It is based round the central question of how far people will go to get what they want \u2013 in this case, a child. Emily and her husband, Dan (Martin Compston, whose relative absence from our screens since he first broke through in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00yzlr0\">Line of Duty</a> has always been a puzzle) have almost reached the end of the line in their attempts to get pregnant. After a series of IVF procedures and miscarriages, Dan\u2019s older sister, Hilary \u2013 a nurse \u2013 agreed to act as a surrogate. While treating Kaya when she returns with complications from the car accident, Hilary starts to miscarry. Kaya recognises Emily and Dan when they arrive and overhears enough to know that Hilary has lost the baby and gain an understanding of the couple\u2019s situation. She offers to help.</p> <p>What would you do? If, like Emily, you had one frozen embryo left for implantation? If there was a young, willing womb for hire in front of you?</p> <p>The Nest does a nice job of thickening the plot with wider questions about the morality of \u201cbuying a baby\u201d and exploiting the vulnerabilities of others without letting it hold up the plot or dissipate suspense. Dan is a self-made man and the couple enjoy every material comfort and they are happy together. Should this be enough? Dan could manage without a baby. Emily says she cannot. Is that self-indulgence, or is baby hunger a quite different kind of appetite from all the ones we try to limit and control?</p> <p>Much of the suspense, especially before the last few scenes, which suddenly immerse us in a variety of new expectations and possibilities, comes from trying to work out just how vulnerable Kaya is. We are given to understand that she has just come out of care \u2013 the man she was arguing with is her keyworker James (James Harkness, otherwise trapped in Julian Fellowes\u2019 latest convulsion, <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80244928\">The English Game</a> on Netflix). Does this make her too damaged to know her own mind \u2013 Dan\u2019s refusal to adopt a child is based on the assumption that anyone they take will have already been irreparably harmed in some way \u2013 or be capable of altruism?</p> <p>She says she wants to do a good thing, but also to charge the going rate for surrogacy in countries where paying for the service \u2013 rather than, as in the UK, just the surrogate\u2019s \u201cexpenses\u201d \u2013 is legal. So, \u00a350,000 instead of about \u00a315,000. It is money that, in her view, will allow her to start a business, be independent and firmly uncouple herself from the life she has known. \u201cGet involved with normal folk,\u201d as she puts it. \u201cNot filthy charities and housing associations.\u201d Should a society that has deprived her of so much also curb the use of what has unexpectedly become a major asset \u2013 her fertility? But what are we to make of her stated desire to be on the receiving end of gratitude for once, instead of its everlasting giver? And how much does helping one individual harm us collectively by normalising the commodification of children? Do we live in a world where foolproof safeguards for women and their reproductive rights and capacities exist? Answers on a postcard, please.</p> <p>Its subtle layering so far puts The Nest a cut above the usual run of such dramas, though I hope the closing shots and the emerging facts about Kaya (via the investigator Dan has put on Kaya\u2019s trail and a reveal by James) don\u2019t signal a slide into a more by-numbers approach in the coming weeks.</p> <p>One final point: in these unprecedentedly stressful times, can I give a big shout-out to the relief to be found in knowing that Martin Compston is finally being allowed to use his own accent? You may not know you need this, but you do. </p>",
  "<p>Italy has banned any movement inside the country and closed all non-essential businesses as it desperately seeks to stem the spread of coronavirus following a horror weekend in which more than 1,400 people died.</p> <p>The escalating measures, which leave the government short of remaining population control levers, came as the rate at which Covid-19 spread around the world continued to accelerate, growing by more 130,000 cases in the past four days.</p> <p>Italy, the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/france-may-refuse-entry-to-britons-if-no-strict-lockdown-is-imposed-in-uk-coronavirus\">firmly at the centre of the global crisis</a>, exceeded China\u2019s death toll last week despite having fewer confirmed infections and a far smaller population. More than 5,500 Italians are testing positive every day, with the average age of those dying 78.5.</p> <p>Supermarkets, banks, pharmacies and post offices are among businesses that will be permitted to keep trading under the new rules. On Sunday, Italians were also banned from moving across municipalities other than for \u201cnon-deferrable and proven business or health reasons or other urgent matters\u201d, the health ministry said.</p> <p>Police squads in Rome were checking documents and fining those outside without a valid excuse. People who were out shopping were forced to wait in line at the entrance to make sure the store was filled with only a handful of shoppers at a time. Joggers were asked to limit their runs to laps around the block.</p> <p>People out for a walk were fined if they broke the rules and wandered into a park or stopped to take pictures of historic scenes of a city without any people.</p> <p>The Italian prime minister told the country it was facing its gravest moment since the second world war and that all businesses and factories that were not \u201cstrictly necessary, crucial [or] indispensable\u201d would close until 3 April.</p> <p>\u201cWe will slow down the country\u2019s productive engine, but we will not stop it,\u201d Giuseppe Conte said late on Saturday. His comments came shortly after it was announced that 793 Italians had died from coronavirus, the most in a single day anywhere in the world.</p> <p>Another 651 Italians died on Sunday, bringing the overall toll to more than 5,400. Nearly 60,000 people across the country are confirmed to have the virus.</p> <p>In other developments on Sunday:</p> <ul> <li><p>The first cases were confirmed in Gaza and Syria, intensifying existing fears about how their health systems would cope with an outbreak of the virus.</p></li> <li><p>The death toll in Spain climbed past 1,720 people, exceeding the official figures of more than 1,600 killed in Iran, and the Spanish prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, warned \u201cthe worst is still to come\u201d.</p></li> <li><p>More than one billion Indians were asked to observe a one-day curfew, as Australia introduced curbs on commercial activity.</p></li> <li><p>Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/uk-could-face-italy-style-lockdown-warns-boris-johnson\">gave his most explicit warning yet</a> that the UK might face an Italian-style lockdown amid mounting criticism of a mixed message from the prime minister\u2019s office.</p></li> <li><p>At least 23 people died and dozens more were injured as Colombia\u2019s prisons were rocked by riots and protests by inmates demanding better protection from the virus.</p></li> <li><p>The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, was quarantined after it emerged that one of her doctors had tested positive, while Rand Paul became the first US senator to test positive.</p></li> <li><p>Spanish opera star Pl\u00e1cido Domingo announced on Facebook that he had contracted the virus.</p></li> </ul> <p>Italy\u2019s civil protection service chief, Angelo Borrelli, voiced cautious optimism over Sunday\u2019s figures, telling reporters: \u201cThe figures announced today are lower than those for yesterday. I hope and we all hope that these figures can be borne out in the coming days. But do not let your guard down.\u201d</p> <p>But Saverio Chiaravalle, vice-president of the order of doctors in Varese, Lombardy, said \u201cthe numbers are still going up too much. Maybe there was a slight decrease today but we can\u2019t be enthusiastic yet because until yesterday there were remarkable increases. It is early to be optimistic \u2013 there are emergency units in Lombardy that are still overwhelmed. For a month we\u2019ve been trying to fight this like crazy and we haven\u2019t yet seen a major result.</p> <p>\u201cIn many cities there are people who still don\u2019t understand the importance of staying at home,\u201d Chiaravalle added. \u201cWe need strict rules, all medics agree with the rules as one of the only weapons we have to fight this is to isolate. It is a sacrifice by all, for all, to try and overcome this situation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/italychina_deaths-zip/giv-390232AFWYuIbB9H\" data-alt=\"Graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/italychina_deaths-zip/giv-390232AFWYuIbB9H\">Graph</a> </figure>  <p>Italy accounts for more than a third of the world\u2019s total of about 13,000 deaths. It has the second-highest number of cases with 53,578 out of the global total of more than 307,000.</p> <p>In Germany it emerged that Merkel had received a vaccine shot against pneumococcus, a pneumonia-causing bacteria, on Friday from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/merkel-quarantined-as-doctor-who-vaccinated-her-tests-positive\">doctor who later tested positive for coronavirus</a>, according to the statement. The chancellor had earlier announced that Germany would ban public meetings of more than two people, amid a raft of further measures. \u201cThe great aim is to gain time in the fight against the virus,\u201d she said, citing an agreement between the federal government and regional states. For at least the next two weeks, people will not be allowed to form groups of three or more in public unless they live together in the same household, or the gathering is work-related, she added.<br></p> <p>India\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases grew to 341 on Sunday and the government ordered lockdowns in 75 districts to contain the spread. Delhi was among several cities to ban all gatherings in the capital and close all but non-essential businesses. The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, said the curfew observed on Sunday \u2013 marked with a raucous applause and banging of pots at 5pm to thank emergency service workers \u2013 was important but a long fight lay ahead.</p> <p>China, which recorded its first new domestic case for four days, still has the most cases with 81,346, <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">according to Johns Hopkins University</a> but the US has the third-highest number of cases.</p> <p>Coronavirus cases in the US increased to more than 30,000 on Sunday. Leaders in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york\">New York</a> urged the president, Donald Trump, to provide more federal help, saying more people would die without it.

  "<p>The government\u2019s plan \u201cto pay the wages of millions of workers across Britain to keep them in jobs\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\" title=\"\">UK government to pay 80% of wages for those not working in coronavirus crisis</a>, 20 March) sounds good but, while it may help those in mainstream employment, it fails to address the problem of those engaged in the gig economy and less stable work.</p> <p>First, vast numbers have already been dismissed, a process that will escalate exponentially over the next few days, leaving them without any rights or protection. Second, it is unclear how those who are retained and are on zero-hours contracts will have their pay computed. Third, and most crucially, there is the difficulty of enforcing any of these rights. Advice agencies in London are reporting that many employers are refusing to pay statutory sick pay, statutory maternity pay and wages already earned, confident that the enforcement agencies and employment tribunals are already unable to cope with the workload.</p> <p>There is a serious risk that, under the new plan, employers will fail to transmit some or all of the payments due to their staff, many will go out of business long before enforcement action can be taken against them, and the voluntary advice sector will be overwhelmed by those seeking help, vast numbers of whom speak little or no English and have no idea of their rights. To be effective, therefore, these payments must be made directly by the state to all workers, including all those engaged in the gig economy, they should be backdated to 1 March and calculated by reference to that worker\u2019s pay during the 12 weeks prior to that date, and there should be a fast-track online enforcement process in cases where there is a dispute as to what is due.<br><strong>Andrew Hillier QC</strong><br><em>Volunteer case</em><em> worker, South West London Law Centres</em></p> <p>\u2022 The government will only pay 80% of staff salaries if they are not working at all. The unfamiliar term of \u201con furlough\u201d was used. This is supposed to mean that staff are not out of a job and can come back when things improve.</p> <p>But if a small business has little or no income coming in, so it cannot pay its staff \u2013 bearing in mind there are other costs to be covered, like insurances, vehicle hire and rent \u2013 how is it meant to keep the business ticking over, by offering takeaways instead of sit-down meals, for example, or dropping off items to their customers, if all its staff have to be at home on furlough? Any staff remaining at work, even on very reduced hours, will not be paid at all by the government.</p> <p>My own small business, like many, had been planning to work a rota system with reduced hours for staff at work. This will not now be possible. The business is supposed to operate at a low level so it is there to come back to, but with no staff working at all, this is an impossibility.<br><strong>Pat Staples</strong><br><em>Bishop\u2019s Waltham, Hampshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 If the chancellor is struggling to find ways to help out the self-employed, here is a suggestion. Since HMRC have the information regarding earnings on the last year\u2019s tax return, it would not be beyond its remit to reimburse 80% of three to six months\u2019 earnings after tax to the self-employed to help them over this difficult time.

Despite being a Protestant from Ulster, and a man once derided for his background and body shape, Best captained Ireland 38 times, with his final game being the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/19/new-zealand-ireland-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">World Cup quarter-final defeat against New Zealand</a> last year. He is the most capped forward in Irish rugby history, and only Brian O\u2019Driscoll and Ronan O\u2019Gara have played more times for Ireland. But I like the fact that Best can bring us back to a Belfast chicken shop \u2013 from where, in his early 20s, he stumbled home and caused unintentional havoc.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/25/irelands-calling-a-journey-to-the-heart-of-a-rugby-powerhouse-donald-mcrae\">Ireland's calling: a journey to the heart of a rugby powerhouse  | Donald McRae</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m coming back and sometimes I brought keys, sometimes I didn\u2019t. At the place I was staying you could put your foot to the corner of the door and give it a nudge, and it sprung open. When I got back I tried to do that but the door didn\u2019t open. So I battered it. Eventually it burst open and I walked in. I saw this flowery wallpaper. I took two steps back because there was no flowery wallpaper in my house. I panicked, dropped everything and ran outside. I saw my house was the one next door. I raced upstairs and just fell asleep on my bed.\u201d</p> <p>When he woke the next morning Best saw his KFC takeaway littered around his neighbour\u2019s garden. He liked the old man who lived next door but, stricken with guilt, he escaped to his parents\u2019 farmhouse in Poyntzpass in County Armagh. When he returned a few days later, the neighbour opened his repaired front door and strolled over to tell young Rory he should watch out because there had been an attempted burglary. \u201cIt was a little heads-up from this lovely fella that I needed to be careful,\u201d Best says, \u201cbut really it was his way of saying: \u2018We know you\u2019re a good lad but please don\u2019t let this happen again.\u2019 I was like: \u2018OK.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I remember only one terrible incident in the village. Two best friends, a Protestant and a Catholic, were shot dead</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A sheepish Best turned away, only to be called back by the neighbour who handed him his credit card which had been found in the garden. Best shakes his head in embarrassment. \u201cIn those days I just thought you played the game hard, and partied hard. I had to find it in myself to change. Some people never find it.

He played his first game for Ulster in 2004 and remained loyal to his province for 15 years. Best made his Test debut, coming off the bench, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/nov/14/rugbyunion.sport6\" title=\"\">against New Zealand at Lansdowne Road in 2005</a> and the first of many damning comments about him wearing an Ireland shirt appeared in print.</p> <p>Neil Francis, a former international whom he had cheered on as a schoolboy, described how \u201cRory Best waddled on to win his first cap\u201d.

But he still remembers the tweet which said: \u201cNo affence [sic] but how can a fat Protestant like you captain our country, you don\u2019t even sing the anthem?\u201d Best retweeted it while saying: \u201cNone taken.

I\u2019m very proud of the fact I come from Ulster. And I\u2019m very proud of the fact that the only international team I\u2019ve ever supported is Ireland. So I\u2019m incredibly proud to have captained Ireland. The beauty of the Irish rugby team is that there\u2019s a lot of respect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5207a8e1337bb37b26646cb1df418bd400c20de8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5207a8e1337bb37b26646cb1df418bd400c20de8/130_183_2966_1780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rory Best is congratulated on his 100th cap\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rory Best is congratulated on his 100th cap by his teammates after captaining Ireland to victory over Australia in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Mullan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI respect the Irish\u2011speaking element of it. The national anthem. I respect all of that. They respect where I come from. We slag each other for fun but there\u2019s mutual respect. When you look at soccer, Northern Ireland really struggle to get to the major tournaments. So do the Republic. But in rugby, as a combined all-Ireland team, we got to No 1 in the world.\u201d</p> <p>Best also points out that rugby can unify communities \u2013 even if it is played predominantly by middle\u2011class Protestants in Ulster. His dad united Best\u2019s primary school side at Poyntzpass with St Joseph\u2019s, a Catholic school. They formed a cross-community mini-rugby team.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a big deal in our village,\u201d Best says. \u201cIn terms of the Troubles I remember only one terrible incident in the village. Two best friends, a Protestant and a Catholic, were shot dead. The village still wears the scar to this day.\u201d</p> <p>In March 1998, when Best was 15 and just weeks before the Good Friday agreement was signed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/feb/03/northernireland.nicholaswatt\" title=\"\">Philip Allen and Damien Trainor were killed</a> while they shared a couple of pints in the pub. Such a tragedy, Best remarks, put his own pain as a rugby player into perspective.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>That sick side of you goes: \u2018What is being said?\u2019 Once you read it, you can\u2019t unread it, much as you wish you could.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Reading his book, it is striking how Best was haunted and then driven by insecurity. \u201cPeople have different ways of motivating themselves. I have a younger sister but I was the youngest of three boys. Simon played Irish Schools, and for Ireland, so he was the rugby one. Mark was a very good rugby player, but he excelled academically. I was like, \u2018What do I excel at?\u2019 You almost develop this chip on your shoulder and it drives you on. That\u2019s where this need to prove myself started. It is doubt. But you almost generate the doubt, to prove them wrong. I used to say in the Irish team room, \u2018I might get dropped this week\u2019, and they\u2019d laugh at me. Whenever you get laughed at in an Irish context, by fellow players, you\u2019re in a good position. But I needed that little push.\u201d</p> <p>In the buildup to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/17/ireland-new-zealand-autumn-international-match-report\" title=\"\">Ireland\u2019s famous defeat of New Zealand</a> in Dublin in 2018 \u2013 beating the All Blacks under Best\u2019s leadership for the second time in three matches, having never tasted victory against them before \u2013 he told his wife he was about to pull on the green shirt for the final time. There had been so much criticism of Best, as being too old and slow, he was certain Schmidt would drop him.</p> <p>\u201cYou allow people to convince you that you\u2019re done,\u201d Best says. \u201cAll I wanted was a win for Ireland and I wondered if they might have a better chance without me. But, deep down, I knew Joe would\u2019ve been the first one to tell me. You say to everyone: \u2018Don\u2019t read the papers.\u2019 But you\u2019ve got well-meaning friends and family. They send the odd text going, \u2018Don\u2019t listen to the papers. We know you can do it.\u2019 Now I\u2019m going to have to look at the papers.

But have they discussed why Ireland lost their way?</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that we haven\u2019t talked about,\u201d Best admits. \u201cWhen we spoke it was making sure he understood the headline gave the wrong impression. He was totally fine \u2013 but we haven\u2019t really chatted about the World Cup.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things the Irish Union could do \u2013 looking ahead to the next World Cup \u2013 is listen to our viewpoints. I have a big regret that, from a captaincy point of view, I didn\u2019t phone Brian O\u2019Driscoll or Paul O\u2019Connell. I played in four World Cups but I didn\u2019t ask Brian what he had learned in 2007 and 2011. If Johnny Sexton\u2019s the captain at the next World Cup that would be one thing you\u2019d encourage him to do \u2013 to ask what we would all do differently as past captains.

The front page ran with the headline \u201cKing of Kings\u201d. In the photo, Sanz holds the trophy sitting on the shoulders of two players: Clarence Seedorf and his son Fernando. \u201cHow could I ever forget?\u201d he said once. \u201cEvery morning, when I wake up and do what I have to do, I see it.\u201d</p> <p>No one else could forget it either, even if Sanz came to feel his work had not been recognised, deliberately written out of the club\u2019s history. On Sunday morning, after he became the latest victim of coronavirus in a country where more than 1,700 have died, that moment dominates memories of him, the 76-year-old\u2019s role fully embraced at last. This time, AS\u2019s cover calls him \u201cthe man of the <em>s\u00e9ptima</em> [the seventh]\u201d. Marca bids \u201cfarewell to the man who recovered the European Cup for Real Madrid\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/21/former-real-madrid-president-lorenzo-sanz-dies-of-coronavirus\">Former Real Madrid president Lorenzo Sanz dies of coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is hard to do justice to how big the <em>s\u00e9ptima</em> was: Madrid had waited 32 years to win the competition through which their identity had been forged and it had become an obsession, the pressure almost unbearable. Madrid had been dreadful domestically and, when Sanz called the coach Juup Heynckes to ask how he was shortly before the final, the German replied: \u201cSunk.\u201d One player recalls them \u201ccrapping themselves\u201d.</p> <p>Yet Sanz\u2019s son Fernando woke in the middle of the night before, convinced that his friend Pedja Mijatovic really was going to score the winner against Juventus, as he had been telling him for days. Mijatovic was injured and shouldn\u2019t have played, but so it proved. There has probably never been a bigger single goal in the club\u2019s history than the one he scored against the Italians.</p> <p>Some estimates put the numbers out on the streets of Madrid at a million. \u201cWe had never seen so many people,\u201d Fernando Sanz recalled. \u201cAt the celebration we became conscious of what we had done: it was absolutely immense.\u201d</p> <p>Lorenzo Sanz promised the <em>octava</em>, the eighth, and in 2000 that arrived too. Yet if the players joyously threw him in the bath, voters threw him out within two months, defeated in presidential elections. Two European Cups and a league in five years were not enough.</p> <p>Born in Chamber\u00ed, Madrid, in 1943, Sanz was the son of a champion amateur boxer and the eldest of 10 children who grew up in the working-class district of Carabanchel. Sport and Madrid occupied his life and that of his family, always proud to have attended the second European Cup final with his dad. He had started going to the Bernab\u00e9u aged 10 with his grandmother, who sold water to fans, and he had been a member for almost 50 years. After losing the presidency in 2000, he twice tried to return.</p> <p>Sanz briefly played in goal for a local <em>tercera divisi\u00f3n</em> side and his sons were all linked to Madrid as sportsmen: Lorenzo won the basketball league with them. Paco began in the youth system and briefly played for Oviedo. Fernando often stood accused because he was the president\u2019s son \u2013 Fabio Capello admitted he was \u201cencouraged\u201d to put him in the team \u2013 but made 35 league appearances and built an impressive career at M\u00e1laga. M\u00edchel Salgado married Sanz\u2019s daughter Malula.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"861bc3f038680f0280f77cd21e2856f2c012774e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/861bc3f038680f0280f77cd21e2856f2c012774e/0_123_2457_1474/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sanz (left) with his son-in-law M\u00edchel Salgado.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sanz (left) with his son-in-law M\u00edchel Salgado.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A self-made man who later bought M\u00e1laga and tried to buy Parma \u2013 leading to him being arrested for allegedly trying to take art work out of the country as a down payment \u2013 Sanz fought accusations of fraud and was fined for tax evasion in 2018. He had started as an errand boy at a barbers\u2019, built a business in printing then real estate and construction, joining Madrid\u2019s board under president Ram\u00f3n Mendoza, whom he met at the hippodrome. Defeat against Barcelona precipitated Mendoza\u2019s departure in November 1995, bringing Sanz to power.</p> <p>Sanz was of his time, a generation of presidents as big, loud personalities \u2013 fans in the directors\u2019 box. Then Barcelona president Joan Gaspart, another of that ilk, complained of the behaviour at the Bernab\u00e9u, saying only the cleaning lady had any decorum. The pair fought but they were friends and Gaspart was devastated at his death.</p> <p>An imposing but accessible man with a taste for Cuban cigars and card games that ran into the night, money laid down, Sanz had big ideas. \u201cHe had a vision to close the gap with Barcelona,\u201d Capello said. \u201cA president with a strong character, a good president. He knew football and the team we built was very, very good.\u201d</p> <p>Madrid had not even qualified for Europe in 1995-96, so Sanz brought in Capello and signed Mijatovic, Davor Suker, Seedorf and Roberto Carlos to join Ra\u00fal, Fernando Redondo and Fernando Hierro. Next, he won a public transfer battle with Barcelona to land Christian Karembeu. Madrid won the league in 1996-97 and, although Capello had not always got on well with the president and was enticed to Milan by Silvio Berlusconi, the European Cup followed in 1997-98. In 2000, they won it again.</p> <p>Look at the staring XIs, though, and only Ra\u00fal, Redondo and Roberto Carlos appear in both, which told a story. As did the fact that Capello\u2019s replacement, Heynckes, was sacked within a week of winning the <em>s\u00e9ptima</em>. That team, nicknamed the Ferrari Squad, were notoriously difficult to handle and Heynckes had given up, \u201ceaten alive\u201d as Sanz later put it.</p> <p>Despite European success, domestically Madrid struggled \u2013 they were fourth, second and fifth in 98, 99 and 2000 respectively \u2013 and these were unstable times. Jorge Valdano, Arsenio Iglesias, Capello, Heynckes, Jos\u00e9 Antonio , Guus Hiddink, John Toshack and Vicente del Bosque: Sanz went through eight coaches in five years and even more players. Steve McManaman was hugely successful; others weren\u2019t. Sanz described buying Nicolas Anelka for 5,500m pesetas as \u201cbeautiful madness\u201d, but many thought he was only half right.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8115227ef80d0f2d5091915528c3f2239b8eb32c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8115227ef80d0f2d5091915528c3f2239b8eb32c/0_153_1674_1004/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The signing of Nicolas Anelka (left) by Sanz (right) did not work out as planned.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The signing of Nicolas Anelka (left) by Sanz (right) did not work out as planned.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Cabanis/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When P\u00e9rez defeated him at the polls in 2000, it was on the promise to sign Luis Figo and a control of postal votes, but also a perception of financial and institutional crisis. There was an internal power battle that hurt Sanz and debt had risen to almost \u20ac300m. He always insisted the worst accusations were untrue, and found it hard to accept being voted out having delivered two European Cups. \u201cHistory will put me in my rightful place,\u201d he once said.</p> <p>That place was Amsterdam in 1998, an image Sanz saw every morning for 22 years. \u201cI can die happy,\u201d he said that night.</p>",

Celeste (full name Celeste Epiphany Waite) is the BBC\u2019s Sound of 2020 winner and the soul singer behind such quietly devastating songs as Strange, Father\u2019s Son and Coco Blood. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/celeste/?utm_source=ig_embed\">The impromptu gig on Instagram</a> is part of the World Health Organisation\u2019s Together, At Home virtual concert series that also features<a href=\"https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/john-legend-together-at-home-against-coronavirus/\"> John Legend</a>, One Direction\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/niall-horan-concert-livestream-together-at-home/\">Niall Horan </a>and <a href=\"https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/together-at-home-chris-martin-coronavirus-concert/\">Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba934b6301389b23b0ef6bf8378b7083a99d69a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba934b6301389b23b0ef6bf8378b7083a99d69a2/851_446_4114_2469/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Thomas in Check Up: Our Health Service at 70.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doing it for food banks ...

Once you\u2019ve done so, you will be able to download the final performance of the show, which Thomas performed in Wakefield, along with interviews he did with NHS workers. The premise was that the approximate UK national average life expectancy is 84. So, if Thomas makes it to 84, the NHS will be 100 \u2013 but which will be in the better shape? The question prompted Thomas to go on a journey through the NHS, witnessing stomach surgery and visiting renal units and dementia care before reflecting on his own and socialised medicine\u2019s mortality.

  "<p>Pressure is growing on the Ministry of Justice to limit criminal court hearings to urgent cases only as restrictions on social gatherings and movement become tougher.</p> <p>Lawyers, jurors, witnesses and defendants are still required to attend court, although the lord chief justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/mar/18/longer-criminal-trials-in-england-and-wales-to-be-delayed-due-to-covid-19\">postponed trials</a> due to last longer than three days and called for video links to be used where possible.</p> <p>As the government has closed pubs and restaurants and recommended social distancing in public spaces, normal routines in courthouses appear increasingly out of step.</p> <p>Rhona Friedman, a criminal solicitor and a committee member of the London Criminal Courts Solicitors Association, told the Guardian: \u201cI saw a young man brought into the dock at Croydon magistrates court on Saturday coughing up phlegm into a tissue in the dock. The security staff realised they shouldn\u2019t be sitting right next to him and retreated as far as they could, which wasn\u2019t very far.</p> <p>\u201cHe had been to hospital the night before but hadn\u2019t been given a test, I guess because he wasn\u2019t admitted and was returned to police detention. He didn\u2019t get bail and was sent to prison.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cOn one occasion last week I was told there were 30 people in the cells in Highbury magistrates court. It\u2019s all completely contrary to government and NHS advice.</p> <p>\u201cThe government should be stopping appearances in person in all nonurgent cases. This is putting people\u2019s lives at risk, particularly in the prison system.\u201d</p> <p>Young Legal Aid Lawyers, which supports professionals taking legal aid cases, called on the government to \u201cimmediately cease all in-person court hearings and ensure access to justice through telephone and video hearings\u201d.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Criminal Bar Association said: \u201cCriminal barristers and solicitors are doing their utmost to fulfil their duty as officers of the court to complete trials that are under way; however, it may be inevitable that events will overtake the whole of the criminal justice system if sufficient numbers of jurors and witnesses have to self-isolate.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for Burnett said: \u201cThe lord chief justice and the senior judiciary have been balancing the need for justice to continue with the need to keep people safe.</p> <p>\u201cAs the pandemic has quickly developed over recent days, they will continue to review advice as the situation changes. As the advice to judges on the<a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/\"> judiciary website</a> makes clear, judges are being told to be flexible and innovative with technology of all kinds.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for HM Courts and Tribunals Service said: \u201cWe are minimising the risk to everyone in our courts by stopping nonurgent work and increasing telephone and online hearings. The situation is under constant review and we are hugely grateful to all those working hard to keep our justice system running.\u201d</p> <p>The statement did not explain what cases were deemed to be \u201cnonurgent\u201d and implied that criminal cases, which are still going ahead, were therefore all deemed to be urgent.</p> <p>Housing lawyers and the charity Shelter have called for thousands of home repossession cases heard in county courts to be postponed until after the crisis.</p> <p>People in danger of losing their houses and flats are still being summoned in block bookings to sit together in courts waiting for judges to decide on claims, despite the prime minister\u2019s promise that renters and mortgage borrowers would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-renters-to-be-protected-from-eviction-says-johnson-video\">protected from eviction</a>.</p> <p>The housing ministry has said no new repossession cases should start during the crisis but existing ones are continuing. In some courts, judges have ordered that hearings should be postponed for several months.</p> <p>A judge in Exeter published a notice last week saying cases would be put back until June \u201cupon noting the declared intention of the government to pass emergency legislation to prevent the evictions of renters\u201d and to provide borrowers with mortgage holidays.</p> <p>At Brentford county court in west London, a list of cases was summoned to court last Friday. One of the respondents was pregnant, another had a serious health condition and others wore face masks because they said they had symptoms of flu-like illness, lawyers present reported. All had turned up to try to prevent their homes from being taken. Despite a request to postpone proceedings, some went ahead.</p> <p>Renata Burns, a solicitor with Hammersmith and Fulham Law Centre, who was at Brentford on Friday, said: \u201cThere was no reason why these hearings could not have been [postponed]. It meant people were all cramped together in courthouse rooms.\u201d</p> <p>Sue James, the director of Hammersmith and Fulham Law Centre and an expert on housing law, said: \u201cThe way that possession cases are listed \u2013 in blocks of time \u2013 puts all parties at risk. You soon build up to having 20 or 30 people in the waiting area. That makes for a lot of people in a confined space.</p> <p>\u201cThe lord chief justice has advised that it is now inappropriate to continue to list cases in this way. Yet they are still continuing in some courts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/a-quarter-of-criminal-trials-in-england-and-wales-will-be-disrupted-coronavirus\">Quarter of criminal trials in England and Wales face disruption</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt makes no sense for the possession cases and evictions to continue \u2013 and it is against government guidance to evict tenants and mortgagees. It is time there was a clear direction in these cases.\u201d</p> <p>Polly Neate, the chief executive of Shelter, said: \u201c[Last] week the government committed to ban new evictions for three months, which will have come as a huge relief for many renters worried about losing their home as a result of this crisis.</p> <p>\u201cAt Shelter we\u2019re hearing from terrified renters being threatened with eviction, and we\u2019re still seeing cases moving through the courts, so we hope to see the legislation come forward soon to ensure that all evictions are halted and everyone is safe in their homes.\u201d</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice said housing cases were a matter for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. The MHCLG has <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/complete-ban-on-evictions-and-additional-protection-for-renters\">said</a> there should be \u201cno new possession proceedings through applications to the court to start during the crisis\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>About 25 years ago, \u201cface time\u201d was a <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=facetime\">new phrase</a>. In 1994 or thereabouts, news came that in cutting-edge workplaces of the US, the term denoted time actually spent in the company of other human beings \u2013 and was, by implication, a symbol of how that most basic aspect of human interaction was being lost. As they became immersed in email and the nascent worldwide web, it was rumoured that the most modern people were increasingly removed from even their friends and families \u2013 something crystallised in Douglas Coupland\u2019s 1995 novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1995/nov/10/fiction.douglascoupland\">Microserfs</a>, which moves from Microsoft\u2019s HQ near Seattle to Silicon Valley.</p> <p>Midway through the book comes an angst-ridden email written by one of the key characters. \u201cSo many people no longer have lives that you raeally [sic] have to wonder if some new mode of existence is being created which is going to become so huge that it is no longer on the moral scale \u2013 simply the way people ARE,\u201d he says. \u201cI only need 2 hours of people a day. I can get by on that amount. 2 hours of FaceTime.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As so many of life\u2019s fundamentals fall away, this is the one kind of human interaction that will be strengthened</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a pointer to the future, it was hardly misplaced. There is grim symbolism in the fact that \u201cFaceTime\u201d eventually lost its original meaning, and became the name of the video-phoning app launched by Apple in 2010 \u2013 ironically enough, a mere approximation of face time in its original sense. But in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, this is how millions of us, of all ages, are living.</p> <p>For the foreseeable future, ours is a world in which extended, in-person social contact is simply reckless, and the replacement of socialising with time spent online is an everyday fact. And beyond all those newly ubiquitous platforms for video calling and conferencing, arguably our single greatest collective tool is also the one people like me have spent the last four years maligning as increasingly monstrous, out-of-control, badly led, central to many countries\u2019 journeys away from liberal democracy, and damagingly addictive to boot.</p> <p>For Facebook and its senior management, all those things remain in play. Beyond the current pandemic, the company\u2019s culture and practices are being tested once again <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/20/trump-election-facebook\">by the looming </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/20/trump-election-facebook\">US election</a>. But life is never without contradictions and ambivalences, and we all know the positive things Facebook can facilitate, arguably as never before. The Covid-19 moment demands a means of bringing people together while they largely stay in their homes, and ensuring that whatever limited time they can spend in the real world is used as constructively as possible. Given that 2.5 billion human beings have Facebook accounts, the solution has arrived as a matter of inevitability.</p> <p>Facebook\u2019s PR people are keen to big up its new <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/facebook-coronavirus-information-center-zuckerberg/\">\u201cinformation centre\u201d</a> that puts reliable material about the virus at the top of people\u2019s news feeds. Its moderating machine, they emphasise, is aggressively tackling misinformation about the virus \u2013 though its systems have already mistakenly <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21184445/facebook-marking-coronavirus-posts-spam-misinformation-covid-19\">clamped down on legitimate material</a>, and the weeks to come will surely test them to the limit. Facebook-owned WhatsApp is another means of communication that the outbreak has made indispensable, although there are questions to be asked about the <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/18/tech/whatsapp-coronavirus-misinformation/index.html\">misinformation</a> people are using it to spread.</p> <p>But here is some unalloyed good news: in the UK alone, Facebook has facilitated the formation of an estimated 300 local <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/16/community-aid-groups-set-up-across-uk-amid-coronavirus-crisis\">Coronavirus support groups</a>, whose combined membership now totals more than a million people.</p> <p>Late last week, I spoke to Edd Withers, a 33-year-old resident of Canterbury, who is one of three administrators of a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/canterburyresidents/\">Facebook group</a> called Canterbury Residents. It was founded in 2014, with the intention of bringing together a small university city, and \u201cbridging the gap between the student population and the resident population \u2013 getting over this kind of clash of worlds\u201d. The group now has 37,000 members. \u201cIt\u2019s had a massive impact on the whole way the city learns and communicates about news, and what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The group has now spawned a Facebook offshoot called Canterbury Coronavirus Assistance, which has gained more than 1,000 members in a week. In the immediate moment, Withers told me, lots of people were volunteering to run errands and check in on others. \u201cBut there will still be people who are self-isolating in six months\u2019 time. Things might calm down, but there will still be really vulnerable people feeling the effects of all this.\u201d He emphasised how important it is that these assistance networks operate safely: \u201cIt\u2019s not about going in gung-ho and introducing stranger A to vulnerable person B.\u201d With that in mind, he and his colleagues are linking people to already-existing local charities and community organisations. Via a Facebook chat group, he is also being advised by a group of wise heads that includes the leader of the council, and representatives of local churches.</p> <p>Whatever Facebook\u2019s serial transgressions, there is something at the heart of such initiatives that holds out the prospect of a kind of social organisation beyond the \u201ctraditional\u201d state and the paternalism of charity. It is one of the most remarkable sociological aspects of this crisis that as so many of life\u2019s fundamentals fall away, this is the one kind of human interaction that will be strengthened. And yes, there is a cruelty in the fact that as so many large and small businesses hit the wall, Facebook and the other titans of big tech will probably emerge from this crisis even more powerful.

He talked about \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d, and how important it is to feel \u201ccomfort that we are not alone and a community is looking out for us\u201d. In his <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/05/mark-zuckerbergs-speech-as-written-for-harvards-class-of-2017/\">commencement address that year at Harvard University</a>, he sounded positively evangelical: \u201cChange starts local. Even global changes start small \u2013 with people like us. In our generation, the struggle of whether we connect more, whether we achieve our biggest opportunities, comes down to this \u2013 your ability to build communities and create a world where every single person has a sense of purpose.\u201d</p> <p>Very quickly, this stuff felt like so much cover for the arrogance and oversights that would be decisively revealed by the Cambridge Analytica scandal. But in the midst of such awful global events and the way millions are responding to them, Zuckerberg\u2019s words also just about ring true, and underline what Facebook enables millions of us to do. Sooner or later, we will have to resume the conversation about whether the company \u2013 along with the other tech giants \u2013 should exist in its current form, whether to forcibly pull its social functions away from advertising, and all the rest. But for now, our world is inescapably cast in its corporate blue and white, and millions of us know one thing as a matter of daily experience: that without it, even more things might fall apart.</p> <p>\u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p>",

  "<p>In hindsight, music has always been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/donald-glover\">Donald Glover</a>\u2019s true calling. Before the sitcoms, the Star Wars movie, the Saturday Night Live hosting gigs, and the well-worn gifs of the performer walking horrified into a burning room with a stack of pizza boxes, you could find him on YouTube as a member of Derrick Comedy. The group\u2019s greatest sketch,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY4kFSuMvKM\"> B-Boy Stance</a>, saw Glover play an ageing hip-hop pioneer who had his arms surgically attached to his back, ensuring he was forever pulling the iconic pose \u2013 it riffs on the distance between the New York acolytes who witnessed the birth of hip-hop and those who came to the music after it was commodified. Glover\u2019s understanding of American culture shines with diamond clarity; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/23/donald-glover-atlanta-robbin-season\">Atlanta, his comedy-drama</a> that goes deep into the city\u2019s rap scene, is the evolution of those ideas.</p> <p>Glover\u2019s early forays into rap were corny and forgettable. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/childish-gambino\">Childish Gambino</a> project felt like the side hustle of a talented kid eager to test every limit of his creativity \u2013 that the moniker was taken from an online Wu-Tang Clan name generator seemed to reflect how low it fell on his list of priorities. In 2016, the funk record <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/dec/01/childish-gambino-awaken-my-love-album-review-funk-donald-glover\">Awaken, My Love!</a> was an artistic breakthrough. Then came 2017\u2019s vicious This Is America and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/07/this-is-america-theories-donald-glover-satirical-video-childish-gambino\">a video that encapsulates the racial prejudice, police brutality and vicious gun lust</a> freezing the soul of the self-proclaimed greatest country in the world. The clip became a pop cultural juggernaut, anointing Glover as spokesman for the Black Lives Matter generation.</p> <p>3.15.20 is the glorious payoff of this musical evolution. Melding elements of industrial hip-hop, hard-edged funk and pulsing electronica, with occasional experimental breakdowns a la Pink Floyd, it is an ambitious album that can turn from hedonism to hope on a dime. And with its genre-hopping ethos, bold orchestral choices and pleasing tunefulness, it is the first truly boundary-pushing record of the 2020s, cementing its creator as a daring virtuoso. (The roll out of the record wasn\u2019t quite as well executed: songs temporarily began streaming on a continuous loop last Sunday via <a href=\"http://donaldgloverpresents.com/\">donaldgloverpresents.com</a> \u2013 and are once again \u2013 leaving fans to ponder whether it was a leak or part of an elaborate release strategy.)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gezFLhUznSk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gezFLhUznSk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Donald Glover Presents: 3.15.20 \u2013 stream</figcaption> </figure>   <p>No song is quite as blunt as the societal sledgehammer that was This Is America because they don\u2019t have to be \u2013 Glover\u2019s sharp pen and outlandish concepts see him smartly examine topics such as freedom in the digital age, the nature of reality and the malignancy in the soul of his home nation.</p> <p>Take Algorhythm, which warns of the erosion of personal liberties as the algorithms that serve our information alter our minds. The corrosive psychological effect of phones has become catnip for songwriters in recent years but Glover brings his own perspective, using vocal effects to slide into the role of artificial intelligence while dropping biblical references. Elsewhere, he buries his voice so deep in effects at moments that it is near-impossible to make out his words \u2013 see 32.22, a bruising rap song that shares DNA with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/jul/22/kanye-west-official-black-skinhead\">Kanye West\u2019s Black Skinhead</a>. The effect alludes to the disappearance of his soul into a digital vortex, inviting listeners to determine what is and is not real.</p> <p>The most direct probing comes on the Ariana Grande-assisted Time, as Glover \u2013 sounding half flower child, half crystal gazer \u2013 questions whether the world is \u201cexactly what it seems\u201d. With a melody reminiscent of forgotten single Cry, there\u2019s even a touch of Michael Jackson to the sweeping anthem. It\u2019s not difficult to picture MJ, arms stretched out in a Christ-like stance, singing lines such as: \u201cSeven billion people trying to free themselves / Said a billion prayers trying to save myself.\u201d Not that you ever would have caught Jackson over these psych-tinted guitar strums and eccentric, retro-futuristic drum machines.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/mar/06/sign-up-for-the-sleeve-notes-email\">Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The gentle funk of 47.48 evokes memories of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/steviewonder\">Stevie Wonder</a> as Glover explores the devastating effect violence has on childhood innocence. There are moments of levity, though. On the Prince-esque lover-man jam 24.19, the meaning of a relationship is captured through minutiae as Glover smiles at his sweetheart\u2019s appreciation of fairytales, the way they wear their hair and the chicken dinners the couple once shared. More passion comes on 12.38, throwback funk featuring horny one-liners such as \u201cHit the uchi-chuchi ti\u2019ll it\u2019s slanted\u201d; the hazy pop of Feels Like Summer will line up well on barbecue playlists.</p> <p>These are lighter moments in a grander work that instantly feels part of the zeitgeist. It\u2019s especially appropriate, then, that 3.15.20 has dropped into the feeds of people social distancing. The disruption caused by the coronavirus forces us to question how strong the foundations of civilisation really are. Glover never could have seen the pandemic coming when he was recording the album, yet at a time when much of what we thought was strong is weak \u2013 what we thought was eternal is potentially fleeting \u2013 3.15.20 captures the insecurity of lived reality and the humanity that truly defines our existence.</p>",

Industry estimates put the figure needed to absorb the damage caused by the coronavirus crisi at five times this figure at least. </p> <p>The knock-on effects will be immense and far reaching. Poorer clubs will struggle to make ends meet, the shape of the AFLW competition will no doubt be impacted and this will all leave state leagues and grassroots footy vulnerable.</p> <p>So now the AFL goes into damage control.

Pay cuts will be routine, jobs might be lost, livelihoods of lower earners threatened. </p> <p>\u201cOur focus over the coming days is working with the clubs to embed medical protocols, to finalise the operating model during the temporary suspension period and to work with our funding partners to secure a line of credit to fund cash falls across the industry, while allowing the best chance to a return to football matches,\u201d McLachlan said.</p> <p>With state borders closing and non-essential travel banned, conducting a national sporting competition became untenable. \u201cIt was the right decision to start the season, and clearly it is now the right decision to stop. That is why we have acted immediately to take this step to play our role in the community and to protect the long-term future of our game,\u201d McLachlan said.</p> <p>Amid the uncertainty, the AFL remains committed to squeezing out a 17-round season if, and when, organised sport gets the green light to resume. But, with politicians talking about containment measures remaining in place for six months or longer, realism is becoming the default setting. </p> <p>Jeff Kennett, the Hawthorn president, is already looking towards next year. \u201cWe at Hawthorn support the decision and our focus must be on surviving to be able to play a full season in 2021,\u201d Kennett said.</p> <p>For better or worse round one did take place, serving at the very least to satisfy our curiosity for post-apocalyptic footy. It was as if the game had landed a leading role in a sequel to The Omega Man.

The only things missing were zombies and tumbleweed.</p> <p>Players looked to be giving their all. In fact, with shorter quarters and longer intervals, it could be argued their intensity was cracked up a notch. Scoring levels, not far off totals reached in round one 2019, would suggest this was the case. </p> <p>Coaches might be used to telling their troops to play like there\u2019s no tomorrow; this time they meant it.

My daughter loves to fold laundry and cook dinner so we do these things together when she\u2019s awake.</p> <h2>\u201cChildren learn through play\u201d</h2> <p>My previous career as an early childhood teacher taught me that opportunities for play and learning are everywhere. Parents don\u2019t need expensive toys and structured activities to replicate an early learning program. In childcare centres, educators encourage children to discover what is interesting to them.</p> <p>I know about six different recipes for playdough but I haven\u2019t made any in months. My daughter prefers playing in my shoe cupboard. She made a \u201cdog\u201d by threading wooden beads on leftover Christmas ribbon. This is an activity she created herself that develops imagination and fine-motor skills.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/shortcuts/2020/mar/16/the-lockdown-larder-an-expert-guide-to-a-healthy-sustainable-store-cupboard\">The lockdown larder: an expert guide to a healthy, sustainable store cupboard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Michelle Walsh, an early childhood trainer and consultant, says: \u201cChildren learn through play \u2026 whether it\u2019s playing with Barbie dolls or toy cars, playing imaginary games, dressing up or being a dog. It doesn\u2019t matter what they\u2019re playing. They are learning.\u201d</p> <p>Walsh suggests parents prepare their homes for play first thing in the morning. \u201cIt could just mean putting puzzles on the floor or setting up some playing cards or a clipboard for drawing. Then let the day flow.\u201d</p> <h2>Show children the passing of time</h2> <p>To guide behaviour positively, distraction is an excellent technique for babies and toddlers. Abel says: \u201cSet up some boxes with activities or materials in them that are relatively novel for the children \u2026 bring these out during important meeting times or for when you need to knuckle down and get some work done.\u201d</p> <p>Children closer to school age will have improved self-control and an understanding of boundaries and time. Abel suggests using a timer to show children the passing of time while you\u2019re working, or creating a visual schedule for the day. \u201cSet up some house rules with the kids so they know what the behavioural expectations are during this time.\u201d</p> <h2>Give them information they can process</h2> <p>After overhearing an adult conversation, my daughter said she was \u201csad because so many people were sick\u201d. Talking to young children about Covid-19 isn\u2019t easy but it cannot be avoided. Children are impacted by other people\u2019s fears and dramatic changes to their normal routines.</p> <p>Abel\u2019s primary message to parents is to ensure \u201ckids aren\u2019t getting information that is developmentally inappropriate for them. Only give them the type and amount of information that they can process at their age.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/18/is-there-a-more-emmy-worthy-childrens-show-than-bluey\">Is there a more Emmy-worthy children's show than Bluey?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMost kids should really only know that there\u2019s a virus going around which is like the flu, and for most of us it won\u2019t be a big deal, but the community is working really hard to make sure that it doesn\u2019t spread too much.\u201d</p> <p>I try not to let external stresses stop me from being patient with my daughter but it isn\u2019t easy. I am much more tolerant of thrown toys and emotional meltdowns when there is toilet paper in my house. And now, more than ever, children need patience and support from the people they love.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the most helpful things parents can do is contain their own anxieties around the situation \u2026 because as parents, our anxiety gets transferred to our kids,\u201d Abel says.</p> <h2>When in doubt, turn to Bluey</h2> <p>One of the best things for my mental health is sitting on the floor, playing with my daughter. I prefer to do other things in my downtime and I don\u2019t always feel like it, trust me \u2013 but I know it benefits us both.</p> <p>\u201cI encourage eight minutes of play a day with your children,\u201d Walsh says. \u201cIt\u2019s just like a Bluey episode. For anyone who hasn\u2019t seen a Bluey episode, I encourage you to watch one and then choose to play with your children for eight minutes a day. It\u2019s not very long but it really enhances their learning.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>There are growing concerns for the health of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/11/rokia-traore-ne-so-review-mali-singer\">Rokia Traor\u00e9, the internationally celebrated Malian singer</a>, who has been on hunger strike at the Fleury-M\u00e9rogis prison near Paris since she was arrested on 10 March on allegations of kidnapping her daughter in a child-custody dispute.</p> <p>Her lawyer, Kenneth Feliho, said: \u201cI am very worried. She is only drinking. She has not been eating for over a week and her immune system is weak.\u201d</p> <p>Among those calling for the musician\u2019 release are African stars including Salif Keita, Youssou N\u2019Dour and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/19/angelique-kidjo-celia-review-magnificent-african-reinvention-of-salsa\">Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo</a>. Damon Albarn, who performed with her in the group Africa Express, wrote: \u201cWe demand, for humanitarian reasons, the immediate release of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/29/rokia-traore-beautiful-africa-interview\">Rokia Traor\u00e9</a>, whose fragile health is deteriorating day by day.\u201d</p> <p>Traor\u00e9 was arrested at Charles de Gaulle airport while travelling between the Malian capital, Bamako, and Brussels. She had planned to attend a hearing at which she hoped to overturn a 2019 decision by a Belgian court that had given sole custody of her five-year-old daughter to her former partner Jan Goossens. Goossens is the director of the festival of Marseilles, and is a Belgian citizen living in France; Traor\u00e9 has both Malian and French citizenship.</p> <p>Traor\u00e9 had also hoped to challenge a European arrest warrant that had been issued against her for \u201ckidnapping, forcible confinement and hostage taking\u201d of her daughter, because she had refused to hand her over to her father. In a statement issued from prison she said: \u201cI started a hunger strike ... to ask for a fair trial in Belgium and for the European arrest warrant to cease to be unfairly enforced.\u201d</p> <p>She has not been allowed any visitors because of the coronavirus pandemic, and even Feliho has not been allowed to see her since Thursday. Laure Panerai, who helps run Traor\u00e9\u2019s cultural centre, the Foundation Passerelle in Bamako, said: \u201cNo one has access to her. It\u2019s very distressing. With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-symptoms-what-should-i-see-a-doctor\">coronavirus spreading</a>, and professionals of the justice system in France asking the French government to release some prisoners who are at the end of [their sentences], we don\u2019t understand why Rokia is still in jail. She is not a criminal. She is famous. She will not run away. The whole country here is asking for her release.\u201d</p> <p>This is more than a painful celebrity custody battle because it also involves a clash between European and African justice systems. France was acting on an arrest warrant from Belgium, but officials in Mali see the situation very differently. A Malian court gave Traor\u00e9, and not Goossens, custody of the child, and the Malian government issued a statement in support of the singer, pointing out that she has a Malian diplomatic passport.</p> <p>In her statement issued from prison, Traor\u00e9 said: \u201cI was arrested on leaving the plane by six police officers to whom I immediately presented my Malian diplomatic passport and my Malian state mission order, which gave me diplomatic immunity. The judge who ordered my detention at Fleury-M\u00e9rogis told me that Malian diplomatic immunity would not be valid in Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Traor\u00e9 filed complaints about Goosens in Mali, France and Belgium, which she insists have not been investigated \u2013 though later in her prison statement she claims they were a major factor in the Malian decision to grant her sole custody.</p> <p>In an interview with a Belgian paper, Goossens said that \u201call horrible and false accusations were investigated and dismissed. All attempts to negotiate and achieve solutions were refused. I\u2019m being cut out of my daughter\u2019s life in a brutal way \u2026 my wish is that the rule of law can do its work \u2026 so that our daughter can see both her parents again.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/29/rokia-traore-beautiful-africa-interview\">Rokia Traor\u00e9: 'I wanted to keep positive and sing about how much I love Africa'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The daughter of a Malian diplomat, Traor\u00e9 is a celebrity in a country that is best known in the west for its remarkable musicians.

  "<p>Since Colombian reggaeton sensation J Balvin\u2019s global breakthrough with 2017 banger <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnJ6LuUFpMo\" title=\"\">Mi Gente</a>, his stock has risen thanks in part to a slew of well-chosen collaborations that have ridden the wave of streaming culture\u2019s democratisation. From Beyonc\u00e9 appearing on a Mi Gente remix, to global smashes with the likes of Cardi B (I Like It) and fellow Latin sensation Rosal\u00eda (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7bfOZek9t4\" title=\"\">Con Altura</a>), Balvin has expertly curated his superstar status by bringing other people into his world without compromise (he still sings and raps in Spanish).</p> <p>Perhaps keen to reiterate how in control he is, his sixth album, <em>Colores</em> (each song is named after a shade), limits outside guests to just one, with Nigerian Afrobeats star Mr Eazi bringing a swooning softness to the dancefloor-ready Arco\u00edris. Elsewhere it\u2019s Balvin\u2019s show, be it utilising a Drake-esque croon on the excellent R&amp;B slow jam-esque Rojo, or eerily stalking the drip-feed beat that underpins bass-rattling highlight, Negro.</p> <p>Aware that any language barrier can be overcome by a plethora of hooks and a prevailing atmosphere, Balvin adds a playful embellishment to each of the album\u2019s 10 tracks, be it Amarillo\u2019s kazoo-assisted beat, or the twinkling glacial percussion that tickles closer Blanco.

  "<p>Frontline NHS staff are not getting the protective equipment they need to treat coronavirus patients, leaving them feeling like \u201ccannon fodder\u201d, a grassroots doctors\u2019 organisation has said.</p> \n<p>Healthcare workers in hospitals have been voicing frustration and fear over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/london-hospitals-struggle-to-cope-with-coronavirus-surge\">the lack of personal protective equipment</a>, saying they are having to substitute the correct gear with items that are less effective \u2013 or even improvise with non-medical materials.</p> \n<p>Responding to staff concerns, Dr Rinesh Parmar, chair of the <a href=\"https://www.dauk.org/\">Doctors\u2019 Association</a>, told BBC1\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: \u201cWe have had doctors tell us they feel like lambs to the slaughter, that they feel like cannon fodder.

What our doctors are telling us is that although equipment is arriving, some of it is inadequate, some of it doesn\u2019t meet the World Health Organization guidance. That really doesn\u2019t fill frontline healthcare staff with the confidence that they need.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nurses in the Royal Free hospital in north London have been affixing clinical waste bags around their legs, the Guardian has been told, while at North Middlesex hospital they have been tying plastic aprons around their heads.</p> \n<p>One nurse, who did not wish to be named, said: \u201cWidespread nurses are making their own PPE. I know friends I trained with doing the same. We have to protect ourselves, some of us have children and babies. We are trying to help people but have to protect families. I don\u2019t know why we are not getting PPE.\u201d</p> \n<p>The lack of PPE raises the prospects of NHS staff falling ill \u2013 and potentially spreading Covid-19 \u2013 at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/doctors-warn-coronavirus-could-overwhelm-nhs-intensive-care\">a time of unprecedented demand</a>, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/compelled-doctors-planning-return-nhs-frontline-coronavirus\">attempts are being made to bolster the workforce.</a></p> \n<p>But there are also concerns that existing staff members who are unwell are not getting sufficient support or being tested.</p> \n<p>A nurse at a London trust said one of her colleagues was asking for help from her, having failed to get it elsewhere. \u201cOne of my colleagues was asking for help from me, to check if he can come to A&amp;E,\u201d she said. \u201cThe colleague\u2019s temperature is spiking at 40.3C [104.6F] \u2013 before, it never went below 38.6 [101.4F].

We\u2019ve not had to do regular PPE transmission to those places before, so that is causing some individual challenges around the four UK countries.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said staff had to be trained in how to fit the high-end masks, adding: \u201cI am confident that the beginning of that supply chain is robust and now the distribution will get better over the next few days.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure>",
  "<p>Just over a week ago, our world looked very different from how it does today. The shift has been so rapid and frightening, it feels as if the ground beneath us has given way. It is disorienting, as if normal life is just over there, out of reach. I have been through two major bereavements, close together, and this has the same unanchored feeling of grief.</p> <p>The human brain is not wired to tolerate uncertainty, but it is wired to be alert to any threat. So, if you are feeling pandemic panic, it is only natural. Blame your brain. For most of us, life has never felt more uncertain, and uncertainty is, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/04/uncertainty-stressful-research-neuroscience\">a 2016 study by neuroscientists at University College London</a>, an even more stressful state to be in than actually knowing something bad will happen. It may explain \u2013 if you\u2019re young-ish and otherwise healthy \u2013 why you may be almost hoping to contract Covid-19, just to get out of that will I-won\u2019t I? mental tussle. Those of us who are older or more vulnerable don\u2019t have such a privilege.</p> <p>According to Robert Leahy, the director of the American Institute for Cognitive Therapy and author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-worry-cure-9780749927240.html\">The Worry Cure</a>, we are all locked in \u201can international human trauma, where everybody has a sense that their life, or the lives of people they love, is threatened\u201d. When we are anxious, he says: \u201cWe tend to equate uncertainty with the worst outcome. For example, after 9/11, I heard so many people say it\u2019s inevitable that there\u2019s going to be another major attack on New York City, or a nuclear attack by al-Qaida. That never happened. When we\u2019re anxious, we tend to treat the uncertainty as a bad outcome. But uncertainty is neutral \u2013 we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We want to be assured the way our world looks when we get up in the morning is the way it will look when we go to bed</p> <footer> <cite>Prof Daniel Freeman</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We can look to what has happened in other countries with understandable horror, but we can also hold on to the fact that measures such as testing, social distancing, quarantining and travel restrictions seem to have some effect, and that at some point, there will be potential treatments. None of this is to underplay the seriousness of the pandemic, and the many lives that have already and will be lost. But the point is that at the moment, nobody really knows what is going to happen.</p> <p>Most of us crave stability. \u201cWe want predictability,\u201d says Daniel Freeman, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Oxford. \u201cWe want to be assured that the way our world looks when we get up in the morning is the way it will look when we go to bed. And if change occurs, we prefer it to be on our terms.\u201d But sometimes life has other ideas.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to come to terms with such uncertainty,\u201d he says. After all, we already live with plenty of uncertainty and lack of control, even if it is on a much smaller scale, such as driving a car or being a passenger in one. \u201cWe have to accept that no action is 100% risk-free and that we can\u2019t totally control events, no matter how much we try. No matter how much we worry, we can\u2019t know what\u2019s in store for us. And we can\u2019t prevent problems happening just by worrying about them. In the end, it is best to concentrate on what is meaningful in our lives.\u201d</p> <p>As a lifelong catastrophiser, and despite knowing with hindsight that in every instance, my imagined worst-case scenarios didn\u2019t come true, my worry doesn\u2019t feel unwarranted at the moment. The question is: how helpful is it? Not very. \u201cWe know that this is a dangerous virus,\u201d says Natasha Page, a therapist and member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy. \u201cBut are we catastrophising about some things? Are we trying to predict what the outcome is going to be? It can be helpful to think about what the best-case scenario could be as well. Anxiety can be a helpful emotion to have \u2013 it can help us to keep safe and do the right things \u2013 but fixating on the worst outcome is not a healthy thing to do.\u201d (Unless, of course, you\u2019re one of those in charge of stopping the spread.)</p> <p>Constantly checking the news may feel like a way of asserting control over events, says Freeman, but it can exacerbate anxiety. \u201cKnowledge is power. So make sure you get your information and advice from the very best sources. You\u2019ll also have to keep checking in to make sure your plan fits with the expert advice. There is an obvious temptation to seek out information all the time, but although this may be helpful as you first orientate yourself to what is going on, a moment comes when we need to put limits on it.\u201d</p> <p>He advises creating a plan in order to make it easier to deal with anxious thoughts so \u201cwe have formed our response and know what to do. A little time worrying isn\u2019t necessarily a problem, as it may alert us to modifications we need to make, but too much time spent worrying skews our thinking. We catastrophise when we worry, leading to less measured responses.\u201d Freeman suggests constraining worry to one or two set periods each day. \u201cWhen worry comes at other times, just note the thoughts down, then don\u2019t fight them but let them go. Notice the worry, acknowledge it, but don\u2019t let it distract you. Stay as calm as you can, focus on what you\u2019re doing and not what you\u2019re thinking, and watch the worry recede into the distance.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"970f953195c88ed52b19ccdd8e6fa193f4ec7e3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/970f953195c88ed52b19ccdd8e6fa193f4ec7e3f/0_29_5211_3127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Try to be the person who calms a friend or partner down, and don\u2019t buy everything in the supermarket.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Try to be the person who calms a friend or partner down, and don\u2019t buy everything in the supermarket.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Blatchford/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With understandable concerns about job security and how you will survive financially, \u201ctry to take as much control as you can over the situation,\u201d says Page. \u201cWe know there are things being set up in order to help people with mortgage or rent payments, and help for businesses. Get yourself well-informed and think about what you might need to plan for.\u201d</p> <p>If you are reading this piece, chances are you are currently healthy. \u201cRemind yourself that in this moment you are safe and well,\u201d says the therapist Eve Menezes Cunningham. \u201cAnxiety is defined by fears around the future. With a pandemic, no one\u2019s imagining that future is going to be all sunshine and rainbows but at the same time we don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to pan out.\u201d When we\u2019re anxious, she says, we typically try to control more, but so much is now beyond our control. \u201cWe can only control what we are doing \u2013 staying at home for the sake of more vulnerable populations, if you\u2019re not already self-isolating because you are part of a more vulnerable population \u2013 not stockpiling. Be kind to yourself \u2013 anxiety is a normal reaction to have in a really unusual situation.\u201d</p> <p>Can you dare to think about the future? What if you had big plans that are now suddenly on hold \u2013 going to university, trying for a baby, moving house or changing career? Nobody can tell you what the best decisions for your life are right now, and it might be better to think no further ahead than a day or a week. \u201cDon\u2019t deny reality but remind yourself that this will pass, although we don\u2019t know when,\u201d says Cunningham. \u201cFor some people, being at home all of a sudden, there is time and space to think about what we want to do with our lives. A lot of people will be looking for more purpose and meaning. It might not be the best time to make big changes, but thinking about a happy future in which you\u2019re doing work that you love or you have the family you\u2019ve longed for will help. When we\u2019re stressed and creating cortisol, it perpetuates stress.\u201d Too much cortisol also compromises our immune systems. \u201cWhen we think happy thoughts \u2013 imagining the love we\u2019ll have for our future baby or the fulfilment we\u2019ll have in our future career,\u201d she says, \u201cwe might not only feel better, but we should also be boosting our immune function.\u201d</p> <p>Be aware that our emotional estimate of risk, says Leahy, \u201cis extremely high. What we tend to do when we\u2019re emotional is think about anecdotes, not probabilities. This is human nature \u2013 we\u2019re not evolved to calculate baselines and probabilities. So we think about stories and how they\u2019re related to us personally. The question is: what is the absolute probability that I\u2019m going to die from Covid-19?\u201d He believes someone is more likely to eventually die from cancer or heart disease. In China, which has a population of around 1.5 billion, at the time of writing 3,245 people have been killed by Covid-19 (and, Leahy points out, China has reported no new domestic transmissions). I\u2019m not sure how comforting this is, especially for those of us who are vulnerable \u2013 the virus still seems an unknown quantity, and we still don\u2019t know how much havoc it will wreak, how overwhelmed our healthcare system will get, or (if we do get a handle on it) when it will spring back again once the restrictions on our lives are lifted. So it comes back to building tolerance for uncertainty.</p> <p>\u201cThere are things you can do to boost your ability to cope in these uncertain times,\u201d says Freeman. \u201cOur lives are becoming much more restricted, so it is absolutely crucial that we have enough activities that we really want to do. Ideally these activities will be meaningful to us and build on our strengths. We need to think about new ways to connect with and support our friends, family and neighbours.

  "<p>Societies gripped by cataclysmic wars, depressions or pandemics can become acutely sensitive to power and privilege.</p> <p>Weeks before the coronavirus virus crushed the US stock market, the Republican senator Richard Burr apparently used information he gleaned from his role as chairman of the Senate intelligence committee about the ferocity of the coming pandemic to unload 33 stocks held by him and his spouse. They were estimated at being worth between $628,033 and $1.72m , in some industries likely to be hardest hit by the global outbreak.</p> <p>While publicly parroting Trump\u2019s happy talk at the time, Burr confided to several of his political funders that the disease would be comparable to the deadly 1918 flu pandemic.</p> <p>Then the market tanked, along with the retirement savings of millions of Americans.</p> <p>Even some pundits on Fox News are now calling for Burr\u2019s resignation.</p> <p>When society faces a common threat, exploiting a special advantage is morally repugnant. Call it \u201cBurring\u201d However tolerable Burring may be in normal times, it isn\u2019t now.</p> <p>In normal times, corporations get special favors from Washington in exchange for generous campaign contributions, and no one bats an eye. Recall the Trump tax cut, which delivered $1.9tn to big corporations and the wealthy.</p> <p>The coronavirus should have altered business as usual. But last week\u2019s Senate Republican relief package, giving airlines $58bn and billions more to other industries, is pure Burring.</p> <p>The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, tried lamely to distinguish it from the notorious bank bailouts of 2008. \u201cWe are not talking about a taxpayer-funded cushion for companies that made mistakes. We are talking about loans, which must be repaid, for American employers whom the government itself is temporarily crushing for the sake of public health.\u201d</p> <p>But the airlines are big enough to get their own loans from banks at rock-bottom interest rates. Their planes and landing slots are more than adequate collateral.</p> <p>Why do airlines deserve to be bailed out? Over the last decade they spent 96%of their free cashflow, including billions in tax savings from the Trump tax cut, to buy back shares of their own stock. This boosted executive bonuses and pleased wealthy investors but did nothing to strengthen the airlines for the long term. Meanwhile, the four biggest carriers gained so much market power they jacked up prices on popular routes and slashed services (remember legroom and free bag checks?).</p> <p>United\u2019s CEO, Oscar Munoz, did his own Burring on Friday, warning that if Congress doesn\u2019t bail out the airline by the end of March, United will start firing its employees. But even if bailed out, what are the odds United would keep paying all its workers if the pandemic forced it to stop flying? The bailout would be for shareholders and executives, not workers.</p> <p>While generous toward airlines and other industries, the Republican bill is absurdly stingy toward people, stipulating a one-time payment of up to $1,200 for every adult and $500 per child. Some 64m households with incomes below $50,000 would get as little as $600. This will do almost nothing to help job-losers pay their mortgages, rents and other bills for the duration of the crisis, expected to be at least the next three months.</p> <p>The Republican coronavirus bill is about as Burring as legislation can be \u2013 exposing the underlying structure of power in America as clearly as Burr\u2019s stock trades. In this national crisis, it\u2019s just as morally repulsive.</p> <p>Take a look at how big corporations are treating their hourly workers in this pandemic and you see more Burring.</p> <p>Walmart, the largest employer in America, doesn\u2019t give its employees paid sick leave, and limits its 500,000 part-time workers to 48 hours paid time off per year. This Burring policy is now threatening countless lives. (On one survey, 88% of Walmart employees report sometimes coming to work when sick.)</p> <p>None of the giants of the fast-food industry \u2013 McDonald\u2019s, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Duncan Donuts, Wendy\u2019s, Taco Bell, Subway \u2013 gives their workers paid sick leave, either.</p> <p>Amazon, one of the richest corporations in the world, which paid almost no taxes last year, is offering <em>unpaid</em> time off for workers who are sick and just two weeks paid leave for workers who test positive for the virus. Meanwhile, it demands its employees put in mandatory overtime.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the most Burring thing of all: these corporations have made sure they and other companies with more than 500 employees are exempt from the requirement in the House coronavirus bill that employers provide paid sick leave.</p> <p>At a time when almost everyone feels burdened and fearful, the use of power and privilege to exploit the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of others is morally intolerable.</p> <p>We are all in this together, or should be. Whatever form it takes, Burring must be stopped.</p>",

Frustration has been building among some of the states, with perceptions that Canberra has been more focused on containing the economic shock associated with the coronavirus than on health prevention measures.</p> <p>With Victoria lining up to close schools early on Sunday, Morrison repeated his earlier arguments that widespread closures of schools \u201cwould seriously impact and disrupt the health workforce that is needed to save lives\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe would only take further measures based on medical advice because, at the same time that we are trying to protect lives, we are also trying to protect the livelihoods of Australians and that means acting on medical advice.\u201d</p> <p>However, the prime minister said the measures agreed by all state and territory leaders set a \u201cbaseline\u201d, and individual states would still prepare \u201ctailored\u201d responses, based on their individual circumstances.</p> <p>\u201cYou will see more regional focus to this, more

their own particular issues they need to deal with,\u201d Kelly said on Sunday.</p> <p>On the new travel restrictions, Morrison said that after consultation with state leaders, the government advice

If you put arrangements in place that shut down large parts of the country and the economy, then you better be prepared to hold on to those arrangements for at least the next six months.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7727b88f08e0999e6b7ed8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T08:55:13.093Z\">8.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">PM: states wanted collective position on schools</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Morrison is asked whether he thinks <strong>states and territories are frustrated on the issue of school closures</strong>, and announced their own measures prior to national cabinet because they didn\u2019t believe they\u2019d get the outcome they wanted.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It was the states themselves who were the most adamant about a collective and agreed position on schools.

The same, absolutely, with Chief Minister Gunner, who I\u2019ve been working particularly closely with on the dangers for remote communities. Every state has different challenges. Their geography is different, the population is different, the rate of spread of the virus is different. Their exposure to international flights at the outset of the virus - completely different.

The National Protocol does not direct jurisdictions to do such assessments but instead, leave it to the State\u2019s discretion.</p> \n   <p>Contrary to some public statements made, every cruise liner that has entered NSW ports has been the subject of an assessment well beyond Federal requirements.</p> \n   <p>The National Protocol states \u201cprovided there are no concerns about the COVID-19 risk profile of a ship or suspected COVID-19 cases reported, the human bio-security officer may advise the bio-security officer that pratique can be granted and the ship may be allowed to continue the voyage while samples are being tested\u201d.</p> \n   <p>NSW Health undertook a full assessment of the Ruby Princess, notwithstanding under the National Protocol in place, it could have chosen not to do an assessment.</p> \n   <p>NSW Health again followed the National Protocol that states \u201cthe ship may be allowed to continue the voyage while samples are being tested\u201d.</p> \n   <p>However, as of midnight March 22, NSW Health will go even further beyond the National Protocol and its current own State protocols and will hold all cruise ships in port until any patients highlighted as having respiratory issues are tested for COVID-19.</p> \n   <p>The increased testing regime follows 26 confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the Ruby Princess, including 17 passengers and 1 crew member diagnosed in NSW, and 8 passengers diagnosed interstate (as of 8 pm yesterday).</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T08:03:05.716Z\">at 8.03am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7717978f08e0999e6b7e97\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T07:49:13.922Z\">7.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Carlton and United Breweries, the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/07/cub-55-workers-have-won-all-demands-in-industrial-dispute-says-union\">whose mistreatment of 55 workers</a> prompted national outrage in 2016, says it is <strong>concerned about brewery jobs</strong> after the Victorian government announced its shutdown of non-essential industries. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rwillingham/status/1241628263107051520\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Carlton and United Breweries are worried about brewery jobs and beer supplies. \u2066<a href=\"https://twitter.com/abcmelbourne?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@abcmelbourne</a>\u2069 <a href=\"https://t.co/69gJxiWQvb\">pic.twitter.com/69gJxiWQvb</a></p>\u2014 Richard Willingham (@rwillingham) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rwillingham/status/1241628263107051520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 22, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7710948f08a08573fbf303\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T07:30:28.308Z\">7.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">ACT says schools will be 'pupil free' from Tuesday</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Just back to the ACT momentarily, the government has also announced it <strong>will be shifting rapidly to online learning in schools</strong>.

The SA police commissioner will also declare a major emergency in that state \u2014 that replaces the public health emergency that was previously declared, and means that emergency provisions are authorised under the Emergency Management Act and not the Public Health Act. </p> \n  <p>Police are responsible for enforcing that act, so the emergency management response will now be coordinated by the police commissioner. This is similar to what Tasmania announced on Thursday.</p> \n  <p>Marshall said the measure was announced after<strong> a number of cases in SA in recent days were of people who had contracted the virus after returning from interstate, or contracted it from people visiting from interstate.</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This has forced our decision to close our borders in South Australia. We make this decision in the interest of public health in South Australia. <strong>People that are coming into South Australia, whether they are visitors or whether they are South Australians returning, will be required to undertake 14 days of self isolation.</strong> This is no longer something which is optional. It is mandatory. It is the social responsibility of every single person in this state to make sure that they are abiding by these rules. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The laws will come into force on 4pm on Tuesday. Border control stations will be set up at the airport, at train stations, and on roads entering SA \u2014 repurposing heavy vehicle inspections stations and biosecurity stations that already exist on the border.</p> \n  <p>Marshall said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When people come into South Australia, from four o\u2019clock onTuesday afternoon, they will be required to understand precisely the orders that will be in place. <strong>They will be asked to sign a declaration that they will self isolate and they will be required to provide SA Police with information on where they will be undertaking their self isolation</strong>. There will be tests on this important declaration and this commitment individuals regarding this very, very important Public safety initiative. </p> \n   <p>There will be some arrangements put in place along borders because we know that in country South Australia, sometimes two towns on either side of the border have a high level of interaction ... People that do live in those communities will be allowed to move between those communities once they have been identified as somebody in on of those communities but, I stress, if there is any reason to believe that there is an outbreak on the immediate other side of the border, then that\u2019ll have to also be curtailed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Marshall said there would be some \u201clogical exceptions\u201d to the quarantine requirements, particularly around freight.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T03:38:01.470Z\">at 3.38am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e76d8078f08a08573fbf24c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T03:17:00.864Z\">3.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">NSW premier says she will introduce a 'more comprehensive' lockdown of non-essential services</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is the full statement from the NSW premier, <strong>Gladys Berejiklian</strong>, on a \u201cmore comprehensive lockdown of non-essential services\u201d in NSW.<br></p> \n  <p>The statement reads:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>Tonight I will be informing the National Cabinet that NSW will proceed to a <strong>more comprehensive shutdown of non-essential services.

  "<p>Much has been written about Britons who fought in Syria, but little truly explains who these characters were, what made them tick. Or what actually happened when they disappeared into the byzantine politics of its brutal war. <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/no-return-9781783351817.html\">No Return</a></em> tracks five teenage friends from Brighton who stepped into its chaos. All were killed except one. The survivor, Amer Deghayes, is the longest-serving Briton in Syria since the fighting began and offers a unique account of a ceaseless, shifting conflict.</p> <p>Equally crucial are those he left behind. I learned that more than 30 Brightonians \u2013 the largest identified group of potential jihadists in western Europe \u2013 had discussed plans to join him. All were between 13 and 18 years of age, some were girls, most were white, working-class Islamic converts from the forgotten estates of east Brighton.</p> <p>Investigating what had happened to these youngsters I discovered the Hillstreet Gang (HSG), whose members had converted to Islam in a makeshift gym. For several years the police considered them the most notorious street gang in Brighton. A hidden, violent side of the city revealed itself.</p> <p>Throughout the summer of 2018 I tracked down prominent members one by one, knowing that approaching the group would mean instant rejection.</p> <p>But like their friends who had disappeared in Syria, key figures would vanish from Brighton, often into prison. One central member of HSG who appears in <em>No Return</em> was jailed for 20 years, so I didn\u2019t get the chance to interview him.</p> <p>Soon after another of the book\u2019s key figures, Amer\u2019s brother Abdul, was killed in an alleged drugs dispute.</p> <p>It was a death as sudden and savage as that of his friends who had entered Syria. But Abdul\u2019s vulnerability, like the others, had been signposted long before, raising questions over how we view those seen as different. Do we try to understand or do we push them further to the margins, deeper into violence?</p> <h2>Extract from No Return: The True Story of How Martyrs Are Made</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cfd197262e7334d214b8f264d77edfacb030532\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cfd197262e7334d214b8f264d77edfacb030532/0_0_3500_2329/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saltdean in Brighton, East Sussex.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saltdean in Brighton, East Sussex.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Hasson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was calm on Saltdean beach, the hum of the A259 drowned out by the surf. As a young teenager, Amer Deghayes would come here for peace and stand up to his ankles in the water, peering into the sea.</p> <p>Peace was a fleeting concept when you lived with four younger brothers. The nearest in age to Amer were twins Abdullah and Abdul. Next came Jaffar. Mohammed, the youngest, was the quietest. Accompanying them would be their mother Einas, a timid woman whose parental strategy was geared towards kindness with as little confrontation as possible. Her husband, Abubaker, was a thickset alpha male with a prayer bump on his forehead that proved his piety.</p> <p>Amer was named after Abubaker\u2019s father, Amer Taher Deghayes, a lawyer who had pioneered trade unions in Libya, and decades later remained a celebrated figure among a slice of the country\u2019s liberal intelligentsia. He was also co-founder of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Ba%27ath_Movement\">Ba\u2019ath movement</a> that challenged Libya\u2019s leader Muammar Gaddafi for power. It was a perilous, courageous move. And one that meant Amer never met his grandfather. Amer senior was arrested by Gaddafi\u2019s security officials 14 years before his grandson was born, and died in custody. Amnesty International said he was \u201cbelieved to have been extra-judicially executed\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d1e552b61be22e47109437b29494cd729db1d9f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1e552b61be22e47109437b29494cd729db1d9f8/0_0_750_829/452.jpg\" alt=\"Amer Deghayes.\" width=\"452\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amer Deghayes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Stewart News Limited</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The family fled to the UK and claimed political asylum. They bought a house in the Sussex village of Saltdean, a conservative place of net curtains and neat flowerbeds a short walk from the beach. They were its only Muslim family. Abubaker studied business at Lewes College, ran an old people\u2019s home and married his cousin, Einas Abulsayen.</p> <p>Abubaker\u2019s brother Omar, inspired by their father, became a lawyer with ambitions to represent the oppressed. After graduating in law from the University of Wolverhampton, Omar, 31, travelled to Afghanistan on a round-the-world trip to experience Islamic cultures. There he was embroiled in the US invasion that followed the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Captured by mercenaries and sold for a reported $5,000 to US intelligence, he was deported to Guantanamo Bay in a case of mistaken identity, confused with a Saudi jihadist who was later killed by Russian forces.</p> <p>Omar spent almost 2,000 days inside the gulag, where he was tortured and lost the sight of one eye. By the time he returned to Brighton in 2007 his wife, whom he had met on his travels, had divorced him. He had lost everything.</p> <p>Abubaker, who devoted years to getting his brother released, and remained traumatised by the loss of his father, was a figure who corroborated the thesis that violence flows down generations. Einas felt her husband had unaddressed mental health issues. Whatever the truth, documents from police and social services suggested that for years the family privately endured his volatile temper.</p> <p>Things came to a head in November 2010 when the emergency helpline of a local charity for victims of domestic abuse received a call from a friend of Einas, gravely concerned for her safety and that of her five sons. In detail, the caller recounted how Abubaker had that weekend become \u201cvery physically aggressive, smashing up mobile phones and other items. Family had to lock themselves in one room and call the police,\u201d stated a summary of the call.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"498ac3e637e5738db57c9833680ce2e650a2bc6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/498ac3e637e5738db57c9833680ce2e650a2bc6f/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Omar Deghayes, who was held in Guantanamo Bay for more than five years and subjected to torture that left him blind in his right eye.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Omar Deghayes, who was held in Guantanamo Bay for more than five years and subjected to torture that left him blind in his right eye.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teri Pengilley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Three days later police received another call; the details were macabre. Amer and the others were allegedly lined up and \u201cwhipped with electrical leads or computer cables\u201d by their father, who contests the claims against him.</p> <p>In light of these allegations, the five boys received a child protection order forbidding Abubaker contacting them. But their troubles were far from over. At Longhill school the four younger boys were subjected to racist comments and bullying. The attacks were daily, merciless and unrelenting. Water was lobbed over the twins as they queued for lunch in the canteen. Bread buns were hurled at them as they ate. Taunts of \u201cPaki\u201d and \u201cterrorist\u201d followed them around the playground. They were cornered and beaten on the school bus back to Saltdean.</p> <p>Even when they made it to home turf, there was no respite. Anti-Islamic graffiti began appearing on the quaint seafront promenade, 200 metres from the family home. Adjacent to their house lay Saltdean Oval, the park where the Deghayes boys played football on summer evenings. It was their favourite pastime, until the bullies from Longhill began targeting them there. They stopped playing football, a decision that upset all the brothers. At night, their attackers would mass at the Oval and creep up the hill towards their home where they would stand in the small front garden, shouting obscenities, the familiar favourites of \u201cPaki\u201d and \u201cterrorist\u201d. Bricks would hit the house. Some of the gang would start kicking the front door. When they grew bored, they would leave. Then the family would quietly shuffle to bed, too petrified to venture downstairs.</p> <p>According to local activists, police gave the impression they were happy to abandon the family. The twins in particular felt the police did not respond to the racism and that reports of harassment and antisocial behaviour against them were not investigated, according to one of their case workers. Behind Brighton\u2019s progressive image of green politics, veganism and tolerance was a competing, ugly reality.</p> <p>During the spring term of 2010 the twins made a pact that the bullies wouldn\u2019t win. They installed boxing equipment in their parents\u2019 Saltdean garage and spent hours pummelling punchbags they pretended were the torsos of their adversaries. They worked out every night, buoyed when their arms and necks started to thicken.</p> <p>Their transformation from bullied children to ringleaders was rapid. Those present at the Deghayeses\u2019 third child protection conference in mid-July 2011 were startled. Though the meeting had been convened to determine if the boys were safe from their father, it became evident that the tables were turned. Officials were alarmed by the speed of the power shift. \u201cThe five boys would now take on their father and not be abused by him. They have become both a powerful group in the community and in the family home,\u201d their assessment concluded.</p> <p>Over the next couple of years, while Amer remained a diligent student, Abdullah, Abdul and Jaffar were routinely excluded from school. The twins enrolled others who were ostracised from mainstream education and formed the Hillstreet Gang, which Jaffar also joined. HSG quickly became notorious for violence, dealing weed and troublemaking throughout the city, resulting in a blanket ban for all members from most of the city\u2019s shops, bars and public spaces in May 2012.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7060a83f8cc155371f4f8dcabd49f22c4eba9964\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7060a83f8cc155371f4f8dcabd49f22c4eba9964/0_0_306_435/306.jpg\" alt=\"Jaffar Deghayes.\" width=\"306\" height=\"435\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jaffar Deghayes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: internet</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Around this time Amer set up a rudimentary gym at the al-Quds mosque, where Abubaker had just become a trustee. And, in part because their reputation meant no other gym in the city allowed them entry, HSG joined a cohort of teenagers who were gathering there daily</p> <p>The police monitoring the Deghayeses and others viewed the popularity of the mosque gym \u2013 dubbed the Brothers\u2019 Gym by the gang \u2013 as an unequivocally positive development. Jaffar\u2019s attendance at the mosque had, after all, coincided with an abrupt fall in his offending.</p> <p>Amer, who was now commuting daily to London\u2019s Oxford Street to a job in Specsavers, was delighted that so many of his brothers\u2019 friends were turning to Islam. The converts learned how to prostrate themselves, kneeling with their foreheads pointing towards Mecca. They were taught Arabic phrases, such as \u201c<em>As-Salaam-Alaikum</em>\u201d, meaning \u201cPeace be unto you\u201d.</p> <p>Twelve months previously the twins had seldom identified as Muslims; now Islam became the gang\u2019s identity. By March 2013 at least 20 of the group called themselves Muslim. For many in the gang it was the first belief system they had.</p> <p>But the largely positive energy inside the gym was about to change. The group often watched videos on their phones and a film about the Syrian civil war had electrified Amer. A German film-maker had spent weeks inside Aleppo, documenting its civilian population under siege.</p> <p>Screened on <em>Channel 4 News </em>on 25 March 2013, it followed a group of exhausted kids working in a makeshift hospital. They attempted to keep other children, pale and bloodied, from death. One boy was no more than 12, a doctor\u2019s coat drowning his frame. He had an 11-year-old friend, Yusef, who helped him tend to the wounded. The film closed with Yusef lying dead, open-mouthed, in the place where he once helped others. He had been killed by a Syrian army bomb.</p> <p>Amer was overcome with a sensation that felt unusual: rage. Others were asking how Bashar al-Assad could get away with killing his own people, the country\u2019s children. Even the twins, preoccupied with their own combat zone on the streets of Brighton, railed against Assad.</p> <p>Something else in the Channel 4 film caught Amer\u2019s eye. Standing against Assad in the absence of western intervention was an Islamist group called Jabhat al-Nusra. The programme followed them handing out food and clothing to Aleppo\u2019s stranded civilians, giving spiritual guidance, relaxing after a firefight by playing <em>Fifa</em>. Amer began investigating al-Nusra, watching grainy footage of men carrying AK-47s marching behind tanks and shouting <em>Allahu-Akbar </em>after every victory.</p> <p>March had been the bloodiest month of the Syrian war with 6,000 deaths. Amer said it was obvious the <em>ummah </em>\u2013 the community of Muslims \u2013 needed defending. He said that every Muslim in the group, including the converts, had a duty. The gang agreed there was a need to fight back. One Islamic concept was starting to appeal: jihad.</p> <p>Over the summer he spent hours studying the cleric <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/anwar-al-awlaki\">Anwar al-Awlaki</a>, who two years earlier had been killed in a US drone strike in Yemen\u2019s tribal badlands. Al-Awlaki lived on in more than 70,000 YouTube videos, and part of his potency was that he preached in English. With no Arabic required, just internet access, it gave him enormous reach to Muslims in the west \u2013 and all those in the Brothers\u2019 Gym.</p> <p>In one video, shot in Yemen in 2010, Awlaki warned: \u201cThe west will eventually turn against its Muslim citizens.\u201d The horrific experiences of Omar in Guantanamo Bay were familiar to everyone in HSG. They all knew what was possible.</p> <p>On 29 August 2013 the British parliament rejected a plan for military strikes against Assad. Then Barack Obama asked Congress to postpone a vote to authorise a US military strike on Syria. It seemed clear to the Brothers\u2019 Gym that doing something was the only option. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be the person just standing on the sideline and watching,\u201d said Amer. He knew what his grandfather would have done.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Each day, more refugees arrived, all with fresher, more brutish accounts of Assad\u2019s men</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Amer\u2019s father had maintained connections with the Muslim humanitarian sector since the Bosnian war. One charity was called the Albayan Foundation, based in the predominantly Muslim area of Sparkhill, Birmingham. The organisation had been among the first to deliver aid to Syria after the conflict began two years earlier. Albayan\u2019s next convoy would be heading for Syria soon, in less than a month. Amer told his father that he needed to help Syria\u2019s beleaguered civilians. His schoolfriend, Mo Khan, was also keen to come along for the ride.</p> <p>On the eve of their departure, Amer told his mum that he was going to Libya to see relatives and she let him have his passport. Mid-afternoon the next day, 8 October 2013, two white lorries that had travelled from Birmingham picked him and Mo Khan up, along with Abubaker, sucking a Rothmans cigarette.</p> <p>Two hours later they reached Calais and from there headed south-west into Germany. After six days and 3,000 miles they reached the Turkish border. On 14 October, the two white lorries entered Syria via the Bab al-Hawa crossing.</p> <p>Close up, the Atmeh refugee camp was wretched. Recent rains had ravaged the site and its paths had become quagmires. Amer watched families struggling uphill, slipping in mud mixed with excrement. The camp\u2019s 25,000 occupants had been forgotten. Winter approached, but it had no running water, no electricity, no heat, no sewage systems and no UN relief convoys. Each day, more refugees arrived, all with fresher, more brutish accounts of Assad\u2019s men.</p> <p>Armed men, AK-47s slung over their shoulders, could be spotted outside the camp. The refugees called them \u201cthe spicy crew\u201d. They were the jihadists, Jabhat al-Nusra. The surrounding hills belonged to them. From Atmeh, Amer could see their black banners, trembling in the breeze. Amer and Mo Khan planned to join them. But the charity workers wouldn\u2019t let them out of their sight. After a week, their tasks almost done, they were no closer to becoming jihadists. Finally, the Birmingham charity workers said they were finished. They were all going home. Reluctantly, Amer and Mo helped pack up and climbed in a van. On 22 October they left Syria.</p> <p>As they drove towards Turkey\u2019s Hatay airport, Amer and Mo Khan hatched a yarn about flying to Libya to see Amer\u2019s family. Outside the departure terminal they said goodbye to the charity drivers and watched them trundle off in the direction of Birmingham. The instant they disappeared Amer and Mo turned towards the taxi rank. \u201cThe border please,\u201d said Amer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b84676f83ec61bf7ab3dd99cfbab6c36d78729e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b84676f83ec61bf7ab3dd99cfbab6c36d78729e6/0_0_2499_1666/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Cilvegozu border crossing between Turkey and Syria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Cilvegozu border crossing between Turkey and Syria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adem Altan/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Crossing the border was effortless as it was controlled by Jabhat al-Nusra. Amer and Mo Khan simply told the border guards they wanted to join the jihad against Assad. They were escorted to a truck and taken south to an al-Nusra training camp.</p> <p>The camp was highly professional. Not only were there huge stockpiles of weaponry, but massive reserves of manpower. Foreign fighters were flooding in from across Europe, most arriving via humanitarian convoys.</p> <p>Training began with a dawn prayer and an hour run led by a Chechen special forces officer. Then it was tactical tutorials, ambush training and simulated attacks, followed by prayers and lectures by Islamist teachers. Amer and Mo learned basic firing techniques and assault tactics, how to clean a rifle, tie a tourniquet and clean a deep flesh wound. In two weeks, they learned how to be jihadists.</p> <p>Back in Sussex, on the morning of 11 November, a meeting of senior police, counter-extremism chiefs, youth justice bosses and representatives from Prevent gathered to ascertain if Jaffar was at risk of being radicalised following a recent diatribe he had made in public about Americans being terrorists. During the meeting, the family\u2019s former social worker revealed that Jaffar\u2019s oldest brother, Amer, was now in Syria. The revelation prompted little urgency. Not a single expert at the meeting believed the 16-year-old was vulnerable. \u201cThere are no risks of radicalisation,\u201d was the final, unanimous verdict.</p> <p>Had they taken even a cursory look at his phone, they would have quickly learned that Jaffar was in frequent touch with his 19-year-old brother. From there, they would have rapidly discovered that Jaffar and a large number of his friends were discussing travelling to Syria.</p> <p>At the start of 2014 there was a major Brothers\u2019 Gym meeting to discuss who was prepared to make the journey. Jaffar was driving the plan. His friend Ibby had already put his name down and Abdullah decided to go too. Like Jaffar, Abdullah felt he had run out of rope in Brighton. \u201cThey were thinking that they couldn\u2019t do anything with their lives, there was no point in staying, that they couldn\u2019t get a job,\u201d said Abdullah\u2019s friend Bill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8310a9e33f59692ff9352f4c0853fe4a3bc077ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8310a9e33f59692ff9352f4c0853fe4a3bc077ae/0_0_1390_1357/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jaffar Deghayes\u2019s friend Ibby Kamara.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"976\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jaffar Deghayes\u2019s friend Ibby Kamara.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: internet</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They bought three one-way \u00a359 tickets to Istanbul, sitting together. They half-expected to be raided by police in the hours following the transaction. Nothing happened.</p> <p>The security staff on duty at Luton on 28 January 2014 could not have missed the three teenagers; the towering pipe-cleaner figure of Ibby framed by the squat physiques of Jaffar and Abdullah. Everything was against them. Ibby was carrying the passport of his 15-year-old brother, a person who looked nothing like him and who was not allowed to fly without an authorised adult. Jaffar was on an extremist airport watchlist. Abdullah, 17, one of the most notorious faces in his force area, was not only on bail but due in court in several weeks. Police also had intelligence that Abdullah and Jaffar\u2019s eldest brother was currently fighting for an al-Qaida-affiliated group in Syria. Finally, they had bought one-way tickets, at a stroke compromising their cover story of a sightseeing trip to Istanbul. A rookie mistake.</p> <p>Shortly after 2pm they checked in and approached passport control. They waltzed through. It was the same story at Istanbul Atat\u00fcrk airport. As the number one arrival point for foreign fighters headed for Syria in early 2014, the airport\u2019s border officials had received instruction to profile Muslims arriving from the west \u2013 especially those with no return tickets. But the three teenagers from Brighton skipped through security without a hitch.</p> <p>They could never have envisaged how straightforward it would be to enter Syria. Jabhat al-Nusra had seized control of the crossing six weeks earlier and the three boys, including the youngest British jihadist who would enter the Syrian conflict, were almost dragged over by the welcoming guards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"71c8f0f42db75f373142da3635b7b7a60acf2cdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71c8f0f42db75f373142da3635b7b7a60acf2cdd/0_0_3508_4000/877.jpg\" alt=\"Abdullah Deghayes.\" width=\"877\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abdullah Deghayes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family handout/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On 5 April 2014, Abdul and Abdullah spent their 18th birthdays three time zones apart. For Abdul it was a fairly low-key day at the mosque gym. Abdullah celebrated his arrival to adulthood at the frontline of the al-Nusra offensive, occupying a trench south of the village of Salma in Syria\u2019s Latakia province. Most of the rebel fighters were weary and cold; supply lines were stretched. Syrian artillery had started shelling their positions, but Abdullah had boundless energy. The more they were targeted, the more he seemed invigorated.</p> <p>Over the days that followed the fighting intensified. At least 40 foreign recruits died. The Brighton contingent found themselves three-quarters up Mount Chalma. Their unit commander took them aside. A force of enemy troops had gathered on the other side of the mountain. \u201cHe just said: \u2018Let\u2019s go around the army and surround them\u2019,\u201d said Amer. They set off, the Mediterranean glittering below them in the late afternoon sun.</p> <p>A ferocious burst of firing erupted from a line of trees just ahead. The al-Nusra fighters crouched as the weight of fire intensified. To his left, Amer noticed a figure moving ahead, Abdullah, out on his own, chasing the regime troops down the scree of the steep mountainside. He could hear his younger brother shouting, pursuing the enemy like he once chased rival gangs along Marine Parade. Then Amer heard a sharp crack, a sniper rifle. He watched his younger brother tumble heavily to the ground. By the time they reached him, it was too late. Abdullah Deghayes was dead. He was 18 years and six days old.</p> <p>Einas was the first to receive the news. She initially refused to believe it. Soon after, an image surfaced on Facebook. Shot at dusk and taken from the chest up, it showed Abdullah lying on his back in a combat jacket. He looked serene, as if he was sleeping. Abdul and Mohammed, who had been lugging the belongings of their three brothers in Syria into their new temporary council home in Portslade, heard their mum\u2019s wailing. Abdul broke down uncontrollably when he learned his twin was dead.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What made me angry was that nothing was done about it. My son was just another dead jihadi. They let them go to die</p> <footer> <cite>Khadijah Kamara</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Within six months another brother and two friends were also dead. Mo Khan had been killed by a Russian explosive, Ibby by an American cruise missile, and Jaffar by Syrian army regulars. His body was never found.</p> <p>Ibby\u2019s mother, Khadijah Kamara, wrote to the Home Office asking why her eldest boy had been allowed to travel using not just the wrong passport but that of a 15-year-old. \u201cAs a mother I feel that I am owed an explanation,\u201d she wrote. But no explanation was forthcoming. \u201cWhat made me angry was that nothing was done about it. My son was just another dead jihadi. They let them go to die.\u201d</p> <p>The city put a lid on the case, hoping that no one would pry too closely. Within the council and police, the fact that the scale and scope of the extremism had not been exposed was a source of relief. Rather than drilling down into the issues \u2013 the injustices and ignorance that caused the problem \u2013 officials walked away, keen to move on.</p> <p>Abubaker\u2019s temper landed him in trouble again. In the summer of 2018 he faced trial for assaulting his wife. He was found not guilty of assault, but sentenced to 18 months in prison for attempting to prevent Einas testifying against him. Abubaker joined his youngest son in jail. Four months earlier Mohammed had been sentenced at Lewes crown court. The court heard that he was caught in a catch-22. The teenager was trapped in a cycle of dealing to repay the debts he had accrued by using drugs as \u201ca much-needed escape from everything going on around him\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Abdul, the twin who had stayed at home, is alleged to have<strong> </strong>evolved into a serious criminal, with a string of convictions for violence, robbery and drug-dealing. In September 2017, he was jailed after police raided the home where he lived with his mother and found scales, deal bags, burner phones, wads of cash, even a safe. And a lot of drugs: cocaine, ketamine, MDMA and amphetamines with a combined street value of \u00a32,250.</p> <p>Amer spoke to him from Syria shortly after he was set free the following summer. Abdul sounded contrite, almost remorseful. He promised his older brother he had changed his ways. But the 22-year-old, who had come so close to travelling to fight in Syria, embraced the only life he knew. He fell back into leading Hillstreet.</p> <p>In February 2019, Abdul is said to have met up with a cocaine dealer known as Frank. What happened next is the subject of a murder trial. Abdul was stabbed eight times. A knife sank nine centimetres into his body, skewering a kidney and slicing the femoral vein and artery in his left leg, a grievous wound. For eight hours doctors at the Royal Sussex county hospital fought to save Abdul. But at 6am, the sky still black, specialists agreed his injuries were \u201cuntreatable\u201d. Abdul Deghayes was dead.</p> <p>His brother Mohammed was allowed out of prison to attend Abdul\u2019s funeral. Abubaker addressed the mourners. His son was venerated, he said, recounting his recent spell in prison when he was afforded hero status by so many inmates because he was \u201cAbdul\u2019s dad\u201d. But Abubaker\u2019s central message was that Abdul\u2019s death must act as the catalyst for his friends to mend their ways. \u201cIt\u2019s time to turn the corner,\u201d said the 50-year-old and stared at the gang. Some lowered their heads. And he said that it was time to go clean. \u201cNo more intoxication, no more getting high. It\u2019s time to chase the super-high of Islam.\u201d Then he pleaded for calm, no more bloodshed. \u201cPlease no revenge, no retribution. In Islam we show peace to everyone, wherever they are. Wherever they come from,\u201d said Abubaker.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2fd0ebfedd454bd7ff0867486c539b4f510eb8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2fd0ebfedd454bd7ff0867486c539b4f510eb8b/0_0_5066_3379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abubaker Deghayes at home in Saltdean, Sussex, April 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abubaker Deghayes at home in Saltdean, East Sussex, April 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Einas, who had now lost three of her sons, kept a low profile in Saltdean, living in a quiet street close to where the family first arrived in the UK. Occasionally friends saw her in the city, always meticulous in her hijab, but she was shy, leaving most to speculate how she coped with what had happened to her five boys.</p> <p>Six years on, Amer is the only one of the five to remain in Syria. Having arrived fresh-faced in the autumn of 2013 with the aim of toppling Assad, the 25-year-old had not imagined he would still be there. After the death of Jaffar, Abdullah and Mo Khan, he sought refuge in family life. He had married Natalie, a Syrian national, in 2015, and they had a daughter, Sham. They moved to a modest home in an Idlib suburb whose roads were lined with rubble and pock-marked with craters. Nearby was a gym and mosque and he had friends, including six British jihadists. Mostly, he enjoyed spending time with his wife, watching CBeebies on YouTube with his daughter.</p> <p>But the defeat at Aleppo had dramatically curbed the ambitions of the jihadists. Shoehorned into a sliver of land in the north-west, all their hope of an Islamic emirate had faded. The only good news, said Amer, was that Islamic State were finally routed.</p> <p>He had started contemplating his future and towards the end of 2019 he was sounding different in his calls home. Once he described himself as \u201cbeaten\u201d and he began feeling homesick. He wanted his family to meet Sham and Natalie. He missed the sea, the squawk of seagulls.</p> <p>But the issue of Syrian returnees following the defeat of the Islamic State had turned toxic. Ministers threatened severe consequences for anyone attempting to return from Syria. In May 2019 the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, gave British citizens in Idlib province an ultimatum: leave within 28 days or face a 10-year prison sentence if they attempted to return to the UK.</p> <p>Amer was worried, fearful of what it meant for him and his family. He occasionally wondered what the UK security services thought of him. But it was the answer to another question that he most wanted.</p> <p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll be OK to come home?\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>This is an edited extract from <em>No Return: The True Story of How Martyrs Are Made</em> by Mark Townsend (Guardian Faber, \u00a312.99).

  "<p><strong>My brother booked his wedding and reception at the Vu in Bathgate for 5 June. Now with guests cancelling on them because of the virus, they have asked if they can postpone the event until 2021 or 2022. He\u2019s been told that they can\u2019t and will forfeit the full fee if they cancel. He\u2019s currently out of work because of the pandemic and has a newborn baby, so they can ill afford this.</strong><br><strong><em>AG, London</em></strong></p> <p>Happily for him the Vu has now changed its policy and is offering couples with weddings booked from now until the end of June the chance to postpone without charge to a suitable date in 2020-21. However, it\u2019s still hosting weddings for as long as gatherings are permitted by the Scottish government. This is the kind of crisis wedding insurance is for, but couples who have not already bought a policy may find they are too late. A number of firms have announced they will not accept any new applications. Even those who have a policy may only be covered if their wedding is cancelled for actual infection rather than fear of infection, and some insurers specifically exclude cover for law changes that affect the big day. That means a future government ban on large groups would not qualify policyholders for a refund.</p> <p><strong>I am 60 and not yet retired. I have a pension pot from previous employment that has fallen by \u00a38,000 this week to \u00a364,000. Is four years enough time for it to recover from this and further slides? Or is there sense in converting to annuities?</strong><br><strong><em>DM, Manchester</em></strong></p> <p>It\u2019s certainly alarming to watch investments in freefall, but pension schemes do factor in financial volatility. Many schemes move funds into less risky options such as gilts and bonds as customers near retirement, which means they will take less of a hit than stock market investments. You should check to see what type of funds your pension is invested in.</p> <p>It\u2019s those who invested their retirement nest egg privately who may have to postpone retirement until markets recover, or resign themselves to a reduced income, according to Charlotte Jackson, head of pension operations and consumer protection at the Money and Pensions Service.</p> <p>It\u2019s crucial to get independent advice before rushing into anything, however desperate the headlines. You can call the Pension Advisory Service on 0800 011 3797 or book a free appointment to discuss your options with Pension Wise. Usually, face-to-face discussions of up to an hour are offered, but in the current climate it will have to be by phone.</p> <p><strong>If someone has life insurance and dies of Covid-19, will the policy pay out, or will this be classed as an \u201cAct of God\u201d and exempt the insurer.</strong><br><strong><em>SQ, Epsom, Surrey</em></strong></p> <p>An understandable question since insurers are notorious for passing the buck to the Almighty when it comes to natural disasters. If you have already taken out the policy you will almost certainly be OK, since most cover infectious diseases. However, the coronavirus outbreak has triggered panic buying of life insurance and anyone still at the application stage will probably find the ground has shifted. Premiums are calculated according to your health and medical history, so any underlying conditions which put you particularly at risk may cost you more \u2013 or cause your application to be rejected. You may also be asked about your recent travels.</p> <p><strong>We have just moved out of our rented flat, which was then professionally cleaned. On the last day of our tenancy my partner developed a cough and so we are now following government advice to self-isolate.

Therefore, they need to be put up somewhere until the property becomes available,\u201d says chief executive David Cox. \u201cConsequently, these costs need to be covered by the existing tenants and these two costs are legitimate deposit deductions.</p> <p>\u201cThis is why we\u2019re calling on government to ensure urgent action is taken to support those who have been financially burdened by the impact of coronavirus.\u201d</p> <p>However, Samantha Jenkins, a solicitor with DAS Law, takes the opposite view, pointing out that tenants are required to leave a property in the same condition as they found it. \u201cAssuming the property was handed back to the landlord in a clean condition, a landlord is not able to hold the tenant liable for the cost of professional cleaning, nor of rehoming a new tenant,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThere are currently no regulations which would suggest that the legal position differs simply because a tenant has any of the symptoms connected with the coronavirus.\u201d</p> <p>The trouble is, if you refuse to pay, the landlord could withhold the deposit, in which case you\u2019d have to raise a dispute with the Deposit Protection Service.

I\u2019m just going to keep myself healthy as much as I can.\u201d</p> <p>Charities and local authorities are racing against the clock to secure enough accommodation for the UK\u2019s homeless population to be able to self-isolate, with many winter night shelters set to close at the end of the month.</p> <p>But while many rough sleepers have been accommodated thanks to a government \u00a33.2m <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/3-2-million-emergency-support-for-rough-sleepers-during-coronavirus-outbreak\">emergency fund</a>, others remain on the streets and are seeing the services they rely on stripped back as staff are forced to self-isolate, volunteers forced to stay home and public gatherings banned.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.org.uk/\">Glass Door</a> in London has stopped accepting new people into its night shelters, and reduced its dinner service to prevent overcrowding. As the supply of food and volunteers diminishes, the charity is considering distributing mobile phones with credit to continue to provide support.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some housing providers stop taking new referrals, and others report that they are struggling to access new accommodation,\u201d says senior caseworker Neil Parkinson. \u201cAt the same time, guests who had managed to get jobs have found themselves back out of work. We are also finding that the wait time on the call to book a first appointment for a new Universal Credit claim has gone from about 10 minutes to two hours.\u201d</p> <p>The government is expected to announce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/uk-hotels-homeless-shelters-coronavirus\">plans to convert hotels and offices</a> into safe units under a national action plan imminently \u2013 but many charities say securing the estimated 45,000 units needed is an uphill task.</p> <p>Terry Gore at Catching Lives Day Centre in Canterbury says the charity has been told to contact the council for alternative accommodation only if clients are showing signs of the virus. \u201cMy hope is that accommodation will be made available to allow our rough sleepers to get off the street and self-isolate \u2013 but there is no sign of that at the moment,\u201d he says. Instead the charity is supporting people on the streets, buying water bottles, cheap mobiles, pay as you go sim cards, power banks, and delivering food parcels.</p> <p>The sector is facing \u201ca perfect storm\u201d, says Mark Grant at <a href=\"https://actionhomeless.org.uk/\">Action Homeless in Leicester</a>. \u201cIn the last couple of days we\u2019ve been working with the council, trying to identify accommodation, negotiating with some hotels on cost, seeing where we can move people into their own flats. But there is very little capacity anywhere. The housing system was already under pressure \u2013 there just aren\u2019t spare hostels and houses.\u201d</p> <p>The decision about who needs to self-isolate is further complicated by a lack of testing among a population who regularly present with coughs and fever. \u201cWe\u2019re operating blind,\u201d says Grant.</p> <p>People are already falling between the cracks. Glass Door in London reported sending a guest with symptoms to hospital for them to be sent home without testing; the <a href=\"https://www.glasgowcitymission.com/\">Glasgow City Mission </a>said guests who had potentially shared a large room with someone who had later tested positive for coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-case-homeless-shelter-guests-street-glasgow-city-mission\">were not given accommodation</a> when its night shelter was closed because of their insecure immigration status.</p> <p>And more pressure may be coming. Some charities the Guardian spoke to expressed concerns that if prisoners were released from prison, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/21/prisons-could-see-800-deaths-from-coronavirus-without-protective-measures\">has happened in the US, Spain and Iran</a>, they would struggle to cope. \u201cThat would be very unhelpful when we are already dealing with unprecedented demand,\u201d says Mel Hartley, project manager at <a href=\"https://stpetrocks.org.uk/\">St Petrock\u2019s in Exeter</a>.</p> <p>As well as rough sleepers, figures released on Thursday revealed that <a href=\"https://england.shelter.org.uk/media/press_releases/articles/with_a_household_becoming_homeless_every_4_minutes,_better_protection_against_coronavirus_is_needed_for_families_in_emergency_accommodation\">62,280 families </a>are currently living in temporary accommodation in England \u2013 5,400 of those with shared facilities. The number has increased by almost a third in the last five years.</p> <p>Acknowledging that people in already economically precarious situations could quickly find themselves homeless because of the current crisis, the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-law-to-ban-uk-landlords-from-evicting-tenants\">protected people being evicted</a> for non-payment of rent last week.</p> <p>More needs to be done, says Polly Neate, CEO of Shelter. \u201cWe already had people choosing between rent and food. Now, with kids at home, that is going to be even more acute \u2013 they need help now.\u201d</p> <p>But while the situation is critical, it isn\u2019t without hope, says Rick Henderson, CEO of <a href=\"https://www.homeless.org.uk/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIl_mSuNKs6AIVQrTtCh3jqAXnEAAYASAAEgKSMPD_BwE\">Homeless Link</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible, but it will only happen if we take measures that have not been taken out of wartime. We have to take that action now, because if this gets into a 100-bed hostel where people share bathrooms and kitchens, we really are in trouble. The potential impact of it spreading doesn\u2019t bear thinking about.\u201d</p> <p>Many charities the Guardian spoke to said there was political will to tackle the crisis at both a national and local level, a steely determination in the third sector, and compassion in the wider community. On Saturday, Crisis launched the campaign <a href=\"https://www.crisis.org.uk/get-involved/in-this-together/\">In This Together</a> to raise funds to support people who are homeless during the outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe if we manage to find shelter for all who need it in this crisis, we will actually see that a home for all is possible,\u201d said Melissa Kerschen of Glass Door. \u201cIt sounds like a cliche, but our fates are all interlinked, and this crisis is showing us that.\u201d</p> <p>On the streets of Glasgow, Willy simply hopes he will have a roof over his head soon. \u201cI want to get in somewhere, I\u2019m sick of living on the street,\u201d he says. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel safe. I feel very vulnerable right now.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The actor Mark Wahlberg is sitting beside me on a sofa in a Beverly Hills hotel, muscles bulging out of his T-shirt, immaculate white trainers resting on a chair, as he tells me about the aggressive figure ruining his home life. \u201cHe\u2019s angry, he gets violent,\u201d he says, his face full of defeat, even though he\u2019s no stranger to the rough stuff himself, having played countless hard guys in Hollywood movies after serving jail time for assault in his youth. \u201cAnd then he goes to the bathroom right on the floor and wipes himself on the floor,\u201d sighs the man who posed topless with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2014/jan/11/10-best-kate-moss-moments\" title=\"\">Kate Moss in Calvin Klein</a> underwear ads that seemed to cover every London bus in the 90s. \u201cAnd he likes to do that in front of me and then give me a look, like, go pick that up, before he walks out.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Wahlberg, who also starred as the porn star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/aug/16/mark-wahlberg-five-best-moments\" title=\"\">Dirk Diggler</a> in <em>Boogie Nights</em>, but who has now found God and starts every day with prayer, sighs.</p> <p>It must be quite a sight, this bum-wiping, given that we are discussing the Wahlberg family\u2019s Pomeranian dog, who appears, in pictures published on his own Instagram account, to be less than a foot long and made only from fluff and eyes. And given that the floor is that of the Beverly Hills mansion shared by Mark with his wife and four children, which not only has a chapel, a cinema and a pool, but also its own golf course \u2013 what an image it creates in my mind\u2019s eye, this ball of fluff wiping his bum on the floor.</p> <p>Yet I\u2019m confused. Of course, I know that Instagram\u2019s a sham, but every time I\u2019ve seen Mark bellow \u201c<em>Number one Pomeranian on the \u2019gram!</em>\u201d in a video, beseeching his 14.5m followers to look at Champeranian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/champeranian/?hl=en\" title=\"\">own account</a>, I thought the enthusiasm was real. Turns out he\u2019s been doing it under duress from one of his sons, Brendan, \u201cwhose life mission is to get me to post as many things as I can about Champ, and get him as many followers as he can. He\u2019s obsessed with it. It\u2019s starting to become\u2026 a thing.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgKEoHNi3Uc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bgKEoHNi3Uc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>While we\u2019re on the subject of violent antics, I want to talk about Wahlberg\u2019s latest movie, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/06/spenser-confidential-review-mark-wahlberg-netflix\" title=\"\">Spenser Confidential</a></em>, made for Netflix. Wahlberg plays Spenser, a former cop who has served five years in jail for trying to expose his corrupt colleagues, only to get released and find they\u2019re still after him. Directed by Peter Berg, with whom Wahlberg also made <em>Patriots Day</em> and <em>Lone Survivor</em>, the film straddles a border between comedy and action, with the action winning out.</p> <p>Wahlberg is the sort of actor who wants to be absolutely on top of the script. He reads it \u201cthree to four times a day\u201d to \u201creally know where we are, continuity-wise. I like to know what we\u2019re doing and how we\u2019re doing it,\u201d he says, and adds that last sentence firmly, as if he has little patience for messing about. \u201cAt one point, Pete was trying to push the humour, and then we pulled it back a little bit, I think. I think you can get into some trouble, trying too hard for comedy \u2013 it\u2019s just a fine line.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I've made a lot of terrible mistakes \u2013 and paid for them dearly</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s the violence I want to discuss anyway. Wahlberg says that growing up the youngest of nine children in a deprived area of Boston, he was bullied by older brothers, \u201cand when I walked out my door \u2013 violence is also all that was there.\u201d Aged 13, he had an opportunity to join his brother Donnie in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/16/new-kids-on-the-block-hangin-tough-book-series\" title=\"\">New Kids on the Block</a>, a globally successful boy band, but he left after a few months, perhaps inevitably, given that he was already in trouble with the police and addicted to cocaine and other substances. He later found his own music success as Marky Mark, in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO9909uexu8\" title=\"\">Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch</a>, and the acting followed. But of his youth, he stresses: \u201cI was always in trouble, and I was kind of little. In the circumstances where I was being preyed upon, at times, I had to protect and defend myself. It\u2019s not an easy thing to navigate as a teenage kid who\u2019s 5ft 2in, 120lb, with grown men.\u201d</p> <p>It was decades ago now, and clearly not something he wants to discuss for the rest of his life, but there was a racist element to some of his crimes; particularly when, while high on the drug PCP, he assaulted a Vietnamese shopkeeper and used racial slurs against him. Wahlberg served a brief sentence for it; the shopkeeper has since said that he publicly forgives him. I put it to Wahlberg that, if he were a new actor coming up now, with that kind of record, he would or should get cancelled. Hollywood is trying to do the right thing, morally, at the moment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7897840fb6c520c8826767ae13be06a1aaec6e75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7897840fb6c520c8826767ae13be06a1aaec6e75/440_304_4068_2443/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Top marks: starring in Ted with Mila Kunis, which Wahlberg says is his best work.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Top marks: starring in Ted with Mila Kunis, which Wahlberg says is his best work.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d he exhales. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think it would be easy to look at it and say that, but having been through it and experienced it, I think it\u2019s a different thing. You see the gentleman who just came in here?\u201d</p> <p>He is referring to a burly man who just popped in for a goodbye hug, covered in tattoos, and who plays a small role in <em>Spenser Confidential</em>.</p> <p>\u201cHe just did 16 years in prison. OK? He got out and I put him in the movie. That could have easily been my life. Being in a situation like that and having nothing else \u2013 certainly I made a lot of terrible mistakes and I paid for those mistakes dearly.\u201d He says that people often think of being incarcerated as though it\u2019s a badge of honour, \u201cbut having been in that situation, it\u2019s not\u201d. He realised that the only way to change his circumstances was \u201cto actually change them\u201d, and then he \u201cdid the work. I took it upon myself to own up to my mistakes and go against the grain and not be a part of the gang any more \u2013 to say that I was going to go and do my own thing. Which made it 10 times more difficult to walk from my home to the train station, to go to school, to go to work.\u201d</p> <p>So you made yourself more vulnerable? \u201cOh absolutely. But I also prided myself on doing the right thing and turning my life around. Whether I found myself venturing off into Hollywood and a music career, or working a 9-to-5 job as a construction worker, whatever path I was going to take, I was going to do the right thing. So I think no, judging a person on what he\u2019s doing and where he\u2019s coming from and all those things, no, I would hope that people would be able to get a second chance in life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a771f38b7218d14e9e25478d5f6a4e9d56361ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a771f38b7218d14e9e25478d5f6a4e9d56361ce/0_294_2073_1242/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Singer Donnie Wahlberg of New Kids On The Block poses with brother Mark Wahlberg backstage after a circa 1989 concert\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boy band: with his brother Donnie in New Kids On The Block, 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: L Busacca/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There <em>have</em> been benefits from all of this, he says. \u201cI do think the one thing I have to my advantage is that I have all this real life experience that I can apply to my work,\u201d he says. \u201cI think audiences can definitely sense authenticity. But that came with a real price.\u201d</p> <p>So why, then, would he play such violent characters if the very impulse is something he wants to get away from? He has a huge resum\u00e9 of playing boxers, bruisers and bent cops. He won a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for <em>The Departed</em>, directed by Martin Scorsese, in which he plays a killer. And his work as a producer on <em>The Fighter</em> and <em>Boardwalk Empire</em>, with equal amounts of fighting and pain, is also much admired and award-nominated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"83f481b6ac3d5d4303500e5054f6d5d5018c9d2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83f481b6ac3d5d4303500e5054f6d5d5018c9d2d/0_0_845_1255/673.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Wahlberg in an embrace with Kate Moss advertising Calvin Klein.\" width=\"673\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019ve seen her since then and said hello.

(A couple of years ago Wahlberg revealed on <em>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</em> that he had found out that one of his daughters was having private Instagram chats with Will Ferrell\u2019s son Magnus \u2013 Mark was \u201cdisturbed\u201d but then realised, if she was going to be with somebody, it would be good if it was someone who was similar to his friend Will.)</p> <p><em>Boogie Nights </em>made Wahlberg hugely famous, though he has said since that he has some regrets about it, that it doesn\u2019t quite fit in with the Catholicism to which he is now devoted, getting up early every morning to make time for \u201cthe scriptures and my devotionals\u201d, and attending Mass each week. He recently posted an Instagram video of his face with the mark of the cross on it in ash, having attended an Ash Wednesday service in LA. His best work, he says, might just be <em>Ted</em>, the unlikely story of a man who continues into adulthood with his best friend, a talking teddy bear. Yet even that has a fight scene in it \u2013 one which he only lets his kids watch with the sound off, because his character shouts \u201c<em>Teddy </em><em>Rux-fuckin\u2019-pin!</em>\u201d</p> <p>So why, in this holier life, so much fighting? <em>Spenser Confidential</em> is full of the stuff, I say. Wahlberg is confused \u2013 he wonders if I\u2019m bringing this up because I\u2019m English. \u201cI keep trying to remember,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t remember it being all that violent\u2026 Yeah he gets beat up a couple of times, but it\u2019s not like he\u2019s beating everybody up. He\u2019s a relatable guy! He\u2019s not some superhuman. But I know there\u2019s a complete difference between what UK audiences find or deem violent versus the US.\u201d</p> <p>I talk through some of the scenes, such as the one where about eight gangsters come at him with machetes and he despatches them all with his fists, before his friend drives a car through the restaurant wall. There\u2019s the bunch of prisoners he hurls over furniture when they ambush him (one is played by the rapper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/post-malone\" title=\"\">Post Malone</a>), the group of corrupt cops who beat him up, the woman who is murdered, her body thrown into a car boot \u2013 I could go on.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think my kids have been in a real fight \u2013 except with each other</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cRight,\u201d he says, still perplexed, \u201cso there\u2019s just a couple of fights?\u201d</p> <p>If this is where he sets the bar, I\u2019m starting to wonder if the number one Pomeranian on the \u2019gram, whom he does describe as violent, might actually have murdered several people.</p> <p>Yet he insists he\u2019d be interested in a romcom, sure. \u201cI\u2019d be into it!

And it\u2019s my least favourite thing to do. I\u2019ve gotten to the point where I\u2019m not really self-conscious and I\u2019m not scared to look vulnerable, or risk looking ridiculous, but I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d His voice goes very low, quiet, but there\u2019s a grin in it. \u201cI feel ridiculous when I\u2019m dancing and singing.\u201d</p> <p>So no more Marky Mark, and presumably he\u2019s not going to do any more underwear modelling either.

Kind of doing my thing,\u201d he says, his eyes glinting mischievously at the memory of whatever his thing was. \u201cI wasn\u2019t very\u2026 worldly, let\u2019s say that,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cBut I\u2019ve seen her and said hello. I think we saw each other at a concert here and there, we said hi and exchanged pleasantries.\u201d</p> <p>On the subject of women\u2019s bodies, I bring up the fact that we\u2019re in the Four Seasons, where many of the Harvey Weinstein accusations played out. When we meet, Weinstein has just been found guilty of two related charges in a New York court. I ask if everyone in LA is talking about it. \u201cI\u2019ve certainly been paying a lot of attention to what\u2019s been going on with the criminal case and everything,\u201d Wahlberg says. \u201cThere\u2019s finally a lot of closure for a lot of people. But I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m so out of the loop with Hollywood.\u201d</p> <p>Really? But you live right here, just down the road, and you work prolifically in the industry.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but other than working, I go to the supermarket. I don\u2019t go to dinner parties on the scene, or screenings. I live in Beverly Hills, but it could easily be the English countryside, because I don\u2019t see anyone and I don\u2019t do anything. I don\u2019t go to awards unless I have a movie in them.

My son was into boxing for a while, and I was perfectly fine with that because there are disciplines to learn, and I think it\u2019s one of the most difficult but most effective forms of exercise. But no, I didn\u2019t think, like, \u2018Oh my God, if something happens at school you can protect yourself\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s not that kind of school.\u201d</p> <p>When Mark and his brothers get together to retell old stories, Wahlberg\u2019s kids \u201cmake fun of it, like, \u2018oh God here we go, Dad and his street stories, whatever Dad.\u2019 They\u2019re not impressed.

  "<p>Because of the coronavirus, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/california-coronavirus-shelter-in-place-bay-area\">7 million people</a> who live in the San Francisco Bay Area have been one step shy of a full lockdown since Tuesday. Amid all the canceled plans, cratering small businesses and disruptions to everyday life, another poignant postponement stands out: The Names Project Aids Memorial Quilt\u2019s <a href=\"https://aidsmemorial.org/theaidsquilt/\">return to Golden Gate </a><a href=\"https://aidsmemorial.org/theaidsquilt/\">park</a> has been delayed. A viral pandemic, one whose scale we haven\u2019t fully grasped, has interacted with another.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-dr-deborah-birx-hiv-aids\">She's a legend in the fight against HIV. Now Dr Deborah Birx is taking on Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many Americans have drawn parallels between HIV and Covid-19, noting the inept government response, the stigmatization of certain groups and the heroism of frontline health workers. Like a ghoulish reboot of a television show, some of the same people have returned. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-dr-deborah-birx-hiv-aids\">Deborah Birx</a>, a longtime HIV doctor in the US military who later became the United States Global Aids coordinator, now serves as the response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus task force. Anthony Fauci, an immunologist, has been the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984.</p> <p>\u201cWe had another silent epidemic: HIV,\u201d Birx said at a White House press conference on Monday. \u201cAnd I just want to recognize the HIV epidemic was solved by the community: the HIV advocates, and activists who stood up when no one was listening and got everyone\u2019s attention.\u201d</p> <p>Her words are unmistakably direct, but for many, the comparison is a cautionary one. HIV has killed nearly 40 million people worldwide since the early 1980s, roughly 700,000 of the victims were Americans \u2013 almost 20,000 of them in San Francisco. The coronavirus has not proven nearly as lethal. Contracting it is certainly not the death sentence that HIV was for so many years, and some advocates are reluctant to push the analogy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"83a11d3471e40ef0f00ee859218acd30a1dd2f88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83a11d3471e40ef0f00ee859218acd30a1dd2f88/47_387_2825_1694/1000.jpg\" alt=\"HIV has killed nearly 40 million people worldwide since the early 1980s, almost 20,000 of them in San Francisco.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">HIV has killed nearly 40 million people worldwide since the early 1980s, almost 20,000 of them in San Francisco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Read/Fairfax Media via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey\u2019re both viruses, obviously, and there are some overlapping parts of this that obviously can be compared,\u201d says John Cunningham, the executive director of the National Aids Memorial in San Francisco, which had been set to debut the quilt in early April, for Golden Gate park\u2019s 150th anniversary. \u201cBut in totality, I would never want to draw that direct comparison. That being said, the National Aids Memorial and the Aids Quilt take very seriously our responsibility to share the stories of the epidemic and the stories of a tragic virus that befell a community.\u201d</p> <p>That the Bay Area is a focal point in both epidemics is not lost on longtime Aids activist Cleve Jones. When the city of San Francisco got involved in the fight against HIV, it was spending more than the federal government was, he says.</p> <p>\u201cThe most glaringly obvious similarity is that both pandemics began with Republican administrations and a Republican president who did not acknowledge the gravity of the situation,\u201d Jones says. \u201cAnd the failure of a strong early response led to tragic consequences.\u201d</p> <p>The similarities extend to nomenclature. In the early days, before the term \u201cacquired immunodeficiency disease\u201d, Aids was known as Grid, for \u201cgay-related immune deficiency\u201d \u2013 when it wasn\u2019t simply called the \u201cgay cancer\u201d or the \u201cgay plague\u201d, that is. When Donald Trump insists on tweeting about the \u201cChinese virus\u201d, he claims to be playing tit-for-tat with Communist party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/conspiracy-theory-that-coronavirus-originated-in-us-gaining-traction-in-china\">propaganda that the virus is of U</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/conspiracy-theory-that-coronavirus-originated-in-us-gaining-traction-in-china\">S</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/conspiracy-theory-that-coronavirus-originated-in-us-gaining-traction-in-china\"> origin</a>. But it ignores the dangers of scapegoating in a time of panic.</p> <p>Racist tropes, like homophobic stigma 35 years ago, can also inspire false confidence in groups who presume they won\u2019t be affected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CleveJones1/status/1238256075910062080\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/x3WhkmPcKE\">pic.twitter.com/x3WhkmPcKE</a></p>&mdash; Cleve Jones (@CleveJones1) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CleveJones1/status/1238256075910062080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 13, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cIn the early days of the Aids epidemic we were told it only affected gay people,\u201d Jones says, \u201cthe result of which was the death of tens of millions of heterosexual men, women and their children\u201d.</p> <p>But before the millions of residents in the six-county Bay Area were told to shelter in place, a meme had spread far and wide among LGBTQ+ Americans. It has two panels, upper and lower. The upper one reads, \u201cStraights: I can\u2019t believe the government would just ignore an epidemic that threatens thousands of lives.\u201d The lower panel reads, \u201cGays: You don\u2019t say...\u201d superimposed over a picture of the Aids Memorial Quilt spread out over the National Mall in Washington DC.</p> <p>It\u2019s a bit harsh and oversimplified, maybe. But the question it presupposes is a valid one in a region on near-lockdown \u2013 because for some people, HIV and coronavirus aren\u2019t separate at all. The fear among long-term survivors of HIV/Aids is potent, according to Dr Lary Abramson, a retired San Francisco physician who treated patients during that epidemic\u2019s early phases.</p> <p>\u201cI can tell you that the people I know who are currently on meds for HIV, who have survived our plague, are taking extreme precautions,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to get anywhere near this coronavirus and are doing all they can to follow the guidelines the NIH is promulgating.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dadff0d84d96f5c96d93fe2db6d964ce38a9a9dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dadff0d84d96f5c96d93fe2db6d964ce38a9a9dc/0_117_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A lone rose sits at the World Aids Day Ceremony at the National Aids Memorial Grove in Golden Gate park on 1 December 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lone rose sits at the World Aids Day Ceremony at the National Aids Memorial Grove in Golden Gate park on 1 December 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Paul Morris/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For younger generations, the instinct is essentially the opposite: to come together in tough times. Even though social acceptance of LGBTQ+ people has arguably never been higher, queer people reflexively seek refuge in queer spaces. Juanita MORE!, a well-known San Francisco drag performer whose parties have raised tens of thousands of dollars for various LGBTQ+ causes, has to balance her advocacy for nightlife against a consistent message of \u201cStay the fuck home!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs a mother to so many people in San Francisco, I have noticed that a lot of people are having a hard time \u2013 and did all the way up until the quarantine was instated \u2013 staying in,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we were in that first year of the Aids crisis, that was also hard for a lot of people, and the reason was that everyone had just come to San Francisco. They had just gotten free and come out, and were told again they couldn\u2019t. Those comparisons, to me, are the same.\u201d</p> <p>As of Thursday, some 70 San Franciscans have tested positive for coronavirus, while approximately 15,000 are living with HIV. For Cunningham of the National Aids Memorial, the trauma lingers.</p> <p>\u201cI lived in the Castro during the darkest days of the epidemic,\u201d Cunningham says, referring to San Francisco\u2019s famous gay neighborhood. \u201cAnd since Covid-19 came upon the scene, there has been a building wave of emotion inside of me and others. I\u2019ve had many conversations and it\u2019s bringing up a lot of unresolved grief and anger.\u201d</p> <p>But, he says, the noble impulse to help one another \u2013 within the strictures of a shelter-in-place order \u2013 are a welcome parallel between HIV and the coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cWhat gave hope and galvanized individuals to step forward out of what was a tragedy, with the discrimination and prejudice and the lack of a response from the government, we saw some of the best in humanity. We saw neighbors helping neighbors. \u2026 Some of the best examples of what it means to be a community were born there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"abd0b3f7593f000bb6292acff866073d3178dad1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abd0b3f7593f000bb6292acff866073d3178dad1/0_167_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump speaks during a news conference with Mike Pompeo, Mike Pence, Dr Deborah Birx and Dr Anthony Fauci.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump speaks during a news conference with Mike Pompeo, Mike Pence, Dr Deborah Birx and Dr Anthony Fauci.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If people can\u2019t feed one another, we can always check in with a phone call or by Zoom. Regarding public-health leadership under a conservative Republican presidential administration, Cunningham observes that it\u2019s \u201cironic that two of our heroes, Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, were there in the days of the Aids crisis and are here today\u201d.</p> <p>Jones notes the surreality of their presence as well.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things that almost every longtime survivor I know has commented on is how eerie it is to see them up there smiling and nodding while this fool blathers on,\u201d he says. \u201cOne can only imagine what is going on inside their head. I think both of them are, every day, probably laying out the degrees of harm: If they were to overly criticize Trump, they would be fired.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, Fauci has been conspicuously effusive in his praise for the president. But for nurses at Zuckerberg San Francisco general hospital like Sasha Cuttler, the reassuring presence of capable figures at the top doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into an adequate response on the ground. There, too, a resemblance to the Aids crisis years is unsettling.</p> <p>\u201cWhat strikes me is the casual disregard of the voice of nurses and others on the frontlines. That [comparison] is not off at all,\u201d Cuttler says, adding that they\u2019ve been removed from field nursing in retaliation for speaking with the media about a lack of urgency and coordination in testing for Covid-19.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"88841707ce18084d1ec84debf457febd672991e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88841707ce18084d1ec84debf457febd672991e2/0_42_1006_604/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People march down San Francisco\u2019s Market Street for the 10th international Aids candlelight march in 1993.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People march down San Francisco\u2019s Market Street for the 10th international Aids candlelight march in 1993.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Poroy/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As it was with Aids patients during the 1980s at the hospital\u2019s experimental and nurse-led <a href=\"https://ari.ucsf.edu/clinical-care/ward-86\">Ward 86</a>, the frontline caregivers are \u201cpredominantly women and queer people\u201d, Cuttler adds. \u201cAnd we\u2019re doing it with love and caring, making it clear to the patients that we do this job because it\u2019s our job \u2013 and we\u2019re not afraid of them or judging them. Both epidemics are used to blame people for their own illness and doing something bad to spread it.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, misinformation has continued unabated, much of it from prominent voices. Displaying considerable ignorance of why residents of the Bay Area were urged to remain at home \u2013 and of how contemporary HIV medications work \u2013 the conservative commentator Mark Steyn remarked on Rush Limbaugh\u2019s show that \u201cIt\u2019s a big gay town, San Francisco, and they\u2019re the ones with all the compromised immune systems from all the protease inhibitors and all the other stuff. And they don\u2019t want all the gays dropping dead on the San Francisco mayor\u2019s watch.\u201d</p> <p>Those words could have been uttered on Tuesday, or on any given Tuesday in 1986.</p>",
  "<p>\u2018You\u2019re not bringing that into the house,\u2019 she said. \u2018Just hang on,\u2019 I replied, letting my wife take the pram as I got on my haunches. I was inspecting a motorised toy car that had been left out on the street. It was the kind your child can sit in as you operate it by remote control, like some sort of playboy millionaire, intent on ruining the day of all the lowly serfs you overtake at 0.05mph. \u2018It\u2019s beautiful,\u2019 I said, of the clearly broken ride-a-long car that was being offered up to any passing deal hound who had space in their heart for a taste of the high life.</p> <p>My wife was right to say it had seen better days. At 20 months old, our son wouldn\u2019t be that safe in it to begin with, even if it didn\u2019t have exposed wires, a wobbly seat and wonky headlamps. There was also the fact that a full night and day outside meant it had almost certainly been exposed to the damaging effects of rain and/or fox wee.</p> <p>Not that I was dissuaded. Perhaps my wife was inured to its charms because she doesn\u2019t peruse the glossy pages of each year\u2019s Argos catalogue as if it was a holy document. If she had, she\u2019d remember these cars cost \u00a3999 (down from an RRP of \u00a31,299) when I was a boy. They were the kind of thing you saw on the <em>Late Late Toy Show</em>, or in movies about kids who\u2019d won the lottery.</p> <p>Some light Googling reveals that prices have gone down in the 30 years since I first circled it in the 1992 toy catalogue and showed it to my dad, prompting him to laugh in my face as if I\u2019d just asked him to buy me a football stadium. I was getting the flush of endorphins I first experienced all those decades ago at the thought that my son could be that obnoxious Richie Rich I had always dreamed of being.</p> <p>It\u2019s a hoary old trope that parents want their children to have those things they couldn\u2019t have themselves. Usually we lie and say that means education and self-confidence, etc, but I now realise I also meant a little motorised car you can ride around in like a fancy prince. Since my wife was still unmoved, I told her that my going back and picking it up off the street could make for a good column. She rolled her eyes as she walked off, which I took to be consent.</p> <p>When I doubled back later that evening, I saw all the more sub-optimal things about taking a giant broken toy car in from the street. The exposed wires I would have no idea how to fix, the sheer improbability of us having anywhere to put it, the vague whiff of animal urine, and the inevitability of my claiming I\u2019d mend it, only to realise I\u2019d never intended to make it work \u2013 I simply wanted to make it mine.</p> <p>Confronted with reality, the bloom had fallen off the rose. Some dreams, however beautiful, should be left to 30-year-old toy catalogues. And if they get sprayed with fox wee, the pages are laminated so you can just wipe it off.</p> <p><em>Follow S\u00e9amas on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shockproofbeats?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@shockproofbeats</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Images of empty museums, cinemas, concert halls and galleries across the country are quickly becoming emblems of our changing life. And this weekend there is fresh speculation that the world\u2019s biggest arts festival in Edinburgh will not take place this August.</p> <p>The end of live performance and public cultural activity is one of the most comprehensive of the myriad shocks to the British economy, as well as to a sense of normality. Theatre doors were closed by a puritanical English regime in 1642, but this total shutdown covers every form of shared entertainment and built heritage. And what now worries the country\u2019s arts institutions is how this world-beating resource can be protected during lockdown.</p> <p>The lights began to go out in the West End of London last Monday when the prime minister classed theatres and cinemas among places to avoid. The Old Vic, where Daniel Radcliffe was starring, reluctantly brought down the curtain first.</p> <p>Almost every other production and solo show in the land followed. From the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-on-Avon and the opera house in Covent Garden to a popular touring production of Helen Forrester\u2019s work <em>By the Waters of Liverpool</em>, the news was the same. The sentiments of Rob Fennah, this new show\u2019s writer and co-producer, were typical: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let this get the better of us. We will relaunch early next year, bigger, bolder and as glorious as ever!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>As Boris Johnson was speaking, almost a week ago, thousands of actors, musicians and comedians were still preparing to perform. At London\u2019s small and unsubsidised Jermyn Street Theatre, a highly acclaimed new production of Shakespeare\u2019s <em>The Tempest</em>, with veteran star Michael Pennington, went on with the director reading a part played by an actor who had suddenly been put into isolation by new symptoms. On Tuesday, a final performance was filmed without an audience. In Eastbourne, the cast of Alan Bennett\u2019s <em>The Habit of Art</em>, starring Matthew Kelly, swiftly organised a similar filmed performance on Wednesday. The actors did not want to walk away without a record.</p> <p>From self-isolation, Melvyn Bragg told the <em>Observer</em> it would be difficult for artists to boost general morale, as Myra Hess did during the war by playing piano in the National Gallery. \u201cIt is much worse than what we know of the blitz, sadly,\u201d said Lord Bragg. \u201cTheatres did not all shut in the blitz. This is a different thing altogether because performers are endangering everyone.\u201d</p> <p>The government\u2019s initial advice to the public prompted anger from many commentators.The playwright Lucy Prebble said that it was unfair to leave the decision up to imperilled arts companies and venues. \u201cWhat a dereliction of duty,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lucyprebblish/status/1239608334845652992\" title=\"\">she argued on Twitter</a>, \u201cto pass on the decision to confused small business owners, performers and consumers.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7097e5d08945ebca2bdeb8cdb45158698022c777\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7097e5d08945ebca2bdeb8cdb45158698022c777/0_0_5906_3544/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two visitors look over the gate of Anne Hathaway\u2019s cottage in Straford-on-Avon, now closed to the public.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two visitors look over the gate of Anne Hathaway\u2019s cottage in Straford-on-Avon, now closed to the public.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Society of London Theatre, having been forced to cancel the Olivier awards, spoke on Friday on behalf of the major booking companies to reassure those with tickets.

Supporting cast and stage crew have nowhere to look for work.

Suspension of the universal credit minimum income floor and tax deferrals are a drop in the ocean compared to the losses experienced by our members, and fall far short of the support available to workers elsewhere in the economy.</p> <p>\u201cWe will fight on to put the case for our members who have provided billions in revenue for the UK but are not being protected in their hour of need.\u201d\u200b</p> <p>Last week saw the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/18/glastonbury-festival-postponed-due-to-coronavirus\" title=\"\">cancellation of Glastonbury\u2019s 50th anniversary </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/18/glastonbury-festival-postponed-due-to-coronavirus\" title=\"\">festival</a>, with headliners Paul McCartney and Taylor Swift asked to bide their time. Deposits already paid by fans were rolled over for a year. Eurovision is also over before it began. Yet both rock and classical musicians, denied access to an audience, have been among the first to react by trying to reach the public online.</p> <p>Singers including Rufus Wainwright have been posting solo performances recorded at home for fans, and on Friday the London Symphony Orchestra released details of Always Playing, <a href=\"https://www.lso.co.uk/whats-on/2019-20-season/alwaysplaying.html\" title=\"\">a digital programme of concerts</a> which will be streamed free on the LSO YouTube channel this month and next, replacing its scheduled performances at the Barbican in London. The Royal Opera House has also unveiled a selection of free ballets and operas available on its Facebook and YouTube channels.</p> <p>Perhaps the most unnerving cultural news for the wider population has been the production paralysis of filmed and televised drama, mainstays of the national conversation. Continuing series such as the BBC\u2019s <em>EastEnders </em>and <em>Holby</em>, and Channel 4\u2019s <em>Hollyoaks</em>, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/bbc-suspends-filming-of-eastenders-due-to-coronavirus\" title=\"\">either been paused or scaled down</a>.

But much of the entertainment impact will not be felt until next year, as filming of hit returning drama series including the BBC\u2019s <em>Peaky Blinders</em> and Netflix\u2019s <em>The Crown </em>and <em>Stranger Things</em>, has all halted, in addition to all major movie productions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f86f0e9289501b8a9fbf168718f075ce3cf12bce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f86f0e9289501b8a9fbf168718f075ce3cf12bce/0_0_4500_2699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"South Bank outside the Tate Modern gallery with one cyclist going past\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A near-deserted South Bank outside the Tate Modern gallery in London last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Harvey/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Warner Brothers has suspended production on <em>The Batman</em> while another Disney live-action remake, <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, is now waiting indefinitely in the wings.

The showcase on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur has been shifted back to high summer at the earliest. In London, the British Film Institute\u2019s Flare festival was also cancelled, although hopes that the main film festival can go ahead in October have survived. Also on the upside, several distributors are now releasing major films straight to streaming services. The new version of Jane Austen\u2019s <em>Emma</em> and the sci-fi thriller <em>The Invisible Man, </em>both released in cinemas just three weeks ago, will be available on the small screen this week.</p> <p>Even the world of books has been affected, with the cancellation of the Hay festival. The annual event makes more than \u00a320m for its host, Hay-on-Wye, but organisers have said they believe that skipping a year means its existence is threatened. Making an appeal for donations, Peter Florence, the director of Hay, said: \u201cAs we face these coming weeks of uncertainty and isolation we will work hard to carry forward our spirit of togetherness, and to share stories and ideas.\u201d</p> <p>In the early stages of this crisis, the arts have become more than a symbol of national pain: they are a way to respond and to communicate, as well as a welcome distraction.</p> <p>Before performers and companies could check whether the chancellor\u2019s new measures would help them, many were offering to perform online. Actors Samuel West and Lisa Dwan will read out requested work, while artists and music teachers have set up lessons. Book and film clubs have gone virtual.</p> <p>The BBC is to broadcast Culture in Quarantine, a virtual festival of the arts. The corporation\u2019s head of arts, Jonty Claypole, explained: \u201cFor me, a precious ray of sunshine has emerged in the clear determination of artists, performers, curators and producers to keep creating and connecting with audiences.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Arts venues put life on hold</strong></h2> <h2><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ca0679326b1eb83c026fb16d837081bbc93ab87b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca0679326b1eb83c026fb16d837081bbc93ab87b/1763_118_576_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Tristram Hunt\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tristram Hunt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Young/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Tristram Hunt</strong><br><em>V&amp;A director</em><br>We all feel great sorrow. Our cultural role in civic society has had the rug pulled out from under it. But we had to respond to the dramatic escalation this week. There had been no clear message from government, but this situation is so hard and we\u2019ve not had sight of the information the advisers are seeing, nor of what the consequences are. And, of course, we are an arms\u2019 length national body and we normally like that. Initially we thought we had until the end of last week, so we operated a 50/50 system, with half the staff going in on alternate days, but we closed on Wednesday after the prime minister\u2019s announcement. Since then I\u2019ve been in meetings with our estates management team working out how to secure and look after this 160-year-old building and ensure the safety of a collection that belongs to everybody. Things are changing every day so we are constantly catching up. Staff are understandably anxious and full of confusion so the job was to try to be clear. We have made no redundancies, but we have had to work through our contractual obligations with events management and that kind of thingand the like.</p> <p>We are dealing with set designers and lighting designers, people who we don\u2019t want to leave in the lurch. Our caterers and cleaners are part of large outside organisations which should be fairly stable I hope.</p> <p>We are now looking at giving more access to the collection online.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5ea6ed7c8250bedd7b56ccd5c1eafa83a6b06e0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ea6ed7c8250bedd7b56ccd5c1eafa83a6b06e0d/1016_76_645_645/500.jpg\" alt=\"Catherine Mallyon.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catherine Mallyon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fiona Goodall/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Catherine Mallyon</strong><br><em>RSC executive director</em><br>Actors do live with uncertainty, like many other freelancers, but that is in the context of there being other work out there in the West End, or in regional theatre or on telly. This situation is materially different. We are like a family in a way, because actors are with the company for such a long time. So they have that support network and we have offered more, largely online.</p> <p>At Christmas our planners picked up on news of the spread of the virus and so we increased hygiene immediately. We thought we were likely to have to suspend, but we were not prepared for the sudden nature of it. On a day when there were performances at 7pm, 5.30pm was difficult.</p> <p>Now we are working around the clock to protect people and let them know what is happening, as we know it. We\u2019ve given a reassurance we won\u2019t leave anyone who was working unpaid. But we can\u2019t do this for an unlimited length of time. We will work in staging posts towards reopening. We could take out a loan, but we wouldn\u2019t have any income to repay it with after a certain point. It is going to have a huge effect on the whole economy of Stratford.</p> <p>Our digital content is going to be available to schools and we want to revive the shows that were in rehearsal, <em>The Winter\u2019s Tale</em> and <em>A Comedy of Errors</em>. We hope we have not lost them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d06d57327e3a1fed27a85acccebab482268b7bfb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d06d57327e3a1fed27a85acccebab482268b7bfb/466_123_2301_2301/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kwame Kwei-Armah.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kwame Kwei-Armah.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Wooller/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Kwame Kwei-Armah</strong><br><em>Young Vic artistic director</em><br>I did have a little cry on Tuesday.

We have told staff we will meet our payroll obligations, including to front-of-house staff, and look after our freelancers.</p> <p>No one knows how long this coronavirus pandemic will last, but we are looking at planning for three months to start with. We have closed down some of our discretionary expenditure straight away and sadly on Friday we closed down the building.</p> <p>We had wanted to keep it open as a place for people to come, and so we spaced out the seating and gave away free tea and coffee.</p> <p>We have modelled this now, so we can do it again in the future when it is needed.</p> <p>We have mothballed the premiere of our house music opera, <em>Orfeus</em>, and are looking for ways to bring it back, as well as to see if the production of <em>Second Woman</em>, which was to be part of the cancelled Lift festival, can come back.</p> <p>Our core mission is about gathering people and so we are going to try to do that digitally now, if we can\u2019t do it physically any more.</p>",

It\u2019s phenomenal. Even though the stories cover different eras and places, her ability to form such solid characters really spoke to me as a woman of colour. And because the stories were set in England, it felt really close to home. She tackles so many of the challenges that women face today but in a beautiful non-cliche way. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/27/bernardine-evaristo-girl-woman-other-interview\" title=\"\">She\u2019s a professor at Brunel</a> \u2014 that\u2019s where I went to university - and I felt a moment of pride.</p> <h2>2.

Jodie Turner-Smith is the star and is a new face in acting. It\u2019s nice to see someone being given the chance to shine. I love how the film explored the romance between men and women. Women are moving forward in major ways and don\u2019t need what we used to from men because we have our own independence. But I love that the film explores this idea of letting go of the ego.

  "<p>Discomfort is putting it mildly. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/07/shock-of-new-novelists-stories-europe\" title=\"\">Marieke Lucas Rijneveld</a>\u2019s debut novel, which has been longlisted for the International Booker prize, goes all the way to disturbing. A bestseller in the 28-year-old\u2019s native Netherlands, the book begins with a 10-year-old girl, Jas, feeling angry at not being allowed to go ice-skating with her brother Matthies and wishing he would die instead of her rabbit (she fears her unsentimental dairy-farming father has his eye on the pet for dinner).</p> <p>And then her brother does die, falling through the ice.</p> <p>What follows is an unflinching study of a family falling apart in the madness of grief, rendered all the more unnerving for the childishly plain, undramatic way their compulsive behaviours are reported. They are further tested by the arrival of foot-and-mouth disease on the farm (the book is set around the 2001 outbreak), necessitating the slaughter of their beloved cows.</p> <p>Jas\u2019s family are strict Christians \u2013 a background shared with Rijneveld, who still works on a dairy farm. The non-binary author has talked about growing up with a sense of a \u201cthreatening, cruel God\u201d \u2013 and also losing a brother at a young age, which the family barely discussed. Suffering in silence is the fictionalised family\u2019s response too. \u201cWe only knew about the harvest that came from the land, not about the things that grew inside ourselves,\u201d Jas says.</p> <p>Even before Matthies\u2019s death, the parents are pious to the point of punitive; bodily functions are a source of shame. Afterwards, it\u2019s as if teachings about sin, penance and the corporeal become painfully snarled up with the family\u2019s loss, and their desperate attempts to control or master it.</p> <p>Jas refuses to take off her increasingly disgusting red coat, keeps a drawing pin stuck in her belly button and develops chronic constipation (this matter-of-fact scatological novel is not for the squeamish). Her brother, Obbe, obsessively bashes his head on his bedframe and starts killing animals, while her mother refuses to eat an ever-growing list of certain foods.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rijneveld pokes sticky fingers into nasty places to stir up uneasy prepubescent memories</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Throughout <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-discomfort-of-evening-9780571349364.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Discomfort of Evening</em></a> characters test the limits of bodily boundaries \u2013 their own, and others. Jas\u2019s father shoves soap up her bum to make her poo; her sister sticks her tongue in Jas\u2019s mouth, like \u201ca leftover steak that Mum\u2019s warmed up in the microwave\u201d. There\u2019s a particularly unpleasant scene featuring a metal artificial insemination gun going into a hole it was never intended for.</p> <p>Rijneveld really doesn\u2019t hold back with all this, poking sticky fingers into nasty places to stir up uneasy memories of prepubescent explorations of sexuality and mortality. The novel evokes a general curiosity and bewilderment with the adult world, here given two supercharged shots in the backside by the unspeakable (in all senses) tragedy of the brother\u2019s death and the pressure of extreme religious beliefs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/07/shock-of-new-novelists-stories-europe\">'My family are too frightened to read my book': meet Europe's most exciting authors</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Translated by Michele Hutchison, Rijneveld\u2019s writing is raw and impassive, though often grotesquely vivid in its descriptions. Skinned knuckles look like \u201cruptured prawns\u2019 heads\u201d; bits of wet crisp at the swimming pool \u201cstick to your feet like blisters\u201d. Jas has a singular imagination, too: she pictures her dead granny\u2019s face \u201cbeginning to ooze eggnog as thin as yolk\u201d out of eye sockets and pores.</p> <p>Not everything works: Rijneveld seems to strain in search of an ending. Jas\u2019s conviction that her mum is hiding Jews in the basement seems less plausible than most of her delusions and rather underdeveloped. (Apparently, the Dutch version also contained a joke deemed too offensive for British publication \u2013 removing it seems a strange choice, serving only to inflame an imagination already given a good stoking by Rijneveld.)</p> <p>But this is a pretty remarkable debut.

  "<p>In a crisis, a society often reveals both its best aspects and its worst. So it is with Covid-19. On the one hand there is the selfishness of hoarding, on the other the selflessness of <a href=\"https://covidmutualaid.org/local-groups/\" title=\"\">mutual aid groups</a>. On the one hand, there is Britannia Hotels, which has not just sacked staff but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/21/scottish-hotel-admin-error-sacking-staff-covid-19\" title=\"\">evicted them</a> from their accommodation (a stance it now appears to have reversed under public pressure), on the other the footballer-turned-hotel-owner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-gary-neville-says-nhs-staff-will-stay-at-his-hotels-for-free-video\" title=\"\">Gary Neville</a>, who has promised to pay wages to all employees through the pandemic while also providing accommodation free of charge to NHS staff. On the one hand, there are medics and paramedics working heroically with inadequate protective equipment, on the other the Home Office using the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/28/scrap-625-pound-surcharge-for-nhs-ovserseas-staff\" title=\"\">health surcharge</a>\u201d to extort money from foreign doctors for the right to make use of the same health service they are helping to sustain.</p> \n<p>In a crisis, too, issues that policymakers have long ignored suddenly become urgent. The pandemic has laid bare the insecurity of work, the cruelty of welfare policy, the hypocrisy of a system in which every time a crisis hits we are told that \u201cwe\u2019re all in it together\u201d but in which, before and after the crisis, the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable are largely ignored.</p> \n<p>The economic burden imposed by the policy of social distancing has <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/doing-what-it-takes/\" title=\"\">fallen most upon the poorest</a> and the lowest paid, many of whom cannot work from home and have few savings on which to fall back. In response, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, unveiled on Friday a major package of measures, including grants to businesses covering up to 80% of employees\u2019 wages, and increases to universal credit and working tax credits.</p> \n<p>The measures are significant, necessary and welcome. There are holes in the package, especially for renters and the self-employed. Nevertheless, Sunak was right to call it \u201cunprecedented\u201d. But it also raises the question: why does it require a pandemic for the needs of low-paid and insecure workers to be taken seriously?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e8a5d369-ef41-4b4a-adf8-f34313e47e32\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;<b>stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.<br></p>\n    <p>If you live with other people,&nbsp;<b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p>After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine.

But what the pandemic has really exposed are the inadequacies of successive governments\u2019 responses to low pay and poverty. And while it might seem like carping to be critical at this time, there are deeper questions that need asking about policy as it has evolved over many years.</p> \n<p>With the coming of the pandemic, policymakers have suddenly discovered that those normally consigned to the margins of the labour force as \u201cunskilled workers\u201d are crucially important to the functioning of society. Cleaners, shopkeepers, delivery drivers \u2013 these are the people, often migrants or women, on whose invisible labour society depends, but whose efforts are usually treated with contempt. The government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-maintaining-educational-provision/guidance-for-schools-colleges-and-local-authorities-on-maintaining-educational-provision\" title=\"\">list of \u201ckey workers\u201d</a> is a list largely of jobs in which workers get paid derisory sums for doing vital work. \u201cLow-skilled\u201d has become as much a measure of moral worth as a job description.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Politicians and policy-makers have long accepted what is effectively state-sanctioned poverty within our benefits system</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The impact of the pandemic has also led people to notice that statutory sick pay is just <a href=\"https://fmpglobal.co.uk/resources/useful-info/statutory-sick-pay-ssp/\" title=\"\">\u00a394.25 a week</a>. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, admitted on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000ggsk/question-time-2020-19032020\" title=\"\">BBC\u2019s <em>Question Time</em></a> that he could not live on that. \u201cBut you expect others to live on it,\u201d Fiona Bruce observed. And even that meagre sum is not available to two million lower-paid workers, those on zero-hour contracts or the self-employed. The problem of inadequate sick pay has existed for years without policymakers taking much notice. Not being able to afford to go sick may particularly be a problem in a pandemic, but it\u2019s a dilemma that has long confronted thousands of self-employed and gig-economy workers.</p> \n<p>Nor is the issue just sick pay. As the Resolution Foundation\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2020/03/government-policies-support-low-income-sick-pay\" title=\"\">Torsten Bell has pointed out</a>, unemployment benefits are worth less in real terms now than they were in the early 1990s. Jobseeker\u2019s allowance and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance/what-youll-get\" title=\"\">employment and support allowance for the disabled</a> stand at just \u00a373.10 a week if you\u2019re 25 or over \u2013 and \u00a357.90 if you\u2019re under 25. Carers\u2019 allowance, for those who spend at least 35 hours a week looking after someone disabled, is a scandalous \u00a366.15 a week. Politicians and policymakers have long accepted what is effectively state-sanctioned poverty within our benefits system.</p> \n<p>Successive governments from the 1980s on have stigmatised claimants and made the welfare system harsh and mean-minded. In parliament last week, Iain Duncan Smith, the architect of the disaster that is universal credit, warned the government against the introduction of any form of universal basic income, as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-uk-update-universal-basic-income-iain-duncan-smith-a9411251.html\" title=\"\">disincentive to work</a>\u201d. There are reasonable arguments for and against UBI. But the claim about \u201cdisincentives to work\u201d has too often been used as a means to cut benefits to the bare bones, and was, in fact, central to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/sep/15/iain-duncan-smith-welfare-reform\" title=\"\">Duncan Smith\u2019s rationale</a> for universal credit, turning what could have been a reasonable reorganisation of the benefit system into a punitive one.</p> \n<p>And then there is the issue of private renters. The government has announced a three-month delay in landlords being able to enforce evictions. For those who have lost wages or their jobs, that is merely to defer rather than to eliminate the problem. As with low pay and benefits, the issue is a longstanding one. Many studies have shown <a href=\"http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/207796/\" title=\"\">the relationship </a>between private renting and poverty, the inability of <a href=\"https://www4.shu.ac.uk/research/cresr/sites/shu.ac.uk/files/tackling-poverty-housing-planning-city-regions.pdf\" title=\"\">working families on low wages</a> to rent in many parts of the country, and the fear of eviction and homelessness, even in normal times. The pandemic has not created the predicament, it is simply exacerbating a pre-existing problem.</p> \n<p>Coronavirus has exposed the fragility of social life. It has revealed, too, that a large measure of that fragility is the result not of the pandemic, or of the attempt to combat it, but rather has been built into the system through deliberate policy. The worry is that beyond the pandemic, and the temporary measures announced by the chancellor, the issues of poverty and inequality will once more be ignored.</p> \n<p>The 2008 financial crisis was resolved with vast amounts of public cash. And then the public was made to pay for that generosity with a decade of austerity. We may need to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to bring the pandemic under control. But once it is under control, will we also then do whatever it takes to deal with low pay, insecure work and inadequate benefits?</p> \n<p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",

The redesigned buildings \u2013 due to be officially opened later this year \u2013 include London\u2019s newest state-of-the art concert halls and a museum featuring more than 15,000 treasures, including the world\u2019s oldest guitar. Professor Colin Lawson, the RCM\u2019s director, told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cPeople have walked past here without really knowing whether they\u2019re allowed in or not. It was pretty forbidding at one time. The redesign is all about opening up everything.\u201d</p> <p>As part of the makeover, a disused courtyard in South Kensington has become a vast, light-filled conservatory that leads off to two concert halls and a museum, as well as dozens of additional practice rooms, recording and digital facilities and a large cafe where recitals will also be staged.</p> <p>A glorified 1960s hut that used to house the museum has been demolished. The RCM can now do justice to its collection, which covers music-making over more than five centuries, from the earliest stringed keyboard instrument (a 1480s clavicytherium) to Mozart\u2019s score for his Piano Concerto No 24 in C minor, complete with his doodles in the margin. Through headphones, interactive displays will allow visitors to hear the music. Lawson said that, although the Victorian-era design had been \u201cfantastic\u201d, \u201call kinds of social interaction\u201d had now become possible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5cc4ec282c1abd511d99947bd5249a7b2df5fa9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5cc4ec282c1abd511d99947bd5249a7b2df5fa9a/0_294_3712_4640/800.jpg\" alt=\"Andrea Bocelli.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrea Bocelli.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniele Venturelli/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The RCM was founded in 1882 by the then Prince of Wales, later Edward VII. Its alumni include the composer Gustav Holst, the conductor Sir Colin Davis, and the flautist Sir James Galway. Today it trains around 800 students from 55 countries. In 2019, it was ranked as the UK\u2019s top institution for the performing arts in the QS World University Rankings. \u201cIn 2020, we\u2019re also number one in Europe and number two in the world,\u201d Lawson said.</p> <p>The public is already able to attend concerts and masterclasses, but the new buildings will increase access and expand programmes, mostly with free entry.</p> <p>Masterclasses are by international stars such as Maxim Vengerov, the violin virtuoso.</p> <p>Lawson said: \u201cThe thing about a Vengerov masterclass is that the students sound absolutely wonderful until he picks up the violin and then suddenly \u2018wow, this is what\u2019s possible\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Transforming the RCM\u2019s Grade&nbsp;II-listed home has taken two-and-a-half years in a project headed by John Simpson, whose work on historic buildings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,1169,719009,00.html\" title=\"\">includes the Queen\u2019s Gallery</a> at Buckingham Palace.</p> <p>He is a favourite architect of Prince Charles, president of the RCM\u2019s fundraising campaign, which has seen one of its biggest investments. Bocelli is among those who have donated money, along with the National Lottery Heritage Fund, trusts and foundations.</p> <p>Simpson\u2019s approach uses updated traditional forms to respond to contemporary requirements. He has done exactly that at the RCM, with light and airy spaces. Joanna Wachowiak, director of John Simpson Architects, said: \u201cThe idea was to provide space for people to practise, space for people to eat and congregate, space for audiences to come and space to teach.\u201d</p> <p>The RCM says that the performance hall and studio \u2013 seating 150 and 90, respectively \u2013 have been designed for the highest standards of music-making with the most sophisticated technology. A beautiful white lattice-work decorates the hall\u2019s walls, but serves a purpose that goes beyond the aesthetic, namely \u201csound-scattering\u201d. The walls incorporate sound-absorbent banners, which can be adjusted to suit different types of performance, while advanced air-handling and climate-control enable the most delicate instruments from the museum to be played. \u201cEvery bit of the design or decoration has a purpose,\u201d said Simpson.</p> <p>Fundraising continues, partly for scholarships. Up to 70% of RCM students receive some support.</p> <p>Lawson said: \u201cWhen the college opened, the future king was proud of the fact that the daughter of a brick-maker was a student. We\u2019ve carried on that tradition but of course we\u2019re in a very competitive environment. There are a lot of endowments in America and you can go to a German conservatoire for nothing.\u201d</p> <p>The redevelopment has excited musicians. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/05/the-show-must-go-on-pianist-lang-lang-gets-helping-hand-literally-for-carnegie-hall-opening\" title=\"\">Lang Lang, the Chinese pianist,</a> said: \u201cIn developing its already iconic and exceptional facilities, the RCM has committed to ensuring a world-leading experience for future students and visitors.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The coronavirus doesn\u2019t respect national borders, political ideologies or conventional thinking. As governments scramble to try to contain the pandemic and mitigate the fallout on economies and societies, the previously unthinkable is suddenly transformed into the essential. Policy ideas that were decried as madness yesterday are being redefined as the only sane response to this emergency. Positions once held to be immutable are being tossed into a great bonfire of discarded orthodoxies.</p> <p>This is an especially bracing challenge for politicians of the right, they who have been animated for decades by the belief that the only good government is a small one and that there is no problem to which the market cannot supply the answer. A philosophy rooted in the conviction that individualism and competition are the wellsprings of healthy and productive societies is found wanting when confronted by a crisis that can only be endured and resolved by rediscovering the virtues of collectivism and solidarity.</p> <p>You can see some of the tensions this creates in the strained and exhausted face of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/15/boris-johnson-to-hold-daily-coronavirus-press-briefings\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson</a> whenever he appears at the now daily news conferences. This instinctive libertarian, who used to earn his living by penning newspaper columns ridiculing \u201cthe nanny state\u201d is being impelled to introduce social controls of a kind not seen since the Second World War. Some of the constraints go further than that time of national trial. They didn\u2019t shut the boozers during the Blitz. He finds himself, and clearly hates having to be, the prime minister responsible \u201cfor taking away the ancient and inalienable right of every freeborn Englishman to go to the pub\u201d.</p> <p>As the beer taps are closed, the spending spigots are being turned up in a way never seen before. The Tory leader who only recently won an election in part by attacking Jeremy Corbyn as the last of the big spenders will now preside over the most dramatic escalation in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/19/peacetime-constraints-ditched-in-the-war-for-economic-survival\" title=\"\">government expenditure </a>since the 1940s to try to save the economy from being ravaged by a depression.</p> <p>For government and voters alike, this crisis is a rushed tutorial in the case for the active and well-resourced state. Only government can take the exceptional measures required to curtail human activity in the hope that it will curb the spread of infection. Only government has the capacity to effectively perform as an insurer of last resort for the huge number of companies facing extinction unless they receive state aid. Only government can provide a safety net for workers deprived of the ability to earn their living because they are ill or trying to do the right thing by isolating themselves or because their employer is in trouble.</p> <p>Welfare is bad. Balance the books. It is not the role of government to bail out failing companies. All those beliefs long worshipped in the churches of conservatism are being sacrificed in the fierce urgency of the now.</p> <p>When events are moving at such an extraordinary pace, it can be easy to lose appreciation of the boggling scale of this transformation. Rishi Sunak\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/budget-2020-rishi-sunak-spending-coronavirus\" title=\"\">first budget</a> was just 10 days ago, but already feels like an artefact from another era. There was a bit of a collective swoon among Tory MPs at the \u00a312bn he initially allocated to dealing with the virus. What he then called \u201cunprecedented\u201d intervention now looks like small change. Just six days later, he was back to announce a package of tax holidays, grants and business loans worth \u00a3350bn, almost 30 times as much as he had originally proposed. The chancellor declared this to be proof that the government would do <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/so-far-whatever-it-takes-is-not-nearly-enough\" title=\"\">\u201cwhatever it takes\u201d </a>\u2013 only to be told that it would take a great deal more to see us through this crisis. The clamour came not just from opposition politicians, trades unions and charities.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Forced to decide between Tory doctrine and food riots, Mr Sunak made the right choice</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of the arresting tableaux of the past few days has been Bernard Jenkin and other representatives of the Thatcherite right adding their voices to those of more centrist Tories such as Greg Clark, the former business secretary, to demand much broader help. Under that pressure, Mr Sunak came up with what was effectively his third emergency budget in less than a fortnight, when he announced higher welfare payments and a mammoth programme to subsidise the wages of workers who would otherwise be facing redundancy. \u201cThis is not a time for ideology and orthodoxy,\u201d remarked a man once known as a fiscal hawk as he dispatched another barrow-load of Tory sacred beliefs on to the bonfire of orthodoxies.</p> <p>He presented a confident face designed to mask the profound fear within government about the consequences of not taking the extraordinary step of making the state responsible for much of the economy\u2019s wage bills. The alternative was to see a massive and rapid surge in unemployment that would have overwhelmed the welfare system and threatened serious civil disorder. Forced to decide between Tory doctrine and food riots, Mr Sunak made the right choice.</p> <p>Similar things are happening around the world as governments battle to prevent an inevitable downturn from sliding into a deep depression. Donald Trump is even talking about sending a cheque from Washington direct to every American.</p> <p>This emergency differs in key respects to that of the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/2008-financial-crisis-coronavirus-138263\" title=\"\">Great Crash of 2008</a>, but some useful lessons can be drawn from the last global crisis. One is that governments and central banks have to act quickly, decisively and at scale to give confidence to markets, households and businesses that the state has their back and that it is possible for people to plan for a future when the crisis is over. Near-zero interest rates, quantitative easing and bank bailouts, the tools used during the financial crisis, did avert a repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s, but it was only slowly that people came to appreciate the negative social consequences that stretched wealth inequalities and stoked a wide and deep public alienation. The spectacle of shameless financiers walking away unscathed from a wreck of their own reckless making and then going on to further enrich themselves fed a righteous rage among the less affluent folk who felt the squeeze of subsequent austerity. \u201cWe all remember what happened in 2008,\u201d Mr Johnson remarked last week, alluding to the debates within his cabinet about the dangers of a massive public backlash if the government is seen only to be looking after big business. Time and again, he tells companies that the government is standing by them so they can stand by their employees.</p> <p>There are critics who say that the gargantuan amounts of government spending being fired at this crisis are too scattergun. Money will end up in the hands of badly run or badly behaved companies. Money will go to some who don\u2019t really need it. Money will be wasted. To which we can only say: so be it. There is no time for government to develop sophisticated schemes with complex delivery mechanisms. The need is to make financial assistance available as simply and swiftly as possible. This crisis calls not for the sniper\u2019s rifle but the bazooka.</p> <p>The hope \u2013 it can be no more than a hope at this stage of uncertainty \u2013 is that a sharp dive in the global economy will be followed by a strong bounce-back when restrictions can be lifted and millions go back to work and return to spending. But that can only happen if there are still businesses left standing.</p> <p>Ministers and officials cannot say how much all the emergency measures will cost, because they can\u2019t know. We can safely say that the sums will be huge. Robert Chote, the director of the Office for Budget Responsibility, would normally have something very chiding to say about a government prepared to let the deficit rip in such a staggering fashion. Now he observes: \u201cWhen the fire is large enough you just spray the water and worry about it later.\u201d</p> <p>Fiscal disciplinarians on the right are largely swallowing it on the grounds that there is no alternative. Libertarians of the state-shrinking and welfare-loathing disposition are reconciling themselves to measures that they\u2019d normally hate with the thought that they are temporary impositions that will be lifted one day. Once the virus is brought under control, either by the production of a vaccine or other measures, then politics can go back to business as usual.</p> <p>I rather doubt that. While it is far too early to make any confident predictions about the longterm ways in which this crisis will reshape society, it has already upended many of the assumptions that have governed politics here and elsewhere for decades. It is hard to believe that a once-in-a-century event will not have some once-in-a-century consequences.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",
  "<h2>Cocktail hour</h2> <p><em><strong>Henry Porter, novelist and Vanity Fair editor<br></strong></em>One of the nastier aspects of the pandemic is that it turns your friends and all that you do to show them affection \u2013 hug and kiss; share meals and drinks \u2013 into a deadly threat. And yet, in this appalling moment, we need our friends more than ever, and it is probably true that our immune systems do, too. Isolation is bad for a species addicted to social intercourse.</p> <p>My solution has been to start a cocktail hour on a video conferencing site, sending one or two friends every day an invitation to drinks in front of their laptop (or phone) at a time when we might normally meet in a pub or at each other\u2019s homes. It\u2019s surprising what a difference it can make to a day of isolation, and to your spirits in general, to see your friends\u2019 faces in the evening and hear them talk and laugh.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a0b6941bba9804e9ebbd2a1d74b5c72ac24553c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0b6941bba9804e9ebbd2a1d74b5c72ac24553c4/0_0_595_357/500.jpg\" alt=\"Henry Porter enjoying cocktail hour with glass of wine, a laptop and a few friends.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Henry Porter enjoying cocktail hour with a few friends.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liz Elliot</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The scale of Covid-19 and what it\u2019s doing to us is very worrying, but an hour with different friends every evening really helps reduce anxiety, and of course you can make much more effort than I do \u2013 dress up, light candles, provide nibbles (crisps make too much noise). Whatever joy is released when you see your pals in the flesh is also present in these video cocktails, and the beautiful thing is that for a small charge the host gets unlimited conference calls (I pay \u00a3110 annually for BlueJeans) and guests pay nothing.</p> <p>Clearly, this can be expanded to talking to neighbours you may not know very well, or people you believe are really suffering from enforced isolation and loneliness. It may even be a good way of meeting people. Each participant might invite a person no one else knows. It\u2019s certainly great for new mothers, book clubs, football supporters \u2013 anyone who is missing out on regular contact.</p> <p>Despite the remoteness of the interaction and the occasional annoyances of the technology, I find that people really talk in the video cocktail hour. Maybe that has something to do with the ambiguity of the interaction \u2013 you are neither alone nor really in company. You are half-way between the two and perhaps that makes you more candid.</p> <p>Sites I have used include Zoom, BlueJeans and Whypay?

If you\u2019ve no garden, there are plenty of ways to grow indoors.</p> <p>You\u2019ll need a sunny windowsill, inside or out. I always advise beginners to grow herbs. They\u2019re easy and delicious \u2013 and when supermarket supplies are low they become increasingly worthwhile. The plastic trays that tomatoes and mushrooms come in will do \u2013 just make some holes in the bottom for drainage.</p> <p>Fill with, ideally, peat-free multipurpose compost (most nurseries deliver and will be grateful for the custom). Parsley and basil rub along happily next to one another, but mint\u2019s a bit of a thug and better in its own pot. You can also chuck in some salad leaf seeds: pea shoots, rocket and nasturtiums germinate quickly and are tasty at any point in their growing cycle. Sow according to packet instructions: you\u2019ll need a fraction of what\u2019s in the packet.</p> <p>Keep the soil moist \u2013 an old spray bottle is perfect for this \u2013 before and after shoots appear.

If you\u2019ll need two coats, do two coats when you swatch. Pay attention to how the colour is affected by light at the times you use the room most.</p> <p>When it comes to painting a wall, use a brush to \u201ccut in\u201d first. This means painting the corners and edges before anything else \u2013 it gives a better finish. Rollers are ideal for large areas and easier on the hands. Make sure you have the correct roller for the surface \u2013 check with your paint supplier.</p> <p>I favour water-based paint \u2013 it doesn\u2019t trap moisture, it\u2019s kinder to the environment and the clean-up is easier. Also, while modern satin and sheen paint finishes are great, consider a matt paint in an older home: it won\u2019t bounce light from any dents and imperfections.

I knee-patched jeans, darned jumpers and, before you could say \u201ctreadle-powered Singer sewing machine\u201d, I had bought one and started making things from scratch. I shirted and trousered myself, and with knitting needles I socked and jumpered. I learned crochet so I could make Y-fronts using nettle fibre. (We\u2019ll all be wearing nettle when the cotton stops, so plant it now. And relax: the fibre doesn\u2019t sting.)</p> <p>Did people laugh? Well, it was meant to be funny. But not only funny. Like any activity that involves applying your mind to the physical universe, sewing is meditative. It puts you in the here and now.</p> <p>Gradually I set aside the angst that had got me started and started sewing for pleasure. Hoping others might follow, I let my repairs show themselves off, using thread of contrasting colours to edge holes in a jumper, and to stitch the slogan \u201cFresh Air Machine\u201d on the back.</p> <p>I published a book about all this, initially as a limited series of hand-bound books I stitched together, with bits of cereal box and old shirts for the cover. (Better than it sounds.) This, too, was meditative work.</p> <p>If you want to have a go, try darning something. (Look at YouTube.) Cut something up and use it to patch something else. Learn different stitches (for different effects), and experiment by combining materials. Using embroidery, write your name on your shirt or give it a luxury brand logo: it will make you smile, and might give joy to others.</p> <p><em>John-Paul Flintoff\u2019s book is <a href=\"https://www.flintoff.org/sew-your-own-book\" title=\"\">Sew Your Own</a> </em><em>(Profile Books, available on Kindle, \u00a36.40)</em></p> <h2>Fun with kids</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6cbaa1fdbc94b8212d77af828c415033118fd446\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cbaa1fdbc94b8212d77af828c415033118fd446/0_62_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"young girls with facemasks and cucumber on eyes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Let the kids play beauty salons - and try not to get too involved.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachel Warne</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Dawn Isaac, garden designer and author </strong></em><em><strong><br></strong></em>After three children and eight years of \u201cscreen-free family Sundays\u201d, I have plenty of ideas for entertaining children at home. First, get comfortable with mess. Kids having fun do not keep things neat. Manage the chaos with a \u201ctidy-up half-hour\u201d for everyone before they go to bed. Also give the kids some control \u2013 they\u2019re always more willing to throw themselves into things if they feel it was at least partly their idea. Let them lead: help them gather material for junk modelling, a fashion show or house construction, but resist getting too involved. Their imaginations are better than yours.</p> <p>On day one of any long stretch with the kids, we make a \u201cboredom buster\u201d. Take a large jar and lots of squares of paper. On each, one, write an activity everyone can do \u2013 play a board game, make a milkshake. Whenever anyone says \u201cI\u2019m bored\u201d, you pick an activity from the jar. The only rule is you all have to do it before you pick another.</p> <p>To add an element of trepidation, slip some chores into the jar: clean your room, empty the dishwasher. That way, the jar won\u2019t be empty by the end of day two, and the house might not look as if a bomb has hit it.</p> <p>Anything out of the ordinary is always more fun. If it\u2019s mealtime, why not have a picnic on the carpet rather than sitting at the table? If they want to run a cafe and serve the family lunch, or set up a library, let them have a go.

  "<p>Each year when the first spring bulbs start to come into their own, I take it as a seasonal cue to start planting their summer successors, it\u2019s like planning what you fancy for dessert halfway through a slap-up lunch. As I sit looking out at a cloud of perfect magnolia blossom, here\u2019s the list I am drawing up for the months to come\u2026</p> <p>Here in the UK, we don\u2019t tend to think of orchids as outdoor plants. However, there are a range of perfectly hardy species that offer up good early summer interest. I love <em>Bletilla striata alba</em> for its delicate white blooms. These woodland plants thrive in deep, rich soil in dappled shade, but will fare well too with their heads in the sun, but feet in the shade.</p> <p>If you want something bolder for early summer, track down <em>Zantedeschia</em> \u2018Herculus\u2019, a giant, hardy hybrid of the calla lily. Capable of reaching up to 6ft, with enormous, immaculately white spathes high above silver-flecked leaves, this guy is all about shock and awe, yet somehow still incredibly elegant. It loves spots in full sun, away from high winds that can damage their huge leaves. They will even be happy in large pots, too, and are perfect for patios or decks.</p> <p>Recent breakthroughs in plant breeding have also given us a new generation of cold-hardy hippeastrums, such as \u2018Swan Lake\u2019 that, come mid-summer, will open up to reveal the soft green centres of their pearly white trumpets. In late summer, <em>Crinum x powellii </em>\u2018Album\u2019 will carry on the show, kicking out scented trumpets through September and beyond. They both demand as much sun as possible and prefer sandy, well drained soils, but are otherwise fuss-free.</p> <p>If you have a sheltered spot, the ginger lily <em>Hedychium coronarium</em> offers up an unbeatable gardenia fragrance from its pale, butterfly-like blooms right up until the first frosts. While these tender tropicals can be bedded out in the garden for the warmer months of the year, keeping them in large pots means they can be easily moved to a bright spot or brought indoors as temperatures start to fall, to keep the scent of spring going right on into winter.</p> <p>Finally, even if you have no garden at all, here are two indoor options for you. The spider lily <em>Hymenocallis festalis</em> is like an otherworldly daffodil, with long, recurved, snow-white petals with a hauntingly sweet scent, and still compact enough to make a good houseplant.</p> <p>If you have space for just one more (and let\u2019s be honest, there is always space for just one more), check out the Amazon lily <em>Eucharis amazonica</em> for its fragrant, pendant flowers set above a rosette of glossy green leaves.</p> <p><em>Follow James on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Botanygeek?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@Botanygeek</a></em></p>",
  "<p>I spent the first half-hour of Friday morning looking up competing dictionary definitions of the word \u201cpersistent\u201d. My wife had woken up coughing and we were wondering whether this was the start of it \u2013 seven days of hopefully mild fever and quarantine for her, and 14 days inside for me and my daughter. While I was Googling those semantics, though, and adjusting to the realities they did or did not imply, the coughing stopped, and we all hung, waiting to hear what would come next.</p> <p>This strangest of weeks in the capital, in the country, in the world, has cast us all in that role, every hour.</p> <p>Social media memes from Spanish balconies; the rolling TV news with its ever-present know-your-enemy virus graphic; texts from friends in various shades of banter or distress; Steve from the Wirral on a radio phone-in; briefings from government ministers and scientists \u2013 all offer the newly housebound competing fragments to piece together as we try to understand what life looks like on the outside.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f50ec62f3081af41eb44fa68eea3cd851eb7ee4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f50ec62f3081af41eb44fa68eea3cd851eb7ee4/0_153_2409_1445/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman in a mask on a train\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Masks have become a common sight on streets and public transport</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That stay-at-home army has watched the terrifying pictures from Italy on a loop and tried to make sense of the numbers \u2013 that morbid Eurovision table of infections and deaths. Then, minute by minute, we have each hazarded a range of appropriate ways to respond: trying to move around cities without touching handrails, occupying imaginary two-metre bubbles in the park, coveting bottles of hand sanitiser, leafleting vulnerable neighbours for shopping orders, lying awake worrying about the rent or mortgage, planning garden projects, sharing lectures in epidemiology and crying over cancelled exams. We spend anxious time telling ourselves health is all that matters, fearing for jobs, setting up Skype accounts, cajoling parents and grandparents to stay indoors, keeping hands away from faces, going through stockpiled food too quickly, scrapping over loo roll, taking our temperatures, trusting official advice and not trusting official advice.</p> <p>One of the most remarkable lessons of the past seven days is just how quickly the mind can make the unthinkable thinkable. A week ago last Friday, Premier League fixtures and the Six Nations rugby were cancelled and there were still plenty of voices arguing overreaction; sympathies were being extended to Liverpool fans. Since then we have not only quietly accommodated the closure of our schools and universities and offices, our theatres and cinemas and museums and places of worship \u2013 but demanded much more closure, much faster.</p> <p>If marching had been advisable the banners would have read: \u201cShut everything down now!\u201d Can liberal voices ever have been more vehemently in favour of the imposition of martial law and the end of free assembly as they have been this week?</p> <p>Last Thursday evening, my Twitter feed had been so full of outrage about people \u201ccarrying on as normal\u201d, drinking in pubs, going to shops, that I was moved to drive around the streets near where I live in London \u2013 through Camden and Islington and Holloway \u2013 to witness this \u201cnew Luftwaffe\u201d for myself. At 9.30pm there was hardly a car on the streets, and those that were drove very slowly, as if not to disturb the unfathomable quiet. The pubs and restaurants were just about uniformly empty, lit up like a gallery of Edward Hopper paintings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Contrarily, then, the next afternoon, shops in my local high street were crowded, with people coughing nervously into their elbows, presumably convincing themselves, like me, that just going up the road for a loaf of bread or to pick up a prescription was obviously fine. We caught each others\u2019 eyes at a safe-ish distance and smiled and shrugged. Normally you feel ashamed to be obsessing about trivial choices, but trivial choices now feel suddenly like the big questions. We have come to the end of the first urgent week of, \u201cWhat exactly should we be doing?\u201d and there are many more to come.</p> <p>In this new reality, everything can seem like a portent. We seize on pictures of full trains and we seize on pictures of empty trains. Walking home from the high street with my package of asthma inhalers I was thinking I didn\u2019t yet know anyone directly who had the virus \u2013 and then that maybe I knew hundreds, untested.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We occasionally look up from screens to say, \u201cIt\u2019s so bloody weird/terrifying\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen?\u201d</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was the first day of spring blossom; two ambulances passed me on their way down the hill. At home, I opened emails from friends much, much closer to the advancing front line: one in Spain who is in the middle of cancer treatment, self-isolated in a bedroom at home and cheerfully determined to get through <em>Ulys</em><em>ses</em>, cursing the prospect of a \u20ac100 fine for stepping out into the sunshine; the other a clinical director of a London hospital who says: \u201cWe created an initial isolation ward, which is now full, and just finished another ward today, which will likely be full by the weekend.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdb98817562ac3e02e72991c4826ff58e68f64ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdb98817562ac3e02e72991c4826ff58e68f64ea/0_364_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shops in Deptford stock up\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shops in Deptford stock up, as a worker heads to Terry\u2019s Discounts with fresh supplies</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tone becomes an issue. How do you check in with a friend who may or may not have lost their livelihood overnight? Too much gravity and you sound like a horseman of the apocalypse, but matey ironies have begun to sound hollow. I scroll through tweets at random; a stranger writes, \u201cMy whole scale of preparedness is off. I\u2019m a catastrophiser anyway, but I can\u2019t gauge where catastrophe is at the moment. Am I being too paranoid? Not paranoid enough? Anxiety is mad at the best of times but now it\u2019s got layers of mad.\u201d I add to the hearts of agreement, and then, next one down, do my bit by offering advice to new-generation workers-at-home.</p> <p>Having mostly been in that particular self-isolation for 20 years now, I\u2019ve narrowed the rules down to two: spend at least as much time in the day walking and talking as you do looking at a screen, and never work lying down. But of course, as I am writing that, I am realising that the new home-working is not the same as the old. It only really makes sense when you are alone. I was struggling to hit a deadline yesterday while my wife was on another Covid-19-crisis conference call with her office from the sofa and my daughter was playing the piano in the hall. In the absence of cafes, I have been checking out park benches with wifi signals. I am writing this at 5am. Unforeseen consequences are our only growth industry.</p> <p>In our semi-isolation, between calls in the living room, we occasionally look up from screens to confirm, \u201cIt\u2019s so bloody weird/terrifying\u201d or to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen?\u201d or to agree, \u201cWe\u2019re the lucky ones with jobs.\u201d We are already in the habit of convening at 5pm to watch the latest prime ministerial update.

He had watched the news with his last couple of regulars and confirmed that it all added up. \u201cI\u2019d already agreed to pay my staff for the duration,\u201d he said, \u201cthough my accountant said I was mad. But this makes it possible. It\u2019s sad to close of course, but I can see a way beyond it now. We\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p> <p>Hearing he was about to close his doors for the summer, I got one of those quick, alarming flashes of what it all might possibly look like in a month or six. How much of the fabric of life can you take away before things start to fall apart?</p> <p>In the once-upon-a-time of last weekend, we\u2019d gone out for breakfast to the local cafe, opening doors with our elbows, looking for an isolated corner table, half-joking that this might be the last meal out of the year. The Portuguese waitress, chatting about what it all might mean, and still hopeful that they could get through, had recommended I read Jos\u00e9 Saramago\u2019s fable <em>Blindness</em>, in which a whole community is rendered sightless by a plague, apart from one woman, a doctor\u2019s wife, who watches the world go mad around her.</p> <p>I Kindled it up last night and, as it unfolded in long spooling paragraphs, imagined myself in the role of the woman, and then of the population, before deciding that I\u2019d best leave it for a month or six to find out how it all ended. Instead, I got involved in a Twitter conversation about which pub I\u2019d go to first when the ban was over; I thought about it long and hard. For me, I had to say, the Prince of Wales or the Eagle. It was much too close to call.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 22 March 2020.

  "<p>When the novelist Maggie O\u2019Farrell was 16, she was invited to a fancy-dress party and knew at once who to be. She put on a black shirt, with a ruffled paper collar, an inky cloak made out of a skirt, her Doc Martens and cheeky shorts over black leggings. To complete her ensemble, she borrowed a skull from her school\u2019s biology lab. She had become obsessed with Hamlet: \u201cHe had got under my skin. I felt he was part of my DNA.\u201d And while there is no mystery about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jun/25/hamlet-andrew-scott-harold-pinter-theatre-west-end-transfer-review-robert-icke\" title=\"\">Hamlet</a>\u2019s glamorous turbulence appealing to an adolescent, O\u2019Farrell\u2019s feeling was to be rekindled, as an adult, by her discovery of the play\u2019s connection with Shakespeare\u2019s son, Hamnet. There was, she was sure, a novel in it. Over the years, she repeatedly tried to write that novel and almost gave up. Yet it was a story that refused to abandon her.</p> <p>And now, here it is: <em><a href=\"https://www.maggieofarrell.com/titles/maggie-ofarrell/hamnet/9781472223791/\" title=\"\">Hamnet</a> </em>\u2013 the novel of her career. And that is saying something because O\u2019Farrell is the author of eight accomplished and hugely popular books. She won the Costa novel award, in 2010, for <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/apr/25/hand-that-first-held-mine\" title=\"\">The Hand That First Held Mine</a></em>, and shortlisted for both <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/03/instructions-heatwave-maggie-ofarrell-review\" title=\"\">Instructions for a Heatwave</a></em> (2013) and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/27/this-must-be-the-place-by-maggie-ofarrell-review\" title=\"\">This Must Be the Place</a></em> (2016).

But <em>Hamnet</em> is a novel apart. And what distinguishes it from O\u2019Farrell\u2019s earlier work is that while it shares the page-turning verve of its predecessors, it pulls off what younger writers (she is now 47) seldom achieve: the power of letting a story appear to tell itself.

His brief and precious life was, O\u2019Farrell thinks, more significant than literary historians suppose. In Shakespeare\u2019s time, Hamlet and Hamnet were, according to the critic Steven Greenblatt in the <em>New York Review of Books</em>, the same name. It is not that Hamnet has never featured on stage or screen: there was Kenneth Branagh\u2019s 2018 film <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/21/all-is-true-review-ben-elton-kenneth-branagh-shakespeare\" title=\"\">All </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/21/all-is-true-review-ben-elton-kenneth-branagh-shakespeare\" title=\"\">Is True</a></em>, written by Ben Elton; a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/sep/11/hamnet-a-play-for-shakespeares-forgotten-son-and-one-11-year-old-actor\" title=\"\">short, one-boy</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/sep/11/hamnet-a-play-for-shakespeares-forgotten-son-and-one-11-year-old-actor\" title=\"\"> show by Bush Moukarzel</a>; and David Mitchell in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/17/the-upstart-crow-review-gielgud-theatre-london\" title=\"\">The Upstart Crow</a></em> (also by Elton), mentions Shakespeare\u2019s bereavement. But no one has, until now, imaginatively investigated the connection between Hamnet and Hamlet \u2013 what is likely to be a clear link between Shakespeare\u2019s life and his work. Claire Tomalin, Dominic Dromgoole and Kamila Shamsie are among those competing for superlatives to hail the novel, and everyone I know who has managed to get hold of an advance copy is in love with it. Of one thing I\u2019m certain: anyone who reads it will find it impossible to see <em>Hamlet </em>again without thinking about the boy after whom the play was named.</p> <p>It is 11 o\u2019clock on a grey winter morning in Edinburgh and the plan is to meet O\u2019Farrell in a local cafe and walk together to her house. I am waiting as she pushes open the cafe door in a fast-forward flurry. What is immediately likable is that she seems unaware of making a dramatic entrance and of her striking appearance. She is wearing a silver Puffa jacket \u2013 as though outer space might be her next stop \u2013 and has piercingly blue eyes and, a mass of auburn curls and is yanked into the cafe by a small lurcher. \u201cLuna,\u201d she explains, \u201cmy sister\u2019s dog.\u201d</p> <p>We arrive at a double-fronted stone house and she leads the way into the sunny kitchen. The room\u2019s occupants are mainly cats (it is a school day) and there is a sketch of Voldemort in fancy lace-up boots left behind by her daughter on the kitchen table. A wall of glass gives on to the garden and the vibe is bohemian in a good way, with plenty of evidence of a family life: she has three children with her novelist husband, William Sutcliffe \u2013 a son of 16 and daughters aged 10 and seven.</p> <p>We sit down at the kitchen table, and O\u2019Farrell explains the book\u2019s beginnings when she was at Cambridge University studying English (having got in from a comprehensive school in North Berwick): \u201cAt that time, studying English was frustrating because it was all about post-Marxist readings \u2013 you were several removes from the text.\u201d But it was through reading biographies of Shakespeare that she learned of Hamnet\u2019s existence. \u201cWhenever they talked about his death, it would be followed by several paragraphs about infant mortality in the late 16th century.\u201d The authors would explain that infant mortality was commonplace and imply that parents barely reacted when their children died. \u201cI found this an extraordinary assumption,\u201d she says. \u201cHamnet was 11...\u201d</p> <p>After leaving university, she would ask friends if they knew the names of Shakespeare\u2019s children \u2013 had they heard of Hamnet, the twin brother to Shakespeare\u2019s second daughter, Judith? When she told them about Hamnet, they thought she was making him up. \u201cThey said: \u2018No! Are you sure?\u2019 And I said: \u2018Yes, I\u2019m absolutely positive.\u2019 And I thought: if they don\u2019t know, then maybe quite a lot of people don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"88702ad26a39644066ad3b04ff97468730ef31aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88702ad26a39644066ad3b04ff97468730ef31aa/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maggie O\u2019Farrell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018For all of Shakespeare\u2019s incredible output, he left a very scant paper trail\u2019... Maggie O\u2019Farrell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the stumbling blocks to writing the novel was the feeling of presumption about characterising a genius (she describes herself as an Anthony Burgess fan but thinks his novel about Shakespeare, <em>Nothing Like the Sun</em>, does not come off). I notice she never uses Shakespeare\u2019s name in the book. \u201cI couldn\u2019t. When you\u2019re sitting at your computer, immersed in the world you\u2019ve created, and have to write: \u2018William Shakespeare had his breakfast\u2026\u2019 it\u2019s impossible not to think: I\u2019m an eejit. Even calling him William seems colossally presumptuous,\u201d and she gives in to a gale of laughter.</p> <p>But an indignation was growing in O\u2019Farrell that would prove stronger than doubt or mirth \u2013 not about Shakespeare but about his wife, Anne Hathaway (also known as Agnes). Agnes is also dismissed by biographers: \u201cFrom scholarly texts to popular culture, we\u2019re told Shakespeare\u2019s wife was an older woman, a peasant. We\u2019re told he did not want to be with her, that she trapped him into marriage. We\u2019re drip-fed this image. I started to feel anger about how domestic life is diminished: people want to believe Shakespeare appeared in London fully formed, that he did not have a domestic life.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The assumption he did not grieve is outrageous. It\u2019s not nothing to call a play and a tragic hero after your son</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Germaine Greer\u2019s book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/01/biography.germainegreer\" title=\"\">Shakespeare\u2019s Wife</a></em>, which O\u2019Farrell found \u201cinspirational\u201d, recommends that people stop asking: why did Shakespeare marry her? and ask instead: why did she marry him? \u201cPeople think of Agnes as a cradle-snatching yokel who married a younger man but her family was wealthy, they had a successful sheep farm. I kept thinking: why would a 26-year-old woman, with a good dowry and a secure home want to marry this fellow? He had no trade and was only 18.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no evidence he hated his wife or his domestic life. And the assumption he did not grieve for Hamnet is outrageous. It\u2019s not nothing to call a play and a tragic hero after your son \u2013 it speaks volumes. We may not quite know what the volumes are \u2013 but it\u2019s a huge act.\u201d She adds that Shakespeare cannot have been indifferent to his family as he sent money made in London back to Stratford and, when he retired, returned to live there with his wife. O\u2019Farrell went to Stratford-upon-Avon to research the book: \u201cWhat\u2019s astonishing at Shakespeare\u2019s birthplace in Henley Street is that, for all his incredible output, he has left a very scant paper trail, so to be able to walk into that house is astonishing. It\u2019s incredibly moving. It seems so unlikely it has survived, that we can walk through it and into the room in which he was born, the room in which he ate. I went round it several times and talked to several guides and asked millions of questions. They were very patient \u2013 they exude such knowledge and love and enthusiasm.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"10b63a1da8f6897f2cedd3af101103f2fdd76657\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10b63a1da8f6897f2cedd3af101103f2fdd76657/0_0_4080_2369/1000.jpg\" alt=\"William Shakespeare\u2019s birthplace in Henley Street, Stratford-upon-Avon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"581\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William Shakespeare\u2019s birthplace in Henley Street, Stratford-upon-Avon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PC Turner/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And yet because so little is known about Shakespeare, O\u2019Farrell had a free rein. This is a novel that, above all, like her memoir, addresses mortality. And, as readers of her memoir know, O\u2019Farrell\u2019s own survival has been against the odds. To mention just three incidents described in <em>I am, I am, I am: </em>she jumped off a harbour wall \u2013 a 15-metre drop into black water \u2013 and lived to tell the tale. She was held up by a machete-wielding man in Chile. She gave the slip to a man who later murdered a young woman. In <em>Hamnet</em>, she writes: \u201cWhat is given may be taken away, at any time.\u201d As a writer, she is most herself when on the brink, when thinking about what it is for a life to hang in the balance. And for her, balance has particular significance. She has written about encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, which exiled her from school aged eight, turned her into a reader and tilted her world (she still sometimes sees things upside down). It is an \u201cimpairment to a number of neurological functions, one of which is the ability to sense where things are or should be and my place among them\u201d. It is a condition from which she might have died.</p> <p>Strangely, given how devastatingly she writes about bereavement, she has never lost anyone close to her: \u201cWhat informed the novel is the peril we live in with my daughter.\u201d Her middle daughter suffers from anaphylaxis, a potentially lethal allergic reaction, and can go into shock just sitting next to someone eating peanuts. \u201cIt\u2019s every parent\u2019s worst and most visceral fear that you will lose your child. That \u2013 and the idea you couldn\u2019t save them or weren\u2019t able to safeguard them. I cannot imagine the agony of having to bury a child. It must be unlike anything else.\u201d</p> <p>But is the situation with her daughter under control? \u201cNo. She is 10 and in great danger all the time from naturally occurring things in her environment. We can\u2019t control it at all. I realised when I wrote my memoir, <em>a</em> memoir \u2013 the indefinite article is better \u2013 it\u2019s only when you finish a book that you understand why you\u2019ve written it. Doing the final copy edit, I realised that trying to pin down in words what she goes through was my way of trying to feel in control but that control was illusory.\u201d</p> <p>Living vigilantly \u2013 being constantly on red alert \u2013 is key to understanding O\u2019Farrell and her writing. And although she is not superstitious, a further stumbling block to finishing <em>Hamnet</em> was the fear that it was playing with fire to imagine the death of an 11-year-old boy when she had a son who, at the time, was under 11 himself. \u201cIf I was doing this, I\u2019d have to put myself inside the skin of a woman sitting beside her son, laying him out for burial. I thought, I cannot do it \u2013 imagine! My son used to say [teasingly picking up on his mother\u2019s anxiety]: \u2018On my 12th birthday you probably won\u2019t give me a birthday party.\u2019 That was not true and he\u2019s almost 17 now...\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e48a147cdd06edfa39716553df088c92c09ac931\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e48a147cdd06edfa39716553df088c92c09ac931/0_129_1536_1919/800.jpg\" alt=\"Maggie O\u2019Farrell with her cats Malachy, right, and Moses, in 2007.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maggie O\u2019Farrell with her cats Malachy, right, and Moses, in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Maggie O'Farrell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I ask whether taking risks is still part of who she is, she says she has played safer since having children. But mightn\u2019t writing be seen as a form of risk-taking? As brave? Exposing? She laughs in disbelief: \u201cWriting is not brave, it\u2019s the opposite \u2013 it\u2019s just something I\u2019ve always wanted to do. Surgeons are brave. If there\u2019s a hierarchy of bravery, writers are somewhere near the bottom.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Farrell is an interesting mixture \u2013 flighty and earthed. Open and judiciously closed. She never swanks. She talks freely about difficult subjects but swerves from even tame questions that close in on her character. She will not say whether she craves solitude or discuss her intuitions and ducks giving an account of her working day although, to be fair, this might be because she does not have one. \u201cRoutine\u201d and \u201corganisation\u201d are alien to her. She gestures at her kitchen and insists tidiness is beyond her, absently fielding a dropped toy from the floor to confirm the point.</p> <p>Ironically, she has much more to say on the subject of her stammer. Speech therapy \u2013 five years ago \u2013 has helped although radio interviews, she says, remain a challenge. \u201cEvery stammerer has a collection of sounds they can\u2019t start off on and one of mine was \u2018M\u2019.\u201d And that is not easy when your name is Maggie. But writing has always been a reprieve. \u201cThere\u2019s indescribable joy in being able to write when nothing stops you.\u201d</p> <p>Might hearing the criticisms of a novelist husband sometimes stop her? \u201cWill and I have known each other a long time. We met in the first year of university but weren\u2019t together for another 10 years. I trust his judgment and know he will tell me what he thinks.

The daughter of an economist, she grew up with her mother and two sisters in Wales and Scotland. As an adult, she has lived in Hong Kong (a year working for a computer magazine) and London (as an arts journalist). But Ireland never loosens its hold: \u201cMy passport is Irish and, since Brexit, I\u2019m clinging proudly to it. I\u2019m wary of claiming Irish heritage but I often mistily think: I shall move back to Ireland.\u201d</p> <p>She once wrote: \u201cIn any fairytale, getting what you want comes at a cost.\u201d What does she want herself? \u201cI want Brexit not to have happened.

Instead, she tells a story. One day, while she was writing <em>Hamnet</em>, her daughter looked over her shoulder and started to read. After a while, she remarked to her mother: \u201cI don\u2019t like this story \u2013 it\u2019s too sad.

We are, he says, in serious trouble.</p> <p>Lang, who established the pioneering <a href=\"https://www.city.ac.uk/about/schools/health-sciences/research/centre-for-food-policy\" title=\"\">Centre for Food Policy</a> at City University in 1994, makes no apologies for the bluntness of the statement. \u201cI did not write that lightly,\u201d he says, when we meet in central London. \u201cI sat in my study, reviewing all the data. Things have just got worse.\u201d Even so, he recognises how it looks. Panic buying aside, our supermarket shelves are usually full. We have access to a greater range of ingredients at better prices than at any time in human history. The conversation around how and what we eat often feels like it sits front and centre of the culture. \u201cI like my food,\u201d he says. \u201cMore joy around food has come into our lives.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s a staggering gap between rich and poor in terms of wealth and income and therefore access to food</p> <footer> <cite>Tim Lang</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And yet, he says, all of that masks a bitter reality: we have a massively fragile just-in-time supply chain which could easily collapse; a depleted agriculture sector which produces only around 50% of the food we actually eat, leaving us at the mercies of the international markets; and production methods which are damaging to the environment and human health. \u201cWhen I looked at the numbers on inequality,\u201d he says, \u201cI was shocked. There\u2019s a staggering gap between rich and poor in terms of wealth and income and therefore access to food.\u201d As he says: \u201cFood is the biggest driver of NHS spending as a result of obesity, diabetes and heart disease.\u201d Food may look cheap, he adds, but too much of it creates vast, unsustainable costs elsewhere.</p> <p>His doorstep of a book attempts both diagnosis and cure. Consciously, it pushes the impact of Brexit to one side to get at the underlying dysfunction. Likewise, we agree to discuss the implications of coronavirus later. Nevertheless, he says, it all amounts to the same thing. \u201cThere is a mismatch between human need, the food system and its outcomes.\u201d</p> <p>At the heart of this crisis is a British willingness to let a small number of corporations dominate food retailing: just eight companies control 90% of our food supply. \u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018leave it to Tesco\u2019 approach,\u201d he says. The prioritisation of price has hollowed out UK agriculture, so that primary producers get the smallest slice of the cake. \u201cThey get about 5% or 6% of the value of the food we buy. They need double that. And that 50% self-sufficiency should be nearer 80%. Not out of nationalism, but so we are in a position to contribute globally. We have a default position of assuming someone else will feed us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a685116511d8a98812d14017a1e7037fb161c33a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a685116511d8a98812d14017a1e7037fb161c33a/0_16_4339_2603/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An elderly woman looks at empty shelves at a Tesco supermarket in London, March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We have a default position that someone else will feed us\u2019: empty supermarket shelves, one consequence of the coronavirus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The book comes freighted with eye-popping data. For example, of the six million hectares of cultivatable land in Britain, only 168,000 hectares are used for fruit and vegetables. As a result, we have to import vast amounts of crops we could otherwise be growing. Much of the remaining land is used for crops to feed livestock or for processed foods.</p> <p>\u201cThe government is now so reliant on the retailers, they are setting them up to fail,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the height of the arguments over a no-deal Brexit, the heads of the big food companies were briefing the government about just how fragile the food supply chain is. Brexit has shone a spotlight on that fragility.\u201d I ask where he thinks this dysfunctional system has come from. \u201cThere is a culture of British exceptionalism. We were the first industrial nation in the 18th century and then became the dominant imperial power in the 19th century and pursued that as a way of feeding ourselves.\u201d Critics often point out that we were less self-sufficient in food in the early 20th century than we are now. True, Lang says, but that was specifically because we had an empire which we ravaged to keep our tables and bellies full.</p> <p>He\u2019s at pains to acknowledge that he is not the first person to raise these issues. He first became interested in the subject in the 1970s when, having just completed his social psychology PhD, he started farming in Wales. He came across a book called <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Food-Problem-Relation-National-Defences/dp/B0055DAUGQ\" title=\"\">Our Food Problem and Its Relation </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Food-Problem-Relation-National-Defences/dp/B0055DAUGQ\" title=\"\">to Our National Defences</a></em>, published in 1939. One of its authors was Frederick Le Gros Clark, a sometime children\u2019s writer who went on to become an expert in malnutrition. Like Lang, he argued that the British<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jul/29/saving-britains-food-supply-manifesto-jay-rayner\" title=\"\"> food supply chain was exceedingly delicate</a> and was not serving the health of the nation. The outbreak of war would prove him right. There was also a review of the British food system in 1936 by William Beveridge, later architect of the welfare state, who made similar arguments. \u201cBeveridge was totally ignored,\u201d Lang says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When the new agriculture bill was introduced in January, it had almost nothing about food</p> <footer> <cite>Tim Lang</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the summer of 2019, then Defra secretary Michael Gove announced he was establishing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/27/leon-restaurants-co-founder-henry-dimbleby-uk-food-system-review\" title=\"\">national </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/27/leon-restaurants-co-founder-henry-dimbleby-uk-food-system-review\" title=\"\">food </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/27/leon-restaurants-co-founder-henry-dimbleby-uk-food-system-review\" title=\"\">strategy</a>, which was broadly welcomed by the food industry. He put his friend Henry Dimbleby, the co-founder of the Leon healthy fast-food chain, in charge of the review, even though he has no academic credentials in the field. Lang is polite about the classic British choice of a non-expert generalist to lead the review, but he does say that he\u2019s concerned that, like Beveridge, Dimbleby\u2019s review will be ignored when it\u2019s eventually published. \u201cWhen the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/16/food-security-brexit-biggest-shake-uk-farming-40-years-agriculture-bill\" title=\"\">new agriculture bill was introduced in January</a>, it had almost nothing about food,\u201d he says.</p> <p>What\u2019s Lang\u2019s solution? It\u2019s detailed and includes the introduction of a food resilience and sustainability act, complete with legally binding targets. National nutritional guidelines should become the basis for food procurement contracts, both public and private. There should be an audit of food production in the UK and the budget for public health should be doubled from \u00a32.5bn of the \u00a3130bn health budget to \u00a35bn. It also proposes the creation of no fewer than nine bodies or institutions, including a royal commission to map a new set of \u201cmulti-criteria principles for the UK food system\u201d, a food resilience and sustainability council and a network of urban and rural food and farming colleges.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76f93351e43306362c66e65959efe40af78d9743\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76f93351e43306362c66e65959efe40af78d9743/0_219_5300_3181/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apples being collected in an orchard in Somerset, England.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Among Tim Lang\u2019s solutions for sustainability is an audit of food production in the UK: apple harvesting in Somerset.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I suggest this is an old-fashioned 1970s corporatist approach; that he\u2019s proposing a massive expansion of the state to deal with the problem. \u201cI think I\u2019ve been pretty modest,\u201d Lang says. \u201cThe British state is failing us by not decentralising.\u201d He also calls for Tesco, which has around 30% of the food retail market, to be broken up, so that no one firm has more than 15%. Likewise, he calls for pension funds to disinvest from manufacturers of ultra-processed foods, as some have started doing with fossil fuels. The list goes on. He insists, however, that this is not some kneejerk leftist manifesto. \u201cWe just need to re-engineer how capitalism works for us.\u201d</p> <p>We agree we can no longer ignore the viral elephant both inside the room and outside it. Might the coronavirus crisis help with the re-engineering of our food supply chain? He agrees, sadly, that it might. \u201cIt could prove a good reminder of the value of state institutions,\u201d he says. And the emptying of shelves as a result of panic buying may help people to \u201cthink about where their food comes from\u201d. He adds: \u201cWe need to move from a \u2018me\u2019 food culture to a \u2018we\u2019 food culture.\u201d It\u2019s a very simple message, but in the white heat of a crisis, defined by queues outside supermarkets, a useful one.</p> <p>\u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 23 March 2020 to more accurately reflect the content and context of the interview with Lang.</p> <p><em>Feeding Britain: Our Food Problems and How to Fix Them by </em><em>Tim Lang is published</em><em> on 26 March</em><em> (Pelican, \u00a325).

While Scott Morrison was standing in his courtyard in Canberra unveiling a $66bn stimulus package, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/victoria-nsw-lockdowns-scott-morrison-coronavirus-national-cabinet\">New South Wales and Victoria crashed in over the top</a> of the prime minister, pointing to imminent school closures, and lockdowns of non-essential services.</p> <p>Now why did that happen? The short answer is there is a view in these two states that community behaviour won\u2019t shift decisively until the shutdowns start; that people won\u2019t grasp how serious the situation is until there are forced lifestyle changes.</p> <p>Hot on the heels of that pincer movement from NSW and Victoria were public statements from South Australia and Western Australia \u2013 their borders would close from Tuesday \u2013 and the ACT followed suit with its shutdown.</p> <p>Collectively, this was the sound of a sonic boom.</p> <p>This was the sound of life daily changing, whether we were ready or not. This was the sound of we\u2019ve tried asking nicely for you to engage in social distancing, and given you\u2019ve ignored us, we will have to engineer the outcome.</p> <p>It was also the sound of a couple of states saying implicitly they don\u2019t believe Canberra is focused enough yet on the health impacts of the crisis. The various moves by the states pre-empted a meeting of the national cabinet. It was supposed to meet early this week. The meeting was brought forward to Sunday night, then at least two premiers brought forward what would be happening on Sunday night.</p> <p>If anyone had five minutes to think, Sonic Boom Sunday could have been predicted given the range of inputs. The NSW government had a really bad weekend, between the Bondi beach insurrection and the cock-up by local health authorities who apparently allowed a couple of thousand people to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/ruby-princess-logged-158-cases-of-illness-before-passengers-disembarked-without-coronavirus-testing\">walk off a cruise ship without proper health screening</a>. Given the fraying, a forceful corrective was doubtless in order.</p> <p>Victoria has been increasingly concerned that Morrison has focused relentlessly on trying to avoid an economic shutdown, with catastrophic job losses, and as a consequence isn\u2019t sharp enough on the health impacts.</p> <p>As well as imposing travel bans and crowd control measures, the federal government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/22/what-australias-189bn-coronavirus-economic-rescue-package-means-for-you\">has put together three stimulus packages in a fortnight</a> \u2013 big, complex undertakings \u2013 with the objective of trying to put a flotation device under the national economy. In Canberra it has been all shoulders to the wheel on stimulus design, and on trying to maintain a measure of public confidence, so the country doesn\u2019t descend into full tilt panic.</p> <p>Obviously both elements of the crisis have to be managed, both are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/remember-josh-frydenberg-scoffing-at-a-wellbeing-budget-hes-not-laughing-any-more\">relevant to national wellbeing</a> \u2013 but tensions about where the various emphases lie between the tiers of government in Australia have been building slowly within the national cabinet, and its health advisers, over the past 10 days or so.</p> <p>On Sunday, those deliberative tensions finally broke cover.</p>",
  "<p>On Friday evening, after one of the most extraordinary weeks in British history, a cabinet minister was among those trying to compute the scale of the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus threat. In the end, he was forced to conclude: \u201cWe\u2019ve just nationalised the economy.\u201d</p> <p>Given that Boris Johnson had just ordered every pub, restaurant, cafe and gym to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/london-pubs-cinemas-and-gyms-may-close-in-covid-19-clampdown\" title=\"\">shut its doors</a>, shortly before his relatively new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced the state would begin to pay a huge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\" title=\"\">chunk of the nation\u2019s wages</a>, the remark seemed apt. The battle to control the coronavirus has remodelled Britain\u2019s way of life \u2013 and bulldozed political ideologies in the process \u2013 in just a few days.</p> <p>A week ago, Whitehall officials were convinced the British response of holding off from drastic measures was the right one. By Friday, entire industries had been closed and direct pay for the nation\u2019s worried employees was given approval while the government had already included urgent advice about social distancing to slow the virus, a \u00a3330bn business-loans package and the small matter of closing the nation\u2019s schools for the first time in history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The frenzy of activity has inevitably left questions over the government\u2019s strategy, whether mistakes were made and precious time was lost \u2013 and how a prime minister who won office for his crowd-pleasing persona rather than his command of detail will cope when confronted with such a crisis. \u201cIt is a big challenge for him. During the leadership election the question was always, \u2018he\u2019s good on telly, can he be a prime minister?\u2019 We\u2019re going to test that,\u201d said one minister.</p> <p>Johnson has always been at pains to insist he has followed the evidence at every turn. Yet it is that commitment that appeared to precipitate last week\u2019s abrupt change of course. The initial stated desire to delay the peak of the virus and allow the build-up of \u201cherd immunity\u201d among the population came up against new evidence \u2013 a report by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies that the crisis was developing more quickly than thought, and the arrival on Monday of a jaw-dropping analysis by Imperial College London that \u201csocial distancing\u201d by the whole population was essential to bringing down deaths from 250,000 to possibly a few thousand.</p> <p>The shift has been widely described as a U-turn and last week led to some fairly hefty criticism about ministers\u2019 anti-Covid-19 policies.</p> <p>Why did we stick to mitigation when we should have gone straight to suppression of the virus?</p> <p>In fact, the government knew about these two scenarios for weeks but chose the less severe path until the most recent data showed this was not going to work. The problem is that lots of uncertainties underpin all the mathematical models that are being deployed to understand Covid-19, says Professor Mark Woolhouse of Edinburgh University. \u201cThere are also huge uncertainties about the social behaviour of people and about the way groups will respond to different controls being imposed on them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffbac7529e11c08aa8f9447e17a52c57fade3e5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffbac7529e11c08aa8f9447e17a52c57fade3e5d/0_0_3500_2297/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A paramedic in Hertfordshire wears protective clothing for a call-out.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>A paramedic in Hertfordshire wears protective clothing for a call-out.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters Photographer/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Armed with the new evidence, the prime minister used his first daily press conference on Monday to announce \u201ca very substantial change in the way that we want people to live their lives\u201d. He urged everyone not to go to pubs and theatres, to work from home if they could, and to stop non-essential travel.</p> <p>Other more serious measures were signposted, but not announced \u2013 and the prime minister appeared to be offering advice, not orders.</p> <p>So began a week of communications challenges for Johnson, with every unprecedented measure leading to more questions about what they meant in practice. On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/17/boris-johnson-coronavirus-press-conference-rishi-sunak-cabinet-as-rishi-sunak-set-to-announcing-coronavirus-financial-rescue-package-politics-live\" title=\"\">Sunak unveiled loans to businesses</a> to help them through. But why only loans? And what of employees and the self-employed?</p> <p>On Wednesday came the schools closure for all but \u201ckey workers\u201d. So how would students get to university \u2013 and who was a key worker? Meanwhile, rumours of a lockdown in London had begun to circulate and refused to go away.</p> <p>It was on Thursday, however, that Johnson\u2019s grip was really tested, as the case numbers grew and the terrible toll the disease was wreaking on Italy became ever more apparent. By now, unease was sweeping the Tory benches over the need for a huge rescue package for workers. A sign of the concerns emerged when Greg Clark, the former business secretary known for his caution in office, said the \u201cnation should pay wages\u201d to workers. Meanwhile, critics such as former Tory minister and independent London mayoral candidate Rory Stewart still maintained the government\u2019s strategy was wrong. \u201cThey are still fundamentally of the view that it is neither practical nor desirable to suppress the virus,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cThis is the very last chance now of following the policy of suppression. A suppression strategy involves much more radical action \u2013 not just isolating the elderly, it\u2019s isolating everybody It\u2019s shutting all schools and universities immediately. It\u2019s shutting all pubs, clubs, gyms. The most prudent move would be to impose isolation on the whole country and start testing vigorously.\u201d Others privately agreed. One Tory MP in London, where the virus is most widespread, said: \u201cWe do have to look at the messaging around bars and restaurants staying open and people being told to keep out. It\u2019s one or the other. We should close them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/archive-zip/giv-3902kj71I5pw516y/\" data-alt=\".\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/archive-zip/giv-3902kj71I5pw516y/\">.</a> </figure>  <p>At that evening\u2019s press conference, Johnson seemed frustrated to be appearing again. \u201cI don\u2019t want to weary you with these occasions,\u201d he told reporters, in an attempt at levity that appeared to reveal his annoyance. He began by talking about \u201cturning the tide within 12 weeks\u201d, striking an optimistic tone that he regards as a trademark. Yet by the end of the appearance, he had conceded: \u201cI cannot tell you by the end of June we will be on a downward slope.\u201d The next day, newly published scientific advice suggested strict social distancing measures could be dialled up and down, but would be needed for \u201cmost of a year\u201d.</p> <p>Amid the uncertainty, the government has also stubbornly remained attached to the idea that Britain might end the Brexit transition period at the end of the year, despite all the evidence \u2013 and widespread acceptance in Whitehall \u2013 that the period will have to be extended. \u201cNo senior minister or top official on the other side is spending serious time on this issue now,\u201d says Sir Ivan Rogers, the UK\u2019s widely respected former EU ambassador. \u201cRightly so. The real question for government though is whether, at a time when they are rightly focussed on trying to do everything possible to ensure that good firms survive this unprecedented crisis, they want senior people in companies battling to survive, to be spending a lot of time contingency landing for \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit nine months from now. Is that a sensible use of corporate leaders\u2019 time right now?\u201d</p> <p>So, was Johnson, who so admires Sir Winston Churchill, misjudging his response in the country\u2019s hour of need? Jill Rutter, senior fellow at the Institute for Government, has concerns. \u201cI thought the bizarre part of the communications was to say \u2018we\u2019re telling you to do this. We might have to do another thing, but you don\u2019t need to yet\u2019. That trailing of things was difficult. I do think it\u2019s unacceptable to put information out under \u201cDowning St sources\u201d. This is just too important for that. No 10 needs to be straight with the communications. This is not a time to be playing games with messaging.\u201d</p> <p>However, the size and speed of the challenge means that many in Whitehall remain sympathetic and willing to give Johnson leeway. \u201cYou have to act first and work through the implications,\u201d says one Tory MP who is not a natural Johnson supporter. \u201cThe school closures decision was a classic of that. How will people get to university? We\u2019ll figure it out. Who are key workers? We\u2019ll work it out. I\u2019m afraid the decisions have to be made. We don\u2019t have the luxury of mapping it all out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6722dd66246d14d4bd413f4c09b4d0c3a1f6a6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6722dd66246d14d4bd413f4c09b4d0c3a1f6a6d/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Stalybridge Buffet Bar in Manchester on Friday, hours before it closed with all other pubs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>The Stalybridge Buffet Bar in Manchester on Friday, hours before it closed with all other pubs.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Devlin/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Johnson and Sunak announced the enforced closure of pubs, clubs, and restaurants and leisure facilities on Friday evening, along with a pledge to pay 80% of workers\u2019 wages up to \u00a32,500 a month, many Tories were satisfied thatthe UK was acting in line with other nations. Even more may be needed. Sunak has yet to heed calls for huge subsidies to transport companies suffering from a collapse in passenger numbers. Bus companies have asked for a \u00a31bn bailout while airlines have asked for a \u00a37bn package \u2013 in part to pay staff to stay at home. Meanwhile, groups representing the self-employed said they were the most obvious omission from the latest package of measures announced by Sunak. The 5.2 million army of self-employed and contract workers can access sickness benefit and universal credit, but will not benefit from the state pay offer.</p> <p>As one minister put it, the question of \u201cwhat the fuck happens after\u201d is yet to be properly asked, never mind answered. \u201cThe economy will change. The nation will change. Our habits will change. But that\u2019s for another day.\u201d So how long can British people remain in lockdown as uncertainties grow over food supplies, the economy, jobs and education? Relax the draconian measures and cases will start to rise again, threatening again to overwhelm the NHS. Neil Ferguson, the academic who led the Imperial research, believes current policies \u201cwill need to be maintained until large stocks of vaccines are available to immunise the population \u2013 which could be 18 months or more.\u201d Woolhouse is sceptical. \u201cWe need an exit strategy from this epidemic and I would not dignify the expectation of developing a vaccine as a strategy. It is a hope, no more than that.\u201d</p> <p>However, there are other reasons for optimism. As China eases its national lockdown, its experience may inform British moves to follow suit. In addition, as time passes, increased NHS capacity could allow further relaxation in social distancing. The complex situation is summed up by Professor Jimmy Whitworth at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine.</p> <p>\u201cThis disease is going to stick with us for a long time. It is going to be an experience that none of us have had before in our lifetimes.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Seldom has a British government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/budget-2020-rishi-sunak-spending-coronavirus\" title=\"\">budget</a> been rendered so out of date and so irrelevant as Rishi Sunak\u2019s first.</p> <p>One of the best indicators of this was provided in his post-budget evidence to the Treasury select committee last week by Robert Chote, the much-respected chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). The OBR is the independent watchdog on government spending and taxation plans \u2013 the setting-up of which was one of the few acts of Chancellor George Osborne of which I approved.</p> <p>Before the budget, the OBR does its best to provide the forecasts on which the budget judgment is based. One of its obvious worries during the 2019 election campaign \u2013 goodness, was it as recent as that? \u2013 was that the two main parties were committing themselves to spending plans that implied the need for increases in taxation that they regarded as politically anathema.</p> <p>Even before the escalation of fears about the coronavirus epidemic, the OBR had grave concerns about the implication of Brexit for the economy\u2019s growth, productivity and tax revenues. But the implications of the virus for the nation\u2019s medical and economic health have become so drastic \u2013 in such a short time \u2013 that in the light of \u201cevents\u201d the OBR has had to change its tune dramatically.</p> <p>What we are facing, indeed already experiencing, is a fall in output \u2013 gross domestic product \u2013 of anything between 10 and 20% in the next three months, according to Capital Economics, a consultancy with a well established reputation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Despite the crisis, the Brexiters are hellbent on not seeking an extension to the negotiations with the EU</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Why? Because the emergency declared by the government implies a collapse of demand for all but essential supplies, as the nation confronts what economists call a \u201csupply shock\u201d \u2013 factories closing or going on \u201cshort time\u201d \u2013 while at the same time the level of consumer spending (ie by people like you and me) plummets as incomes collapse and so many of us are confined to our homes (in economists\u2019 jargon, \u201ca demand shock\u201d).</p> <p>Now, the budget was already seriously inadequate in that, despite stealing Labour\u2019s clothes on certain public spending plans, it hardly dealt with the need to address the appalling erosion of the social services under the ill-conceived austerity strategy embarked on by Osborne in 2010.</p> <p>What the OBR has recognised, in common with others, is that this is a serious emergency, which demands good judgment, not the usual obsession with deficit and debt levels in relation to GDP. The 2008 financial crisis was terrible, but it had nothing like the impact on output, incomes and employment threatened by the coronavirus pan-panic that now confronts us. As Chote said: \u201cThis is not the time to be squeamish about one-off additions to public sector debt \u2026 it\u2019s more like a wartime situation.\u201d He added that it was \u201cno abdication of budget responsibility to be spending what you need to spend to deal with this\u201d.</p> <p>As it is, despite being faced with this calamitous virus \u2013 for which the austerity-struck <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/17/nhs-postpone-millions-operations-tackle-coronavirus\" title=\"\">NHS </a>was hopelessly ill-prepared \u2013 the Brexiters who control the government seem at the time of writing hell-bent on not seeking an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/14/calls-to-extend-eu-transition-period-as-europe-fights-coronavirus\" title=\"\">extension of the period for Brexit negotiations</a>.</p> <p>One suspects, however, that they will almost certainly have an extension forced upon them. Unless, of course, they crash out, which increasingly seems to be the danger.</p> <p>Meanwhile, is it not wonderfully ironic that objections to freedom of movement were a vital factor in the Brexit vote, yet, while EU countries have temporarily suspended freedom of movement in response to the crisis, the British government did not clamp down and, in effect, invited more of the virus in.</p> <p>Just to add to their borderline insanity, the Brexiters are also determined to leave the sensible organisations that link this country to the EU in cooperation on healthcare. When it finally became clear that we were indeed leaving the EU, one well-meaning friend suggested that I stop writing about Brexit. What? Stop opposing self-harm? Sorry. No!</p> <p>And now we have coronavirus. Some believe its presence will be felt for a long time, others that its consequences will be short-lived. Who knows? But we have to conduct as good a rescue operation as possible. And it looks, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\" title=\"\">Friday\u2019s announcement of 80% compensation for wage losses</a>, as if the government has finally been shamed into it. Meanwhile, I am reminded of Alexander Pope\u2019s lines: \u201cWho shall decide when doctors disagree, And soundest casuists doubt, like you and me?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>On Thursday, Northwick Park hospital in London declared a critical incident when it <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/news/hospitals-critical-care-unit-overwhelmed-by-coronavirus-patients/7027189.article\" title=\"\">ran out of intensive care beds</a> after a surge in the number of coronavirus patients coming through its doors. It is a sign that, in London, the spread of Covid-19 is already threatening to overwhelm hospital capacity. Other areas of the country will not be far behind. As infection rates rise, and the death toll inevitably increases, the experiences of other countries tell us that things will get much worse before they get better. We have been asked by the government to adopt a range of social distancing measures that, so far, have been less stringent than those adopted elsewhere. We implore our readers to stay home to save lives.</p> <p>Scrutiny of the government\u2019s response continues. To ask hard questions about what the government has so far got right and wrong is not to needlessly politicise a crisis: it is to hold our leaders to account in order to ensure that mistakes do not continue. Some aspects of government have inspired great confidence in the last week, others have sowed apprehension and trepidation among scientists and experts.</p> <h2>Why weren\u2019t we ready?<br></h2> <p>The first set of very real concerns are about the government\u2019s preparedness for the crisis; in the present, and ahead. Only last Monday did Matt Hancock, the health secretary, issue a public call for companies that might be able to assist with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/17/uk-manufacturers-regear-factories-build-ventilators-nhs\" title=\"\">ventilator production</a> to contact government. There are now three industrial consortia working quickly to develop a prototype of a medical ventilator that can be manufactured within a month. But the timing of Hancock\u2019s call raises the question: why were these efforts not under way weeks ago, when <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext\" title=\"\">scientists in China</a> were warning the world of the risk of a deadly pandemic? Similarly, the UK\u2019s lack of coronavirus testing capacity is holding it back from pursuing the strategies of mass testing, contact tracing and isolation that have been so successful in holding down infection and mortality rates in South Korea; there is insufficient capacity even to test frontline NHS and care workers who start to display symptoms, meaning they must immediately self-isolate. Why was testing capacity not expanded in preparation for this pandemic?</p> <p>We cannot change where we are now: but it is by understanding the answers to these questions that government can ensure similar errors of forward planning do not cost lives. In particular, the government must be thinking ahead about solutions such as ordering, in good time, those manufacturers who can do so to switch to the production of goods that will be critical in helping the country to weather this crisis.</p> <p>Second, there are real questions about the government\u2019s communications capabilities. In a public health crisis that relies so heavily on changing behaviour in order to control the spread of the outbreak, communication is not an optional extra: it is a critical tool in the fight to save lives. To its credit, Downing Street quickly responded to criticisms of being slow off the mark by introducing a daily press conference last week. But inaccurate news has continued to dribble out from government sources before those briefings; for example, the idea that London would soon see the imposition of a lockdown, which further fuelled panic buying. The government has been to slow to adopt effective messaging to discourage the public from stockpiling.</p> <p>Worryingly, the prime minister himself does not inspire confidence. He has struck the wrong tone at his press conferences, undermining the seriousness of the government message to stay at home as much as possible, for example suggesting that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-mum-coronavirus-mothers-day-self-isolate-tv-address-today-a9415496.html\" title=\"\">he hoped to see his mother today on Mother\u2019s</a><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-mum-coronavirus-mothers-day-self-isolate-tv-address-today-a9415496.html\" title=\"\"> Day</a> (a mistake his advisers sought to correct afterwards). His way of speaking to the nation stands in stark contrast to that of Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, and Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, both of whom have struck far more capable, sober and reassuring tones.</p> <p>Third, there are concerns about the government\u2019s strategy to contain the spread of the virus, which is more lax than those adopted by European countries such as Italy, Spain and France. There appears to be disagreement among scientific and behavioural experts about the extent to which the government\u2019s delays will reduce deaths over the medium term by allowing it to keep stringent restrictions in place for longer when infection rates are even higher than they are now; or whether it is needlessly costing lives. Only time will tell.</p> <p>But, given our lack of testing capacity, a more stringent approach now could presumably buy more time to increase ventilator, critical care and testing capacity. The government distanced itself from its explicit suggestion that it was consciously trying to develop herd immunity by allowing 60% of the population to become infected in the coming months, once it realised that this would result in an intolerable number of deaths. We need confidence that Boris Johnson will not hesitate to introduce stricter restrictions in order to save lives, regardless of any personal distaste he may feel for temporary curtailments on people\u2019s liberties.</p> <h2>Cometh the chancellor</h2> <p>The government\u2019s economic response, coordinated by Sunak, has been far more confidence-inspiring. We applaud the chancellor for taking swift action to intervene to save jobs and increase the generosity of a benefits system that has been devastated by 10 years of austerity inflicted by his predecessors. The Treasury has announced that it will pay 80% of wages, up to \u00a32,500 a month, for employees that have been furloughed by their employers. In addition, the standard annual allowance of universal credit has been increased by \u00a31,000 for a year, and the link between housing benefit and local rents has been restored. This is a sorely needed package of measures that will run into the tens of billions at least. But as the <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/press-releases/government-sets-out-unprecedented-but-essential-pledges-to-underwrite-wages-and-strengthen-the-safety-net/\" title=\"\">Resolution Foundation</a> has pointed out, there are significant gaps: there is very limited support for the self-employed, most of whom will have to claim unemployment benefit, and for the two million workers who do not earn enough to qualify for statutory sick pay.</p> <p>Many families will struggle to cope with the impacts of social distancing on their physical, mental and financial wellbeing. But those who have safe places to isolate are in an immeasurably better position than some of the most vulnerable and destitute in our society. There has been far too little action on protecting homeless people, those locked up in prison and immigration detention, vulnerable children and victims of domestic abuse. The government must urgently make more funding available to allow local authorities to take extraordinary action, for example, to follow the mayor of London\u2019s lead in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-live-updates-deaths-jump-in-spain-and-italy-millions-locked-down-in-us?page=with:block-5e75f9e88f08e0999e6b797c#block-5e75f9e88f08e0999e6b797c\" title=\"\">block-booking hotel rooms</a> in which to temporarily house homeless people.</p> <h2>We all have a role</h2> <p>The government has a critical role to play in minimising the death toll and economic pain that will result from this pandemic. But we cannot simply rely on government to get us through this. It is down to all of us: to businesses and employers, to civil society and to individuals to take government advice seriously and refrain from panic buying, to ensure that critical workers and those at risk are also able to feed their families. Even as some businesses have stepped up \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-live-updates-deaths-jump-in-spain-and-italy-millions-locked-down-in-us?page=with:block-5e75f4f88f08a08573fbedde#block-5e75f4f88f08a08573fbedde\" title=\"\">shifting manufacturing to produce hand sanitiser</a> for those in need and donating stock to food banks \u2013 others have sacked and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/21/scottish-hotel-admin-error-sacking-staff-covid-19\" title=\"\">made their employees homeless</a> with no notice, and extracted tens of millions in dividends for their owners while going cap in hand to the government for taxpayer support.</p> <p>Even as some people have thrown themselves into organising local aid groups for those who have to self-isolate, others have sought to profiteer by bulk buying and re-selling goods such as <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/coronavirus-desperate-mums-forced-pay-21717944\" title=\"\">baby formula</a>. Even as millions have heeded government advice to save lives and protect the NHS frontline by staying at home, others packed into pubs on Friday night for their last day of opening, no doubt encouraged by those like the Wetherspoons boss, Tim Martin, who have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-wetherspoons-boss-says-uk-pubs-will-stay-open-as-long-as-possible\" title=\"\">undermined government messaging</a> to try to protect their business.</p> <p>Perhaps a crisis of this sort was always going to hold up a mirror to the best and the worst of us. But it is within all of our power to ensure that we look after each other and do all we can manage to minimise the number of lives that will be claimed by this pandemic. Every day, NHS staff and care workers, teachers and nursery workers, delivery drivers and supermarket staff are exposing themselves to greater risk to ensure that people are cared for and can eat while we fight this threat. Every day, older people and the immuno-compromised will be self-isolating, worried about the possibility of contracting a virus that could cost their life. It falls to the rest of us to guard them from harm as much as we can. Stay at home; protect the NHS; save lives.</p>",

After all, the most pressing questions have only one answer: \u201cWe don\u2019t know, so please stay at home.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, let me bring you two new podcasts. Initially, I thought them very different, but actually, they have a lot in common. First, <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000ghxl\" title=\"\">Girl Taken</a></strong>, from Radio 4. In this podcast, journalist Sue Mitchell retells a strange news story that took place in the recent past. In 2015, Rob Lawrie, a British volunteer at the Calais refugee camps, was caught smuggling a four-year-old Afghan girl called Bru over the French-English border in his van. Lawrie, a charismatic, enthusiastic man who believes in good and would do anything to help anyone, had met Bru and her father, Reza, in the Calais camp. It was a spur-of-the-moment decision on his part to take Bru with him, and he thought it would be easy: just get her into England and then deposit her with some of her relatives in Leeds. But he was caught and taken to the French courts. Astonishingly, he was let off with a suspended sentence. When he returned home, his wife had moved out and taken their kids. She couldn\u2019t believe he would do something so reckless without consulting her.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s clear that Karbaat thought that he was acting for the best and didn\u2019t tell anyone what he was up to</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mitchell, who knew Lawrie and liked him, has already made a couple of documentaries about this nutty tale, and she and he take us back through what happened. It\u2019s simultaneously gripping, touching and maddening. Lawrie is lovely, striding about the place in his red Stetson hat, but so naive, so desirous of attention. He\u2019s another child, really. Anyway, halfway through the series, things change. Lawrie receives an unexpected email, and the whole mad tale whizzes off again. It turns out that Bru\u2019s background is not what it seems, and the story that Lawrie had been told by her father is far from the truth. No spoilers, because this is a very unusual piece of reporting, worth following to the end. All the episodes are <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000ghxl/episodes/player\" title=\"\">up now on BBC Sounds</a>.</p> <p><em>Girl Taken</em><strong> </strong>did make me think, though, how lives can be utterly changed \u2013 and not for the better \u2013 by men who think that they, personally, know best. The type of chaps who forget to consult anyone else when they make a decision, whose sounding board is their own conscience and mind. Some might mean well, but good intentions don\u2019t mop up the consequences. We learn that Reza acted extremely selfishly but so, too, did Lawrie.</p> <p>Another true story podcast, <strong><a href=\"https://www.somethinelse.com/projects/the-immaculate-deception/\" title=\"\">The Immaculate Deception</a></strong>, started last week. It has a very different subject matter, and I\u2019m not revealing too much when I say it\u2019s about a Dutch infertility doctor who turned out to be all too fertile himself. By the end of episode one (other episodes will be released weekly, on a Wednesday), we know that said doctor has fathered more than 60 children; children whose mothers believed were created using sperm from either an anonymous donor, or by that of their partners, through IVF. These children are now grown up and call themselves Karbastards (the doctor\u2019s name was Jan Karbaat). We are led through the story by writer Jenny Kleeman, who, like Mitchell in <em>Girl Taken</em>, is an excellent, careful presenter. She talks to Joey, one of Karbaat\u2019s children, who sensed that something was wrong throughout his life \u2013 even though his mother was convinced that her husband, his dad, was his biological father.</p> <p>Oh, but the doctor was \u201ccharming, empathic\u201d, according to one of the mothers; he told his clients what to do and they did it. Even at this early stage, it\u2019s clear that Karbaat, too, thought that he was acting for the best and didn\u2019t tell anyone what he was up to. Hmmm. Beware those action men who never ask for advice.</p> <h2>Three calming podcasts</h2> <p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/gaba/id1480815448\" title=\"\">Gaba</a><br>A highly original podcast offering a mix of meditation, soundscape and soul-baring.

Likewise, Plouffe is mindful of political identification serving as social glue and identity.</p> <p>As he frames things: \u201cIf November comes and persuadable voters testify\u201d that Trump drives them \u201ccrazy with tweets\u201d, view him as a \u201cterrible person\u201d, but conclude that the president has been \u201cOK on the economy and the Democrats want to turn us into a socialist country\u201d, Trump will probably return to power.</p> <p>To be sure, the economy is no longer fine: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MorabitoCM/status/1240097382886453249\">Black Plague 2.0</a> is never a good look.

Reality is stripping Trump\u2019s theatrics bare.</p> <p>Yet Trump was never simply a candidate. He led a movement. How all this affects his support is an open question. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWFgqnisSsk\">Breaking up is hard to do</a>.</p> <p>Understandably, Plouffe takes heart from the midterms which saw the Democrats recapture the House of Representatives. That was about Democrats building on their traditional base of liberal voters, minorities and graduate degree holders, making inroads with suburbanites and white women and ginning up those who go to the polls less frequently.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/mi/michigan_trump_vs_biden-6761.html\">Michigan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/pa/pennsylvania_trump_vs_biden-6861.html\">Pennsylvania</a>, which went for Trump, are again leaning Democratic. <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/az/arizona_trump_vs_biden-6807.html\">Arizona</a>, which last voted blue in 1996, may be fertile territory for Biden.

On the other hand, participation in Illinois dropped markedly.</p> <p>Looking ahead, voting by mail may emerge as the rule, not the exception. Disease and social distancing are altering how we live and vote. Our country and democracy are in transition.</p> <p>Plouffe has publicly acknowledged Biden\u2019s vulnerability with younger voters. On that score, his concerns are to a point well-placed.</p> <p>Biden won less than 40% of <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/elections/2020/primary-results/voter-analysis?state=IL\">Illinois Democrats</a> under the age of 45 even as he took nearly three-in-five older voters. Michigan told a similar story. But Sanders was no pied piper. Although he won younger voters, the Vermont senator did not electrify them. In all fairness, elections are an older person\u2019s game.</p> <p>Plouffe offers no foolproof method for energizing young Americans. The environment is a major concern for this bloc, but issues don\u2019t axiomatically translate into votes. Just a hunch: survival in the face of a plague may take priority.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/16/dark-towers-review-deutsche-bank-donald-trump\">Dark Towers review: Deutsche Bank, Donald Trump and a must-read mystery</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unfortunately, Plouffe can come close to broad-brushing Trump supporters as irredeemably deplorable.

Sydney\u2019s famous Bondi Beach, from Australian Associated Press.</p> \n  <p>The New South Wales government has temporarily closed Bondi Beach as authorities handed lifesavers unprecedented move-on powers amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p>NSW Police David Elliott announced the drastic measure on Saturday afternoon after photos of throngs of beachgoers flocking to the iconic Sydney strip drew swift condemnation.</p> \n  <p>Thousands flocked to Bondi Beach on Friday amid temperatures in the high 30s, ignoring social distancing measures.</p> \n  <p>Pictures of big crowds were criticised by foreign media and on social media.</p> \n  <p>The decision comes as the number of coronavirus cases in NSW ballooned to 436 after 83 new cases were identified in the state.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a significant level of disappointment that we have to move today to not only remove people from Bondi Beach and it\u2019s a significant opportunity to remind people that the Health Act must be complied with,\u201d Mr Elliott said.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat we saw this morning at Bondi Beach was the most irresponsible behaviour of individuals that we\u2019ve seen so far.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe cannot have an area where more than 500 people are gathered.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Under regulations introduced to control the spread of the deadly virus, outdoor gatherings of 500 people or more have been banned.</p> \n  <p>As part of that, lifesavers will have the power to close beaches and ask people to move on if a crowd of 500 or more is gathered at the same spot.</p> \n  <p>The minister said that if the crowd does not comply, NSW Police will have the powers to make people leave.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis is not something we\u2019re doing because we\u2019re the fun police, this is not something that the government is doing because we want to make life easy, this is about saving lives,\u201d Mr Elliott said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cTomorrow in NSW we will probably crack 500 cases of coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIf the community does not comply with the regulations and the health warnings, this is going to become the new norm.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe are going to close down the type of activities we\u2019ve grown to love.\u201d</p> \n  <p>It came as Waverley mayor Paula Masselos on Saturday issued a public plea for people to stay away from Bondi amid the coronavirus pandemic and away from beaches.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe public must at all times keep a minimum safe distance from each other in public places and if you don\u2019t need to be out in public, please consider staying at home,\u201d Mr Masselos said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe all have a role to play in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and I am frustrated that people continue to ignore health advice about social distancing as observed yesterday at Bondi Beach.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt also hit out at people who flouted social distancing advice and risked spreading the virus.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat happened in Bondi was unacceptable and the local council must take steps to stop that occurring,\u201d Mr Hunt said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cEach of us as individuals, as families, as groups, as councils, as state governments, as a national government has responsibility.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhere something like this is occurring the local council must step in and that message is absolutely clear.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e75912d8f08dcc95cc2077b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/justinmccurry\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\">

about the new cases reported in South Korea today:<br></p> \n  <p>The 147 new coronavirus cases reported in South Korea on Friday - bringing the country\u2019s total to 8,799 - was <strong>the second-highest number of daily positive diagnoses this week</strong>, following 152 identified on Wednesday, according to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).<br><br>The pace of daily new infections had shown signs of slowing since the second week of this month after health authorities finished testing 210,000 followers of a secretive church that was at the centre of the country\u2019s outbreak.<br><br>Just over 100 of the new daily cases were from Daegu, the southeastern city where the church is located, and nearby North Gyeongsang province. The two locations account for about 60% of all of South Korea\u2019s Covid-19 infections. <br><br>There is concern, however, over a rise in infections in Seoul and among people arriving from overseas, Yonhap news agency said.<br><br>Seoul reported 15 additional cases and nearby Gyeonggi Province 12, while the number among people arriving in the country rose by six to 23.<br><br>In response, South Korea will require all arrivals from European countries to get tested for the virus and self-isolate for two weeks starting Sunday, Yonhap said, adding that temporary shelters had been set up to accommodate up to 1,000 European travelers while they wait for their test results.<br><br>South Korean health authorities have won praise for their mass testing regime, which has enabled them to quickly identify infection clusters. The number of people being checked for the virus and under quarantine came to 15,704 as of Friday, the KCDC said.
