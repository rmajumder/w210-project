Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest news:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>More than 40 Tory MPs have now called for Dominic Cummings to go. </strong>With Downing Street continuing to defend him, the senior government minister Penny Mordaunt also said there were \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in Cummings\u2019 account of his actions and apologised to her constituents for how recent days were distracting from key public health messages. The former de facto deputy prime minister Damian Green criticised Cummings, but stopped short of calling for him to go.</li> \n   <li><strong>The former home secretary, Amber Rudd, added her voice to those calling for Cummings\u2019 departure.</strong> Rudd, who stood down as an MP in December, told ITV\u2019s Peston programme that Cummings\u2019 continued presence in No 10 was making the government\u2019s job more difficult at a time of national crisis.</li> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson said an independent inquiry into Dominic Cummings\u2019 actions wouldn\u2019t be a good use of official time.</strong> The PM was grilled on the Cummings affair and his government\u2019s response to the pandemic by the powerful liaison committee. Under forensic questioning and several times facing the charges of putting political concerns before the nation\u2019s health and of underestimating the public\u2019s anger, the prime minister said it was time to \u201cmove on\u201d from the \u201cvery frustrating\u201d episode. He also didn\u2019t give a clear answer on whether he was saying that if people don\u2019t have access to childcare they could do what Cummings did.</li> \n   <li><strong>The NHS test and trace programme goes live at 9am on Thursday.</strong> If you get a call from a contact tracer because you\u2019ve been in contact with an infected person, you must isolate for 14 days, even if you don\u2019t have symptoms. The government has said these instructions must be followed. Though they will be voluntary at first, they will be made mandatory if necessary. \u201cIt\u2019s your civic duty to follow test and trace instructions,\u201d Matt Hancock said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Officers are reporting people breaking lockdown rules and using Dominic Cummings as an excuse, the West Midlands police and crime commissioner said. </strong>David Jamieson told the BBC in the last few days the public has pushed back and the police\u2019s ability to enforce the rules has been undermined. He said people are telling officers that \u201cif it is OK for Cummings, it is OK for us\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Most people now believe there is \u201cone rule for them, and one rule for us\u201d after Cummings remained in post despite breaching the lockdown, a government adviser said. </strong>Prof Stephen Reicher, who advises the government on human behaviour during disease outbreaks. He has told Channel 4 News: \u201cAnd all the research on compliance with authority shows that it depends critically on thinking that authority is part of us, is with us, is for us. And so, once you create that sense of \u2018us and them\u2019, you undermine trust and you undermine compliance.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>If you\u2019d like to read yet more, head over to our global pandemic live blog, which is still running:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/27/coronavirus-live-news-spain-begins-10-days-of-mourning-as-global-deaths-near-350000\">Coronavirus live news: US deaths from Covid-19 have passed 100,000</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T23:08:13.779Z\">at 12.08am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eceec948f0898700351d890\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T22:42:23.505Z\">11.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>McGuinness said Cummings\u2019 actions had undermined the goodwill needed to maintain the lockdown.

It is vital that adequate support is on hand, to enable all directors of public health and Public Health England consultants leading these local systems, to deliver this effectively.</p> \n   <p>The safety of the public and key workers is paramount and given the limits of the test itself, self-isolation of those with symptoms and their contacts is even more vital. This will require good communication with the public at a national level.</p> \n   <p>Establishing local test, track and trace is a step in the right direction but will require significant resources, monitoring and vigilance to ensure that it is working effectively across the country.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eced6db8f087e3ca0f64ac8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T21:22:08.609Z\">10.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Alicia Kearns</strong>, the Tory MP for Rutland and Melton, is another to criticise Cummings, while stopping short of calling for his departure.

I relentlessly pressed for more information to get the facts of what happened, I believed that was the least the British people were owed. On Monday, we received more of the information that residents had been calling for: I wish this information had been made available at an earlier time.</p> \n   <p>I do not support Mr Cummings\u2019 actions. I would not have done the same.</p> \n   <p>Mr Cummings believed he was protecting his family, and not just from his fear of not being able to care for his child, but from the abuse his family was enduring at their home. I know what it is to be a worried parent, but his actions have caused much disappointment.</p> \n   <p>Mr Cummings has accepted that he could have done better. I agree.</p> \n   <p>With regards to his travelling to County Durham, he was acting within the very limits of what Deputy Chief Medical Advisor Dr Harries OBE set out at the daily televised press conference on 24th March when she said \u2018clearly if you have adults that are unable to look after a small child, that is an exceptional circumstance\u2019.</p> \n   <p>It is for the police, not me, to determine whether Mr Cummings breached the lockdown guidelines.

Leaving women behind means we risk no economic recovery at all.</p> \n   <p>What this study shows is that we are going backwards and that is extremely worrying. There is also the real prospect of two-tier workplaces as the lockdown is eased with men getting back into work and women still left at home caring for children, without nursery places or schools fully open for months. </p> \n   <p>Government must now prioritise strategic investment to create a childcare infrastructure, reform parental leave, to equalise parenting in a child\u2019s first year and normalise flexible and remote working in the post-Covid economy.

  "<p>A loophole in government guidance has caused some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable people to lose up to 60% of their income and is now forcing many to put their health at risk as lockdown comes to an end, one of the UK\u2019s biggest charities has warned.</p> <p>Around 2.5 million UK residents, hundreds of thousands of whom are in employment, have been identified by the government as being \u201cextremely clinically vulnerable\u201d.

She is currently furloughed but is expected back at work on 19 June. \u201cI watch the daily broadcast every single night waiting for something, but I\u2019ve heard nothing about people with illnesses who work,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know which way to turn: do I go back to work and take the chance?\u201d</p> <p>Around 118,000 people have bought employment cases through Citizens Advice since lockdown began. More than a quarter of those shielding had lost 60% of their income since the coronavirus outbreak began. Four in 10 have lost at least 20%.&nbsp;</p> <p>Some had been denied access to the furlough scheme. Others were initially furloughed but have since been asked to return to frontline roles as shop workers and delivery drivers, and felt unable to refuse.&nbsp;</p> <p>The government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/vulnerable-not-exempt-from-coronavirus-furlough-winding-down-employers-told\">told charities</a> and social enterprise employers that when it brings the coronavirus job retention scheme to a close, there will be no exemption for vulnerable workers.</p> <p>Sarah, a mother of two, has been told her three-year-old daughter must shield due to asthma and allergies.

And now they\u2019re confused and that makes them angry and I think that will have consequences.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo when he thinks, as any of us working in government must, \u2018am I adding here, am I helping?\u2019 he can only conclude that his presence is making things worse at a time when we\u2019re already in a crisis.\u201d </p> \n<p>Johnson and most of his cabinet ministers have stood behind Cummings, saying his actions were legal and reasonable, and something that any father would do out of concern for their child\u2019s welfare.</p> \n<p>Danny Kruger, a former No 10 aide and new Conservative MP, raised the stakes in Cummings\u2019 defence by telling colleagues in a note that demands for his resignation were tantamount to a vote of no confidence in the prime minister.</p> \n<p>At the liaison committee, Johnson said he had seen evidence proving some of the allegations made against Cummings are false, but he refused to publish that evidence or hand it over to the cabinet secretary. His chief adviser has strenuously denied claims he returned to Durham on 19 April, in what would have been another potential breach of the guidelines on travelling.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-key-workers\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus-key-workers</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>But Johnson refused calls by the chair of the public accounts committee, Meg Hillier, to release that evidence to the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, or for it to be published.</p> \n<p>Johnson said: \u201cI think, actually, that it would not be doing my job if I were now to shuffle this problem into the hands of officials who, as I think the public would want, working flat out to deal with coronavirus.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson has also sought to blame the media for misreporting of Cummings\u2019 actions, despite No 10 having weeks to respond to allegations against him. One senior cabinet source told the Guardian that they disagreed with the prime minister\u2019s attacks on the media for pursuing the Cummings story, saying the&nbsp;press should not be blamed for doing its job.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"33b27498-b467-4c86-a391-0263dc48c7c8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/knXsKciv63s?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Attempting to defuse public anger,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/robert-jenrick\">Robert Jenrick</a>, the communities secretary, said on Tuesday that anyone could do the same as Cummings in similar circumstances, even though his actions have provoked uproar, with polls suggesting that the majority of people believe he should resign.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf there are no other options, if you don\u2019t have ready access to childcare, then you can do as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominic-cummings\">Dominic Cummings</a>&nbsp;chose to do,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.</p> \n<p>However, Jenrick said it was not possible for any fines already issued to people for driving to seek childcare to be reviewed, contrary to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/vicars-query-over-lockdown-travel-fines-challenges-hancock\">suggestions from Matt Hancock</a>, the health secretary, on Tuesday. \u201cThere isn\u2019t going to be a formal review.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/watch/mcmillions\">McMillions (Sky Documentaries)</a> is McMazing. McHonestly. You will hardly believe your McEyes and McEars. I advise, as with the viewing of all the best true-crime documentary series, a stiff drink before, during and after. You need to be both braced and blurred to be truly receptive to it all.</p> <p>The central question is set within the first few minutes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/03/mcmillions-bizarre-story-how-one-man-stole-24m-mcdonalds-hbo\">the six-part series</a>, and with it the tone. Between 1989 and 2001, the filmmakers James Lee Hernandez and Brian Lazarte inform us, there were \u201calmost no legitimate winners\u201d of any of the high-value prizes (cars, boats, $1m cash) in the promotional Monopoly games that McDonald\u2019s ran for customers over two decades. \u201cHow crazy bullshit is that?\u201d says the beaming FBI agent at the centre of the investigation that uncovered the scam.</p> <p>His name is Doug Mathews, and Hernandez and Lazarte must praise his name every day: he is a gift to the camera and possibly the least filtered speaker in the history of law enforcement. It is fascinating to watch someone hover so near the border between joyously magnetic and absolutely unbearable \u2013 part labrador puppy, part the most annoying kid in class. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the hardest-working agents I\u2019ve ever met. But he can talk forever,\u201d says fellow agent Janet Pellicciotti. \u201cYou kinda want to keep him sedated,\u201d says his boss.</p> <p>In 2001 Mathews was a new agent, bounding around the FBI office in Jacksonville, Florida. The main business was investigating medical and insurance fraud in a state packed full of retirement homes. \u201cI\u2019m bored to death of this healthcare garbage,\u201d explains Mathews. So when he saw a half-buried Post-it note on his boss\u2019s desk reading \u201cMcDonald\u2019s Monopoly fraud?\u201d he snatched it up and ran with it.</p> <p>It led to a source who told them that the three previous $1m prize-winners may all have had different surnames, but they belonged to the same family. The district attorney, a man as unflappable as Mathews is excitable, Mark B Devereaux, got interested. \u201cIn my world,\u201d he notes, \u201cyou don\u2019t believe in coincidences very much.\u201d</p> <p>The game was afoot. After some debate, they summoned McDonald\u2019s company representatives to Jacksonville to tell them the very, very bad news that they had been scammed, possibly for years, possibly for millions and millions of dollars. Mathews wore a gold suit to the meeting. Looking back, he thinks now it might have been a mistake. But the meeting was \u201cso boring!\u201d And so long! \u201cI might have been hungry twice!\u201d</p> <p>McDonald\u2019s was not involved. But the question of who could be was stymied by the lack of the normal records and documentation that is usually available in a fraud case. But, as luck would have it, McDonald\u2019s was about to run another Monopoly game. Eventually, they agreed to go ahead and allow the FBI to monitor the whole thing. Attention turned to the exploration of everyone in the chain from the production of the Monopoly pieces at an apparently secure printworks, to their final distribution.</p> <p>From there, the story and the investigation exploded. It involved an undercover operation led by \u2013 who else? \u2013 Mathews, fake commercials and trips to Vegas, rank amateurism and organised crime, reluctant and eager participants, duffle bags of money, a tiny dog with a foul temper, a mob widow and much, much more.</p> <p>It is the characters who carry the series, which is remarkably unstylish in execution and rushes through parts of the investigation where you might have preferred it to linger, and lingers where you might have preferred it to pick up the pace a little. Re-enactments are mostly limited to suited men sitting round boardroom tables with their backs to camera. There is some footage of the \u201ccommercials\u201d made by Mathews\u2019 undercover FBI film crew, recording winners\u2019 accounts of how they came by their prizes in order to check and challenge their versions later, but there is almost as much time spent screening old McDonald\u2019s adverts and pictures of the outlets of the era. In a crime documentary, a little nostalgia goes a long way. After that, it just gets in the way of the story.</p> <p>But it is a great story, made even greater by the fact that there is no harrowing suffering, no death, no catastrophic miscarriage of justice shown to be the result of systemic corruption as featured in much of this genre. Defrauding multi-billion dollar companies of some millions is about all I can emotionally bear right now. Plus, unlike many of its predecessors, it comes with a satisfying conclusion. The people who broke the rules get caught and are given commensurate punishment. Although I think that too counts as nostalgia now.</p>",
  "<p>Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 28 May.</p> \n<h2>Top stories</h2> \n<p><strong>The&nbsp;New South Wales&nbsp;government has quietly paid out millions of dollars to more than a dozen former schoolchildren who it admits were abused by a paedophile</strong> teacher who rose through the ranks of the state\u2019s public school system over three decades while preying on young Indigenous boys. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/28/nsw-government-secretly-paid-millions-victims-teacher-paedophile-cletus-oconnor-indigenous-men\">Since April 2018, lawyers from the state\u2019s education department have signed out-of-court settlements with 14 men from across western&nbsp;NSW</a>. The men, who are all Indigenous, are predominantly based in Dubbo.

Nor has it acknowledged the existence of a serial paedophile in the public school system, a step that might have encouraged others to come forward.</p> \n<p><strong>360 people have been arrested in Hong Kong, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/hong-kong-trump-china-security-crackdown-protests\">as thousands of armed police clashed with demonstrators</a> engaged in day-long protests,</strong> sparked by China\u2019s plans to introduce sweeping anti-sedition laws in the former British territory.

Faubert, capped once by France in 2006, was an injury-prone winger who had made only eight appearances for West Ham since joining from Bordeaux in 2007 and was not the type of player who usually attracted the attention of one of Europe\u2019s most famous clubs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/09/psgs-record-198m-splurge-on-neymar-will-stand-for-years-as-symbol-of-crisis\">PSG's record \u00a3198m splurge on Neymar will stand for years as symbol of crisis | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI called a friend in Spain,\u201d says Le M\u00e9e, taking up the story of one of the most infamous transfers of all time. \u201cI said: \u2018Look, somebody from Real Madrid called me about Faubert.

One survivor vividly described his inability to show intimacy towards his children, including not feeling comfortable bathing them as infants or allowing them to hug him or sit on his lap.</p> <p>Another told the Guardian he had been unable to maintain intimate relationships throughout his life as a result of the abuse, and described lifelong alcohol abuse beginning about the age of 12 when he said he would drink before school because it was \u201cthe only way I could escape as I had nobody at home to help me\u201d.</p> <p>Though the victims have received financial settlements and an acknowledgement of the abuse from the Department of Education, the men who spoke to the Guardian feel justice has not and perhaps never can be done.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These poor blokes are going to have a harder time showing economic loss because of the reality of what it means to be Aboriginal in Australia</p> <footer> <cite>Jason Parkinson, lawyer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like throwing a rock into a river,\u201d one survivor said. \u201cHow do you stop the ripples? And how do you stop the rock from sinking?</p> <p>\u201cWe lost our education from the abuse, we lost a lot of things. Their apologies hasn\u2019t helped.\u201d</p> <p>Jason Parkinson, a lawyer from Porters Lawyers who specialises in child abuse cases, said race and class play a significant role in determining settlement payments because, while general damages were guided by common law, payments made on the basis of economic loss took individual circumstances into account.<strong><br><br></strong>\u201cEconomic loss is the big-ticket item but it\u2019s personal to each individual\u2019s case,\u201d he said. <br><br>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the tragedy of these cases. Generally, because of the way Australian society is, these poor blokes are going to have a harder time showing economic loss because of the reality of what it means to be Aboriginal in Australia. Generally speaking, if you\u2019re from a well-off family with high-achieving parents and siblings, and you were sexually abused by a Catholic priest, you\u2019re going to have an easier time showing economic loss because of your changed circumstances.<br><br>\u201cAnother thing is that, virtually as soon as you go to jail you\u2019re stuffed for economic loss. So even though a person was pushed down the wrong path because of the abuse, it hurts them later when negotiating an economic loss settlement.\u201d <br><br>Parkinson makes a point of issuing a writ to the supreme court on every case \u201cto show that we\u2019re serious\u201d but said it wasn\u2019t unusual for cases like the one uncovered by the Guardian to never reach a courtroom. <strong><br><br></strong>\u201cIf I was a defendant\u2019s lawyer, the first thing I would do is look to see whether the plaintiff has the hallmarks of child sexual abuse, a history of depression, PTSD, alcoholism \u2013 all of that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when that is recorded throughout the medical records I\u2019m going to say, \u2018OK, I\u2019m satisfied that happened,\u2019 because you can\u2019t fake that.<br><br>\u201cThen when you see there\u2019s another 14 of these men that\u2019s when you say, \u2018OK, on the balance of probabilities our guy did it and he\u2019s our agent, let\u2019s settle this before it gets to court.\u2019<strong><br><br></strong>\u201cIt\u2019s never simple, but the reason you\u2019re not seeing cases where people ride up the courthouse steps on a white steed to have their day in court is that the defendants know they\u2019re done for and they settle for enough money before it reaches that stage.\u201d</p> <p>The Department of Education did not answer questions about what steps it had taken to investigate the claims before it had agreed to settle the cases, saying they were subject to privilege. But documents seen by Guardian Australia show the department unequivocally accepted the abuse occurred.</p> <p>In a statement, a spokesman for the department said: \u201cWe agreed to settle cases consistent with the requirements of the NSW government\u2019s 19 principles for handling such cases and the model litigant policy. The requirements include settling them out of court and utilising a trauma-informed approach.</p> <p>\u201cThe model litigant policy provides we settle claims promptly, pay legitimate claims without litigation, and endeavour to avoid litigation where possible.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Do you know more? michael.mcgowan@theguardian.com</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636.

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far.

  "<p>It has become a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/27/boris-johnson-mop-no-10-media-public\" title=\"\">commonplace</a> to observe that Boris Johnson does not welcome close scrutiny of his decisions and actions. During his premiership, the depth of his antipathy to normal procedures of parliamentary accountability has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue\" title=\"\">repeatedly demonstrated</a>. Even in the midst of a pandemic, the prime minister has remained elusive. Until the crisis over his chief adviser\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/22/dominic-cummings-durham-trip-coronavirus-lockdown\" title=\"\">flouting of lockdown rules</a> engulfed the government, Mr Johnson had presented only two of the daily Downing Street press conferences since late April.</p> <p>This unwillingness to engage would have made Wednesday\u2019s interrogation by the House of Commons liaison committee a significant and revealing moment, even before the recent revelations that Dominic Cummings broke the government\u2019s own lockdown rules. The liaison body is the only MPs\u2019 committee with the right to question the prime minister, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/boris-johnson-to-face-minimal-questions-on-cummings-conduct\" title=\"\">it had been trying in vain</a> to exercise it since the autumn. After repeated cancellations, Mr Johnson belatedly agreed to turn up after the Brexiter luminary, Sir Bernard Jenkin, was appointed as chair last month.</p> <p>The spectacle which ensued vividly illustrated why the prime minister had been so keen to stay away. Mr Johnson\u2019s trademark technique of offering bluster and rhetorical flourishes in lieu of detailed responses was on display throughout. Questioned by Jeremy Hunt on the failure to ramp up testing targets until April, he failed properly to explain the lethal lack of urgency. It remains unclear whether, when the new test-and-trace regime takes effect, there will be sanctions for those who ignore advice to self-isolate.</p> <p>But inevitably it was the Cummings affair \u2013 and Mr Johnson\u2019s determination to both defend and retain his senior adviser \u2013 which transformed this occasion into a test of the prime minister\u2019s leadership and priorities, at a time when national unity and public trust in government is paramount. His performance was characteristically blithe and depressingly inadequate.</p> <p>Flying in the face of every opinion poll, the prime minister suggested that the public wanted to \u201cmove on\u201d, having heard, he said, quite enough \u201cautobiography\u201d when it came to Mr Cummings. He rejected the idea that his adviser\u2019s decision to follow his own lockdown rules could lead other people to do the same, placing lives at risk. A cabinet inquiry into the episode, he judged, would be \u201ca waste of time\u201d, and claimed to have seen evidence of Mr Cummings\u2019 movements but refused to elaborate. The prime minister\u2019s stonewalling was such that it prompted one Conservative MP to tell him: \u201cFrankly no one understands why you hold these views.\u201d</p> <p>The explanation, clearly, is that Mr Johnson has no intention of doing without his most valued official, even at the cost of losing public trust during a national emergency. The majority of the public think that Mr Cummings broke the rules, should resign or be sacked, and that his actions have compromised government messaging. As the country begins the fraught process of easing lockdown, a fraying of a sense of collective responsibility would be disastrous, but the prime minister is willing to risk it.</p> <p>The manner and content of his responses to the liaison committee were of a piece with the approach which has served him so well on his journey to Downing Street. The brazen willingness to obfuscate and bluff it out; the indifference to ordinary standards of accountability and the absence of detail all belong to a political style which treats dissent, or even scrutiny, with contempt. Partly thanks to Mr Cummings\u2019 divisive presence in Downing Street, this has become the government\u2019s modus operandi. But as the Conservative MP, Peter Bone, recently <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/opinion/columnists/boris-johnson-analysis-1922-committee-tory-mps-coronavirus-crisis-2855468\" title=\"\">warned</a>, it is not possible to run a government like \u201ca Vote Leave campaign\u201d. The refusal not only to sack Mr Cummings, but even to express regret for his behaviour, amounts to a crisis of leadership and authority at the top of British politics.</p>",

George screamed. Screamed for his mother. Screamed for his breath. For his life.</p> <p>For many watching the footage, George\u2019s cries echoed Eric Garner\u2019s \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d New York police department officer Daniel Pantaleo killed Garner a couple of weeks before a Ferguson police officer killed Michael Brown. George\u2019s plea reminds me of another black man shot by police: Eric Harris. In 2015, Tulsa reserve deputy Robert Bates told Harris \u201cfuck your breath\u201d.&nbsp;That same year, Fairfax county law enforcement tased Natasha McKenna four times while she sought help during a mental health crisis. As they were brutalizing her, she said, \u201cYou promised you wouldn\u2019t kill me.\u201d For me, the image of the white officer kneeling into George\u2019s back reminds me most of Freddie Gray. Baltimore police severed Gray\u2019s spine through an intentional rough ride in the back of a police van.</p> <p>George, like <a href=\"https://www.vibe.com/2020/05/sean-reed-black-man-killed-by-indianapolis-police\">Dreasjon Reed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/police-killing-of-breonna-taylor-fuels-calls-to-end-no-knock-warrants-11590332400\">Breonna Taylor</a> and other black people killed by police this year, should be alive and breathing. This cycle \u2013 murder, protest, calls for justice, non-indictments \u2013 is revelatory. We must join others to reduce police power before, during and after these viral killings. Police reform is not enough. We need abolition.</p> <p>In recent years, news stories broke about how Immigrations and Customs Enforcement use raids, detentions and deportations to threaten immigrants in the US. Calls to \u201cAbolish Ice\u201d could be heard from the streets to the halls of Congress. Ironically, there were no calls to have more Latino and black Ice agents. Mayors did not call for community-driven deportation or raids, like we see for community policing. Non-profits did not call to strengthen relationships between border patrol and immigrants; cities did not fund Ice and ice-cream trucks to pass out treats to immigrant children. Liberals did not point out that there were good apples and bad apples in border patrol enforcement. These programs cannot reform Ice, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/10/15/alex-vitale-interview-the-end-of-policing/\">nor can they reform police.</a></p> <p>If we can understand that the calls to abolish Ice actually means that this country needs a new, transformational immigration system, then why dismiss police abolition as a viable option for a transformative society?&nbsp;</p> <p>One major difference is the mainstream narrative around dreamers: immigrants hoping for a better life and fleeing persecution and violence in their homeland. To be clear, the fight for immigrant justice is crucial and inseparable from the fight against racial police violence. Immigrants, especially undocumented black immigrants, are vulnerable to police violence and face the risk of prison, deportation and death. Yet black Americans, like indigenous and First Nations people, represent particular reminders that white settlers looted land, committed genocide and enslaved people to build a democracy. As a result, black and indigenous bodies remain a public nuisance to be disappeared, exploited, imprisoned and killed by white people and police alike. They want us to live in constant fear of those possibilities for a reason. Thus, black resistance matters, against police and white supremacy alike.</p> <p>Abolitionist organizers in Minnesota are informed by a history of resistance that dates back to&nbsp;1867 when the Minneapolis police department was first formed to surveil black people and Native Americans. Since then, MPD has murdered or beaten black people \u201csavagely\u201d for acts ranging from inviting white women to a dance to refusing to \u201cmove on\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.mpd150.com/wp-content/themes/mpd150/assets/mpd150_report.pdf\">Per a report </a>by MPD150, the Minneapolis police department has garnered several accolades over time, including the nation\u2019s most homophobic police department at one point. In recent memory, officers in the city arrested black people at rates 10 times higher than white people for the same offenses.</p> <p>After a Minneapolis police department officer shot and killed Jamar Clark in 2015, activists occupied their local police department for more than two weeks. This activism spurred organizing that continued after the cameras went away. Through struggle, organizations like MPD150 and Reclaim the Block pushed the mayor and city council to shift more than <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/11/30/mpls-budget-amendment-removes-million-dollars-police\">$1m from police departments </a>to communities. Unquestionably, this organizing since 2015 influenced the mayor\u2019s unprecedented decision to ensure that the police chief fired all four officers responsible for George Floyd\u2019s killing, almost immediately after it happened.&nbsp;</p> <p>The story is not over. On Tuesday night, <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-nw-minneapolis-protests-george-floyd-20200527-ix72khibnvayjcelxpmbo6uvc4-story.html\">MPD teargassed</a> and shot rubber bullets at protesters who took to the streets to decry the murder. The fact that residents were willing to risk their lives during a global pandemic to protest against this injustice demonstrates that the race is not given to the swift nor the strong, but to the organizers who resist until the end.</p> <ul> <li><p>Derecka Purnell is a movement lawyer, activist and Guardian US columnist.</p></li> </ul>",

She was released in June following a preliminary hearing for the new trial at the Old Bailey after prosecutors accepted her plea to manslaughter.</p> <p>She was sentenced to nine years and four months for manslaughter, but released after the judge concluded she had already served her sentence.</p> <p>In a ruling on Wednesday, the judge Paul Matthews concluded that a rule barring people who kill from inheriting their victim\u2019s estate should be waived in her case. His decision followed a high court hearing in Bristol earlier this month.</p> <p>Challen had been in a relationship with her former car dealer husband for about 40 years, since she was 15 and he was 22, and they had two sons, the judge heard.

He would ignore her complaints about his behaviour or insist that she was mistaken and that she had not seen what she said she had seen,\u201d the ruling added.</p> <p>Challen had considered suicide after killing her husband and had left a note saying she could not live without him.</p> <p>\u201cThese facts are extraordinary, tragic, and, one would hope, rare,\u201d the judge said.</p> <p>\u201cThey lasted 40 years and involved the combination of a submissive personality on which coercive control worked, a man prepared to use that coercive control, a lack of friends or other sources of assistance, an enormous dependency upon him by [Challen], and significant psychiatric illness.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/29/coercive-control-and-domestic-abuse-what-might-have-saved-hannah-clarke-and-her-children\">Coercive control and domestic abuse: what might have saved Hannah Clarke and her children?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He added her husband had \u201cundoubtedly contributed significantly\u201d to the circumstances in which he died, and said he considered without his \u201cappalling behaviour over so many years\u201d she would not have killed him.</p> <p>He left no will, and a major asset, the home they shared, had been jointly owned.</p> <p>Every case had to be decided on its merits, and not all victims of coercive control would necessarily be able to inherit, the judge said. \u201cI emphasise that the facts of this terrible case are so extraordinary, with such a fatal combination of conditions and events, that I would not expect them easily to be replicated in any other,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The ruling means that Challen, and not the couple\u2019s sons, would inherit.

  "<p>Empty offices and restaurants in the city of Sydney are driving hungry rats into homes and suburbs, and the loosening of restrictions could create \u201ca new rat plague\u201d, according to a leading rat-catcher.</p> <p>As city centres have closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, suburban rat infestations have spiked, according to Geoff Milton, a Sydney rat-catcher with 35 years\u2019 experience.</p> <p>Rats naturally seek out houses during winter, and the sudden drop-off in food and rubbish in our cities is exacerbating the problem.

The rats we have in the centre of Sydney are the same species as in New York \u2026 They are wholly dependent on us. If they produce babies they can\u2019t support, they kill them.

They will not let a meal of another rat go by.\u201d</p> <p>Milton said this had driven rats into new areas.</p> <p>\u201cThey have moved into the suburbs, closer to residential now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are having a big spike in residential rodent control.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s got colder quicker this year as well. It is coming on to winter where they need somewhere warm to sleep. They usually get into roof voids in people\u2019s houses, because they can climb up brick walls or they can leap from overhanging trees above peoples\u2019 houses. They can leap about three or four foot.\u201d</p> <p>However, Banks said that people should not worry about hordes of rats in their homes, as the overall rat population would have dropped under lockdown.</p> <p>\u201cRats are probably the big losers from Covid-19,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rat population would have been knocked down a lot. It will probably be a pretty typical winter. There are not going to be waves of rats running across the suburbs trying to get into people\u2019s houses.</p> <p>\u201cBut people will be seeing them in houses now, because that is the only place where there is food.

But if we are out in springtime or late winter, out there spilling food, they will be there to exploit it.\u201d</p> <p>Milton agreed.</p> <p>\u201cThere will probably be a new plague of rats take over the city,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a lot of the ones that are left unattended in suburbia will stay there. They usually eat dog food and all that, because people leave dog kibble out all night. They\u2019ve got ready made meals really.\u201d</p> <p>Banks said that rats would \u201cbe back\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat they do is, the adults just stop having babies. The mortality rates will go up, but there will be survivors. There will be some who get by.

The instant halving of the number of referees will come at a cost though; Belinda Sharpe, who made history as the first woman to referee an NRL game in July, is among those relegated to the touchline. Yet fans have been left to ponder whether these highly qualified touchies could give way to a revival of the once effective sideline official.</p> <p>New to the NRL rule book is the awarding of six additional tackles for ruck infringements. The change was trialled back in 2012 in a high-scoring Indigenous All Stars game, but shelved ever since. For current players, the new law is virtually untested and teams would be well advised to watch the early games this round to gauge how the rule will be enforced, how it may open up attacking opportunities and to what extend it could wear down defending sides, particularly in the latter stages of a game.</p> <p>Overall, player fitness is questionable \u2013 and not just in the face of the newly legislated 12-tackle set in defence. At the cessation of competition in March, players used to training as a collective were moved to a program of virtual and isolated sessions. Restrictions which prevented tackling were only lifted in the past fortnight, leaving clubs attending to the current casualties of a second, more intensive pre-season and nervous as to what injuries may be generated in the re-opening rounds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea0020e657dc19da8a37295ba9b2a5da26753148\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea0020e657dc19da8a37295ba9b2a5da26753148/0_0_2568_1711/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Parramatta\u2019s Reagan Campbell-Gillard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Parramatta\u2019s Reagan Campbell-Gillard trains during the week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Himbrechts/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Compounding the issue of fitness is the unknown effect of the lower grades (particularly NSW Cup) being cancelled for 2020. With clubs having a 30-player squad, there are enough players to draw from, but the elite grade will not be supported by a match-fit emergency talent pool as it has in the past. Further, for the first time, the club\u2019s regular starting line-up now face at least 18 consecutive rounds of play \u2013 no byes or split rounds to undergo a mid-season rejuvenation.</p> <p>By far the most controversial of the Covid contingencies is the reduction of NRL grounds in use and the lack of fans in attendance. Nearly 20 traditional home grounds have been reduced to just six through to round nine with five teams \u2013 Brisbane, North Queensland, Parramatta, Melbourne and West Tigers \u2013 to play out of their traditional home grounds. For these teams, particularly the Storm and Cowboys who have the luxury of not sharing their base, the decision is likely to provide a huge logistical advantage at the very least.</p> <p>While the NRL embarks on its next mission \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/25/nrl-targets-1-july-for-crowds-to-return-to-stadiums\">to have spectators return by 1 July</a> \u2013 the home advantage of once-feared fortresses will be examined in a new light, given they continue to be void of spectators. Of the eight teams with the highest winning percentage at home over the past five years, Melbourne, Brisbane and Parramatta look to have the advantage in retaining their traditional home ground, but will these statistics hold true in 2020?</p> <p>Germany\u2019s Bundesliga, the first European football league to return to competition during the pandemic, tells a different tale. In the first 22 games since the competition restarted at fan-less stadiums this month, only three teams have won at home.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/27/asada-under-fire-for-six-month-delay-on-bronson-xerris-drugs-test-result\">Asada under fire for six-month delay on Bronson Xerri's drugs test result</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Undoubtedly, at a distinct disadvantage are the New Zealand Warriors who left their homeland and families to set up camp in Tamworth before moving closer to their assigned home ground in the Central Coast last week. Similarly, the Canberra Raiders have been allocated to the nearest stadium, Campbelltown, albeit two-and-a-half hours away.</p> <p>To add to the logistical headaches are interstate border restrictions that have necessitated the need for teams to fly in and out on game day. It\u2019s another unfamiliar twist for players and officials and apart from a physical toll, the mental toll resulting from the strict contingencies and complete change to usual conditions of operation is yet to be realised.</p> <p>This could be the most anticipated re-start since the NRL kicked off in 1998 following the end of the Super League era.

As one of the protesters who went there on Monday, I would like to clear up this aspect of Cummings\u2019 misinformation campaign: there was no \u201cmob\u201d of protesters outside his home, though there was perhaps a \u201cmob\u201d of paparazzi.</p> <p>On Monday, there was \u2013 at our peak \u2013 a handful of protesters quietly standing around and socially distanced on the pavement. A few of us had placards. Nobody was chanting. The police facilitating the protest confirmed we were not breaking the law and were very friendly to us. They also told us there hadn\u2019t been a protesting presence outside Cummings\u2019 home over recent days.</p> <p>When Cummings returned from his press conference, having brazenly insulted our intelligence, quite understandably he was briefly shouted at as he entered his home and the paparazzi pressed in. One of our number swore, which, given his behaviour, didn\u2019t seem that outrageous. Of course, it was this moment of high drama and jostling that made the evening news bulletins. Once he got inside we shut up, and shortly after that we all went home as it was getting dark.</p> <p>The paparazzi were perhaps more mob-like, but in my view the man has brought that level of scrutiny on himself and it is by no means disproportionate to his crime.

Like the UK\u2019s app, it operates on a centralised model allowing the country\u2019s interior ministry access to the information it gathers.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>However, it gathers much more information than most similar apps, including the location of the user, which it links directly to their name and national ID, a choice that Amnesty describes as \u201chighly problematic\u201d. It also became compulsory on 22 May, with a penalty of up to three years in prison for people found to have not downloaded it.</p> \n<p>The data-hungry approach favoured by Qatar is in stark contrast to Switzerland, which this week launched its own Covid contact-tracing app, SwissCovid, the first in the world to be built around privacy-first technology developed by Apple and Google. It operates in a \u201cdecentralised\u201d manner, with Swiss health authorities receiving no information that can be used to track the pace of the outbreak.</p> \n<p>The Swiss app is used only by essential workers since primary legislation needs to be passed by the country\u2019s MPs, which the government hopes can happen by June, before it can ben made available to the general public</p> \n<p>Other countries, including the UK and Australia, come down somewhere between Switzerland and Qatar on the amount of data they are gathering with the apps. A study from Johns Hopkins University in the US argues that may be the best position. The report,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/book/75831\">Digital Contact Tracing for Pandemic Response</a>, argues that privacy should not outweigh public health goals and other values. It also criticises Apple and Google for unilaterally setting the terms of use at a time when such broad public interests are at stake.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cTechnology companies should not alone control the terms, conditions, or capabilities of DCTT [digital contact-tracing technologies], nor should they presume to know what may be acceptable to members of the public,\u201d the report concludes, arguing that \u201cthere is insufficient evidence that public trust would be threatened by a DCTT system that has the capacity to securely collect location data, integrate public health authorities, and enable voluntary sharing of certain user data (eg location data) with those authorities.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jeffrey Kahn, the report\u2019s author, added: \u201cToo much emphasis on privacy could severely limit the ability to gather information that is critical for effective and efficient contact tracing to help beat the pandemic, and so the full range of interests and values of the public must drive this conversation\u2013and not just those asserted by tech companies.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Ann Mitchell, who has died aged 97, was a member of an elite group of women at Bletchley Park, the wartime codebreaking centre in Buckinghamshire, who played a key role in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/14/how-did-enigma-machine-work-imitation-game\" title=\"\">breaking of the German Enigma ciphers</a>. She worked in the Hut 6 Machine Room devising \u201cmenus\u201d, instructions on how to set up the Bombes, machines designed by the mathematician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/alan-turing\" title=\"\">Alan Turing</a> to speed up the codebreaking process.</p> <p><a href=\"https://bletchleypark.org.uk/roll-of-honour/9858\" title=\"\">Mitchell</a>, who studied mathematics at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, was recruited to work at Bletchley in September 1943, at a moment when the codebreaking process was being streamlined to cope with the demands that would result from the invasion of occupied Europe.</p> <p>The Machine Room, so-called because it housed the few Enigma machines that were available to the British, was originally the domain of the elite codebreakers, the vast majority of whom were male mathematicians. But in 1943 the codebreaking process was split into two, separating the initial codebreaking, henceforward to be carried out by a new section called the Watch, from the more functional process of creating the \u201cmenus\u201d for the Bombes in the Machine Room.</p> <p>Shortages of men, who were needed to fight on the frontline, and civil service rules preventing women from working on night shifts with men for reasons of \u201cdecency\u201d forced <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituarysir-stuart-milner-barry-1613199.html\" title=\"\">Stuart Milner-Barry</a>, the head of Hut 6, to staff the Machine Room entirely with women.</p> <p>He attempted to recruit enough female mathematicians to cover the three shifts required for 24-hour working. But they were few and far between and he had to supplement them with other female graduates. \u201cWhen I went up to Oxford in 1940, there were five women in the whole university who were reading maths that year,\u201d Mitchell recalled. \u201cWe were very scarce.\u201d</p> <p>Once she arrived at Bletchley Park, Mitchell was unable to tell even her parents what she was doing, other than that she was working for the Foreign Office. \u201cTo my family and friends, I had to describe it as office work,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the truth was far more interesting.\u201d</p> <p>The male codebreakers in the Watch worked out \u201ccribs\u201d, pieces of German text that might appear in the messages and passed them through a hatch to the Machine Room, where Mitchell and her colleagues devised the menus for the Bombes, and liaised with the members of the Women\u2019s Royal Naval Service, known as Wrens, who ran the menu on the Bombes, to test the potential settings.</p> <p>\u201cThe knowledge that our work was always urgent provided a constant challenge, and in Hut 6 we worked against the clock,\u201d Mitchell recalled. \u201cIt was relentless and demanding. Nevertheless, I loved the work. The Wrens working on the Bombes would telephone us when they got a stop, which would be the position at which the Bombe stopped where all the chains on your menu were accurate.\u201d</p> <p>She and her colleagues would then set up an Enigma machine and type in a message to check that the settings were correct and, if it was, pass it to the Decoding Room where members of the Women\u2019s Auxiliary Air Force used the settings to set up British Typex cipher machines adapted to operate like the Enigma machine, then typed the enciphered message into their machine, which produced the original German message.</p> <p>The women in the Machine Room also worked on messages that could not be deciphered, usually because the German operators had made an error. These messages were known as \u201cduds\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPossibly the German operator had set his machine up or copied something down wrongly,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cI helped a colleague who was a former maths teacher on these. We had fun sorting out the duds and also doing mathematical puzzles.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere were 10 or so of us working in the Machine Room. It sounds much more complicated than we found it at the time. It was fascinating, all these messages coming out in German. I loved it.\u201d</p> <p>Ann was born in Oxford. Her father, Herbert Williamson, had recently left his job as a commissioner in the Indian civil service based in Simla, the summer capital of British India. Her mother, Winifred (nee Kenyon), was a former nurse who, as assistant secretary to the Oxford Family Welfare Association, was helping to run one of Britain\u2019s earliest family planning clinics.</p> <p>At the age of seven, Ann gained a scholarship to Headington school for girls but when she opted to study mathematics at university her headmistress protested that it was \u201cnot a ladylike subject\u201d. Her parents overruled that judgment and backed her choice.</p> <p>After the war, she worked as secretary to the provost of Worcester College, Oxford, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/07/archives/sir-john-masterman-86-director-of-world-war-ii-system-of-double.html\" title=\"\">John Masterman</a>, who as a wartime member of MI5 and chairman of the Double Cross Committee was well aware of the importance of the work she did at Bletchley Park.</p> <p>She met Angus Mitchell, the son of family friends who shared her parents\u2019 backgrounds in the Indian civil service and nursing, in October 1946, when he was studying modern history at Brasenose College. After finishing his degree, he obtained a post in the Scottish Office. They married in December 1948 and moved to Edinburgh a few days after Christmas so he could start his new job in January. They couple had four children, Jonathan, Charlotte, Catherine and Andy.</p> <p>Mitchell\u2019s life in Edinburgh was spent initially raising her family. In the late 1950s, she trained as a marriage guidance counsellor which led to an <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1099-0860.1987.tb00318.x\" title=\"\">interest in the effects of divorce on children</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI noticed that the focus of failing marriages was almost entirely on the parents, while any children were left to muddle through,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI decided to research the experiences of divorce and its effects on children and was astonished to find this had never been done before.\u201d</p> <p>She wrote several books about the psychological effects of divorce on children including Someone to Turn to: Experiences of Help Before Divorce (1981) and Children in the Middle: Living Through Divorce (1985). Her research led to an MPhil at the University of Edinburgh and prompted changes to Scottish law to ensure the needs of children were properly taken into account in a divorce settlement.</p> <p>Angus died in 2018. Mitchell is survived by their children and six grandchildren.</p> <p> \u2022 Ann Katherine Mitchell, codebreaker and social scientist, born 19 November 1922; died 11 May 2020</p>",

Some hadn\u2019t even told their parents about it.\u201d The case of Epstein was never a he-said, she-said situation; to quote the retired Palm Beach police chief Michael Reiter in the Herald\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html\">original story</a>: \u201cThis was 50-something \u2018shes\u2019 and one \u2018he\u2019 \u2013 and the \u2018shes\u2019 all basically told the same story.\u201d</p> <p>But Epstein\u2019s intimidation factor was strong, and many of the survivors, their justice thwarted by the plea deal and Epstein\u2019s subsequent immunity, had moved on with their lives. \u201cYes, there was a pattern that he had, but each person\u2019s experience with that and how they handled it is different,\u201d said Bryant. \u201cThis is their story to tell, their narrative.

It went nowhere. Years later, in 2005, Palm Beach police launched an investigation into an alleged sex ring run out of Epstein\u2019s beachside mansion, in which Epstein and Maxwell allegedly coerced high-school girls \u2013 most of them around 14, in vulnerable circumstances and needing money \u2013 into sex acts under the pretense of a \u201cmassage\u201d for $200. Maxwell has denied any involvement. The alleged crimes expanded even further, as favorites were allegedly trafficked to rich and powerful friends for parties at Epstein\u2019s $77m Upper East Side mansion in New York, at a London townhouse, and on Epstein\u2019s private island in the Caribbean.</p> <p>Some survivors featured in the series are speaking on camera for the first time; others, such as Virginia Giuffre, have been advocating for justice for years. Giuffre alleges in and out of the documentary that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew, who has <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/prince-andrew-interview-ties-epstein-widely-panned-n1084721\">denied the allegations</a> and queried the veracity of a photo that exists of him with his arm around her, with a smiling Maxwell in the background. Virginia Giuffre denies she was 18 at the time of the photo; she says she was 17.</p> <p>Given witness testimony in the series by a former Epstein employee who alleges he saw the prince engaged in poolside \u201cforeplay\u201d with a topless Giuffre on Epstein\u2019s island, Andrew\u2019s defense and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/09/prince-andrew-will-not-voluntarily-cooperate-epstein-investigation-lawyer-says\">lack of cooperation with prosecutors</a> reads even more shabbily here. Andrew says he has \u201cno recollection\u201d of meeting Giuffre.</p> <p>The show stokes justifiable outrage through each survivor\u2019s account, retracing how the Palm Beach police department\u2019s investigation was bumped up to the FBI, and was then derailed by a \u201cnon-prosecution agreement\u201d the Herald called <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html\">\u201cthe deal of a lifetime.\u201d</a> Signed in 2008, the deal \u2013 brokered by state attorney and later Trump labor secretary Alex Acosta and Epstein\u2019s all-star team of lawyers, including OJ Simpson defender Alan Dershowitz (the only Epstein acolyte to attempt a defense in the series) \u2013 was controversially sealed and kept private from the accusers. It offered Epstein and named and unnamed co-conspirators immunity from federal criminal charges; instead, he pleaded guilty to two prostitution charges in state court, and served 11 of 13 months in Palm Beach jail, out six days a week on \u201cwork release\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d860d1d12bb7a9d4d32712e272ce382e6b083f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d860d1d12bb7a9d4d32712e272ce382e6b083f2/0_35_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick McMullan via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe was still seeing girls, he was still making money, he was still conducting business \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s just outrageous,\u201d said Berlinger of Epstein\u2019s \u201cincarceration\u201d.

A year on, Bur\u00f3n, his fellow investigator Juan Carlos Urue\u00f1a and a team of archaeologists are into their second week of excavations and believe they are closing in on the chapel.</p> <p>\u201cThe monastery, which had been built at the end of the 13th century, was the most significant in the city in terms of both size and importance,\u201d said Bur\u00f3n.</p> <p>By the time O\u2019Donnell died in the nearby village of Simancas, he added, Valladolid was serving as the seat of the court of Philip III and the monastery would have been \u201cat the height of its splendour\u201d. But the site was sold and destroyed in 1836 during a wave of monastic expropriations.</p> <p>Using records, digital technology and the only surviving plan of the monastery, which dates from 1835, the team set about looking for the chapel.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been piecing together the plans and looking for the trail over the past 200 or 300 years to find out where certain walls and lines are now,\u201d said Bur\u00f3n.</p> <p>\u201cNow it\u2019s just a question of putting that together \u2013 and praying a lot. On Monday morning, the archaeologists said they\u2019d come across another of the walls we were expecting to find, which means we\u2019re getting very close.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58cded1fd2d2dfefab4c7f8073ee3844687eb921\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58cded1fd2d2dfefab4c7f8073ee3844687eb921/138_296_7874_4725/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The dig in the centre of Valladolid, Spain\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The dig in the centre of Valladolid, Spain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jes\u00fas Guerra</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The project has turned up hundreds of bone fragments and on Wednesday found six more-or-less intact skeletons, leading the team to suspect they are already in or around the Chapel of Wonders.</p> <p>The dig has attracted considerable interest from Ireland, where O\u2019Donnell remains a romantic \u2013 and romanticised \u2013 figure, and a symbol of defiance on a par with Scotland\u2019s William Wallace. O\u2019Donnell was born in 1572 in what is today County Donegal, a north-west corner of Ireland that had held on to its Gaelic identity and independence against English encroachment.</p> <p>He clashed with local rivals, raided cattle and pillaged much of Galway but Irish schoolchildren tend to focus on 1592, when he escaped imprisonment in Dublin Castle and lost two toes to frostbite while fleeing over the Wicklow mountains.</p> <p>With his father-in-law, Hugh O\u2019Neill, he led a nine-year campaign that scored notable victories against Queen Elizabeth I\u2019s forces before defeat at Kinsale. From there, he struck out for Spain.</p> <p>\u201cHe was a formidable operator \u2013 powerful and probably quite charismatic,\u201d said Jane Ohlmeyer, a professor of modern history at Trinity College Dublin and author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Making-Ireland-English-Aristocracy-Seventeenth/dp/0300118341\">Making Ireland English: </a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Making-Ireland-English-Aristocracy-Seventeenth/dp/0300118341\">the Irish Aristocracy in the Seventeenth Century.</a></p> <p>\u201cHe was a very significant regional powerbroker and periodically a thorn in the side of the English crown. Taking him out would have been a priority for Queen Elizabeth and her officials in Ireland.\u201d</p> <p>Were they to be found, his remains could yield DNA that would confirm or scotch a theory that he was poisoned, said Ohlmeyer. \u201cYou can tell a lot from people\u2019s bones. They could tell us not only how he died but how he lived.\u201d</p> <p>Bur\u00f3n, however, is adamant that no one should be holding their breath. The monastery was used as a burial site for hundreds of years and the bones it held were churned and mixed up when it was destroyed in 1836. And besides, he added, real-life archaeological quests seldom end as neatly as they do in Indiana Jones films.</p> <p>\u201cPeople in Ireland are hoping that a skeleton missing two toes will turn up and that it\u2019ll be poor old Red Hugh,\u201d said the architect. \u201cBut it would be impossible to do a DNA test on each of the 300 or 400 bone fragments we\u2019ve found \u2013 unless a Bill Gates type wants to come along and spend their millions on it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/stolen-artefacts-international-art-trafficking-crackdown\">Police seize 19,000 stolen artefacts in international art trafficking crackdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For him and the rest of the team, the project is about much more than bones, no matter how illustrious. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is trying to locate the chapel where Columbus and O\u2019Donnell were so that the site can get the respect it deserves,\u201d said Bur\u00f3n.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important for the people of Valladolid and important for the people of Ireland. This monastery was one of the biggest in Spain at the time and it\u2019s very sad that a place with so much heritage and history was lost overnight.

As Los Angeles was shifting hip-hop\u2019s power base from its historic New York home, nine powerful necromancers emerged from the shadows of Staten Island, \u201cthe forgotten borough\u201d, to rebuild the east coast in their own image. Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) was a new blueprint in slimy-grimy NYC street rap. The spirit of regional greats like Kool G Rap loom over their shoulders, but the Clan pull you into their own forbidding image of the city, built from components of gangster rap, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-Percent_Nation\">Five-Percenter ideology</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2019/oct/31/why-do-so-many-black-people-love-kung-fu-video\">hours of kung-fu movies</a>.</p> <p>RZA\u2019s beats sound as if they\u2019re forged from melted-down knuckle-dusters. With the chemistry of a group of spiritually connected Shaolin monks, the Clan pass the mic like a hot potato, each outlandish personality already feeling fully formed as they veer from solemn street revelations to goofy wisecracks to send-you-crying-to-your-momma threats. Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) is not just the Clan\u2019s genesis \u2013 it remains the purest distillation of their collective expression.</p> <h2><strong>The three to check out next</strong></h2> <p><strong>GZA \u2013 Liquid Swords (Geffen/MCA, 1995)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11BlEYtj53Q\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/11BlEYtj53Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>GZA: Liquid Swords \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>GZA raps like a boxer methodically finding holes in an opponent\u2019s tight defence, or Houdini unpicking a lock. No syllable seems arbitrary. Released during the first wave of post-36 Chambers solo albums, Liquid Swords utilises GZA\u2019s icy vocals, cerebral rhyme patterns and bleak worldview to shed the Clan\u2019s aesthetic of all pop leanings. Emboldened by RZA\u2019s rawest back-to-front production job (the hiccupping sample that propels the title track, or the rumble of 4th Chamber), GZA embraces the role of neighbourhood correspondent. On I Gotcha Back, GZA solemnly shakes his head at the struggles he sees in his home borough, Brooklyn: \u201cCould\u2019ve wrote a book with a title Age 12 and Going Through Hell.\u201d Coupled with the wicked beauty of the beats, it adds up to the greatest album to ever be stamped with the Wu symbol.</p> <p><strong>Ghostface Killah \u2013 Supreme Clientele (Epic/Sony/Razor Sharp, 2000)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnCAIEN-OVc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XnCAIEN-OVc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Ghostface Killah: Mighty Healthy \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The Clan entered the new millennium with cracks in their armour. The solo records released following second group album Wu-Tang Forever hadn\u2019t resonated. Then came Ghostface Killah\u2019s Supreme Clientele. Recorded after a self-imposed exile in Benin \u2013 where he sought relief from diabetes outside of western medicine \u2013 Ghost gave a clinic in outlandish rapping that plays like an abstract art piece swaddled in street scripture and comic-book lore. The English language has never felt so limitless \u2013 the opening verse of first song Nutmeg alone sees Ghost reference John McEnroe, compare kids caught up in the American legal system to Rapunzel and picture himself opulently \u201clamping in the throne with King Tut hat\u201d \u2013 while the beats evolve the Wu\u2019s grainy style to more bitter noir orchestrals, prominent samples and outlandish experimentation. Being in a legendary group dominates many great artists\u2019 legacies, but Ghostface Killah has forged the broadest and best solo discography of any rapper to emerge from the 36 Chambers.</p> <p><strong>Wu-Tang Clan \u2013 8 Diagrams (SRC/Universal Motown, 2007)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1vs1mCXOXw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/videoseries?wmode=opaque&list=PLAwgd_whiAX8cAgFQE_lCqYmfBGGpFCki\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Wu-Tang Clan: Campfire \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The narratives around 8 Diagrams have to an extent overwhelmed the music. That members of the Clan were unhappy with the direction RZA pulled the album in is part of the unvarnished Wu-Tang history. Building a collection of songs when a group is not united is hardly optimum, so that a classic record emerged feels even more extraordinary. It\u2019s true that RZA was determined to wrench the Clan from the sounds that had defined their legacy, moving towards lusher orchestration. But by retaining the kung-fu mysticism, and with no member slouching in the recording booth, 8 Diagrams always feels like a Wu release. Almost every experiment hits: Campfire is built around what sounds like soldiers humming as they march off to battle, a heavy drumbeat that could have been excavated from an ancient tomb, and a heavy splash of martial-arts movie dialogue.

Young men at the time, they never sounded all that youthful, their voices rippling with ruin, as if they had already seen too much. Released 14 years later, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx ...

  "<p>Tensions between China and India over their Himalayan border have escalated, with China accused of moving thousands of troops into disputed territory and expanding a military airbase in the region.</p> <p>Thousands of Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) troops are reported to have moved into sensitive areas along the eastern Ladakh border, setting up tents and stationing vehicles and heavy machinery in what India considers to be its territory.</p> <p>In response, the Indian army has moved several battalions from an infantry division usually based in the Ladakh city of Leh to \u201coperational alert areas\u201d along the border, and reinforcement troops have been brought in.</p> <p>The aggressive military posturing follows two skirmishes between the two sides on 5 and 9 May in the contested areas around Pangong Lake and North Sikkim, in which more than 100 soldiers from both sides were injured.</p> <p>On Wednesday Donald Trump waded into the heightened standoff, claiming that he had \u201cinformed both India and China that the United States is ready, willing and able to mediate or arbitrate their now raging border dispute\u201d.</p> <p>The high-altitude border has been aggressively contested and heavily militarised since 1962 when China launched an offensive into Indian territory, sparking a short but bloody war.</p> <p>Ashok K Kantha, a former Indian ambassador to China and now director of the Institute of Chinese Studies based in Delhi, said the recent incursions and border aggressions from China were \u201cfar from routine occurrences\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThis escalation is serious; I don\u2019t think this is just a localised incident. China\u2019s behaviour is more aggressive this time, backed up by a fairly large number of troops, which is not typical of this border where troop levels tend to be low on both sides. It could be a territorial claim or part of a wider messaging to India that they need to be more mindful of China on sensitive geopolitical issues.\u201d</p> <p>Kantha said it was \u201cin the interest of both India and China to keep the situation under control and maintain relative peace\u201d.</p> <p>China\u2019s actions appear to be a response to India\u2019s construction of roads and airstrips adjacent to the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which will improve connectivity and enable easier mobility for Indian troops in the area. Construction has paused during the coronavirus lockdown but is due to resume imminently.</p> <p>There have been diplomatic discussions as well as multiple meetings on a local level in an attempt to defuse the tensions.</p> <p>On Tuesday India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, held a meeting with his national security adviser, Ajit Doval, plus his chief of defence staff and three security chiefs to discuss \u201cbolstering India\u2019s military preparedness to deal with external security challenges\u201d.</p> <p>According to satellite footage published by the Indian news channel NDTV, there has been large-scale construction work at a Chinese military airbase less than 120 miles from the border in recent weeks, including the building of a new runway suitable for warplanes.</p> <p>Zhao Lijian, spokesman for the foreign ministry, told reporters in Beijing that the two countries have channels for resolving such issues. \u201cAt present, the situation along the border between China and India is generally stable and controllable,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cChina is committed to safeguarding the security of its national territorial sovereignty, as well as safeguarding peace and stability in the China-India border areas,\u201d a Chinese foreign ministry statement said.</p> <p>In a recent statement, India\u2019s external affairs ministry blamed China for provoking the military escalation. \u201cIn fact, it is the Chinese side that has recently undertaken activity hindering India\u2019s normal patrolling patterns,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Indian side has always taken a very responsible approach towards border management.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The appointment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/david-evans-appointed-labours-new-general-secretary-after-winning-vote\">David Evans</a> as Labour\u2019s general secretary represents another win for Keir Starmer. The leader was sticking his neck out when it was briefed to the press that he had a preferred candidate for the post \u2013 but the gamble has paid off. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/04/jennie-formby-resigns-as-labour-party-general-secretary\">Jennie Formby</a>, an ally of Jeremy Corbyn, has been replaced by someone who is heavily praised by activists on the right of the party. The Labour left has been thoroughly defeated, and the end of Corbynism is complete.</p> <p>When it first emerged that the leader\u2019s office had a firm favourite for general secretary and his name was David Evans, most of the members on the left of Labour\u2019s national executive committee \u2013 the ruling body that interviews and votes on the applicants \u2013 hadn\u2019t heard of him. They were introduced to the former assistant general secretary by journalists who themselves knew him primarily as the author of a 1999 report. This report described local constituency parties as \u201cdysfunctional\u201d and argued for a \u201cradical overhaul\u201d of the party that could \u201cempower modernising forces within the party and marginalise Old Labour\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>Although the intention was apparently to weaken the power of MPs and other stakeholders who had a tight grip on local parties but couldn\u2019t be bothered to show up to meetings, the proposals were interpreted at the time <a href=\"http://home.freeuk.net/clpd/1999bullart2.htm\">by left activists as \u201celitist\u201d</a>. The context of the leak was that Margaret McDonagh was at the helm as general secretary; soon after the report was published, Evans became her assistant. According to the left, she brought in a period during which trade unions were \u201csidelined\u201d and \u201coften treated with contempt\u201d, as expressed in a briefing that circulated among NEC members last week.</p> <p>Affiliated trade unions on the party\u2019s left were incensed by the news that this man was Starmer\u2019s pick. The&nbsp;Fire Brigades Union general secretary <a href=\"https://labourlist.org/2020/05/exclusive-fbu-leader-warns-against-factional-general-secretary-frontrunner/\">Matt Wrack warned colleagues against Evans</a>, describing him as a \u201cfactional figure\u201d and \u201clikely to be extremely divisive\u201d. Since his appointment, one local party representative on the NEC has tweeted that Starmer and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/09/angela-rayner-to-face-dominic-raab-at-pmqs\">Angela Rayner</a>, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, have \u201cshown their pledge to end factionalism to be a sham\u201d, while other furious reactions have been offered as anonymous comments. \u201cIf Evans now takes us back to the toxic culture in HQ, purges of leftwing members and stitch-ups of selections exposed in the leaked report, his appointment will be the worst mistake of Keir\u2019s leadership,\u201d one said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/david-evans-appointed-labours-new-general-secretary-after-winning-vote\">David Evans appointed Labour's new general secretary after winning vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is worth pointing out that many in the party \u2013 across the political spectrum \u2013 believe that there is already a toxic culture in HQ,<strong> </strong>and that parliamentary selections were being stitched up during the Corbyn era too. It is also worth noting that friends of Evans dismiss the portrayal of a Blairite driven by factionalism and anti-union sentiment. They counter that the internal report actually demanded more resources for constituency parties and for members to be empowered. It advocated all-member meetings rather than local committees, for example \u2013 a move that would later be <a href=\"https://labourlist.org/2018/11/all-member-meetings-would-open-up-local-labour-parties-to-the-many-not-the-few/\">championed by the left</a> under Corbyn.</p> <p>Evans is hailed by former colleagues as an excellent organiser who oversaw the campaigns that enabled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jul/09/bnp-beaten-labour-london-byelections\">Labour to beat the BNP in Barking in 2010</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-27514805\">regain control of Croydon council in 2014</a>. They say he was instrumental in efforts that led to Labour\u2019s 2001 general election win. Like Starmer and his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, Evans sees working with local government not as a nice-to-have but as a key way of securing power at a national level. His ability to connect with voters, described by friends such as Barking and Dagenham council leader, Darren Rodwell, will have to manifest itself through party staff and an enthused activist base.</p> <p>Starmer took a risk and did well to get the finely balanced NEC to approve his first preference \u2013 the appointment went through by 20 votes to 16, according to well-placed sources. The two GMB representatives provided the votes that swung in Starmer\u2019s favour, making the trade union a key player under the new leadership. The narrow NEC result also offers a stark reminder to the Labour left that it needs to get its house in order, and fast. If Corbynites had put forward a united slate for <a href=\"https://labourlist.org/2020/04/corbynsceptics-sweep-the-board-in-labours-ruling-body-by-elections/\">the recent by-elections</a>, they would have been well placed to win the two members\u2019 representative places, and Evans would probably not be general secretary now.</p> <p>It was a close call, but the new leader now has an ally in control of the party machine as well as a clear personal mandate from members. That means he has no reason not to deliver on his key campaign pledges from the leadership election: unity, professionalism, electability.<strong> </strong>In a recent Zoom meeting alongside Starmer and Rayner, Evans reportedly expressed his desire to professionalise HQ, and said that the party must get back to winning elections. Was picking Evans over a compromise candidate the right decision? The proof will be in whether party culture improves over the coming years, in its ability to respond well to the findings of the Equality and Human Rights Commission investigation expected shortly, and in electoral tests starting with the 2021 local contests.</p> <p>\u2022 Sienna Rodgers is editor of LabourList</p>",
  "<p>The last time Hannah Gadsby released a Netflix special, it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/oct/19/hannah-gadsby-quit-comedy-i-cant-ive-got-no-other-skillset\">changed her life</a>&nbsp;\u2013 and arguably, changed comedy. In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/19/hannah-gadsby-review-nanette\">Nanette</a>, she publicly quit standup, the practice of which \u2013 she argued \u2013 made her complicit in her own (homophobic, mainly) oppression. It was a fierce provocation, delivered with expert control of increasingly serious tone, and it introduced a new lens through which to consider self-mocking comedy. Far from ending Gadsby\u2019s career, it gave that career a spectacular new lease of life.</p> <p>Douglas begins that new life. As I wrote on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/oct/25/hannah-gadsby-review-nanette-follow-up-doesnt-surprise-but-delights\">seeing it live last autumn</a>, it\u2019s a more approachable set than its predecessor. Gadsby is obviously having fun \u2013 which isn\u2019t something you could say about Nanette \u2013&nbsp;but it\u2019s in no way a climbdown. The show (her 1oth \u2013 but also her \u201cdifficult second album\u201d, she admits) is perfectly judged, a 75-minute set that proves self-deprecation is a thing of the past for Gadsby, that blazes with well-earned confidence, and that hitches her crusading, patriarchy-bashing humour to great jokes, meticulous set-building \u2013 and a new cause.</p> <p>Part of its appeal is Gadsby\u2019s newfound swagger \u2013 real, but sometimes teasingly sent up. That\u2019s never more in evidence than in her remarkable prelude, in which our host itemises routine by routine what she\u2019ll be saying and doing in the show to follow. It\u2019s a real coup, which lays depth charges that will detonate for her throughout the set, and tees up the subject towards which the show tends: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jul/16/hannah-gadsby-trauma-comedy-nanette-standup-netflix\">Gadsby\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jul/16/hannah-gadsby-trauma-comedy-nanette-standup-netflix\">2015 diagnosis of autism</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziIwxPCeByU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ziIwxPCeByU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziIwxPCeByU\">Watch the trailer on YouTube</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>I did find that opening set piece more thrilling live than on Netflix, because it was a surprise first time round. Also, being in the room with her made it feel more like a dialogue, tight-roping between smug and playful, than a look-at-me trick. But whether the sequence delights or disconcerts us is all equal to Gadsby: after all, autistic people, she tells us, seldom make a good first impression.</p> <p>There\u2019s great craft in the show that follows, as Gadsby builds from a hack starter on the differences between US and Australian speech, via a dog-walking anecdote (which prises open her anti-sexist theme), towards a takedown of male arrogance in having named, diagnosed and depicted everything, forever, on their own partial terms. The show\u2019s title derives from an intimate body part named after an 18th-century Scottish doctor. Its closing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/19/hannah-gadsby-on-the-male-gaze-in-art-stop-watching-women-having-baths-go-away\">art history lecture</a>&nbsp;\u2013 one great visual gag after another \u2013 marvels at what the so-called Old Masters chose to depict. And Gadsby\u2019s material on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/02/simon-baron-cohen-autism-neurodiversity-brains-money\">neurodiversity</a> smoulders with fury at the doctors who dismissed her as \u201chormonal\u201d and the perception of autism as the preserve of nerdy boys.</p> <p>It\u2019s a well-constructed set, with a high hit-rate of jokes. Even the weaker, cruder sections \u2013 those laying into golfers and anti-vaxxers \u2013 are redeemed by neat one-liners, like Gadsby\u2019s claim to be \u201cmicrodosing\u201d herself on social media abuse from the latter: \u201cYour hate is my vaccine.\u201d Finally, the show emerges as a trenchant defence of Gadsby\u2019s right to be different \u2013 and to make shows that won\u2019t fit (as per Nanette) within narrow definitions of comedy. \u201cMy brain takes me to places no one else lives,\u201d she claims \u2013 but if the success of Douglas is anything to go by, more and more audiences will choose to spend time there.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81054700\">Hannah Gadsby: Douglas is on Netflix</a></p>",

Meanwhile, the Beijing study reported: \u201cNo infectious virus could be recovered from cotton clothes after four days,\u201d but added: \u201cRapid loss of infectivity was observed within one hour after incubation on both paper and cotton clothes surfaces.\u201d</p> <p>But there are many considerations. Prof Deenan Pillay, a virologist at the University College London, told the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2020/mar/24/covid-19-how-long-can-it-survive-outside-the-body\">Guardian Science Weekly podcast</a> in March: \u201cWe have got to remember the virus, when it goes on to a surface, it is not just the virus, it is of course a virus within a droplet. So if for instance it is covered with proteinaceous material, from sputum that comes from cells in the lung from which the virus has been coughed up, then clearly that&nbsp;virus&nbsp;will last longer on the surface than if it is without that.\u201d </p> <p>In the case of shoes, said Keevil, the situation is also unclear. \u201cShoes have some kind of a finish to them, like a polish \u2013 so no one knows,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might argue that if, say, shoes have got a polish on them, does it act anyway like soap?

He cautioned that in some cases&nbsp;researchers may extract the virus from materials, such as fabric and paper, that is trapped&nbsp;within layers, \u201carguably meaning it is not released to the hand during contact when people report just hours survival\u201d. </p> <h2>If viable virus is still present on surfaces, what does this mean for infection?</h2> <p>Keevil said the matter is a big question. \u201cAt the moment everyone is referring back to things like flu,\u201d he said, adding that virus is known to be spread by people touching their face \u2013 a reason why handwashing has been highlighted as crucial in tackling coronavirus.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html#How-COVID-19-Spreads\">According to</a> the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cIt may be possible that a person can get Covid-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The split between Downing Street and Conservative MPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/tory-unrest-increases-pressure-pm-sack-dominic-cummings\">over Dominic Cummings</a> can be summarised in a single message. After a bank holiday weekend made up of Tory MPs venting their fury both on social media and over WhatsApp, Conservative MP Danny Kruger wrote to fellow MPs on Tuesday in a bid to calm them. After sharing sympathy over complaints from constituents and multiple media reports, Johnson\u2019s former political secretary laid out a political truth: \u201cNo 10 won\u2019t budge, so calling for DC to go is basically declaring no confidence in PM.\u201d</p> <p>As someone who worked full time in Downing Street up until last year\u2019s general election when he became an MP, Kruger is well placed to speak for how the government plans to style this out. Since Johnson entered No 10, bringing many Vote Leave staff with him, there has been an effort to centralise power and a shift away from paying much attention to the parliamentary party. Johnson showed with Brexit that he was happy to withdraw the whip from MPs who disagreed with him. Kruger\u2019s suggestion to MPs was that No 10 plans to do the same now.</p> <p>The problem? As Johnson\u2019s government finds its popularity falling amid a growing public backlash, it\u2019s a message that few MPs want to hear right now. And unlike with Brexit, when the voters that the Tories were trying to appeal to in large supported Johnson\u2019s aim (delivering Brexit), this time it\u2019s the wavering MPs who are currently more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/public-anger-swells-ranks-tory-mps-turning-on-dominic-cummings\">in tune with public opinion</a>.</p> <p>When reports first emerged that Johnson\u2019s most senior aide had travelled 260 miles from London during lockdown, the first instinct in No 10 was to fight it. A brief statement was given and the whips moved to firmly encourage MPs and ministers to take to social media and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/23/cummings-and-cabinet-cheerleaders-feel-heat-from-social-media-fury\">defend Cummings</a>. However, as more allegations have emerged and complaints from constituents have increased, that line has become harder to hold.</p> <p>A number of ministers who initially tweeted their defence of Cummings feel as though they ought to have been warned that the picture could change \u2013 with details of the trip to Barnard Castle only emerging later. Meanwhile, a number of cabinet ministers have so far declined to send any public endorsement. While a handful of ministers spoke up for Johnson\u2019s senior aide in Monday\u2019s cabinet conference call, the silence from others was telling.&nbsp;</p> <p>As Tory MPs worry that the defence of Cummings has weakened the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/27/public-health-trust-dominic-cummings-second-wave\">public health message</a> and authority, there is growing annoyance that the No 10 operation has chosen to expend so much political capital on Cummings. Few believe the measures \u2013 which range from a personal defence by the prime minister to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/i-think-i-behaved-reasonably-dominic-cummings-defends-actions-in-lockdown-row\">impromptu press conference</a> in the Rose Garden \u2013 would have been taken for anyone else.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t recall the orchestrated Twitter campaign when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/10/robert-jenrick-urged-explain-visit-parents-during-lockdown\">Robert Jenrick was in trouble</a> over travelling during lockdown,\u201d said one weary minister, in reference to an earlier row when the communities secretary found himself in the firing line for travelling to his parents\u2019 home to deliver supplies.&nbsp;</p> <p>There\u2019s also disagreement about whether the press conference was effective. \u201cIt was as mad an idea as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/dec/22/the-ed-stone-ed-milibands-monumental-folly-labour-election-limestone\">Ed Stone</a>, only this one actually happened in Downing Street,\u201d said an MP of the one-time Labour leader\u2019s huge tablet of pledges that was supposed to sit in the garden had he won the election.&nbsp;</p> <p>With polling suggesting a fall in support for the Conservatives in recent days, to say the bulk of MPs are unhappy would be an understatement. But when it comes to the chances of a Tory revolt forcing No 10\u2019s hand, doubts remain.&nbsp;More than 35 MPs have so far gone public to call for Cummings to go. However, even the rebels admit they need the number to increase before they have any chance of success. \u201cThere\u2019s no chance of No 10 listening to us until it\u2019s closer to 80,\u201d said one MP. Though they already have almost enough MPs to wipe out Boris Johnson\u2019s majority were any vote to take place, they feel they need this higher number to show it\u2019s a rebellion that won\u2019t peter out if a few people fall into line. </p> <p>As for unhappy MPs yet to go public, they roughly fall into two groups:&nbsp;those who think they\u2019ve taken the political hit anyway so Cummings may as well stay; and those who believe the longer he stays in post the worse the situation becomes.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point crying over spilt milk,\u201d said one MP. \u201cMistakes get made. We need to move on and give people a sense that we have a plan both for the economy and public health.\u201d A minister reluctantly agreed: \u201cI don\u2019t really see how he can stay, but the damage is probably now indelible to some extent.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/27/boris-johnson-coronavirus-dominic-cummings\">Boris Johnson should be protecting the nation.

Unhappy MPs were already looking to the return of parliament next week to make their feelings known on lockdown, China and the economy. While government whips in part pushed for the end of the virtual parliament on the grounds that MPs in Westminster would be easier to control, at this rate they are heading for a nasty surprise.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022&nbsp;Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor</p>",

In 2018 a federal judge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/23/trump-twitter-block-ruling-court-public-forum-account\">ruled</a> the president could not block people on Twitter, because it violates their first amendment rights to participate in a \u201cpublic forum\u201d.</p> \n<p>As his election-year polling numbers have deteriorated, however, Trump has grown increasingly wild in his threats against media organizations and the voting system, and more aggressive in removing mechanisms for oversight in the federal government and in installing loyalists. His takeover of the federal courts could put future first amendment claims on new and dangerous ground.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s disturbing that the president misunderstands the first amendment so fundamentally,\u201d said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. \u201cThe only first amendment issue here arises from the president\u2019s threat to punish Twitter in some way for factchecking his statements.\u201d</p> \n<p>Most recently, Trump\u2019s attacks on mail-in voting and on a cable news host, Joe Scarborough, have created controversies and put a great deal of pressure on Twitter, Trump\u2019s preferred bullhorn, to modulate the president\u2019s speech.</p> \n<p>The husband of a former aide to Scarborough, who died when the MSNBC host was a member of Congress, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/26/lori-klausutis-husband-asks-twitter-delete-trump-joe-scarborough-smears-death\">formally asked Twitter this week</a> to remove \u201chorrifying\u201d tweets by Trump wrongfully and recklessly accusing Scarborough, a frequent Trump critic, of murder.</p> \n<p>Twitter declined to remove those tweets, citing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/27/twitter-warning-labels-tweets-violate-site-rules\">relatively new policy</a> crafted with Trump in mind&nbsp;to allow itself to leave up tweets by \u201cworld leaders\u201d.</p> \n<p>But the company took unprecedented action on Tuesday in response to lies tweeted by Trump about mail-in voting.

  "<p>In the streaming age, it\u2019s easier than ever to connect up your tech so you can listen to all the best music and podcasts wherever you want, without wires trailing everywhere. If you\u2019re one of Spotify\u2019s 286 million monthly users, you\u2019ve probably noticed an icon on your mobile app that looks like a computer monitor behind a speaker \u2013 that\u2019s your portal to Spotify Connect, a super-simple way to play music on all your home tech devices, from your smart fridge to your laptop. But how does it work \u2013 and how does it stack up against other wireless streaming methods?</p> <h2>Welcome to Spotify Connect</h2> <p>Since 2018, Spotify Connect has been available for all users, however to be able to connect to every compatible device out there, you\u2019ll need a Spotify Premium subscription. You can use it on your tablet, phone or computer as a kind of remote control to play what you want, where you want it \u2013 Spotify offers podcasts in addition to its extensive library of music. And unlike using a Bluetooth speaker, the music won\u2019t stop if you receive a call.</p> <p>Using Spotify Connect is really easy. From the mobile app, choose something to play, then tap \u201cdevices available\u201d underneath the song name. Next, tap the icon of a screen and a speaker, and you\u2019ll get a list of all the Connect-compatible smart devices on your home network. You don\u2019t have to add them, they appear automatically if they\u2019re connected to wifi.</p> <p>The process on a computer is pretty similar: play something, then click the icon of a screen and a speaker in the bottom right of the app and choose your preferred device.</p> <p>There\u2019s a vast range of compatible gadgets, so chances are that the device you want to play music on is on the list, but <a href=\"https://spotify-everywhere.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">you can check here</a> just in case.</p> <p>Once you\u2019re streaming, you can use your phone or computer as normal: the audio comes directly from Spotify, not your device, so you can take calls and keep the music going. It doesn\u2019t run your battery down, either.</p> <p>Moving the sound around is really straightforward: just tap a different device on the list and the music instantly continues there. This is especially handy when you\u2019re moving rooms, or you need to switch away from the soundbar because someone wants to watch TV, for instance.</p> <p>And when it\u2019s party time (after the pandemic, we might add!), use Spotify Connect to start a group session so that everyone can contribute to the playlist \u2013 another feature you can\u2019t get with just Bluetooth or wifi. You\u2019ll see the option to \u201cStart a group session\u201d at the bottom of your Spotify Connect device list, which gives you a code to share with friends so they can add their favourites.</p> <h2>Is it better than Bluetooth?</h2> <p>Bluetooth is an easy, near-universal wireless method of connecting one smart thing to another. That connection is called \u201cpairing\u201d and is usually simple to do \u2013 for instance, on many speakers, there\u2019s a little button with the Bluetooth symbol (a stylised B that looks like a sideways pair of scissors) that you press to start sending out signals. Then, turn on Bluetooth via your phone, or whichever device you\u2019re trying to connect to, scan for nearby Bluetooth gadgets and select your speaker from the list. The instructions vary slightly by device, so check the help files for yours if you\u2019re stuck.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/premium-listening/2020/may/27/turn-off-tune-in-chill-out-how-audio-can-complement-your-wellness\">Turn off, tune in, chill out: how audio can complement your wellness</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pairing is usually straightforward and only has to be done once \u2013 from then on it should work automatically. But Bluetooth does have its downsides too, the more distance there is between the music device and the speaker, the more chance there is for interference and sound drop out \u2013 something you don\u2019t need to worry about with Spotify Connect. Thick walls can really mess up the connection too, as you\u2019ll notice if you wander around the house with wireless headphones on.</p> <p>Bluetooth is the best choice for listening to music outside your home, because you can use it for portable speakers, car stereos and so on without needing to be close to a power socket or wifi router. However, it\u2019s a real drain on the battery life of whatever device you\u2019re streaming from.</p> <p>The connection can also be temperamental, varying on some devices more than others. If one of the gadgets you like to listen on often drops out, it\u2019s worth trying a different method.</p> <h2>Using wifi without Spotify Connect</h2> <p>Most devices that can play music, such as speakers, TVs, games consoles and even smartwatches have an app that helps you connect them to your home wifi network, and from there you can link up your streaming source.</p> <p>For instance, a smart speaker such as Google Home gets connected to wifi during setup, using its app. Once it\u2019s ready, you just open the app settings and choose your preferred service for streaming music and podcasts, then start issuing voice commands \u2013 such as \u201cOK Google, play Spotify\u201d.</p> <p>The benefit of using wifi rather than Bluetooth is that you don\u2019t have to worry about keeping your devices close together. As long as whatever\u2019s playing the music is connected to wifi, you\u2019re good \u2013 and you can use your phone for calls without cutting off the tunes.</p> <p>Spotify Connect runs on wifi, so you\u2019ll see all these benefits, plus the added bonus that it will automatically seek out and connect with compatible devices. So if you are going to connect over wifi, it makes sense to do it via Spotify Connect.</p> <p><em><strong>Spotify Premium gives you music without the interruptions.

The requirement is enshrined in a provision, article 23, of Hong Kong\u2019s de facto constitution, known as the basic law.</p> <p>In early 2003, the government proposed a national security law, prompting fears that overly broad definitions of national security on the mainland would be established in Hong Kong, threatening freedom of speech, the press and assembly. Barristers said the law went beyond what was required by article 23, while others worried about expanded powers given to the police and draconian measures that would put security above civil liberties.</p> <p>On 1 July, as the government tried to push the legislation through, an estimated half a million people took to the streets in the largest protests since the handover. They called for the law to be stopped and for the chief executive Tung Chee-hwa to resign. The bill was eventually shelved. The secretary of security who had pushed the legislation resigned, and two years later, Tung stepped down in the middle of his second term, citing health problems.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da5f3df034db4acfbffc4bfb16c0ddeaba63971b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da5f3df034db4acfbffc4bfb16c0ddeaba63971b/0_0_2212_1648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters chant slogans calling for political reforms in 2003\" width=\"1000\" height=\"745\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters chant slogans calling for political reforms in 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kin Cheung/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Patriotic education \u2013 2012</h2> <p>In 2012, the education bureau of Hong Kong proposed a \u201cmoral and civic education\u201d curriculum to be implemented in all public schools by 2016. Guidelines distributed to teachers in a handbook called the China Model criticised multiparty democracies and described the Communist party in glowing terms.

Protesters occupied government headquarters for 10 days, with some going on hunger strike. Demonstrators chanted slogans such as \u201cNo thought control\u201d. </p> <p>The law gave rise to a group of student leaders, including the pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong, who was 15 at the time. Wong notes that even though the plan did not go forward, Hong Kong education has been compromised in other ways, including the revision of textbooks and most recently a question in a <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education/article/3085351/hong-kong-exam-question-china-and-japan-has-sparked\">history exam</a> that Beijing took issue with.</p> <p>The patriotic education plan was also shelved.

Those who have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/14/uk-scheme-signs-up-440000-self-employed-workers-on-first-day\">benefited from SEISS</a> have raised alarm about whether or not it will be extended in line with the furlough scheme to pay the wages of employees, which will now run until October.</p> <p>\u201cI teach to supplement my income and my part-time salary accounts for just over half of what I earn,\u201d wrote a freelancer. \u201cThis makes me ineligible for government support.

He says that in the future, freelancers should be represented on every board of every arts organisation in the country. In the past, he says, they have been systemically underrepresented.</p> <p>The artistic director worries that the industry is letting freelancers down by focusing too much on buildings rather than individuals. Storyhouse has created a hardship fund to support its regular pool of freelancers. The fund was enabled by the furloughing of more than 93% of staff, leaving a team of nine. He says Storyhouse itself is in \u201csignificant jeopardy\u201d as 83% of its income is earned directly (3% comes from Arts Council England). Storyhouse spends \u00a31.1m a year on freelance theatre practitioners. \u201cThat\u2019s as much as we spend on our core team. Freelance workers are vital to our organisation.

I\u2019m used to being unemployed, I\u2019m used to applying for work. So I applied everywhere; all of the supermarkets, call centres, warehouses. The only job I got offered was a 90-minute shift at 3am for \u00a38.25 an hour. I declined it as I would decline an unpaid short film. But as time has stretched on, it\u2019s not only the financial strain, it\u2019s the emotional. I want an audition. I want to laugh and cry and pretend to be someone else.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cI currently have zero income. Not only as a performer \u2013 all my other jobs are also freelance and none of them now exist. Nothing exists anymore. I am grateful for Universal Credit and the SEISS payment coming soon as this means I can eat. I\u2019m a hustler, a hard worker and it goes against my whole person to sit and wait.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cJust a fortnight before the lockdown, a show I\u2019d been in rehearsals for, far away from home, was meant to open. We were suddenly told that our production would not be going ahead for the foreseeable future. We all had so many questions \u2026 What about all that hard work? Would it just disappear? Was it all for nothing? Will we ever work together again? I didn\u2019t even get a chance to hug my friends goodbye. Wait! Are the company still intending to pay us? How long for? How will I pay my rent? How will I earn enough to eat? How will I survive?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cThis anxiety has a handy counterpoint in my belief that artists are tenacious. Even stubborn. We in the theatre make something from nothing, and this is our opportunity to do just that, to evolve and to try things in new ways and to allow things to be different than they were before. I\u2019m intent on finding a way; I can\u2019t quite let go of all the many years of my life I\u2019ve put in to building the worker that I am.\u201d</p>",

Yet to&nbsp;keep him in post, cabinet ministers have been used as sockpuppets, tweeting the same ridiculous excuses for his behaviour.<br><br>\u201cEntirely right,\u201d declared health secretary <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthancock/status/1264162359733555202\">Matt Hancock</a> who, somewhere on the Cummings itinerary between Durham and Barnard Castle, had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbcnews/status/1246109819234328582?lang=en-gb\">instructed us</a> it was entirely wrong for infected people to leave the house. The attorney general of England, Suella Braverman, whose job is to provide independent legal advice, rushed to declare possibly illegal behaviour above board. Over the weekend Downing Street desperately tried to kill off the story. Then finally, the day after a disastrous public briefing by Boris Johnson, a mere adviser was granted the kind of press conference, in the No 10 rose garden, normally given for world leaders or for major national occasions \u00ad\u2013 once the stage set for Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, for Nick Clegg and David Cameron.</p> <p>For the sake of one father of one four-year-old, the public health guidelines have been binned and, as one of the government\u2019s scientific advisers has said, the credibility of both the advice and those giving it has been \u201ctrashed\u201d.</p> <p>Clutching at terms for this spectacle, many have called it \u201chypocrisy\u201d. If only. At least that\u2019s a familiar vice.&nbsp;Hypocrisy in politics? We\u2019ve all seen that box set.&nbsp;But in truth, this is its opposite \u00ad\u2013 an ugly display of naked honesty by both Cummings and Johnson about who really matters in Britain today. Namely: them. Not us, the Little People who have to follow the rules; nor the health of a democracy that relies on everyone respecting norms and procedures.</p> <p>In that revelation lies so much of the huge public disquiet. The government has displayed immense force in trying to rescue Cummings, while showing just how corrupt it is, by ripping up rules to accommodate one associate of the prime minister. The hard-right groupuscule running Britain has exposed how rotten the country has become.<br><br>Just why the prime minister has lashed himself to his ideas guy is a question best left to biographers. For now, let us observe that, while Cummings has broken the rules, Johnson is bending the machinery of state to his defence, pronouncing:&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/l%27%C3%A9tat%2C%20c%27est%20moi\">L\u2019etat, c\u2019est Dom et moi</a></em>. As Danny Kruger wrote to his fellow Conservative MPs <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nicholaswatt/status/1265359341688950791\">last night</a>, \u201cAppreciate the inbox and press are horrific but the PM is signalling that he\u2019s serious \u2026 calling for [Cummings] to go is basically declaring no confidence in [the] PM.\u201d You can always judge a man\u2019s priorities by his diary, and this prime minister skipped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/michael-gove-fails-to-deny-pm-missed-five-coronavirus-cobra-meetings\">five Cobra meetings</a> on the coronavirus crisis on the trot, even while finding time to attend a <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-38-days-when-britain-sleepwalked-into-disaster-hq3b9tlgh\">giant fundraising ball</a> for the Conservative party.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s coterie will go to war for Cummings, yet they couldn\u2019t equip doctors and nurses with essential masks and gowns. The result is that 200 healthcare workers have so far <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/six-in-10-uk-health-workers-killed-by-covid-19-are-bame\">died of Covid-19</a>. Although the UK has a GDP per head of nearly \u00a335,000, it still can\u2019t run a test-and-trace regime to touch that of Vietnam (GDP per head, \u00a32,000).</p> <p>When you run one of the richest countries in the world, inaction is as much a choice as action. The prime minister who has thrown a protective ring around Cummings also let thousands of residents of care homes die for want of testing. While Johnson this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/24/boris-johnson-says-dominic-cummings-will-not-be-marked-down-for-lockdown-rule-breaking-video\">commended his aide\u2019s fatherly instincts</a>, he said nothing about the fathers and mothers and grandparents who have died needlessly over the past two months, many without a hand to hold in their final hours.</p> <p>The scandal that today rightly roars around Cummings and Johnson is nothing compared with their gigantic failure on Covid-19. Both men must know that their real reckoning is still to come. Those Westminster bubble descriptions of two \u201cpolitical geniuses\u201d leave out what a mess they\u2019ve made in government, on everything from suspending parliament to Brexit deals. Get past the 20,000-word blog posts and the three-word slogans \u00ad\u2013 Take Back Control, Get Brexit Done \u00ad\u2013 and all they have is a talent for self-preservation and media manipulation. It gets them into power, but leaves them no clue what to do with it.</p> <p>So the endless jokes about driving to Barnard Castle for an eye test distract from the government\u2019s multiple failures on sourcing protective equipment for key workers, which in turn overshadows the double-counting of coronavirus tests, which in turn hides the complete failure of the testing regime, which in turn obscures the awful and disgraceful reality that the UK is <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1093256/novel-coronavirus-2019ncov-deaths-worldwide-by-country/\">second</a><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1093256/novel-coronavirus-2019ncov-deaths-worldwide-by-country/\"> only to the US</a> in its total number of Covid-19 deaths.</p> <p>Soon will come a point when the memes peter out and the media scrum disperses. What will be left is a historic economic depression and a public realisation that far more people have died in this pandemic than in the blitz, thanks to an administration that could barely bring itself to care for anyone beyond its own senior members.<br><br>Stay at Home? That was just for us; for them it meant Stay Where You Like.</p> <p>Protect the NHS? Protect Yourselves.</p> <p>Save Lives? Save Dom.</p> <p>\u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>In the same week civil rights activists celebrated the <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/news/2020/05/16/weekend-read-66-years-after-brown-v-board-schools-across-south-still-separate-and-unequal\">anniversary</a> of the supreme court\u2019s unanimous decision in Brown v Board of Education, the United States observed another milestone: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/us-coronavirus-patient-zero-100000-deaths\">nearing 100,000 deaths</a> caused by Covid-19. Early data indicates that black Americans comprise a disproportionate number of the victims. Sixty-six years after Brown partially overruled the \u201cseparate but equal\u201d doctrine \u2013 laying the foundation for black Americans to have equal access to better schools, healthcare, and housing \u2013 this pandemic has laid bare a harsh reality: the country is still separate and still unequal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/25/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-hate-crime-fbi\">FBI investigating Ahmaud Arbery shooting as possible hate crime, lawyer says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At least 20,000 black Americans have died from the virus. Their death rate is nearly 2.5 times higher than whites, and it has never been less than twice that of Latinos and Asians, according to recent data compiled by <a href=\"https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race\">APM Research Lab</a>. Despite comprising 13% of the country, they make up 25% of Covid-19 deaths.</p> <p>The Trump administration has placed much of the responsibility for these disparities <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/surgeon-general-jerome-adams-apologizes-for-telling-people-of-color-to-step-it-up-and-stop-drinking-smoking\">on victims</a>. Public officials have speculated about the victims\u2019 smoking and drinking habits and made insinuations about their diets and lifestyle choices. There has been no contemplation, however, of the underlying conditions of America\u2019s racial caste system, the one rooted firmly in this country\u2019s soil.</p> <p>While Brown laid the ground for desegregating the United States, this country was built on a far more entrenched foundation of white supremacy. African Americans have been deemed property longer than we have been considered citizens. Our wealth and resources have been extracted longer than we have been able to accrue or maintain them. The intentional, overt practice of white supremacy has endured longer than it has been unconscious and covert, or talked about in academic circles as microaggressions and racial privilege. It has been 66 years since the highest court in the land asserted that segregation in public schools was inherently unequal \u2013 and 400 years of America proving its assertions of liberty and equality are lip service.</p> <p>Centuries of white supremacy have meant that black workers and white ones <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/reports/2019/08/07/472910/systematic-inequality-economic-opportunity/\">do not earn the same wages</a>, buy the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america\">same types of houses</a> or have the same nest eggs to <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap/\">pass down</a> to their kids. It has meant private acts of racism and government-sanctioned racism, often in tandem. It has meant <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-why-65-years-later-school-segregation-persists-20190517-4hh4w7shabbv5hbbnkk6zmd4hi-story.html\">less access</a> to quality public schools, higher education, or high-paid jobs that require expensive, advanced degrees. It means <a href=\"https://hub.jhu.edu/magazine/2014/spring/racial-food-deserts/\">more grocery stores</a> in affluent white urban neighborhoods, and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3387667/\">fewer healthcare services</a> for the black and dispossessed. It means black Americans rely more heavily on <a href=\"https://wherewelive.cityofnewyork.us/explore-data/access-to-opportunity/transportation/\">public transit</a>, are <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/work-from-home-black-hispanic-workers/\">less able to work from home</a>, and are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/us/coronavirus-women-essential-workers.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share\">over-represented</a> in \u201cessential\u201d jobs. It means more exposure to Covid-19. It means 20,000 deaths.</p> <p>The disproportionate death rates in some states are astounding, with large margins dotted <a href=\"https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race\">all over the map</a>. In Washington DC, black people are 44% of the population, yet 80% of coronavirus deaths. In South Carolina, they make up 27% of the state and 56% of its deaths. Black people in Michigan and Missouri are 14% and 11% of the population \u2013 and 42% and 39% of Covid-19 deaths, respectively.</p> <p>More studies are necessary to determine the precise cause of these disparities. Public health research has to assess why certain comorbidities, such as hypertension, may be more present in black Americans than other groups, and move past stereotypical assumptions.</p> <p>The more difficult assessment, however, is what to do in the future, after the worst cases subside and the pandemic wanes. There must be a commitment not to return to normal, with black workers continuing to be the sacrificial lambs of white American liberties and corporate profiteers.</p> <p>In the next 66 years, fulfilling the promises of Brown requires we reimagine and rethink our social structures. This reconsideration requires shedding the entrenched individualism that allowed white landowners to equate human suffering with their rights to enslave. It must challenge a culture that permits white liberals to claim they are in favor of integrating high-opportunity neighborhoods while fighting rabidly to prevent it when it hits their doorsteps. It requires ending the fanatical obsession with corporate profits that pushes a disproportionate number of black people to their deaths faster \u2013 whether in risky warehouses during a pandemic or the temporary and low-wage jobs that lack health benefits, paid time off and sick leave. It requires governments that provide adequate social services safety nets.</p> <p>Most of all it requires a fight, because none of this will happen without one. While the Trump White House and Republican legislators loot the country\u2019s treasury for bank and business bailouts, conservative state governments and their rightwing constituents rabidly demand that the country \u201c<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-05-06/trump-americans-warriors-fight-to-open-economy\">re</a><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-05-06/trump-americans-warriors-fight-to-open-economy\">open</a>\u201d. Conservatives\u2019 long-time verbal commitments to being anti-abortion \u2013 like commitments to democracy and equality since this country\u2019s founding \u2013 have been easily <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chris-christie-reopening-economy-deaths-no-matter-what/\">abandoned</a> in the interests of individual convenience. And leaders of the corporate, liberal wing of the two-party system have done <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/04/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-congress-coronavirus-interim-relief-bill\">relatively little</a> to challenge it.</p> <p>Twenty-first century concerns about gentrification and displacement complicate the desegregation narrative; people of color in New York City, for instance, have asserted that equal access to opportunities is <a href=\"https://wherewelive.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Where-We-Live-NYC-Draft-Plan.pdf\">most important</a> to them, regardless of the racial composition of their neighborhoods. Nevertheless, Covid-19 has clarified the fortitude of America\u2019s racial caste system. Generations after Brown, inequality is still very much the law of the land. But the chance remains to create another precedent.</p> <ul> <li><p>Malaika Jabali is a freelance writer, activist and attorney</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>When Tom Watson lifted the Claret Jug at Royal Birkdale it was his fifth Open title, the first he had won in England and, at the age of 33, the promise was of more to come.

  "<p>Although its live scene is currently on pause, jazz has been thriving throughout London, with names such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/10/history-needs-to-be-set-alight-shabaka-hutchings-on-the-radical-power-of-jazz\">Shabaka Hutchings</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/05/nubya-garcia-jazz-review-village-underground-london\">Nubya Garcia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/13/binker-moses-review-boyd-golding-london-jazz-stars\">Binker </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/13/binker-moses-review-boyd-golding-london-jazz-stars\">and Moses</a> all attracting attention and media coverage around the world.

I don\u2019t hear that so much when I listen to American jazz.\u201d</p> <p>Rhythmically, this cocktail of sounds is not entirely without precedent. Two-tone bands in the early 1980s were experimenting with a similar blend, in particular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/sep/06/popandrock1\">the Beat</a>\u2019s drummer Everett Morton, who was playing reggae, calypso and Afrobeat in the context of a post-punk band.

But there are other influences that have fed into the London jazz scene \u2013 one of the things that you didn\u2019t really get in the States is the influence of the South African expatriate community in the 70s.\u201d</p> <p>He adds that for drummers, \u201cyou\u2019re defined by how many styles you can replicate with authenticity. Nowadays, if you want to survive as a jazz drummer in London, you have to check out reggae, soca, calypso and Afrobeat.\u201d</p> <p>Afrobeat has started to play a key role in this blend of rhythms. Many of the current British jazz wave studied at Trinity Laban in south-east London, a music college that was attended by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/may/05/fela-kuti-10-best-songs\">Fela Kuti</a> between 1958 and 1961. Cassie Kinoshi, the alto saxophonist and leader of the SEED Ensemble, was a Trinity student who was disappointed that Fela\u2019s music was not even mentioned on the school\u2019s curriculum.</p> <p>\u201cCassie always made a point of performing Fela\u2019s music at college for big performances,\u201d says Boyle. \u201cBut Fela\u2019s music is something that loads of young British musicians have got into independently. I remember finding his albums in the record library when I was in high school. A few years later I remember going to a Red Bull drumming masterclass with Fela\u2019s drummer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/05/tony-allen-fela-was-right-but-i-detest-singing-militant\">Tony Allen</a>, and loads of other London drummers were there \u2013 including Moses Boyd, Femi Koleoso and Eddie Hick. For all of us, Tony Allen is as important as, say, Max Roach or Tony Williams. Songs such as <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Qj5x6pbJMyU\">Zombie</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bC6ouP7qRoQ\">Colonial Mentality</a> are jazz standards to us.\u201d</p> <p>The multicultural nature of London life has had a very obvious effect on the music made by this generation of musicians. \u201cWe\u2019ve all grown up in London, and these rhythms have just seeped into us,\u201d says tenor saxophonist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/10/nubya-garcia-one-to-watch-saxophone\">Nubya Garcia</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s happened from listening to our parents\u2019 records, or from going to Carnival, or to dub nights, but it can also be the sounds you hear when you\u2019re walking past a car, or in a local shop, or listening to what kids on the bus are playing on their phones.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s tempting to see the family backgrounds of many of these musicians as crucial to the development of this music. Garcia\u2019s parents come from Guyana and Trinidad; <a href=\"http://www.cassiekinoshi.com/\">Cassie Kinoshi</a> has Nigerian, Sierra Leonean and Caribbean ancestry; drummer Femi Koleoso comes from a Nigerian family; tuba player <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/theon-cross-london-jazz-tuba-fyah-804801/\">Theon Cross</a>\u2019s parents come from Jamaica and St Lucia; Shabaka Hutchings spent much of his childhood in Barbados; Binker Golding\u2019s mother comes from Grenada. But it\u2019s not just heritage that is influencing this music.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3a0118a678a7d76a40c3f052e7b70b5868a3e97c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a0118a678a7d76a40c3f052e7b70b5868a3e97c/0_527_1961_2198/892.jpg\" alt=\"Emma-Jean Thackray.\" width=\"892\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018London is a place where people can flourish\u2019 ...

And, since moving to London, you start to hear so much music from all over the world \u2013 this is a place where people are allowed to flourish and share their music with everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Guitarist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/28/nardeydey-shirley-tetteh-i-was-so-into-jazz-i-thought-everything-else-was-trash\">Shirley Tetteh</a>, who plays with Nubya Garcia in the septet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/27/nerija-review-oslo-london\">N</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/27/nerija-review-oslo-london\">\u00e9rija</a>, is reluctant to draw direct connections between her heritage and the music she makes. \u201cA lot of people will make a connection between my guitar style and Ghanaian highlife, assuming this comes from my Ghanaian family,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd there is possibly is some subliminal influence. But I\u2019m very careful when talking about this. People stop seeing you as a musician and see you just as a Ghanaian. And I don\u2019t want to insult people who spend a lot of time mastering Ghanaian music. For me, it\u2019s about getting into very specific genres with respect, be it the funeral music of northern Ghana, or Jamaican nyabinghi music, or Malian kora music. I know that there are jazz drummers on the scene who are really into drill music, for instance. These are all serious genres that have a complex history.\u201d</p> <p>This palimpsest of Caribbean and African rhythms can have a curious effect on jazz audiences. Older jazz crowds \u2013 who miss the reassuring pulse of swing, bossa or funk beats \u2013 will often be baffled when they hear musicians soloing over these lopsided polyrhythms. But for a generation who have grown up with Latin-derived pop genres such as reggaeton, this music is very dancefloor friendly \u2013 frustratingly so, if you\u2019re now listening to it in lockdown. You see young audiences responding to that dominant 3/3/2 bounce \u2013 an eight-beat phrase that emphasises the first, fourth and seventh beats, the same rhythmic pulse common to big recent hits such as <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kJQP7kiw5Fk\">Despacito</a> or <a href=\"https://youtu.be/JGwWNGJdvx8\">Shape of You</a>.</p> <p>Clearly, such rhythms have also altered the way in which jazz musicians improvise and compose. \u201cWhen you\u2019re playing over certain Afrobeat rhythms, for instance, you tend to play in a more staccato style,\u201d says Shabaka Hutchings. In Sons of Kemet, he says, he tends not to play \u201cthe kind of flowing, narrative lines\u201d used in the classic US mid-century bebop style. \u201cI\u2019ll be playing free, or drawing from the chant-like qualities of nyabinghi music. I tend to improvise in different ways in all of the different line-ups I lead. With Shabaka and the Ancestors, I\u2019m working in the vocabulary of South African music, which is quite vocal-derived. But, in the Comet Is Coming, I\u2019m playing over electronic rhythms, which force me to play at a high intensity. It also forces you to embed yourself within the rhythms but also fight against them, moving between sustained lines and very rhythmic playing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bc35a8153bd83ae1b141c472cf80f28fe569f1f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc35a8153bd83ae1b141c472cf80f28fe569f1f2/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shabaka and the Ancestors.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Embedded in rhythms and fighting against them ...

For instance, if you\u2019re playing over a dancehall beat, the horn parts are often dependent on the lyrical nature of dancehall. You\u2019re playing like a dancehall vocalist, a style that\u2019s marked by repetition and interlocking rhythms \u2013 it\u2019s almost as if the sax is part of the drum kit. And that\u2019s not part of American jazz at all. But it\u2019s part of the London scene, via the Caribbean.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>American jazz still thinks that blending hip-hop with jazz is something quite radical. In London, that\u2019s taken as read</p> <footer> <cite>Emma-Jean Thackray</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Thackray also draws distinctions between US and UK jazz. \u201cAmerican jazz still thinks that blending hip-hop with jazz is something quite radical. Here, in London, that\u2019s taken as read. I\u2019ve always been influenced by the way in which, say, MF Doom constructs his phrases, using his rhythmic intonation to inform my own solos. A lot of British jazz musicians do this \u2013 it\u2019s part of our musical DNA, just as reggae and Afrobeat is. Americans struggle with that.\u201d She remembers how she played with an American drummer in New York after her UK drummer couldn\u2019t make the trip. \u201cHe was very good, and it sounded fine in the end, but it was very different \u2013 he couldn\u2019t really get that Caribbean two-step thing that I wanted.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say that this is music that has no American ancestry. \u201cThe irony is that dozens of these players came through the Trinity Laban jazz course, which was very bebop orientated,\u201d says Thackray. \u201cThat grounding remains strong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you listen to any of us practise, you\u2019ll hear a hell of a lot of bebop,\u201d says Garcia. \u201cThat\u2019s what you might hear when I\u2019m jamming with other members of N\u00e9rija. I can certainly play bebop over swing rhythms if I choose \u2013 it\u2019s just that I make a conscious decision not to do so on stage.\u201d</p> <p>Golding concurs, insisting that his duets with Boyd are directly inspired by classic duets between John Coltrane and Rashied Ali, Dewey Redman and Ed Blackwell, and Pharoah Sanders and Max Roach \u2013 even if the swing elements have been removed. Boyle acknowledges dozens of key American influences \u2013 not least a 1958 Ahmad Jamal track called Poinciana, where drummer Vernel Fournier seems to be subtly melding New Orleans and Caribbean influences. \u201cIt shows you that you can see glimmers of what we\u2019re now doing throughout jazz history,\u201d says Boyle.</p> <p>American jazz traditions have also remained at the heart of the Tomorrow\u2019s Warriors weekend schools that so many of these musicians attended. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Warriors had an approach to jazz that I really loved,\u201d says Tetteh. \u201cThey didn\u2019t divorce it from its American history, from notions of slavery and segregation. People such as Gary Crosby made it clear that jazz is very much an aural tradition, one that\u2019s not just taught academically, but something that is experienced and absorbed. The community aspect is hugely important.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a050b89f6014f60a511d54060a30de7d064e09b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a050b89f6014f60a511d54060a30de7d064e09b7/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theon Cross.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bringing New Orleans to London ... Theon Cross.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabrice Bourgelle</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Curiously, the one explicitly American area of music being explored by many British jazz musicians at the moment is the century-old traditional music of New Orleans \u2013 not least its marching-band tuba. Ben Kelly, <a href=\"http://orenmarshall.com/\">Oren Marshall</a>, Theon Cross: all have managed to make this seemingly antiquated instrument work in a modern context. \u201cTheon\u2019s music makes perfect sense when you listen to a lot of electronic music,\u201d says Boyle, who is currently touring in Cross\u2019s band. \u201cYou listen to grime, drill, trap, bounce \u2013 a lot of the basslines and sub-bass frequencies make perfect sense when played on a tuba. It becomes this thread linking ancient and modern.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTheon knows his traditional New Orleans jazz history back to front,\u201d says Golding, who taught Cross in Tomorrow\u2019s Warriors. \u201cHe can play you every tuba solo on every old Louis Armstrong 78 [rpm record]; he knows his New Orleans dirges. And it\u2019s the same with musicians such as Moses and Nubya and Shabaka. They\u2019re heading into the future, but they all know their history and they know how to use jazz as a key to unlock and interpret dozens of other forms of music. I\u2019m now teaching a generation of musicians who want to be the new Shabaka or Nubya, and I have to explain that if you want to play like them, you\u2019ve got to understand your history!\u201d </p> <p>What\u2019s exciting is that with their cosmopolitan vision of jazz, this London generation are not just understanding history \u2013 they\u2019re making it.</p>",
  "<p>This half-hour short film by Ariane Labed is a sparkily absurdist declaration of female independence that bucks against male fantasy.

Lola and Pierre shuffle around the living room in fabric shoe covers to walk and polish at the same time; she bonds with his mum by playing with the remote-control footrest on the pensioner\u2019s La-Z-Boy recliner. The film builds up a nice head of quirk, underpinned by Lola\u2019s outsider status.

In his passing, the Columbia River lost one of its most ardent protectors. The native tribes that fish the river and live along its banks lost a leader. And a family lost a husband and father who always put them first.</p> <p>Begay worked for 22 years for the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, an organization that oversees policy and fisheries services for the Yakama, Warm Springs, Umatilla and Nez Perce tribes. As a senior fishery technician, he was the organization\u2019s eyes and ears on the river, FiveCrows said. \u201cHe just always had a humorous story, and never took himself seriously,\u201d FiveCrows said.</p> <p>\u201cHe was the ultimate tour guide because he loved what he did.\u201d</p> <p>Begay, a member of the Yakama tribe nation, lived in Celilo Village, a small unincorporated Native American community about 90 miles east of Portland. He was a leader in the community, FiveCrows said, taking part in powwows, the annual First Salmon Feast, and the annual lamprey harvest.</p> <p>The river\u2019s salmon and lamprey hold cultural and spiritual significance to the local tribes, and Begay was committed to ensuring that their tradition of fishing would continue. \u201cHe had a belief that if people understood more about the tribal culture, they would be more understanding of where the tribes were coming from and why it should be important for everyone to protect the river and the salmon,\u201d FiveCrows said. </p> <p>One of Begay\u2019s favorite stories to tell was about encountering a sea lion at Sea World that he swore recognized him from his time hazing sea lions along the river.</p> <p>Begay would never hurt the sea lions, but he would fire off little firecrackers to spook them off.

It was him who called Abdool Karim to head the Covid-19 team.</p> <p>If Mkhize\u2019s sure-footed response to the Covid-19 pandemic has earned him praise, his handling of Aids was more chequered. As the KwaZulu-Natal executive council member responsible for health from 1994 to 2004, he opposed a court application to force government to roll out medicine to pregnant women to prevent HIV transmission to their babies, because he wanted the trials to finish first. But he also permitted government clinics in his province to roll out Aids medicines at a time when the national government had not yet allowed such a move.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e4b75139a79ce2e8744c0ac9bbf29d3d01fbc83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e4b75139a79ce2e8744c0ac9bbf29d3d01fbc83/0_250_4061_2436/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zweli Mkhize\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zweli Mkhize\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic earned him praise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Themba Hadebe/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just before his 2017 presidential campaign, Mkhize <a href=\"https://www.politicsweb.co.za/news-and-analysis/hivaids-why-mbeki-should-apologise--zweli-mkhize\">unsuccessfully called</a> on Mbeki to apologise for his view that HIV did not lead to Aids. \u201cHe led the country astray with a wrong view, which he was made to believe was true,\u201d Mkhize said.</p> <p>Mkhize\u2019s cabinet colleague responsible for promulgating the fierce lockdown regulations, local government minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, was also in the team leading South Africa\u2019s early Aids response. As Mandela\u2019s health minister from 1994 to 1999, she was tasked with reforming the public health system while trying to come to grips with the new pandemic.</p> <p>Some of her early ideas around Aids prevention were considered pioneering, but her later support for the toxic industrial solvent, Virodene, as an Aids cure, and the misspending of taxpayers\u2019 money on an Aids prevention musical, tarnished her reputation.</p> <p>Later she became Africa Union Commission chair and pushed for the founding of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention after the 2014 Ebola outbreak in parts of the continent. It now plays an important role in supporting African countries on Covid-19.</p> <p>She has earned praise for the clear and simple way she explained the government\u2019s plans to gradually ease the lockdown in her mother tongue, Zulu, the biggest first language in South Africa.</p> <p>Also prominent in South Africa\u2019s Covid-19 crisis are activists like Mark Heywood, who edits a news site focusing on human rights and social justice civil society organisations called <a href=\"https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/\">Maverick Citizen</a>. He was among those who led the fight to make Aids medication affordable and widely available. Of late, he\u2019s also provided advice to the local <a href=\"https://twitter.com/covidcoalition?lang=en\">C19 People\u2019s Coalition</a>, one of the biggest civil society Covid-19 responses in the world.</p> <p>As an Aids activist he learned how important it is to build alliances between those living with the disease, the health sector, trade unions, the media, and government. \u201cCovid-19 is a social ill as much as it affects individuals,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to address it socially, not just through individual behavioural interventions.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8406451756bd87b7e860088a3b8e5cd9e83bf98a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8406451756bd87b7e860088a3b8e5cd9e83bf98a/0_0_6450_4408/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young children wait to receive food donations without their parents during a handout in Johannesburg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young children wait to receive food donations during a handout in Johannesburg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Ludbrook/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Heywood foresees the looming possibility of a big battle around access to Covid-19 treatment and vaccines, similar to the battles for Aids medicines. \u201cBillions of people are going to need the vaccine when it arrives.

But the government\u2019s past failures to provide an effective and early HIV response has left South Africa with millions of HIV infections that could have been prevented. As a result people with weaker immune systems (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4911250/\">four out of 10</a> HIV-positive South Africans are untreated) could be more vulnerable to developing Covid-19, she says.</p> <p>\u201cThe most obvious lesson is the difference an early response can make. With HIV, the government started an evidence-based response much too late.\u201d South Africa only had 550 coronavirus cases when it closed borders and decided on a strict lockdown that lasted at least five weeks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f312e9297fa47a93b62c777facb5c89a6e3ab6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f312e9297fa47a93b62c777facb5c89a6e3ab6f/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nurse performs a swab test for Covid-19 on a health worker at the Vlakfontein Clinic in Lenasia, Johannesburg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South Africa managed to flatten its coronavirus curve through an early response and lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michele Spatari/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Communicating a clear and unambiguous message from government was another lesson, and partnerships have been struck with the media to make this possible \u2013 and to fight disinformation. \u201cActivists and the media were the complete enemy during that time [of Aids], but now the minister of health at his briefing would thank the media for being partners,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t criticise them, but we are on the same side.\u201d</p> <p>Putting science above politics is also crucial, she says. \u201cAbdool Karim was world-renowned at that time [during the Aids pandemic] already, and he was rejected.

When child activist Nkosi Johnson died of Aids-related complications aged 12 in 2001, Mbeki was silent.

The man had been displaying Covid-19 symptoms in the week leading up to his death, but had many other health complications. Australia\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, <strong>Paul Kelly</strong>, said the case \u201cshows that there is community transmission of some sort\u201d.</li> \n   <li>The New South Wales premier, <strong>Gladys Berejiklian</strong>, announced a 12-month wage freeze for public servants in line with decisions made in other jurisdictions. She said the freeze was \u201cabout saving livelihoods, saving jobs and saving lives\u201d. </li> \n   <li>The Western Australia premier, <strong>Mark McGowan</strong>, called for better state-federal communication after six Covid-19 cases were confirmed among the crew of a ship which docked at Fremantle. McGowan admitted there were \u201cerrors made all around\u201d.</li> \n   <li>Cedar Meats, the Melbourne abattoir at the centre of a Covid-19 cluster, will restart operations, including processing, on Thursday. About 300 staff are expected to return to work.</li> \n   <li>During an interview on the ABC, the prime minister, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>, refused to guarantee workers would be better off as a result of the so-called Accord 2.0, saying that was what he \u201cwanted\u201d to see.</li> \n   <li>After a two-year investigation, the AFP announced it will not lay charges against the News Corp journalist <strong>Annika Smethurst</strong>.</li> \n   <li>The Victorian premier, <strong>Daniel Andrews</strong>, said people would continue working from home \u201cfor all of June\u201d after the state recorded eight new cases of Covid-19.<br></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T09:54:36.449Z\">at 10.54am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ece2cbc8f08498203f3cc4b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T09:03:35.947Z\">10.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Western Australian premier, <strong>Mark McGowan</strong>, with his daily Covid-19 dashboard.

There are only 2,400 eastern bristlebirds in the wild and about 140 in the Howes Flat population near Mallacoota.</p> \n  <p>They caught the birds, described by the ecologist <strong>Dr Rohan Clarke </strong>as ground-dwelling weak flyers that were \u201crelatively cryptic\u201d animals with a \u201cloud and distinctive metallic call\u201d using mist nets and bluetooth speakers.</p> \n  <p>One speaker would be set up to play the eastern bristlebird\u2019s call and then, when it sounded as if the real birds had approached the speaker, the sound would be remotely switched to a second speaker, which would draw the birds into the path of the fine cotton net. </p> \n  <p>The fire stopped on the edge of the Howes Flat habitat, but another bristlebird population a short distance away, crossing the border with NSW, appears to have been destroyed. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T07:45:36.407Z\">at 8.45am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div

<strong>Josh Taylor</strong> at the bushfire Senate committee hearing ...</p> \n  <p>The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet faced questions at the Senate committee hearing on the 2019-20 bushfires over whether the prime minister, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>, had been adequately briefed about the bushfires during the fire season last year.<br></p> \n  <p>PM&amp;C hadn\u2019t provided verbal or written briefings to him while he was in Hawaii from 15 to 21 December (he cut his trip short by two days), but that doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility that PMO was updating the PM on the situation.</p> \n  <p>The department secretary, <strong>Phil Gaetjens</strong>,<strong> </strong>told the committee that the PM was in Australia when the fires in Victoria, NSW and South Australia flared up in late November, and back when the state of emergency declarations were made in four states on 30 December, so it was incorrect to say he was absent during the crisis.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a correct interpretation to say that the prime minister was not here in the crisis,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Gaetjens himself was on leave for half of December, he told the committee.</p> \n  <p>The department confirmed that before Morrison left on holidays in Hawaii he was \u201cvery well informed\u201d about the bushfire situation via a series of teleconference meetings with the head of Emergency Management Australia and others in November.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt seems to me that what you were telling us is that he would have had considerable knowledge about how extreme the crisis was and what was unfolding, yet he still decided to go off on holidays,\u201d the Greens senator <strong>Janet Rice</strong> replied.</p> \n </div> \n <p

The need to fund more domestic places so young people, and the thousands of other Australians whose jobs have disappeared, have tertiary education as a viable option. Past recessions have shown that, as unemployment rates soar, those who cannot earn enrol to learn.<br></p> \n  <p>2. The proposed \u201csafe corridors\u201d to bring international students into Australia needs to be implemented as soon as is safely possible so there is at least some chance of international students getting to Australia and clearing quarantine for the second part of this year. Failure to do this swiftly will add to the devastation of our international education, which contributed $40 billion to our economy each year before COVID-19.<br></p> \n  <p>3. International students, who are already in Australia, should be supported and encouraged to remain here. Community groups, state and local governments and have stepped up to support those who have been hard hit by job losses and exclusion from JobSeeker and JobKeeper. They do however need practical, ongoing help, coordinated at the national level that shows how we value them for their contributions to the Australian economy.</p> \n  <p>4. Cuts of up to 21000 jobs are underway as universities yet the Federal Government has ensured that universities \u2013 unlike other large businesses and some private universities \u2013 are ineligible for the JobKeeper subsidy. This does not make sense.</p> \n  <p>5. Researchers urgently need government assistance to ensure that they can continue and not waste work already done. Many research projects have already been suspended.</p> \n  <p>International researchers, who are very important to the sector, may not return to Australia to finish their work. Much of the $4.7 billion that universities put into research each year has been funded by revenue from international education. That revenue has now evaporated from a sector that is likely to take years to recover.<br></p> \n  <p>6. There is a need to re-start infrastructure projects that have been suspended as universities try to stop their financial haemorrhaging. The Victorian Government has allocated $350 million, which will greatly assist universities with capital projects in that state, but what about the rest of the nation?<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T23:25:08.432Z\">at 12.25am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecda35e8f0852d72995058d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T23:19:50.747Z\">12.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hundreds of masks and plastic containers have washed up on Sydney\u2019s eastern beaches overnight.

  "<p>The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, has been forced to acknowledge that his state\u2019s health department was notified of sick crew members on board a live export vessel before it docked in Fremantle, but remains critical of the federal Department of Agriculture for not \u201cbacking up\u201d such a significant message with \u201cat least a phone call\u201d.</p> \n<p>The admission came after the federal agriculture minister, David Littleproud, defended the actions of his department in response to McGowan\u2019s claim on Tuesday that he discovered sick crew were on the ship Al-Kuwait that day only by word of mouth from dock workers. Littleproud released an email showing a department worker had notified WA Health on Friday about three sick crew members.</p> \n<p>After six crew tested positive on Tuesday, it emerged on Wednesday the email had been sent to a generic address within the WA Health department, also copying in an incorrect email address for a specific WA Health worker.</p> \n<p>As a result of the delays caused by crew quarantines, the original $12m shipment of about 56,000 sheep destined for Kuwait will likely miss the 1 June deadline introduced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/14/australias-ban-on-live-sheep-trade-could-be-extended-due-to-heat-stress-risk\">limit transport of live animals to the Middle East</a> during the northern summer.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/wa-premier-fears-more-covid-19-infections-after-six-test-positive-on-live-export-ship-in-fremantle\">Western Australian premier fears more Covid-19 cases after six test positive on live export ship in Fremantle</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Also on Wednesday a staff member at a Melbourne hotel hosting quarantined travellers was among Victoria\u2019s eight latest coronavirus cases.</p> \n<p>The Victorian health department revealed the Rydges on Swanston worker had been diagnosed with Covid-19, with the cause of the infection under investigation and the hotel shut to the public. Two of the other fresh cases have been detected in staff at Lynden Aged Care home in Camberwell, bringing the total cases at the facility to three.</p> \n<p>With authorities scrambling to find a replacement crew for the Al-Kuwait, McGowan has said he would support an exemption to the summer export deadline being granted by the federal Department of Agriculture. As the sheep have undergone a biosecurity clearance, they are unable to be returned to local farms.</p> \n<p>Scott Morrison moved to pre-empt any wider opposition to the live export industry, urging people not to get \u201ctoo far ahead of themselves on this\u201d, and arguing halting live exports would \u201churt our economy drastically\u201d.</p> \n<p>At a press conference on Wednesday, McGowan, while calling for clearer communication between federal and state authorities in relation to port arrivals, said the initial email revealed by Littleproud had been noted by a WA Health employee.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe email did not raise red flags ... in these times it plainly should have,\u201d McGowan said in a statement. \u201cWe have to be more vigilant.

The federal government gave permission for the ship to dock at Fremantle that day, with a port authority worker boarding the vessel donning personal protective equipment to guide it into port.</p> \n<p>On the same day, 22 May, the department sent an email to the WA Health department noting the sickness, but concluding \u201cfrom information received no concern for Covid-19 on vessel\u201d.

Confident Charlotte wasn\u2019t too cut up; she meets Jonathan, who is pleasingly wealthy, when she\u2019s selling him a fancy loft apartment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The people in these stories seem imprisoned by a judgmental authorial voice</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One day a couple of years in, she realises \u201cthat she was not the most perfect person to be married to Jonathan Bell \u2013 even though she <em>was</em> married to him and liked him very much.\u201d She breaks this to him not long after he\u2019s had thyroid surgery \u2013 she \u201ctold Jonathan her news\u201d, is the way Ford describes their conversation; the information is all in her control. Yet the reader knows he will not react too badly; the story is, for the most part, an elegant meditation on the currents of adult relationships, and how far any of us can escape our histories. It is the strongest piece in this uneven book, yet there is still a laziness of observation which also mars, for the most part, the other tales.</p> <p>So we learn that Charlotte has two relationships after her divorce from her first husband: \u201cOne with an intense but too-diminutive brain surgeon, and one with a burly cop who wanted her to relocate to Staten Island.\u201d Isn\u2019t the stereotypical cop always burly \u2013 and always living on Staten Island? Women fare worse when it comes to this kind of slack description. Charlotte is \u201cforty-four, a tall, easily smiling, lanky, intelligent beauty\u201d. Is this how she thinks of herself? She had once been a model: \u201cHouse hunters often did double takes when she hauled \u2018those legs\u2019 out of the car to present a property.\u201d To whom do those quotation marks belong?</p> <p>Charlotte, at least, is slender. More than once, across the entirety of this collection, the reader feels as if she\u2019s in the presence of a speak-your-weight machine. In \u201cCrossing\u201d, Tom, a lawyer in the midst of finalising his divorce, observes a young woman: her \u201cplump hands. The placid blue-eyed gaze of profound un-interest \u2026 The waist an equator, the legs large in a too-tight brown skirt that rode up revealingly.\u201d In \u201cThe Run of Yourself\u201d, Peter Boyce\u2019s daughter Polly has \u201cadded more weight. She wore very tight blue jeans that weren\u2019t helping.\u201d Peter, like Jonathan in \u201cSecond Language\u201d, is a widower; his wife Mae has been dead for two years. She was stricken with cancer but took her own life before the disease could kill her; she is described as \u201cstarkly pretty and thin\u201d when dying of cancer.</p> <p>Ford is one of the grand figures of contemporary US literature: the Frank Bascombe trilogy of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2013/apr/12/richard-ford-the-sportswriter-podcast\">The Sportswriter</a></em>, <em>Independence Day</em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/oct/08/fiction.features\">The Lay of the Land</a></em>, published between the mid-1980s and the early years of this century, are landmark books. His work has always been distinguished by the precision of his observation and his thoughtful dissection of American life in the years following the end of the Vietnam war. His characters\u2019 discontents \u2013 illness, divorce, estrangement \u2013 have always reflected the troubles of his native land.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/09/richard-ford\">Richard Ford: 'I didn't finish a book until I was 19'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in <em>Sorry for Your Trouble</em>, that thoughtfulness is too often absent. Characters in stories are entitled to their perceptions of the world and those they observe. But the stories in this book come across as stale because, more often than not, the people in them seem imprisoned by a judgmental authorial voice. Most of these narratives concern the tribulations of middle-aged, middle-class men who find that life hasn\u2019t quite worked out as they\u2019d planned. In \u201cNothing to Declare\u201d the narrator encounters an old love and has yet another unsatisfactory encounter with her; in \u201cDisplaced\u201d, Henry recalls a youthful friendship gone wrong; in \u201cJimmy Green \u2013 1992\u201d Jimmy almost hooks up with a woman in Paris (\u201cthe flesh under her eyes was slightly wrinkled\u201d) against the backdrop of Bill Clinton\u2019s election to president. In earlier books Ford has painted these kinds of lives with wisdom and sensitivity; here, the characters\u2019 resistance to emotional depth leaks out into the narrative. Henry\u2019s friend Niall in \u201cDisplaced\u201d is a working-class kid trying to hide the fact that he\u2019s gay, but the broad brushstrokes tip him towards caricature rather than character.</p> <p>What\u2019s intriguing in \u201cSecond Language\u201d is the way in which both Jonathan and Charlotte seem, to a certain extent, to elude their author: that\u2019s what gives them a life beyond the page.

Gale first got out on a shrimp boat when he was 12. \u201cMama wouldn\u2019t let me go any earlier, but from 12 years on out \u2013 every weekend I wasn\u2019t in school or summer vacation I was on a shrimp boat.\u201d He spent the next 20 years learning from his dad, who shrimped for 45 years.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was an average day like?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d leave about 4.30 in the morning and get to the dragging grounds about 6.30, maybe 7am. I\u2019d put out in daylight, make three or four drags that day. The latest I\u2019d be out would be 4pm,\u201d he says. \u201cLook,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing right here, right now, selling shrimp on this corner \u2013 it sucks. It\u2019s way better out there on the water. It\u2019s where I\u2019ve lived all my life. If I wasn\u2019t in the ocean, I was in the river running trout lines and catching catfish, or fishing for shad in winter.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Americans eat more shrimp than ever \u2013 an average of 4.4lb per person \u2013 but not all of America\u2019s shrimpers are thriving. Nearly 90% of America\u2019s shrimp comes from overseas, farmed in Asia and Central America, where working conditions and meat quality can be <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/dining/shrimp-sourcing-united-states.html\">repugnant</a>. It is increasingly rare for fresh, wild-caught, chemical-free shrimp to reach an American consumer\u2019s plate.</p> <p>Off the coast of Georgia, fishermen harvested about 2.61m lb of shrimp in 2019, a haul valued more than $11m. Shrimping is deeply ingrained in culture there, but Georgia\u2019s fishermen are facing significant challenges: an ageing workforce, low prices per pound, climate change and <a href=\"https://gacoast.uga.edu/research/major-projects/black-gill/\">black gill disease</a>, leading many to wonder if the industry will survive.</p> <p>These days, depending on the season, Gale can get $3 to $5.50 per lb of shrimp. \u201cBack in the 1980s and 1990s,\u201d he says, \u201cwe were selling the same size shrimp for $8 a pound. We have good years \u2013 but most of the time we have bad years now.\u201d</p> <p>Bryan Fluech, the associate marine extension director at Marine Extension and Georgia Sea Grant, uses the term \u201cgraying of the fleet\u201d when talking about the future of shrimping in Georgia.</p> <p>\u201cShrimp are the Cheetos of the sea,\u201d Fluech tells me. \u201cEverything eats them. But people need to remember: that shrimp didn\u2019t just show up in a Publix.</p> <p>\u201cThe decline of the shrimping industry has been death by a thousand cuts,\u201d Fluech says. \u201cThe cost for maintaining a boat is up, and the boats are getting older. Sustainable fishing practices are expensive to implement. The younger generation doesn\u2019t want to work on a shrimping vessel, and captains tell me they can\u2019t find a reliable workforce. The cost of ice and fuel might rise, but the profit on shrimp doesn\u2019t. Plus, our guys are competing with foreign markets.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=So%20you%20want%20to%20eat%20it%3F%20&amp;description=Here%20are%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.seafoodwatch.org%2Fseafood-recommendations%2Fgroups%2Fshrimp%3Fq%3DShrimp%26t%3Dshrimp%22%3Especific%20guidelines%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20eat%20shrimp%20as%20ethically%20as%20possible.%20The%20Oceanic%20Society%20suggests%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oceanicsociety.org%2Fblog%2F2181%2Fwhat-is-sustainable-seafood-and-how-do-i-choose-it-your-top-questions-answered%3Fgclid%3DCj0KCQjwzZj2BRDVARIsABs3l9LS3WRzMbYYMzOrcS-nAKD4CsZy-KpgTT-7aeW-5MeJBwDg8aEqBbIaAlo4EALw_wcB%22%3E%20avoiding%20%3C%2Fa%3E%0Aall%20imported%20shrimp%20because%20of%20health%20and%20labor%20practices.%0A%0A&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"So you want to eat it?\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=So%20you%20want%20to%20eat%20it%3F%20&description=Here%20are%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.seafoodwatch.org%2Fseafood-recommendations%2Fgroups%2Fshrimp%3Fq%3DShrimp%26t%3Dshrimp%22%3Especific%20guidelines%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20eat%20shrimp%20as%20ethically%20as%20possible.%20The%20Oceanic%20Society%20suggests%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oceanicsociety.org%2Fblog%2F2181%2Fwhat-is-sustainable-seafood-and-how-do-i-choose-it-your-top-questions-answered%3Fgclid%3DCj0KCQjwzZj2BRDVARIsABs3l9LS3WRzMbYYMzOrcS-nAKD4CsZy-KpgTT-7aeW-5MeJBwDg8aEqBbIaAlo4EALw_wcB%22%3E%20avoiding%20%3C%2Fa%3E%0Aall%20imported%20shrimp%20because%20of%20health%20and%20labor%20practices.%0A%0A&link=false\">So you want to eat it?</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cA <em>lot </em>has changed,\u201d Gale tells me. \u201cWe\u2019re losing our infrastructure. Lost our big block ice plant that had given ice since the 1940s. Can\u2019t hardly find anybody to build nets any more.\u201d</p> <p>Fluech professes enormous respect for the shrimpers still operating in Georgia\u2019s waters. \u201cLet me tell you \u2013 MacGyver [the TV adventurer hero] has <em>nothing</em> on Georgia shrimpers. They are so resourceful. You can\u2019t just be a good shrimper any more. You\u2019ve got to be a welder, a businessman and a direct marketer too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople love to say that they\u2019re all about local food,\u201d Fluech adds. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll see a shrimping boat on every tourism brochure, but commercial waterfronts have changed. People don\u2019t like the look of a working dock. There\u2019s only one left in Brunswick, which means the fishermen have to take those prices or go out on their own. We say we like authentic experiences, but we\u2019re losing them.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>You can see the old reverence for Georgia\u2019s shrimpers in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b59nWMMebho&amp;t=3s\">Blessing of the Fleet</a> ceremonies, which still happen along the coast in towns like Brunswick and Darien at the end of March, as the fleet readies itself for the season.</p> <p>Ships with beautiful names like the Lady Raven, Flying Cloud, Bernice II, Liberty Bell and Sundown arrive at the ceremony decorated with lights and streamers. A crowd gathers, and a minister \u2013 often waving a toilet brush spray-painted gold, and flanked by the Knights of Columbus \u2013 offers a blessing into the microphone. Shrimping is a dangerous vocation, after all, and every year there are injuries, drownings and boats that don\u2019t return.</p> <p>This year\u2019s ceremony was postponed due to the pandemic. The cancellation feels like the latest knock in a long and difficult fight.</p> <p>Once celebrated, many shrimpers feel vilified as they face mounting regulations aimed at preserving other species, like sea turtles. In the 1980s, before turtle excluder devices (TEDs) were prevalent, shrimp nets were responsible for more than 10,000 sea turtle <a href=\"https://modernfarmer.com/2020/01/shrimpers-vs-sea-turtles-the-war-continues/\">deaths</a> annually in the south-east. In 1989, when regulations tightened, shrimpers created a 500-boat blockade in the Gulf coast, raising skull and crossbones flags and even ramming Coast Guard ships.</p> <p>In Georgia, tension between scientists and fishermen is amplified by black gill disease, which affects a shrimp\u2019s respiratory system. The shrimp\u2019s immune response causes the visible blackening of the gills, and results in lethargy, potential death and sometimes the collapse of an entire fishery.</p> <p>Black gill is an expensive problem. In 2019, the commerce department <a href=\"https://coastalgadnr.org/federal-government-announces-1-million-disaster-relief-2013-shrimp-fishery-failure\">distributed</a> over $1m to commercial shrimpers and researchers because of the 2013 white shrimp fishery failure.</p> <p>Black gill is, however, more pervasive than ever. Gale reports that it\u2019s starting earlier in the year, beginning in May instead of August, and continuing throughout fall. Though it has been around since the 1990s, researchers believe the disease is <a href=\"https://www.gpbnews.org/post/black-gill-shrimp-linked-climate-change\">worsening</a> with climate change.</p> <p>Climate change will continue to wreak further havoc on the industry \u2013 changing the salinity of the water, shifting the distribution of shrimp \u2013 female shrimp need colder water to spawn. Warmer winters appear to predict a smaller annual shrimp harvest, and may not kill the bacteria responsible for black gill.</p> <p>Keeping shrimp fisheries healthy, and livelihoods possible, requires intense collaboration between fishermen and scientists. Otherwise, foreign markets with cheap labor and unsustainable practices will take over the market share entirely.</p> <p>\u201cWe <em>have</em> to look for the cooperative path,\u201d Fluech says, emphasizing how helpful it can be when shrimpers help with data collection and reporting. He currently works with five to eight shrimpers each season; the fishermen help report black gill using an online tracking app.</p> <p>One of the best historical examples of this cooperative path is fisherman <a href=\"https://voices.nmfs.noaa.gov/sinkey-boone\">Sinkey Boone</a>, who hailed from a long line of shrimpers in Darien. Boone created the first turtle excluder device in the late 1960s, called the Georgia Jumper, which allowed turtles \u2013 an oxygen-breathing species \u2013 to escape trawler nets so they wouldn\u2019t drown.</p> <p>Scientists and fishermen may seem at odds, but collaboration is possible, and perhaps imperative.</p> <p>\u201cMe and the shrimpers may not agree on everything, but I respect the hell out of them,\u201d says Fluech.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Gale agrees with the saying that shrimpers never retire. \u201cWe fish till we fall out and die,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen men fish right on until their 80s and 90s. I know an old man right now who\u2019s got to be 85 and he outworks anybody I know \u2013 still climbs up in the rigging. Diabetic and <em>still</em> goes.\u201d</p> <p>I hear stories about poisonous snakes tangled in anchor lines, boats on fire, near-sinkings, and a man in his 70s impaled by his own equipment who hardly survived, but broke out of the hospital to get back on his boat a few days later.</p> <p>\u201cOnce fishing\u2019s in your blood, and you get used to it, you just don\u2019t want to do anything else,\u201d Gale says.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d still work for my daddy,\u201d Gale tells me. \u201cHe just <em>knew</em> where the shrimp would be \u2013 it was absolutely amazing. He knew the tide cycles, what the weather meant. You could set your watch to it. Another fisherman could make that same pass and miss them.\u201d</p> <p>In 1979, the government issued 1,471 commercial trawling licenses in Georgia \u2013 but only 253 in 2014. If the decline in Georgia\u2019s shrimping continues, the ripple effect will be felt in the local economy, on dinner plates, during seasonal festivals, and on the horizon line, where many are used to seeing early morning trawlers. Frozen foreign shrimp and farmed shrimp \u2013 known as aquaculture \u2013 are the likely future.</p> <p>\u201cDo I think there will always be shrimpers in Georgia?\u201d Fluech asks me. \u201cI hope so. You have to be an eternal optimist in this business.\u201d</p>",

The official count was of around 1.1 million pigs culled in the year after that according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).</p> <p>Unofficially, however, China\u2019s numbers were probably closer to 200 million or more pigs culled, slaughtered early or lost to the disease in the first year of the outbreak. Last July the Dutch bank Rabobank estimated that at least 40% of the country\u2019s 360 million pig population could have been lost.</p> <p>The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the UN agency based in Paris which monitors all notifiable animal diseases, told the Guardian it considered this \u201ca reasonable estimate\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d00476d7e7ddfcc3b0e25dc0ad36238295e79d74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d00476d7e7ddfcc3b0e25dc0ad36238295e79d74/0_140_2904_1742/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A wild boar in woods near Saint-Hubert, Belgium.

They have actually learned to \u2018live\u2019 with the disease in the country, and benefit enormously from the high pork price.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/11/african-swine-fever-destroying-small-pig-farms-as-factory-farming-booms-report\">African swine fever destroying small pig farms, as factory farming booms \u2013 report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Profits <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/markets/article/3083684/china-pork-stock-expectations-fattened-again-and-their-past\">continue to skyrocket</a> at top Chinese pork producers such as WH Group, Wens and Muyuan. None of these companies would comment when approached by the Guardian to discuss any enhanced biosecurity measures they are implementing at facilities in China.</p> <p>Meanwhile urgently needed preventive action is being delayed, partly, ironically, because of the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cIn order to protect the pig sector, and the people who rely on it, the only available course is global coordinated actions at all levels \u2013 this includes accelerating vaccine research, increasing biosecurity and surveillance, and enforcing policies for safe trade and cross-border movement,\u201d said Rozstalnyy.</p> <p>\u201cAt the same time there are some instances in which political or economic sensitivity could lead to unwillingness to report cases,\u201d he said. \u201cTackling ASF in a globally coordinated way, where all countries can benefit from stronger multi-sectoral support, will require as much transparency and openness as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Pfeiffer believes the ASF virus is now almost \u201cunstoppable\u201d and fears are growing among pig producers in the US and Europe that it is only a matter of time before the disease reaches their pig herds from continuing outbreaks in China, Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of it is about just a chance event,\u201d Zoe Davies, chief executive at the National Pig Association in the UK, told the Guardian. \u201cI believe it is here already. It\u2019s just whether that chance event would happen, that somebody would go out into the countryside, and either put [contaminated meat] in a bin or chuck something over a hedge that the pigs got access to.

  "<p>It is a narrative standard in role-playing adventure games: the hero is pitted against a Big Evil, who has a strategic or chaotic hunger to destroy the world we know.

Role-playing games need to offer more than a sequence of linked events toward a monumental finale. A world is made of people, not just objectives.</p> <p>This is where side quests come in: the tiny stories that make the emotional texture of a journey richer and fuller. Whether we\u2019re talking role-playing epics such as Final Fantasy and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/13/witcher-3-wild-hunt-review-xbox-ps4-pc\">The Witcher</a>, or indie adventures such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/14/night-in-the-woods-review-platformer-90s\">Night </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/14/night-in-the-woods-review-platformer-90s\">in </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/14/night-in-the-woods-review-platformer-90s\">the Woods</a> and <a href=\"http://www.playiconoclasts.com/\">Iconoclasts</a>, it is off the beaten path that the stories gain their power.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Side quests are not just portals to smaller adventures, they are demonstrations of kindness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Across a lifetime of playing video games, I think most often of these side quests: lost animals, medicine in need of delivering before the ingredients expire, underwear retrieved from a bedroom where it shouldn\u2019t be, baby rats that must be fed every day, hiding a cursed fiance and his panicked bride in the nights before their wedding. All of these tiny stories are alleyways off the main drag of the quest, but ones I happily get lost down. I prefer a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/apr/11/final-fantasy-vii-remake-a-triumphant-return-for-cloud-strife\">Cloud Strife</a> who will stop to help a child in a slum find her lost cats to the one who would power through undeterred to his climactic battle.

I hope. I am interested in ways that we can play games and save worlds without violence, ways in which gameplay utilises curiosity, helpfulness and generosity as power in the place of a gun or a sword. Side quests are not just portals to smaller adventures, they are demonstrations of kindness.</p> <p>In Paper Mario: the Thousand-Year Door, a starkly underrated RPG, we are invited to spend time keeping the ageing mayor of a village of Koopas company, or assembling a cake for a psychic who lives beneath the central town of Rogueport. These simple, transactional quests elevate the adventure, giving the world and its oddball creatures an independent life. And there is no rush: the princess will still be waiting in another castle when we are done.</p> <p>The transgressive indie adventure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/nov/06/11-best-games-on-nintendo-switch-mario-zelda\">Undertale</a> turns the stuff of side quests into the main thrust of the game: talking to the monsters lets you pass them by safely. Rather than electing the simple input of violence, the game asks you to consider conversation and engagement instead, mercy as the ultimate display of heroism. In this way, every encounter becomes a tiny story of its own: a healing operation, a brief journey taken.</p> <p>The first real side quest that impacted me profoundly when I was growing up was a classic within a classic. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, on the Nintendo 64, Kakariko Village. Upon arriving at the game\u2019s first town, we are asked in simple terms by a stressed-out girl called Anju to help her find her chickens. She can\u2019t go and get them herself because she can\u2019t touch them - they\u2019ll make her sick. So off you go. Though we have the burden of an entire kingdom on our young shoulders, a heavy sword, and an even heavier quest, we help her. We trek up behind the windmill, clamber over fences, thrash open boxes, and for a few minutes, we are just a child, running after chickens. In return, she gives us an empty glass bottle and sends us on our way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72e330c83203f2e89f06d38b08368590b750c7b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72e330c83203f2e89f06d38b08368590b750c7b9/0_0_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There is more to life in Legend of Zelda than saving the world from Ganon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simple pleasures ... there is more to life in Legend of Zelda than saving the world from Ganondorf.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The bottle, though not a weapon, becomes one of the most useful items in the entire game. Later, we use it to hold ingredients for medicine to help another citizen of Hyrule. It can hold potions, and milk, to heal us, too. The chickens weren\u2019t even that hard to find.</p> <p>In the shadow of huge plot devices like destiny and impending doom, it is important that adventure games give us the chance to yield to tiny, human interactions. We must be given space to heal the citizens of the world, as well as the world itself \u2013 to find beloved pets, gather ingredients, solve disputes.

  "<p>Fines given to people travelling for childcare reasons during the coronavirus lockdown will be looked into by the government after Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was caught flat-footed by a vicar.</p> \n<p>The Rev Martin Poole, a Church of England vicar, said he challenged Hancock at the Downing Street press briefing after feeling compelled to expose the inequality he believed the Dominic Cummings case revealed.</p> \n<p>In a surprise move Hancock said he would ask the Treasury about the penalty notices, which were initially \u00a360 and later rose to \u00a3100, and which were given to people breaching the lockdown rules. It is not known how many fines have been given to families travelling for childcare reasons.</p> \n<p>Poole, 61, from Brighton, was selected to ask a question at the daily briefing as a member of the public. He told the Guardian: \u201cThis came from a genuine sense of unfairness. I know families who have suffered all sorts of hardships because of this. I\u2019m concerned about inequality and standards for people in public life and the rest of us, and I think one of the roles of the church is sometimes to call these things out when we see it.</p> \n<p>\u201cI know a mother, [who] was a nurse, and she and her husband both went down with the virus, and they got on with it until they both recovered. That\u2019s what many, many, people have done.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hancock, who had not had previous sight of the question, said he would write to the vicar saying whether the fines could be refunded.</p> \n<p>He said during the press conference: \u201cWe do understand the impact and the need for making sure that children get adequate childcare. That is one of the significant concerns that we\u2019ve had all the way through this and so I think especially coming from a man of the cloth that is perfectly reasonable to take away that question. I\u2019ll have to talk to my Treasury colleagues before I can answer it in full. We\u2019ll look at it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Shortly after the briefing, government advisers stressed that Hancock had been asked about another government policy area and had not promised an official review but only to look into the issue. The Home Office, rather than the Treasury, will look into the issue.</p> \n<p>As of mid-May police in England and Wales have issued more than 14,000 fines for alleged breaches of lockdown laws.</p> \n<p>Poole, of St Luke\u2019s church, in the Brighton suburb of Prestonville, said he first submitted his question on Saturday after it emerged the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser, Cummings, had driven from London to Durham to seek childcare for his four-year-old during lockdown amid fears that both he and his wife were becoming ill. </p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been galling. Since this came up I\u2019ve been trying to find the official advice on this,\u201d Poole said. \u201cAnd wider than that, if the government starts saying it\u2019s okay to interpret rules and laws \u2013 and the people who have had penalty notices have broken the law \u2013 if we are all being told we can use our instincts as to whether we can abide by the law, that\u2019s an increasingly serious thing for the future.\u201d</p> \n<p>After Poole\u2019s live question to Hancock, Sky News asked if he felt there had been hypocrisy. He said he thought the government operated by a different set of principles to the rest of society.</p> \n<p>A police officer had reported that members of the public were using Cummings\u2019 alleged breach of lockdown rules as a reason to follow suit.</p> \n<p>The officer, who said he worked in London and gave his name as Scott, told LBC radio that he found enforcing the law more difficult now. When he asked growing numbers of lockdown flouters why they were refusing to observe the UK restrictions, they told him it was because \u201clockdown was over\u201d and if Cummings \u201ccan do what he wants [then] we should be able to too\u201d, the officer said, adding: \u201cAs a police officer, I don\u2019t know what to respond back to them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cummings denies any wrongdoing.</p> \n<p>On the last bank holiday Monday the crowds who descended on British beaches were attributed in part to Cummings\u2019 travels and Johnson\u2019s apparent sanctioning of long car journeys.</p>",

It is unclear whether greater gliders are now using the site.</p> <p>The project has never been assessed under Australia\u2019s national environmental law, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, but has a state development consent.</p> <p>At the time of the initial proposal in 2008, the greater glider was not listed as a threatened species under the EPBC Act.</p> <p>The species was formally listed as vulnerable in 2016. It is now one of the federal government\u2019s priority species requiring urgent assessment after fires destroyed parts of its habitat in Victoria and NSW.</p> <p>The EDO will argue that the planned development is now a breach of federal environmental law. The legal firm will seek a declaration that the clearing is likely to have a significant impact on the greater glider and should not be permitted to proceed unless it assessed and approved at a federal level.</p> <p>The Manyana development is just one project that highlights the problems that can arise for species when environmental catastrophes occur in the period between a development being granted approval and works commencing.</p> <p>In many instances this timeframe can be several years and a species status can change owing to mounting pressures from drought, heatwaves and fires, or as a result of threats such as clearing for other projects.</p> <p>\u201cIt is clear that a paradigm shift is needed to protect Australia\u2019s incredible wildlife, which suffered so tremendously last summer,\u201d Morris said.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, through no fault of their own, the developer of this site now owns a piece of land that may be critical to the survival of the greater glider.\u201d</p> <p>Since the fire disaster the planned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/21/koalas-localised-extinction-planned-nsw-shenhua-coalmine\">Shenhua Watermark coalmine</a> and logging in NSW and Victoria \u2013 which is exempt from federal environmental laws \u2013 have also been identified as development that will push species under pressure closer to extinction unless governments decide to step in.</p> <p>Morris said the coronavirus pandemic had affected the ability to conduct thorough assessments of the full impact of the fires. \u201cThe proper approach\u201d would be to pause development of sites that might now hold increased importance to the survival of species, he said.</p> <p>The independent ecologist will be granted access to the site for three days and nights. The matter is scheduled to be heard by the federal court again on 5 June.</p> <p>Ozy Homes said it could not comment on a matter before the court.

A further eight Tory MPs have been publicly critical of the senior aide\u2019s actions and three said privately that he should be forced out.

Across England, the number of users of drugs who require supervised consumption has reduced from 51% as of January to 16% now.</p> \n<p>She said: \u201cWe moved away from people having to attend the pharmacy every day to collecting their medication either weekly or in some cases every two weeks, so moving quite quickly away from the need to go to the pharmacy every day. That obviously helped the pharmacy as well.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s always safer for clients to have OST available to them rather than be off it and use street drugs. That was the overarching principle. People are on supervised consumption, if we remove that how do we keep them safe?\u201d</p> \n<p>But there are risks in taking people off daily supervised consumption, Britton said, with risks of clients taking a week\u2019s worth of methadone in one day or selling methadone to other individuals, known as diversion.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were particularly concerned about people who had a recent history of overdose, particularly if that was intentional,\u201d she said. \u201cGiving that group of individuals a large quantity of opiates is not a safe thing to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>Shortly after lockdown measures were introduced, the government announced plans to allow pharmacists to provide OST medication without a prescription but many weeks past before the legislation was laid \u2013 and even then a \u201cpush the button\u201d clause was written in, meaning a secretary of state has to formally enact the measure.</p> \n<p>Britton said the legislation \u201cwould have made a difference done at the beginning\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe would still like that legislation enacted,\u201d she said. \u201cAlthough there\u2019s no massive crash of the system, and that includes us, at the beginning it would have been valuable.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Amid the smog of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/26/lying-government-coronavirus-crisis-dominic-cummings\">lies and contradictions</a>, there is one question we should never stop asking: why has the government of the United Kingdom so spectacularly failed to defend people\u2019s lives? Why has \u201cthis fortress built by Nature for herself against infection\u201d, as Shakespeare described our islands, succumbed to a greater extent than any other European nation to a foreseeable and containable pandemic?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/19/uk-government-pandemic\">Part of the answer</a> is that the government knowingly and deliberately stood down crucial parts of its emergency response system. Another part is that, when it did at last seek to mobilise the system, crucial bits of the machine immediately fell off. There is a consistent reason for the multiple, systemic failures the pandemic has exposed: the intrusion of corporate power into public policy. Privatisation, commercialisation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/07/outsourcing-coronavirus-crisis-business-failed-nhs-staff\">outsourcing</a> and offshoring have severely compromised the UK\u2019s ability to respond to a crisis.</p> <p>Take, for example, the lethal failures to provide protective clothing, masks and other equipment (PPE) to health workers. A <a href=\"https://weownit.org.uk/sites/default/files/attachments/Privatised%20and%20Unprepared%20-%20The%20NHS%20Supply%20Chain%20Final.pdf\">report</a> by the campaigning group We Own It seeks to explain why so many doctors, nurses and other hospital workers have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/23/emails-reveal-doctors-plea-for-ppe-before-covid-19-death-dr-peter-tun\">died unnecessarily</a> of Covid-19. It describes a system built around the needs not of health workers or patients, but of corporations and commercial contracts: a system that could scarcely be better designed for failure.</p> <p>Four layers of commercial contractors, each rich with opportunities for profit-making, stand between doctors and nurses and the equipment they need. These layers are then fragmented into 11 tottering, uncoordinated supply chains, creating an almost perfect formula for chaos. Among the many weak links in these chains are consultancy companies<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/04/uk-government-using-crisis-to-transfer-nhs-duties-to-private-sector\"> like Deloitte</a>, whose farcical attempts to procure emergency supplies of PPE have been <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/dark-money-investigations/useless-deloitte-accused-of-ppe-failings-amid-covid-19-deal-secrecy/\">fiercely criticised</a> by both manufacturers and health workers.</p> <p>At the end of the chains are manufacturing companies, some of which have mysteriously been granted monopolies on the supply of essential equipment. These private monopolies have either failed to meet their contracts, or provided defective gear to the entire NHS, like the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/09/ppe-crisis-15m-protective-goggles-pulled-safety-fears/\">15</a><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/09/ppe-crisis-15m-protective-goggles-pulled-safety-fears/\">m protective goggles</a> and the planeload of <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/07/revealed-emailed-offer-help-turkish-t-shirt-salesman-led-ppe/\">useless surgical gowns</a> that had to be recalled.</p> <p>Instead of stockpiling supplies, as emergency preparedness demands, companies in these chains have been using just-in-time production systems, whose purpose is to cut their costs by minimising stocks. Their minimised systems could not be scaled up fast enough to meet the shortfall. Where there should be a smooth, coordinated, accountable programme, there\u2019s opacity, byzantine complexity and total chaos. So much for the efficiencies of privatisation.</p> <p>The pandemic has also exposed the privatised care system as catastrophically unfit and ill-prepared. In 1993, 95% of care at home was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/may/12/why-dont-we-talk-more-about-the-privatisation-of-social-care\">provided publicly by local authorities</a>. Now, almost all of it \u2013 and almost all residential care \u2013 is provided by private companies. Even before the pandemic, the system was falling apart, as many care companies, unable to balance the needs of their patients with the demands of their shareholders, collapsed, often with disastrous consequences.</p> <p>Now we discover <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/covid19-social-care-sector/\">just how dangerous</a> their commercial imperatives have become, as the drive to make care profitable has created a fragmented, incoherent system, answerable sometimes to offshore owners, that fails to meet basic standards, and employs harassed workers on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/08/care-workers-pay-ppe-stress-zero-hours-contracts-coronavirus\">zero-hour contracts</a>. If there is one thing we have learnt from this pandemic, it\u2019s the need for a publicly owned, publicly run <a href=\"https://weownit.org.uk/blog/why-we-need-national-care-service\">National Care Service</a> \u2013 the care equivalent of the NHS.</p> <p>It could all become much worse, due to another effect of corporate power. A <a href=\"https://corporateeurope.org/en/2020/05/cashing-pandemic-how-lawyers-are-preparing-sue-states-over-covid-19-response-measures\">report by the Corporate Europe Observatory</a> shows how law firms are exploring the possibility of suing governments for the measures they have taken to stop the pandemic. Many trade treaties contain a provision called \u201cinvestor state dispute settlement\u201d. This enables corporations to sue governments in opaque offshore tribunals, for any policies that might affect their \u201cfuture anticipated profits\u201d.</p> <p>So when governments, in response to coronavirus, have imposed travel restrictions, or requisitioned hotels, or instructed companies to produce medical equipment or limit the price of drugs, the companies could sue them for the loss of the money they might otherwise have made. When the UK government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-nhs-private-hospitals-join-forces-academics-warn-over-strategy\">commandeers private hospitals</a> or the Spanish government prevents evictions by landlords, and stops water and electricity companies from <a href=\"https://www.euroweeklynews.com/2020/03/17/spain-reassures-public-water-gas-electricity-supplies-will-not-be-cut-off-amid-coronavirus-crisis/\">cutting off destitute customers</a>, they could be open to international legal challenge. These measures, which override democracy, have already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/04/us-trade-deal-full-frontal-assault-on-democracy\">hampered attempts</a> by many governments, particularly of poorer nations, to protect their people from disasters. They urgently need to be rescinded.</p> <p>The effectiveness of our health system is also threatened by the trade treaty the UK government <a href=\"https://www.globaljustice.org.uk/blog/2020/mar/4/dont-be-fooled-governments-pledge-keep-nhs-out-trump-trade-deal-these-are-just-empty\">hopes to sign with the US</a>. The Conservatives promised in their manifesto that <a href=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5da42e2cae7ebd3f8bde353c/5dda924905da587992a064ba_Conservative%202019%20Manifesto.pdf\">\u201cthe NHS is not on the table\u201d</a> in the trade talks. But they have already broken their accompanying promise, \u201cwe will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards\u201d. Earlier this month, <a href=\"http://www.farmbusiness.co.uk/news/minister-claims-unintended-consequences-as-agriculture-bill-import-standards-amendment-is-defeated.html\">they voted that measure out</a> of the agriculture bill. US companies are aggressively demanding access to the NHS. The talks will be extremely complex and incomprehensible to almost everyone. There will be plenty of opportunities to give them what they want while fooling voters.</p> <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s central mission, overseen by Dominic Cummings, is to break down all barriers between government and the power of money. It is to allow private interests to intrude into the very heart of government, while marginalising the civil service. This helps to explain why Johnson is so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/26/dominic-cummings-debacle-exposed-weakness-dependency-boris-johnson\">reluctant to let Cummings go</a>. The disasters of the past few weeks hint at the likely results.</p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>A fantasy preview screening of the BBC\u2019s powerful new drama Sitting in Limbo would have a handful of home secretaries lined up in the front row: Theresa May, Amber Rudd, Sajid Javid and Priti Patel \u2013 with David Cameron invited to sit alongside them. Further back, there would be places for the civil servants who devised immigration policy over the past decade, senior immigration enforcement officers and the governors of Britain\u2019s immigration detention centres.</p> <p>This memorable evening will, of course, never happen because of lockdown, and possibly also because this isn\u2019t how the BBC organises its screenings. But I hope that these politicians and officials force themselves to watch the one-off drama at home when it airs in early June. They may find it uncomfortable viewing.</p> <p>In 90 minutes, it tells the story of Anthony Bryan, 62, a builder who was mistakenly classified as an illegal immigrant by the Home Office in 2015, just as the government turned up the volume on its hostile environment policies, introduced to cut immigration numbers by making it very difficult for those without the correct documentation to continue living in Britain. Bryan was sacked from his job, twice arrested and twice sent to immigration removal centres, where he spent a total of five weeks, before being booked on a plane to Jamaica, a country he hasn\u2019t visited since he moved (entirely legally) to London as an eight-year-old in 1965.</p> <p>The drama, beautifully written by Bryan\u2019s younger brother, the novelist Stephen Thompson, captures the catastrophic consequences of getting placed on the Home Office list of suspected illegal immigrants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"027f2f17e1b1637bada9e1ef79e1178cce11da41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/027f2f17e1b1637bada9e1ef79e1178cce11da41/209_68_5791_3475/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Robinson as Anthony Bryan in Sitting in Limbo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patrick Robinson as Anthony Bryan in Sitting in Limbo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/Left Bank Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The casually sceptical language used by Home Office staff during their many interviews with Bryan is hard to listen to in the film. They repeatedly suggest he is lying when he sets out his life story. They refer to his children as his \u201calleged children\u201d, and the headteacher who has dug up a photo of him at primary school in the 1960s as \u201cthe man you claim is your ex-headmaster\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just doing my job,\u201d one of the officials tells him. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter that your job ruins people\u2019s lives?\u201d Bryan asks.</p> <p>I watched the film with a rising fury, and was immensely upset by it, which is surprising because I\u2019m already very familiar with the story. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/01/man-detained-threatened-with-removal-after-52-years-in-the-uk\">I met </a>Bryan and his partner, Janet McKay, in December 2017, days after he had been released from his second stint in immigration detention, when he was still fighting a deportation order. His son had contacted the Guardian after reading about another long-term UK resident, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/28/i-cant-eat-or-sleep-the-grandmother-threatened-with-deportation-after-50-years-in-britain\">Paulette Wilson</a>, who had also arrived in the UK from Jamaica as a child in the 1960s and who had also been sent to immigration detention and was trying to fight off deportation to a country she hadn\u2019t visited since she was 10.</p> <p>During a long interview, Bryan mentioned that he knew several other people who were being similarly harassed by the Home Office: friends from childhood who had also been misclassified as illegal immigrants, had been sacked from their jobs and were struggling to prove a mistake had been made. Over the next few weeks, he and McKay put me in touch with Hubert Howard, Tyrone McGibbon and Jeffrey Miller, all of whom had moved to the UK legally from Jamaica in the 1960s. Interviews with them and dozens of others triggered a government apology, Rudd\u2019s resignation and multiple promises to set things right.</p> <p>Two years on, things have not been resolved. The last figures published show that only 36 people affected have received compensation (totalling \u00a363,000 from a pot that officials expected to pay out between \u00a3200m and \u00a3500m). Bryan is still waiting.</p> <p>The actor Patrick Robinson, who plays Bryan, says he was in tears as he read the script. \u201cI knew this was happening to lots of people,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to be involved with the film in any shape or form.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The arguments our parents had in the 1950s and 1960s \u2026 I never thought we would be fighting them again</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Robinson had a friend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/19/windrush-generation-tell-of-holidays-that-led-to-exile-and-heartbreak\">Junior Green</a>, who was refused re-entry into Britain after visiting Jamaica, despite having lived in the UK for 60 years, since arriving as a five-month-old. Green missed his mother\u2019s funeral while he was stuck in Jamaica for five months, trying to persuade officials that he was British and should be allowed to travel home.</p> <p>\u201cI was aware of it before it hit the news. The whole West Indian community was just collateral damage in the debate on immigration. The government\u2019s apologies are like putting a little piece of sticking plaster on a great big, gaping, festering wound,\u201d he says. </p> <p>His portrayal of Bryan\u2019s shifting emotions, from bemusement to desperation to silently mounting rage, is extremely moving. Robinson says his performance was fuelled by his anger at a scandal that could easily have touched his own family. His parents came from Jamaica in the 1960s; his four older siblings were born in Jamaica, while he and two younger children were born in the UK, where his father tried to continue his career as an electrician, but later accepted work as a bus driver. \u201cHe kept getting laid off.\u201d Was it racism? \u201cProbably. He wouldn\u2019t speak much about it. The history of people coming to the so-called motherland, and the history of double-standards that followed, is very close to me.\u201d</p> <p>Bryan is worried that most people have already forgotten the Windrush scandal, which is why he is so pleased that the film has been made. \u201cPeople find it hard to believe that this happened. They can\u2019t believe that I went through all that after 50 years here. People still trust the government; they just can\u2019t believe they would do this to someone.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7b263b9726feac40c6af695e751b57f2ad1993e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b263b9726feac40c6af695e751b57f2ad1993e8/614_1335_4293_5366/800.jpg\" alt=\"Bryan as a young man.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bryan as a young man.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He hopes the drama will imprint the scale of what went wrong in the minds of a new audience. He found revisiting the scenes in immigration detention especially painful. \u201cIt is so close to what I went through. I hope people will watch and understand the trauma,\u201d he says. He wants to emphasise that his is just one story that illustrates what thousands have been through, and hopes that the film will push the issue back on to the political agenda. \u201cI\u2019d like immigration people to watch this to see what they put so many people through \u2013 people who shouldn\u2019t be locked up in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>The film opens with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/10/immigration-bill-theresa-may-hostile-environment\">clip of Theresa May</a>, when she was home secretary, standing behind a podium marked with the slogan \u201cFor Hardworking People\u201d, announcing in an eminently reasonable tone: \u201cThe government will soon publish the immigration bill which will make it easier to get rid of people with no right to be here.\u201d<strong> </strong>We see the then prime minister, David Cameron, remarking: \u201cWe would like to see net immigration in the tens of thousands rather than the hundreds of thousands.\u201d And we hear him self-righteously declaring: \u201cYou put into Britain, you don\u2019t just take out.\u201d</p> <p>Bryan and Thompson\u2019s mother, Lucille, who put a lot into the UK during her time working as a cleaner in an east London hospital, appears on screen shortly afterwards. She struggles to understand why her son has been arrested. Bryan says: \u201cMy mum used to say: \u2018Why are the police arresting you? You must have done something wrong.\u2019\u201d For a while, when everyone was questioning his story, he began to doubt his own memories.</p> <p>\u201cIt made me angry again watching it,\u201d McKay (who is played by Nadine Marshall) says. \u201cI think it will make people get up in arms against the Home Office and the system when they see the injustice.\u201d</p> <p>Thompson recalls his horror when McKay called him in 2016 to tell him that his older brother had been arrested. \u201cI thought there must have been a mistake; I couldn\u2019t get my head around the idea of deportation. It had seemed to be a case of mistaken identity, and felt like a vague, nonserious threat \u2013 until Janet made it quite clear that he would be deported.\u201d He watched what Bryan was going through, as the whole family rallied to try to get him out of detention.</p> <p>He has reassessed his sense of how far Britain has moved on from the racism endured by his parents\u2019 generation on arrival from the Caribbean. \u201cThe arguments our parents had in the 1950s and 1960s \u2026 I never thought we would be fighting them again; I thought we had won those arguments.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, he spent days talking to Bryan, nudging him out of a stoical refusal to dwell on his mistreatment. \u201cHe was very forthcoming on the facts, but he had to be cajoled into opening up personally. It\u2019s not just about losing your job, can\u2019t pay your bills, can\u2019t claim benefits. There has been a real emotional cost, too, and as he has gone along, he has become more open about the effects of it.\u201d</p> <p>Thompson\u2019s film shows Bryan enduring all the exhausting humiliations of a system that is designed to grind people into submission: the interminable queueing at Home Office reporting centres, where officials won\u2019t listen to you, and \u2013 if they do \u2013 aren\u2019t inclined to believe what you say; the hours wasted on hold to call centres in search of officials who might help; the financial difficulties that follow from being sacked, and told you aren\u2019t eligible for benefits (despite having paid UK taxes for years); the embarrassment of having to rely on your children for food. It is a shattering portrait of a system that aims to wear its targets down until they begin to think the idea of self-deportation (back to a country they haven\u2019t been to for half a century) is possibly the most sensible way out.</p> <p>\u201cHe got a sense that, no matter what documentation he provided, it was not going to help,\u201d Thompson says. He worries that the long delay in paying compensation is beginning to take its toll on Bryan. \u201cMy brother is naturally the forgiving and accepting type; he doesn\u2019t do embittered. But the unfortunate reality is that the longer this goes on, and the longer the government drags its heels over the next stage, it will be hard for him to stay that way. There has been a slow, steady erosion of his desire to see the good in everything,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cHe is trying to be patient, but the truth is that they are in very, very bad straits financially. He feels let down.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8c5b926b725630bd7bdbe5c0f5e710645180b603\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c5b926b725630bd7bdbe5c0f5e710645180b603/216_239_4058_2435/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Bryan at home with his family in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Bryan at home with his family in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve been talking to McKay and Bryan periodically for two and a half years (and for a few startling seconds towards the end of the film, I\u2019m figuratively on screen with them, played by Anna Madeley, somehow made to look disconcertingly like me). I\u2019ve also witnessed a shift from optimism to disillusionment as the compensation process drags on.</p> <p>Nothing here has been exaggerated. In some ways, the film\u2019s strength lies in its subtlety. Many other Windrush victims had even more extreme experiences \u2013 exiled for years in unfamiliar countries, forced into destitution or made homeless.</p> <p>And the Windrush issues explored here remain acutely relevant. It was the same hostile environment priorities that prompted the government in 2015 to introduce the NHS surcharge (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/johnson-forced-to-drop-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">which was partly withdrawn last week</a> amid anger at the number of international healthcare staff forced to pay to access the NHS services they were working to provide and already paying taxes to fund). These policies also meant a Commonwealth veteran (who had served the British army for a decade in Afghanistan and Iraq) was this month charged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/18/british-army-veteran-faces-27000-nhs-hospital-bill\">\u00a327,000 for an emergency operation</a> to remove a brain tumour.

  "<p>The government\u2019s \u201csnapback\u201d strategy has finally snapped. Gone is the Keynesian language about the benefits of the largest stimulus package in Australian history, when jobkeeper was announced in March. Tuesday\u2019s National Press Club address by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, makes clear that his government has returned to austerity, victim blaming and cliches.</p> <p>Like a lost driver claiming to have deliberately taken the scenic route, Scott Morrison is desperate to make a fiscal virtue out of the Australian Tax Office\u2019s $60bn administrative error. Just last week, the Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, was assuring the Senate that the unprecedented size of the government\u2019s fiscal stimulus package was appropriate, given the unprecedented size of the recession we are headed into. But this week, after learning that jobkeeker was only providing half of the stimulus he had promised, Morrison is pretending that he never really wanted to spend the full $130bn on jobkeeper anyway.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/27/scott-morrison-refuses-to-guarantee-pay-and-conditions-under-industrial-relations-overhaul\">Scott Morrison refuses to guarantee pay and conditions under industrial relations overhaul</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The underspend on jobkeeper is based on two entirely unrelated errors, but Morrison is now banking on Treasury having made a third \u2013 even bigger \u2013 mistake. Let\u2019s look at them one by one.</p> <p>The first mistake was the original costing of jobkeeper by Treasury, which predicted more than six million workers would benefit from the payment. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/13/australian-business-cant-lead-us-out-of-this-recession-the-government-must-step-up\">As I\u2019ve said before,</a> the numbers never looked right. With less than 14 million people in the entire labour force, the decision to exempt most casuals and temporary visa holders from the jobkeeper scheme meant that Treasury was predicting nearly half the eligible workforce would have qualified for a wage subsidy. Given that no one was predicting more than two million job losses, this meant that only three things were possible:</p> <p>1. The recession was going to be far deeper than Treasury\u2019s 10% forecast.</p> <p>2. We were going to give an enormous amount of public money to companies that had no intention of standing down most of their staff.</p> <p>3. The program would be massively underspent.</p> <p>I put my money on it being number two, and a bit of three. My colleague, Jim Stanford at the Centre of Future Work, went for a lot of three and a bit of two. Treasury was way off.</p> <p>The next error was made by the ATO, and it is worse in many ways. Forecasting is hard at the best of times and February was not the best of times. But once the jobkeeper cash started to flow out of the government\u2019s bank accounts and into employers bank accounts, the forecasting stopped and the counting should have begun. Time will tell how it happened but, to be clear, the ATO\u2019s error was that it had no idea how much money it was actually spending. In an incredible coincidence or cock-up, the wrong number they came up with happened to be about the same as Treasury\u2019s flawed forecast.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The $60bn question is: does Treasury still think we are heading for the biggest recession in a century?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And now, Morrison is not just betting his credibility, but the livelihood of millions of Australians, on the belief that his Treasury has made a third error about the size of the recession Australia is heading for.</p> <p>Both the Treasury and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) have forecast that Australia\u2019s GDP will be 10% smaller by September than it was in December last year. To put that fall into context, the 1991 recession saw GDP fall by less than 1.5%. If recessions were a wave, then the one heading towards us now is expected to be seven times higher than the last one to hit us. If Treasury\u2019s forecast is a bit out and GDP \u201conly\u201d falls by 8% then the recession will \u201conly\u201d be five times worse than 1991.</p> <p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/australias-treasury-chief-says-government-should-worry-about-jobs-and-not-rising-debt-during-coronavirus-crisis\">Kennedy addressed the C</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/australias-treasury-chief-says-government-should-worry-about-jobs-and-not-rising-debt-during-coronavirus-crisis\">ovid-19 Senate committee</a><strong> </strong>and assured the parliament not only that jobkeeper was being delivered to more than six million people, but that the $130bn cost of jobkeeper was appropriate, given the size of the recession that Treasury is expecting.</p> <p>So the $60bn question is: does Treasury still think we are heading for the biggest recession in a century?</p> <p>It would be phenomenal news if Treasury and the RBA no longer thought that Australia\u2019s national income was about to fall by 10%. The 1.5% recession of 1991 ruined hundreds of thousands of lives, and while the unemployment rate took years to fall, the reality is a lot of retrenched workers wound up on the age pension before the labour market created another job for them. Avoiding the 10% recession forecast would be the best possible news.</p> <p>But despite fronting the press club for an hour on Tuesday, Morrison made no mention of any such great news from Treasury. On the contrary, after demonstrating that his government had <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/spend-the-60b-windfall-on-bigger-stimulus-20200525-p54w1n\">spectacularly failed</a> to roll out the promised fiscal stimulus, Morrison simply tried to shift responsibility for managing the economy away from his government and on to the shoulders of everyone else.</p> <p>Despite the fact that mass unemployment is caused by a lack of demand for products, Morrison announced that his plan was to focus on the skills of the unemployed. This trick is an oldie but a goodie. It allows politicians to sound like they are helping the unemployed, while actually planting the idea that it is the unemployed people\u2019s lack of skills \u2013 rather than the federal government\u2019s lack of stimulus spending \u2013 that is the cause of unemployment. Blaming the victim always works in Australia.</p> <p>Morrison also tried to shift responsibility for job creation on to the unions and employer groups on Tuesday. Having finally ditched the conservative virtue signalling union busting legislation, Morrison is now arguing that industrial relations reform is central to his \u201cjobmaker\u201d plan, but ultimately the responsibility of others to design. Well played, Scott, well played.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/25/morrison-says-support-measures-are-only-temporary-medication-for-sick-economy\">Morrison says support measures are only temporary 'medication' for sick economy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For two months, Morrison and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, have wrapped a cloak of Keynesian language around their fiscally conservative worldview. While it never fit well, this language at least suggested they were listening to the economic advice of Treasury. But on Tuesday, that cloak was discarded.</p> <p>The government has flicked the switch back to austerity economics and victim blaming. The jobmaker plan wasn\u2019t a package of legislation or funding, it was a list of cliches, designed to shift the economic debate away from the government\u2019s own failure to go early, go hard or go households, and back to the old political attacks designed to go unions, go \u201cdole bludgers\u201d and go state premiers.</p> <p>If Treasury really did make a third mistake, and now believes the looming recession might not be so bad at all, then Morrison might have pivoted at the perfect time. But if that\u2019s the case, his decision to keep Treasury\u2019s good news to himself may be \u201cgood\u201d politics but it\u2019s terrible for investor confidence.</p> <p>If Treasury hasn\u2019t significantly changed its view about the size of the recession heading our way, the prime minister\u2019s decision to ignore macroeconomic advice and focus on his preferred microeconomic hobby horses will be devastating for him. And, more importantly, it will be for Australia as a whole.</p> <p>We will find out which one it is soon enough.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Denniss is chief economist at independent thinktank The Australia Institute</p>",

compliance and greenfields agreements.</p> <p>\u201cThe government will be considering those other broader issues as we go to the budget later this year and of course in the months ahead,\u201d he told Channel Nine\u2019s Today program.</p> <p>\u201cNow we want to focus on what is happening in the workplace itself and how we could make those businesses work better so they can create more jobs and people can have greater certainty of employment in their conditions.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier, Morrison told ABC\u2019s AM that \u201cthis is a process that wants to see workers better off, this is a process that wants to see employers better off\u201d and argued that reforms would be decided by agreement.</p> <p>But Morrison refused to issue a guarantee, arguing the industrial relations debate needs \u201cto get past all that, past the point it has turned into of black and white discussions\u201d.</p> <p>McManus told Radio National unions had agreed to take part in consultation because they want to hear what employers and the government have to say, arguing they now have a seat the table whereas the previous reform process lead by the attorney general Christian Porter occurred \u201cfrom our perspective in secret\u201d.</p> <p>McManus said the government may try to put reforms unions disagree with through the Senate, promising \u201cif we disagree with them, we\u2019ll fight them\u201d.</p> <p>McManus suggested unions believe changes could be made to the bargaining process, including the evidentiary burden of establishing that workers were better off overall \u2013 provided unions and employers agreed the pay deal should be approved.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>Bargaining is on the table and the bargaining process,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a lot of discussion around the idea there are too many hoops [to get an agreement approved].</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got some sympathy for that there are five barriers for employers and 16 for working people when they bargain.\u201d</p> <p>McManus renewed the ACTU\u2019s calls for multi-enterprise or industry-level bargaining, arguing it would be more suitable for small workplaces such as childcare centres, which increasingly rely on the award system rather than striking separate workplace pay deals.</p> <p>Asked if any worker should be worse off, McManus replied: \u201cThe principle that bargaining is about improving conditions \u2013 and yes, [improving them] for everyone \u2013 is a good one.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re never going to go into negotiations and see [workers] go backwards, lose pay and conditions.\u201d</p> <p>McManus noted the government\u2019s objective is to increase the number of jobs, but said the \u201cquality of jobs is also important\u201d, arguing that Australia has a two-tier system of employment that leaves one third of workers who are casual or gig economy workers without conditions such as paid sick leave.</p> <p>McManus warned job creation is \u201cnot going to come about just through industrial relations changes\u201d and the government would have to \u201cget behind industry going forward to do so.</p> <p>Porter told Radio National it was a \u201cgreat

The death toll stands at 346,700. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting.</li> \n   <li><strong>WHO warns of \u2018second peak\u2019 in areas where Covid-19 is declining. </strong>Countries where coronavirus infections are declining could still face an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d if they let up too soon on measures to contain the outbreak, the World Health Organization said on Monday. The WHO emergencies chief, Dr Mike Ryan, told an online briefing: \u201cWe cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave. We may get a second peak in this wave.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>The UN refugee agency said Covid-19 had pushed its humanitarian work to near \u201cbreaking point\u201d in Yemen, a country devastated by five years of war</strong>.

The report\u2019s authors found 37% more death certificates were issued in April 2020 than that month\u2019s average during the previous four years. By the end of May they estimated the number may grow to 120%.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK death toll passed 47,000, according to new figures from the country\u2019s Office for National Statistics</strong>.

The UK government figure only includes deaths of patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus.</li> \n   <li><strong>Russia reports record one-day rise in deaths. </strong>Russia has announced that 174 people with coronavirus have died in the past 24 hours, a record one-day amount that has pushed the nationwide death toll to 3,807. Officials reported 8,915 new cases, pushing its overall case tally to 362,342.</li> \n   <li><strong>White House brings forward Brazil travel restrictions by two days. </strong>The US has amended the timing of its Brazil travel ban to come into force at 11.59pm Washington time on Tuesday. It came as Brazil recorded a daily death toll higher than the US for the first time (807 versus 620). Brazil has the world\u2019s second highest number of infections.

A cross-party group of 16 Bundestag MPs had last week proposed a long-term shutdown of all forms of prostitution in the wake of the pandemic: \u201cProstitution has the effect of a virus super spreader\u201d, the group said in an open letter. \u201cSexual acts are generally non-negotiable with social distancing.\u201d </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T09:50:48.308Z\">at 10.50am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eccdd598f0864e579f17c31\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T09:13:13.418Z\">10.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Indonesia </strong>has today reported 415 new confirmed cases of Covid-19, and 27 deaths.

The scientist said the latest study suggesting otherwise was \u201cmessy\u201d and dismissed it as done with \u201cbig data\u201d by \u201cpeople who have not seen any patients\u201d. </p> \n  <p>The study, published in the Lancet, looked at the records of 96,000 patients in hundreds of hospitals.

You don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to change because there are people who do \u2018big data\u2019, which is a form of delusional fantasy \u2026 Nothing will change what I have seen with my own eyes,\u201d he said <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZFN3DryH68\">in a video on his hospital website</a>.</p> \n  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine-trial-trump-coronavirus-safety-fears\">World Health Organization has announced it is suspending trials of the drug</a> on Covid-19 patients over safety concerns.

See you all tomorrow!</p> \n  <p>My colleague Simon Burnton will take it from here. In the meantime, these are the main developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Confirmed cases worldwide near 5.5m. </strong>According to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker, infections worldwide number at least 5,495,061. The death toll stands at 346,232. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting.</li> \n   <li><strong>WHO warns of \u2018second peak\u2019 in areas where Covid-19 is declining. </strong>Countries where coronavirus infections are declining could still face an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d if they let up too soon on measures to contain the outbreak, the World Health Organization said on Monday. The WHO emergencies chief, Dr Mike Ryan, told an online briefing: \u201cWe cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave. We may get a second peak in this wave.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico City records thousands more deaths than usual, amid doubt over official Covid-19 toll. </strong>This year, Mexico City has issued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/mexico-city-records-thousands-more-deaths-than-usual-amid-doubt-over-official-covid-19-toll\">8,072 more death certificates than the average</a> for the same period in the past four years, according to a study that suggests the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll could be significantly higher than the official figure of nearly 7,400. The report\u2019s authors found 37% more death certificates were issued in April 2020 than that month\u2019s average during the previous four years. By the end of May they estimated the number may grow to 120%.</li> \n   <li><strong>White House brings forward Brazil travel restrictions by two days. </strong>The US has amended the timing of its Brazil travel ban to come into force at 11.59pm Washington time on Tuesday. It came as Brazil recorded a daily death toll higher than the US for the first time (807 versus 620). Brazil has the world\u2019s second highest number of infections. In its original announcement, the White House said the travel restrictions would come into force on 28 May.</li> \n   <li><strong>Dutch PM Mark Rutte did not visit dying mother due to Covid-19 restrictions. </strong>The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was unable to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/dutch-pm-mark-rutte-did-not-visit-dying-mother-due-to-covid-19-restrictions\">visit his dying mother</a> in her final weeks because he obeyed coronavirus restrictions against visiting care homes, his office has said. His mother did not die of Covid-19, although there had earlier been an outbreak of the disease in the home where she was living, Dutch media reported.</li> \n   <li><strong>UK PM\u2019s aid refuses to apologise or resign over lockdown breach. </strong>The British prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has refused to apologise or resign for breaching lockdown rules. Cummings drove 264 miles from London to his parents\u2019 estate in Durham, despite suspecting that both he and his wife had coronavirus. Cummings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-refuses-to-resign-or-apologise-for-lockdown-breach\">also admitted to having taken a second trip</a>, to a beauty spot 30 miles from Durham, which he claimed was necessary to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-says-he-drove-to-barnard-castle-to-test-his-eyesight-video\">check his eyesight</a> was good enough for the longer drive back to London.</li> \n   <li><strong>WHO suspends hydroxychloroquine trial. </strong>The World Health Organization has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine-trial-trump-coronavirus-safety-fears\">suspended testing the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients</a> due to safety concerns. The WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/22/hydroxychloroquine-trumps-covid-19-cure-increases-deaths-global-study-finds\">a paper published last week in the Lancet</a> that showed people taking hydroxychloroquine were at higher risk of death and heart problems than those who were not taking it. In light of the study, he said, the organisation would pause the hydroxychloroquine arm of its solidarity global clinical trial.</li> \n   <li><strong>Coronavirus measures \u2018disastrous\u2019 for children, says Dutch watchdog. </strong>The coronavirus pandemic will have a \u201cdisastrous\u201d impact on children\u2019s rights worldwide, making them more vulnerable to forced labour and underage marriage, a rights group said on Tuesday. School closures left boys and girls more vulnerable to child labour, early marriage and teenage pregnancy, while millions would fall into extreme poverty because of the coronavirus outbreak, the NGO KidsRights said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Australia will not open the country\u2019s borders \u2018anytime soon\u2019. </strong>Australia will not open the country\u2019s borders \u201canytime soon\u201d, the PM, Scott Morrison, said on Tuesday, but added the country would continue its discussions with neighbouring New Zealand about a trans-Tasman safe travel zone. \u201cI was speaking with Prime Minister Ardern this morning, and we\u2019ll continue to have our discussions about the trans-Tasman safe travel zone,\u201d Morrison told the National Press Club in Canberra.</li> \n   <li><strong>Masks too dangerous for children under two, Japan medical group says. </strong>Children under the age of two shouldn\u2019t wear masks because they can make breathing difficult and increase the risk of choking, a Japan medical group has said, launching an urgent appeal to parents as the country reopens from the coronavirus crisis.</li> \n   <li><strong>Saudi Arabia to revise curfew times. </strong>Saudi Arabia will revise curfew times this week, and lift them entirely across the kingdom with the exception of the holy city of Mecca, starting on 21 June, state news agency reported in a statement early on Tuesday. Bans on domestic travel, holding prayers in mosques, and workplace attendance in both the government and private sector will be lifted, starting 31 May, the statement added.

The Twitter page also aggregates tweets from a number of journalists and publications explaining why Trump\u2019s statements are false.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s claims about California on Tuesday were blatantly wrong. The state is not sending a ballot to anyone who lives in the state but rather those registered there. Sam Mahood, a spokesman for the secretary of state, Alex Padilla, said in an email only active voters in the state would be mailed ballots.</p> <p>As states prepare for an unprecedented surge in mail-in voting because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Trump has repeatedly made baseless claims that this will lead to fraud. Voter fraud is <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/ensure-every-american-can-vote/vote-suppression/myth-voter-fraud\">extremely rare</a> and one analysis found just <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/494189-lets-put-the-vote-by-mail-fraud-myth-to-rest\">143 convictions involving</a> mail-in ballot fraud since 2000, representing 0.00006% of the ballots cast during that time period.</p> <p>Trump, who voted by mail in Florida in March, has made it clear that he opposes any effort to make it easier to vote by mail for all eligible voters, including sending an absentee ballot application to all voters, a measure the Republican National Committee does not oppose. In March, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/trump-republican-party-voting-reform-coronavirus\">he said</a> Democratic efforts in Congress to expand mail-in voting would make it so \u201cyou\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again\u201d. Studies have shown neither Democrats nor Republicans benefit from a switch to a vote-by-mail system.</p> <p>Trump also attacked efforts to increase mail-in voting in Michigan and Nevada last week. He falsely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/20/trump-threatens-cut-states-election-funding-mail-in-ballot-plans\">said Michigan</a> was sending absentee ballots to all registered voters; in fact the state was only sending an absentee ballot application. Trump later deleted his tweet and reposted a new one accusing the secretary of state of unlawfully sending the applications, something the secretary of state says is well within her authority.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, lambasted Twitter\u2019s decision in a statement, framing it as an attempt by \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d to \u201cobstruct and interfere with President Trump getting his message through to voters\u201d. Parscale also asserted that Twitter\u2019s \u201cclear political bias\u201d was a reason that the Trump campaign pulled its advertising from Twitter \u201cmonths ago\u201d.</p> <p>Twitter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/30/twitter-ban-political-advertising-us-election\">banned all political advertising</a> in November 2019, more than six months ago. At the time, Parscale decried the global policy change as \u201canother attempt by the left to silence Trump and conservatives\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/30/twitter-ban-political-advertising-us-election\">Twitter to ban all political advertising, raising pressure on Facebook</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Experts on misinformation raised questions about whether Twitter\u2019s measure would be effective.
