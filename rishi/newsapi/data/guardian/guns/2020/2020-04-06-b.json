It will decide whether or not we will rise again after Easter,\u201d Kurz said, referring to the resurrection of Jesus, the culmination of the Easter feast, which is widely celebrated in the overwhelmingly Catholic country.</p> \n  <p>From 1 May, all shops, shopping centres and hairdressers will be allowed to open.

They should be used by the whole of the country. Those who don\u2019t have a mobile phone will be required to wear a special key-ring style device, the chancellor said at the weekend.

It is being developed in conjunction with a European app that 130 researchers are developing, and will warn people if they might have had contact with infected persons. Its use is expected to be anonymous and voluntary, although surveys show a large number of Germans are prepared to use it if it leads to a relaxation of lockdown rules. The ultimate aim should be to have a single, Europe-wide tracking app. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIts use should be voluntary, but obviously with the hope that as many people as possible will use it,\u201d Steffen Seibert, spokesman for the German government said this afternoon. \u201cPeople who use it will be doing their significant bit to reduce the spread of the infection and helping measures to fight it.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T13:52:18.409Z\">at 2.52pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8b1a298f08c35a1d11ad59\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T12:08:27.447Z\">1.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Eugen Tomac, a Romanian MEP, has tabled a written question in the European parliament asking what measures the European commission intends to take to forestall the spread of Covid-19 among refugees in the Greek islands. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>Fears are growing that the conditions in which refugees are living on Europe\u2019s borders are ripe for the spread of pandemic disease.

As the EU\u2019s fight to contain the virus continues, nearly 42 000 asylum seekers are living in squalid conditions in hotspots on the Greek islands. This is likely to lead to an outbreak. Hence, can the Commission answer the following questions:</p> \n   <p>1. How does it intend to ensure the right to health in the refugee camps is respected?</p> \n   <p>2. What measures have been taken to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak within the overcrowded camps?</p> \n   <p>3.

A spokeswoman said the move was a precaution in case the prime minister needs ventilation.</p> <p>Johnson was admitted to hospital on Sunday, with officials saying the symptoms of coronavirus from which he has been suffering were persisting.</p> <h2>Known global cases pass 1.3 million</h2> <p>According to Johns Hopkins University, 1,337,749 people around the world are known to have been infected, while at least 73,917 have died. The scale of the outbreak is likely to be greater as some countries are suspected of underreporting their figures. The researchers say 275,883 people have recovered.</p> <h2>UK foreign secretary to stand in for PM</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/06/coronavirus-live-news-boris-johnson-admitted-to-hospital-as-trump-again-touts-hydroxychloroquine?page=with:block-5e8b8c698f08c9eaf0dafb53#block-5e8b8c698f08c9eaf0dafb53\">Dominic Raab will deputise for Johnson</a> while the latter is in hospital. In a televised interview, the foreign secretary said the UK government\u2019s coronavirus fight would continue and ministers would focus on implementing the prime minister\u2019s plan.</p> <h2>World leaders wish Johnson well</h2> <p>The French president Emmanuel Macron said he hoped the UK prime minister made a speedy recovery, while the US president Donald Trump said he was praying for Johnson. Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau and the Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar were among <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/06/global-leaders-send-messages-of-support-to-boris-johnson\">those to send their best wishes</a>.</p> <h2>Westminster unites behind prime minister</h2> <p>Prominent figures from across the UK\u2019s political landscape <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/06/coronavirus-live-news-boris-johnson-admitted-to-hospital-as-trump-again-touts-hydroxychloroquine?page=with:block-5e8b84e58f080bdb9f53566c#block-5e8b84e58f080bdb9f53566c\">offered their support to Johnson</a> as his condition deteriorated.</p> <h2>French death toll increases by 10%</h2> <p>The death toll in French hospitals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/06/coronavirus-live-news-boris-johnson-admitted-to-hospital-as-trump-again-touts-hydroxychloroquine?page=with:block-5e8b6cc98f080bdb9f5355b0#block-5e8b6cc98f080bdb9f5355b0\">increased by 10% in a day</a> to a cumulative total of 6,494, the country\u2019s health minister Olivier V\u00e9ran said.

The prominent infectious diseases expert, Sotirios Tsiodras, said data suggested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/06/coronavirus-live-news-boris-johnson-admitted-to-hospital-as-trump-again-touts-hydroxychloroquine?page=with:block-5e8b509c8f08c9eaf0daf8d5#block-5e8b509c8f08c9eaf0daf8d5\">the country was \u201cflattening the curve\u201d.</a></p>",
  "<p>So you\u2019re locked down and you\u2019re a bit scared, but you\u2019re safe. George is 70 years old and he\u2019s locked up. He has served two years of an eight-year sentence and is expecting to be released by 2022. If he lives that long. He had no idea when they put him inside that fraud could carry the death penalty but that\u2019s what he\u2019s facing now. Because George is one of the 2,000 prisoners already identified by justice secretary Robert Buckland as having an underlying health issue that, were they in the wider community, would require shielding.</p> <p>But in jail his safety is outside his control. Any prison officer \u2013 many of whom are still pleading for PPE \u2013 can come in and out of his cell, and there\u2019s nothing he can do about it. His wing has been designated the isolation wing for prisoners with Covid-19, so he knows he\u2019s in close contact with the virus: in fact, prisoners who have tested positive are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/31/uk-prisoners-covid-19-symptoms-forced-share-cells\">frequently sharing cells with those who have not</a>. Try observing social distancing in a cell that was only ever built for one person.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you\u2019re releasing prisoners into the community, you need a solid support network</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To say that George is terrified every time the door opens is an understatement. He\u2019s now in his cell for more than 23 hours a day, with less than an hour to walk around the yard, and there\u2019s no education, no library, no gym, no recreation and no access to information. That leaves only fear. He\u2019s one of the forgotten. Detained by the state, which has a duty to keep him safe. Instead, it threatens his life because jail, even more so than its upmarket cousin the cruise ship, is a petri dish for infection.</p> <p>Latest ministry of justice figures show three deaths, and a 20% increase in cases of the virus in three days (from Thursday to Sunday) to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/04/up-to-4000-inmates-to-be-temporarily-released-in-england-and-wales\">107 prisoners</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/04/up-to-4000-inmates-to-be-temporarily-released-in-england-and-wales\"> across 38 prisons and 1</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/04/up-to-4000-inmates-to-be-temporarily-released-in-england-and-wales\">9 staff across </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/04/up-to-4000-inmates-to-be-temporarily-released-in-england-and-wales\">12 prisons</a>, and that\u2019s with patchy testing. There could be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/21/prisons-could-see-800-deaths-from-coronavirus-without-protective-measures\">800 avoidable deaths</a> in prison, University College London\u2019s department of epidemiology has estimated, unless vulnerable inmates are effectively cocooned: a conservative figure compared with the justice minister\u2019s own estimate of 2,000.</p> <p>The government has shown no concern for the acute distress caused by the fact that the greatest number of prisoners ever are guarded by the fewest staff ever. It has been <a href=\"http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/Portals/0/Documents/Bromley%20Briefings/Prison%20the%20facts%20Summer%202019.pdf\">indifferent to the record number of assaults</a>, self-harm, ambulance call-outs, suicides and other deaths in custody. By <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49324718\">whatever measure you like</a>, the government, led by the media venom towards a small group of terrorist offenders, has spent a decade making things worse.</p> <p>There\u2019s only one right thing to do with George and that\u2019s release him. He\u2019s 70 and he\u2019s not a danger. There are many thousands of prisoners like George and it\u2019s time for them to be let out.</p> <p>And now, thanks to Covid-19, the government has bowed to universal pressure. Pregnant prisoners are out and those with weeks of their sentence to go will soon be leaving. And last week ministers announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/04/up-to-4000-inmates-to-be-temporarily-released-in-england-and-wales\">4,000 offenders in England and Wales could be \u201ctemporarily released\u201d</a> .</p> <p>But these measures will not be enough to halt the spread of coronavirus in a prison estate of 83,000. What\u2019s needed is a massive reduction in the prison population. And when prison numbers are finally down, let\u2019s keep them down. If prisons are kept for the most dangerous, it would result in jails that are actually less dangerous and better managed, and that means, yes, less reoffending.</p> <p>George has two years left, so his release isn\u2019t even on the cards yet. Surely the 1,700 prisoners over 70 years old must be the next to leave? Although he doesn\u2019t have anywhere to go, which used to mean sleeping rough or going to a shelter. Now, thanks to the pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/councils-told-to-house-all-rough-sleepers-in-england-by-weekend\">local authorities are housing the homeless</a>, providing hotels and university halls to stop them spreading viruses on the streets.</p> <p>However it\u2019s not that straightforward. A lot of people think that all you have to do for the homeless is give them a bed. This doesn\u2019t recognise the mixture of addiction, mental health issues and poverty that lie behind homelessness \u2013 and a lot of prison sentences too. If you\u2019re releasing prisoners into the community, you need a solid support network. It\u2019s unfortunate, then, that these prisoners, with their complex needs, will be released at a time when those support services are contracting dramatically.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/two-workers-at-londons-pentonville-prison-die-from-covid-19\">Two workers at London's Pentonville prison die from Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For this sector, support has always been face to face. Now, the drop-in centres where food and help was once available aren\u2019t there. Offender management is no longer about two people in a room.

  "<p>The Wisconsin supreme court ordered the state to move ahead with in-person voting on Tuesday, hours after Governor Tony Evers called it off, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/03/wisconsin-election-coronavirus-pandemic\">capping weeks of chaos and criticism</a> as the state scrambled to try and hold an election amid the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Evers, a Democrat, had delayed in-person voting in the state until 9 June and ordered the legislature into a special session on Tuesday to consider a new date for in-person voting. But in a 4-2 ruling, the state supreme court accepted a request from the Wisconsin legislature to allow voting to proceed. The legislature argued Evers lacked the authority to move the election.</p> <p>Evers had resisted calls to move the election for weeks, saying he did not have the authority to unilaterally call off the election. On Friday he had called on Republicans who control the state legislature to delay in-person voting and move to an all-mail election. Republicans <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2020/04/04/wisconsin-legislature-adjourns-special-session-monday-voting-track-tuesday-election/2948444001/\">swiftly</a> rejected that request.</p> <p>Wisconsin\u2019s Tuesday election is being closely watched as a major test of whether a state can successfully hold an election in the coronavirus era. The state faced such a shortage of poll workers that jurisdictions throughout the state were planning to severely limit in-person voting.</p> <p>Wisconsin residents are currently <a href=\"https://evers.wi.gov/Documents/COVID19/EMO12-SaferAtHome.pdf\">under an order</a> to stay at home.</p> <p>Evers had also called on the national guard to assist at the polls. In Milwaukee, the city planned to open just five locations for in person voting \u2013 it usually has 180. Election officials said the weeks leading up to election day were chaotic and some called on the state to postpone the election.</p> <p>\u201cAs municipalities are consolidating polling locations, and absent legislative or court action, I cannot in good conscience stand by and do nothing,\u201d Evers said in a statement. \u201cThe bottom line is that I have an obligation to keep people safe, and that\u2019s why I signed this executive order today.\u201d</p> <p>An unprecedented 1.2 million Wisconsin voters had requested absentee ballots and Evers\u2019 executive order would have allowed them to continue to request ballots until the date of the new election.</p> <p>In addition to the Democratic primary, Wisconsin\u2019s Tuesday election features local races throughout the state. The most closely watched contest was a race for a seat on the state supreme court, where Democrats are hoping to oust Daniel Kelly, a conservative justice. Democrats were concerned that the low voter turnout could benefit Kelly, who recused himself from Tuesday\u2019s decision.</p> <p>The rules around the Tuesday election have been hotly fought over in federal court over the last few days. A federal judge last week ordered the state to extend its deadline for accepting absentee ballots from election night until 13 April. An appeal of that order is currently pending in the US supreme court.</p> <p>Last month, Ohio public health officials cancelled the state\u2019s 17 March <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/16/judge-declines-ohio-request-delay-primary-vote-amid-coronavirus\">primary at the last minute</a>. The state has since moved to a mail-in focused election.</p>",

  "<p>The first indication that Boris Johnson was sicker with coronavirus than either he or his aides were letting on came on Thursday morning. The suggestion made by a source was specific: a bed was being prepared at St Thomas\u2019 hospital for the prime minister, whose condition had worsened during his seven-day period of isolation in Downing Street.</p> \n<p>It did not take long for rumours to spread. A Conservative backbencher had heard a similar story, this time suggesting Johnson may have even already been admitted to the hospital across the Thames from Westminster, and passed the tip to the Guardian at about the same time. Together it was more than enough to prompt an urgent inquiry to No 10.</p> \n<p>In reply, Johnson\u2019s aides were emphatic. His condition had not deteriorated, he still had only \u201cmild symptoms\u201d, he hoped to be at work from Friday when his coronavirus isolation period was up - and he had not been admitted to St Thomas\u2019 hospital for treatment. When on Monday evening it emerged that contrary to reassurances about him getting on with his red box, he was being admitted to intensive care, the denials were coming under increasing scrutiny.</p> \n<p>Johnson, 55, had spent the week since testing positive for coronavirus holed up in the flat above No 11 Downing Street, while his pregnant fiancee Carrie Symonds - who has herself been unwell - was becoming increasingly concerned about his health.</p> \n<p>The prime minister hoped to keep his period of isolation to a minimum, trying to govern the country via video conference calls and email, all the while still coughing and with his overall condition failing to improve.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d6a01fe6-79ff-49a8-89ef-f39231b8bcc6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0Q6jmZ7RLDw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Meanwhile, the mood in Downing Street was darkening during a difficult week in which it was becoming clear that the government was struggling to hit a target of 10,000 coronavirus tests a day, even prompting <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-johnson-takes-control-of-drive-for-coronavirus-tests-3gffbsg7m\">the unwell prime minister on Wednesday to promise that he would take personal charge of the issue</a>.</p> \n<p>Key advisers such as Dominic Cummings, his chief aide, were not at No 10 because they too were ill and isolating, while criticism was being levelled at the health secretary, Matt Hancock, himself only back at work on Thursday after developing symptoms.</p> \n<p>\u201cOther ministers feel he\u2019s been getting the government in trouble by over-promising on testing, and not interrogating his civil servants enough,\u201d according to one well-connected Tory aide, who is close to key figures at No 10.</p> \n<p>There was also criticism of the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, the leading figure in Downing Street in Johnson\u2019s and Cummings\u2019s absence. \u201cSedwill seems to be amassing power, even though you have to be questioning how effective the civil service has been in tackling coronavirus so far. And all the while, was he looking out properly for the prime minister?\u201d the aide added, although it is hard to know if even the country\u2019s most senior official could have persuaded Johnson to recuperate earlier.</p> \n<p>On Thursday lunchtime, having denied the first round of rumours about St Thomas\u2019, Downing Street floated the idea that Johnson might not be back at work on Friday as planned if his temperature remained high.</p> \n<p>A cough was not mentioned, but his official spokesman told a daily briefing with journalists that he would only go back to work the next <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/02/boris-johnson-shows-covid-19-symptoms-still-and-may-stay-in-isolation\">day if his temperature came down</a>.</p> \n<p>That evening at 8pm, despite his isolation, the prime minister appeared at the door of No 10 to applaud the work of NHS workers. Despite the appearance, the health rumours did not go away: St Thomas\u2019 was on standby because Johnson\u2019s condition had worsened, the first source insisted - only for Downing Street, when pressed, to deny that he was about to be admitted that night.</p> \n<p>On Friday lunchtime, the situation began to unravel. An unkempt, gravelly-voiced and clearly unwell Johnson <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1246042407973662721?s=20\">released a video in which he said, somewhat implausibly</a>, \u201cI\u2019m feeling better,\u201d before conceding he could not fully return to work. \u201cAlas, I still have one of the symptoms, a minor symptom, I still have a temperature,\u201d he insisted.</p> \n<p>On Saturday he spoke to newly elected Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to invite him \u201cto a briefing next week\u201d on the crisis, but on Sunday his health apparently took a turn. At about 7.30pm that evening, Johnson was rushed by car to the hospital.</p> \n<p>About 90 minutes later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/boris-johnson-admitted-to-hospital-with-coronavirus\">Downing Street went public, saying Johnson had been \u201cadmitted to hospital for tests\u201d</a> on the advice of his doctor and, in a change of language, acknowledged the prime minister was suffering from \u201cpersistent\u201d rather than mild symptoms.</p> \n<p>Shortly before 8.30pm on Monday, further news came: the prime minister had been admitted to intensive care at St Thomas\u2019 90 minutes earlier.</p> \n<p>Several sources say Johnson has required oxygen to help with his breathing following his admission to hospital - an assertion that was not denied by Downing Street - although his official spokesman said that Russian reports that he was on a ventilator were \u201cdisinformation\u201d. Those who know Symonds, 32, say she is worried: \u201cShe\u2019s ringing up friends, telling them how anxious she is.\u201d</p> \n<p>At the daily press briefing on Monday evening, nearly 24 hours after Johnson\u2019s admission to hospital, little extra detail was offered.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b11b0cb6-8ac7-43ab-b509-0911c14f49ad\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tbpphDSk9kw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, who has now taken over temporarily with Johnson incapacitated, would only repeat that the prime minister \u201chad a comfortable night\u201d and was \u201cin good spirits\u201d.</p> \n<p>Some Conservative MPs are worried that Downing Street\u2019s evasiveness on the seriousness of the prime minister\u2019s condition will undermine trust in what they say going forward.</p>",

According to the written decision, the judges agreed that the state must act swiftly, but that the original prison reduction order \u201cwas never intended to prepare Defendants to confront this unprecedented pandemic\u201d and could therefore not be modified in light of the coronavirus.</p> <p>Now, Bien says his office and the Prison Law Office will take the motion to a single judge and seek an order to transfer high-risk people out of prisons and into empty state facilities or home confinement in lieu of full releases.</p> <p>\u201cThe best outcome isn\u2019t a victory in court but a victory in reducing density. We\u2019re hoping this message to the governors\u2019 office is taken seriously,\u201d said Bien.</p> <p>As of 5 April, 16 inmates and 53 staff members at the CDCR<strong> </strong>have tested positive for Covid-19. While that number is small compared to the <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/4/1/21202995/coronavirus-covid-19-illinois-prison-stateville-national-guard-field-hospital\">48 cases</a> and one death in a single Illinois prison and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/rikers-island-jail-coronavirus-public-health-disaster\">nearly 200 cases</a> at Rikers Island in New York, advocates worry that it\u2019s just a matter of time before prisons in California see dozens of confirmed cases.</p> <p>The CDCR houses around 116,000 inmates in prisons and camps, according to their most recent population report. Almost 5,600 are 65 or older and 37% of the total prison population have at least one of the risk factors that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says put them <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fspecific-groups%2Fhigh-risk-complications.html\">at risk</a> of severe illness from Covid-19.</p> <p>Age and underlying conditions combined with the lack of space in prisons are a \u201cperfect storm of why this population should be released early\u201d, said David Muhammad, the executive director of the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform, of older prisoners.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re most at risk, they cost the most to incarcerate and care for, and have the lowest risk of recidivating,\u201d Muhammad continued. (Federal inmates who were released after the age of 60 had a less than 10% reincarceration rate compared to over 30% for people under 30, according to a 2017 United States Sentencing Commission <a href=\"https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/research-publications/2017/20171207_Recidivism-Age.pdf\">report</a>.)</p> <p>In a 31 March response to Bien\u2019s motion, attorneys for the state say CDCR officials have \u201calready taken immediate, bold and appropriate steps in response to this rapidly evolving crisis\u201d. The measures include moving around 500 people from dormitories, which are open spaces with bunk beds that hold dozens of inmates, to prisons with available space. They\u2019ve also suspended intake from county jails, a process that usually brings 3,000 new people into the CDCR\u2019s 35 adult institutions per month.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the CDCR told the Guardian in an email that these steps along with the recent releases will, \u201chelp create physical distancing for all inmates, thereby reducing the risk of spread of Covid-19 among the entire population\u201d.</p> <p>But many worry that the state\u2019s exclusion of people who have committed violent crimes \u2013 almost half of the CDCR population according to a 2018 department report \u2013 won\u2019t reduce the elderly population enough to avoid an outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a risk to public safety if you don\u2019t reduce the population, not the other way around,\u201d said Adnan Khan, who after spending 16 years in San Quentin state prison became the executive director of<strong> </strong>justice reform not-for-profit Re:Store Justice.</p> <p>Khan, who was released in January 2019, says he stays in daily contact with friends that are still incarcerated, including his 68-year-old mentor. Khan recalls a recent conversation where his mentor matter of factly told Khan that he and other prisoners are, \u201cJust waiting to get the coronavirus. Those who survive do, and those who don\u2019t, don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>State officials say that releasing people from incarceration is a complicated process that begins more than six months before someone is allowed to walk out the prison\u2019s gates. This process includes assessing post-release needs and getting people set up with state-funded benefits as needed. They argue that these pre-release plans are necessary to ensure that people can thrive post-incarceration and that this process should remain in the hands of corrections officials, not state courts.</p> <p>Still, people like Khan and Rhoden worry that as the legal battle wears on, their loved ones will become more at risk while behind bars.</p> <p>\u201cMy mom\u2019s not young, and I\u2019m worried about her getting sick there,\u201d said Tamisha Torres, a re-entry service provider in California\u2019s Contra Costa county.</p> <p>Torres\u2019 mother is 55 years old and incarcerated in Folsom state prison, about 30 miles from Sacramento, after hitting a California Highway Patrol officer while he was helping with a collision. She was accepted into one of the CDCR\u2019s 3 Alternative Custody Programs, which are private residences or CDCR facilities with rehabilitative programs, to serve the rest of her sentence. But the rapid spread of coronavirus has prompted CDCR officials to stop the transfer of the people from prisons to these facilities.

  "<p>At this strange, scary moment, as we\u2019re forced to stay inside for our safety, it has become a catastrophic period for many industries, the world around us pausing long enough for certain parts of our lives to <em>seem</em> obsolete. <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/streaming-gets-big-bump-coronavirus-quarantines-nielsen-says-1287682\">But as the numbers have shown</a>, while cinemas temporarily shutter their doors, we\u2019re streaming more than ever, reliving old content while remaining desperate for the new.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/06/quibi-app-new-netflix-or-mistake\">Can Quibi become the new Netflix or is it a $1.75bn mistake?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a theoretically ideal time, then, for a splashy new name in the game (the <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/disney-plus-europe-5-million-app-downloads-launch-day-1203545088/\">huge numbers</a> attached to the post-quarantine launch of Disney+ in Europe signify this) and so today, with the US arrival of Jeffrey Katzenberg\u2019s $1.75bn Netflix-challenger Quibi, all eyes are on our phones to see if forking out for yet another streaming service seems justifiable. To understand what differentiates Quibi requires an explanation of what a Quibi is, a groanworthy attempt at combining the words quick and bite, the sort of name that gets suggested in a brainstorm before being met with crushing silence and an immediate lunch break.</p> <p>A quick bite is anything between seven and 10 minutes, designed to be watched on a commute or in a queue, a way to fill a gap in the day. Original films are separated into chunks while unscripted reality or competition shows are shortened and all are designed to be viewed on your smartphone and your smartphone only. But the problem Quibi faces is that, for most of us, those gaps have been erased by the pandemic and instead we desire longer-form content to dominate the many, many hours we\u2019re spending at home. It\u2019s a gimmick that, for now at least, doesn\u2019t really work and it\u2019s also a gimmick that, with or without Covid-19, would need to be supported by content that would transcend the novelty of the platform. When Netflix kicked off its original slate, it was with House of Cards, a substantive and slickly entertaining series that would have become an awards magnet wherever it had landed. But with Quibi\u2019s ambitious launch of 50 shows and films, nothing in the 24 titles sent to critics feels robust enough to stand up anywhere else, a big pile of unnecessary stuff that\u2019s digested as quickly as it\u2019s forgotten.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0aU0BzlBtI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/t0aU0BzlBtI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>While big star involvement has been touted in ads, the high-profile names are mostly resigned to low-investment non-fiction shows, such as the well-intentioned yet ultimately too self-congratulatory Thanks a Million, which sees stars such as Jennifer Lopez give money away to those who need it and the bizarre, Reese Witherspoon-narrated nature doc Fierce Queens, which tries to package the lives of cheetahs into the plot of a CW high school show. The films are then led by lower wattage stars who can\u2019t quite handle the weight of the task, with Game of Thrones alum Sophie Turner struggling with plane crash thriller Survive (which features an uneasy did-we-learn-nothing-from-13-Reasons-Why self-harm how-to in the first episode) and Liam Hemsworth as the empty space in the middle of Most Dangerous Game, some familiar b-movie schlock about human hunting that also features Christoph Waltz going full ham for the umpteenth time.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7zyJy588XA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E7zyJy588XA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Elsewhere, things remain underwhelming. Two familiar MTV shows get rebooted \u2013 Chance the Rapper\u2019s Punk\u2019d with disappointingly D-list punkees and an unintentionally creepy take on Singled Out that takes a pool of potential love matches who are already in the lives of the person picking between them \u2013 and both suffer from the abbreviated format. The pranks on Punk\u2019d are over before you know it and before the \u201ccelebrities\u201d have truly started to crack while a refreshingly diverse Singled Out speeds through every stage with such careless abandon that it\u2019s impossible to care about the result. There\u2019s also a Nailed It-style food show called Dishmantled in which contestants have to guess what dishes are being thrown at them \u2013 as with many of Quibi\u2019s titles, it feels like a 30 Rock cutaway joke \u2013 and a Chrissy Teigen vehicle called Chrissy\u2019s Court which can\u2019t turn its not entirely heinous setup (Judge Judy but with petty non-legal personal issues) into anything worth clicking on. Like a lot of the shows, it\u2019s the kind of throwaway junk you might leave on in the background while using your phone to do something else, but Quibi\u2019s platform demands both complete attention and a willingness to actively seek these things out.</p> <p>The problem is that for an initial line-up, there\u2019s nothing particularly buzzworthy. The ones that almost work (Funny or Die\u2019s Flipped coasts on the comic appeal of the stars Kaitlin Olson and Will Forte while Murder House Flip stands out because of its barmy premise: a home makeover show for a house where a spate of killings took place) don\u2019t work enough to demand a subscription. The 90-day free trial will surely attract some curiosity but unless there\u2019s a steep uptick in quality, most will probably drop out before paying.</p> <p>In short, as Quibi seems to prefer it, the majority of its initial lineup consists of shows we don\u2019t need right now on a platform we don\u2019t really want. It\u2019s an idea born in an LA conference room that will probably die in the real world, content for content\u2019s sake, teasing something bigger and better that doesn\u2019t seem to come. We might all have more time than ever right now but there still isn\u2019t enough time for Quibi.</p> <ul> <li><p>Quibi is available in the US now with a UK date yet to be announced</p></li> </ul>",

Disgruntled broadcasters are threatening to withhold payments and with every passing day of lockdown the existential threat to livelihoods, to entire clubs, perhaps even to entire leagues, looms ever larger.</p> \n<p>This is not, for all the wailing sirens and general sensation of panic, a short-term development. In many ways this is a mud fight that has been brewing for some time: years, perhaps even decades. English football\u2019s inability to come together and function as a collective did not happen overnight; it occurred, instead, in small devastating steps.</p> \n<p>You could pinpoint, for example, Tottenham\u2019s circumvention of the FA\u2019s Rule 35 in 1983, allowing them to float on the stock market and irrevocably transforming the modern football club into a profit-making vehicle. The formation of the Premier League, divorcing the largest clubs of any statutory obligation to the rest of the pyramid, ingraining light-touch regulation and free-market economics as cultural ideals. </p> \n<p>The largely unchecked influx of billionaire owners in the early 21st century: in recent days plenty of outrage has been directed at figures such as Joe Lewis at Spurs and Mike Ashley at Newcastle, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/01/premier-league-clubs-accused-of-being-in-moral-vacuum-over-pay-coronavirus\" title=\"\">blithely availing themselves of public handouts while placing low-paid staff on leave</a>.

Fans are stirred and stoked and set against each other. Governing bodies scrap for reach and audience and space in the calendar. Clubs, now competing on the balance sheet as well as the pitch, are aligned not in accordance with a wider ecosystem but the individual will and ambition of their owners. Above all, the law of the market reigns supreme: a hierarchy of revenue generation where the language of wealth is the only acceptable tongue.</p> \n<p>There is an element of broad-brush here but the wider point remains: if you were trying to design a system hostile to collaboration and solidarity, you could scarcely do better than English football in 2020. Tribal, commercial self-interest is why the game can barely lift a finger to fight racism. It\u2019s why the application of video technology has been such a mess. It\u2019s why scheduling and player workload are a disgrace.

The French Football Federation is working to set up a solidarity fund for ailing clubs. Of course no country\u2019s game is free of greed, bickering or self-interest but there does seem something innate in English football\u2019s resistance to collective action, its lionisation of the one-off gesture, the individual act of generosity, the PR coup or\u2013 as Liverpool neatly demonstrated on Monday evening \u2013 the PR-inspired U-turn.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s the stench of a sport that has gnawed away at its own wider obligations until there are virtually none left to speak of, that has largely shed its pretence of shared destiny and interdependence, the sense that on some level we are all part of the same game. This pandemic has exposed the faultlines in English football, an unsatisfying coalition of chaos that may yet come loose entirely. What emerges from the rubble is anyone\u2019s guess.</p>",
  "<p>Rishi Sunak will be delighted.

This latest administration is of the \u201clight touch\u201d variety, apparently, and merely designed to forestall legal action from creditors.</p> \n<p>One doubts if Debenhams\u2019 suppliers will feel so relaxed since, unlike the last administration, they probably won\u2019t be paid in full this time. Yet, strange as it may sound, Debenhams probably will live to fight another day.</p> \n<p>Most of the 22,000 staff can be put on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/government-covid-19-plan-holes-four-groups\">the government\u2019s furlough scheme</a>; and, since even mighty Primark isn\u2019t paying its rent, landlords can be told to go whistle for a few months. After another cull of its stores, Debenhams should emerge in vaguely recognisable form.</p> \n<p>Do not mistake survival for prosperity, however. This is more akin to an exercise in financial damage limitation for Silver Point Capital, the US hedge fund now in control of Debenhams. Covid-19 is a huge setback for its plans, but the hedgies need to roll the dice again, keep the business alive and hope something turns up.</p> \n<h2>Legal &amp; General\u2019s divi isn\u2019t as risky as it seems</h2> \n<p>As a former Treasury high-flyer, Sir John Kingman knows how to read regulatory breezes. So one suspects Legal &amp; General, where he is chairman, is in the clear on its decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/03/lg-to-pay-750m-dividend-despite-bank-of-england-warning\">keep paying a dividend</a>.</p> \n<p>The Bank of England\u2019s advice to insurers last week was merely to ensure distributions are \u201cprudent and consistent with \u2026 risk appetite\u201d. That was a long way from being an outright ban, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/31/uk-banks-agree-to-scrap-dividends-and-bonuses-due-to-recession-fears\">as was applied to banks</a>. So, as long as it\u2019s being prudent, L&amp;G should be fine.</p> \n<p>And, yes, L&amp;G is being conservative by most measures. Its last solvency reading was healthy. A large chunk of its business these days is fund management, which doesn\u2019t consume vast sums of capital. And its book of annuities is backed by steady long-life assets.</p> \n<p>What\u2019s more, there\u2019s a fair argument that putting cash into the hands of investors serves a wider purpose. The money can be recycled and used for rescue fundraisings elsewhere. L&amp;G and Kingman run the risk of being embarrassed if the market shakeout becomes substantially worse, hitting key ratios. But saving the divi looks the right move for now. Someone\u2019s got to give the pension funds some income.</p>",

State officials in New York have said that about 4,000 seriously ill patients are now being treated with the drug.</p> \n<p>But with some Americans turning to unconventional, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/24/coronavirus-chloroquine-poisoning-death/\">potentially deadly</a>, treatments for coronavirus, medical experts have called for considered, accurate information to avoid exacerbating the pandemic.</p> \n<p>Last month an Arizona man <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-cure-kills-man-after-trump-touts-chloroquine-phosphate\">died</a> and his wife was left in critical condition after the couple took chloroquine phosphate, an additive used to clean fish tanks that is related to the composition of the anti-malaria treatment promoted by Trump.</p> \n<p>\u201cTrump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure,\u201d the woman told NBC, before advising: \u201cDon\u2019t take anything. Don\u2019t believe anything. Don\u2019t believe anything that the president says and his people \u2026 call your doctor.\u201d</p> \n<p>Here are the key things to know:</p> \n<h2><strong>What is hydroxychloroquine?</strong></h2> \n<p>Hydroxychloroquine, also known by its brand name, Plaquenil, is a drug used to treat malaria. It is a less toxic version of chloroquine, another malaria drug, which itself is related to quinine, an ingredient in tonic water.</p> \n<p>It is also readily available to Americans \u2013 already approved as a malaria and anti-inflammation treatment by the FDA \u2013 where it is an off-the-shelf drug with various low-cost generic versions. Despite the emergency use order, the FDA has not conducted clinical trials to fully ascertain whether the drug is an effective treatment for Covid-19.</p> \n<h2>Why is Trump touting it?</h2> \n<p>Trump was influenced by a widely publicized study in France where 40 coronavirus patients were given hydroxychloroquine, with more than half experiencing the clearing of their airways within three to six days. This apparent improvement is important as it would curtail the timeframe in which infected people could spread Covid-19 to others.</p> \n<p>However, experts have warned that the study is small and lacks sufficient rigor to be classed as evidence of a potential treatment. The French health ministry has warned against the use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19, with Olivier V\u00e9ran, France\u2019s health minister, saying that it shouldn\u2019t be used by anyone with the exception of \u201cserious forms of hospitalization and on the collegial decision of doctors and under strict medical supervision\u201d.</p> \n<h2><strong>What does the evidence show?</strong></h2> \n<p>The French study followed work by Chinese researchers which suggested that hydroxychloroquine can slow infections from Sars-CoV-2, the virus behind Covid-19, by blocking it from entering cells in the body. But more recent, albeit small-scale, research from China has shown that patients who were treated with the drugs fought off coronavirus no more quickly than those who didn\u2019t get it. Indeed, one patient given hydroxychloroquine severely worsened in condition while four patients on the medicine developed signs of liver damage and experienced diarrhea.</p> \n<p>Regardless of these findings, any drug being used for a certain purpose before full clinical trials are completed is, by definition, untested and unproven. It\u2019s too early to say if hydroxychloroquine can have a major benefit or not.</p> \n<p>The European Medicines Agency, an agency of the EU, has said hydroxychloroquine should not be taken by coronavirus patients except for clinical trials or emergency use programs.</p> \n<h2>Are there any downsides to this drug being in demand?</h2> \n<p>Like many drugs, hydroxychloroquine comes with a number of potential side-effects. These include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, weight loss and mood changes.</p> \n<p>Worse, a sudden surge in demand for hydroxychloroquine risks shortages of the drug for those who need it most. Hydroxychloroquine is able to keep lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease, in check but some people with the condition have complained they are now unable to find Plaquenil. Trump\u2019s pushing of the treatment has caused many Americans, whether they need it or not, to stock up on the drug.</p> \n<h2>What should people do instead?</h2> \n<p>The latest Chinese research suggests that using hydroxychloroquine is no better than more conventional coronavirus treatments, such as bed rest, antiviral drugs and oxygen inhalation. There are about 40 different research efforts around the world to find a vaccine, which may take a year or more, while scientists rummaging around in the existing medical cabinet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/19/prospects-treatment-coronavirus-drugs-vaccines\">have identified some other drugs</a> that may be repurposed to tackle Covid-19. But this work, too, will take time.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion?</h2> \n<p>There is no magic cure for this pandemic, no matter what Trump says.</p> \n<p><em>Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

  "<p>Nicola Sturgeon has disclosed she asked Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/05/scotland-chief-medical-officer-seen-flouting-lockdown-advice-catherine-calderwood\">to resign on Sunday night</a> after realising her breaches of lockdown regulations were damaging public confidence.</p> <p>The first minister told reporters on Monday she reversed her earlier decision to publicly defend Catherine Calderwood after it became clear later on Sunday that the CMO\u2019s position was untenable.</p> <p>It is understood Calderwood, an obstetrician, could face an investigation by the General Medical Council (GMC), the medical profession\u2019s regulator, for potentially breaching its codes of conduct.</p> <p>Part 75 of the GMC\u2019s good practice code requires doctors to immediately report any incident where they are cautioned or charged by the police. There is no equivalent of a caution under Scottish law, but the chief constable of Police Scotland, Iain Livingstone, disclosed on Sunday that his officers had visited her at home and issued her with a warning about breaching the lockdown. The Times reported that her husband, Angus Loudon, was also given a warning.</p> <p>Part 65 of the code says doctors must \u201cact with honesty and integrity\u201d, and \u201cmust make sure your conduct justifies your patients\u2019 trust in your and the public\u2019s trust in the profession\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a15c3fe9bd62b9019cd9c4e48fe47f9af424567\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a15c3fe9bd62b9019cd9c4e48fe47f9af424567/0_233_3500_2101/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Sturgeon and Catherine Calderwood\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sturgeon and Calderwood at a press conference in March about Scotland\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Calderwood apologised on Sunday after admitting that the couple had twice visited their holiday home in Earlsferry, Fife, during the lockdown and had taken their family and gone for an overnight stay last Friday night, visiting the local beach.</p> <p>Calderwood has been approached for comment. The GMC would not confirm whether any complaints had been made about her conduct.</p> <p>Sturgeon denied news management was a factor in the timing of the resignation announcement, which came on Sunday night just as it emerged that Boris Johnson had been hospitalised with Covid-19. She said she and Calderwood agreed the CMO should quit after a long conversation to discuss their options.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was at the forefront of my mind was how firstly I continue to make sure I have the best advice to enable me to deal with this virus, but also how I ensured that the confidence of the public in the advice we are giving then was maintained,\u201d Sturgeon said.</p> <p>\u201cThose were things I was weighing up during the day and as you know, I came to a view last night that the CMO had to resign in order to make sure we maintained that confidence.\u201d</p> <p>Calderwood\u2019s resignation capped a difficult day for Sturgeon and the Scottish government, after the Scottish Sun published photographs of the CMO and her family breaching the lockdown she had been instructing the public to follow in the government\u2019s information films.</p> <p>The first minister had insisted during her daily coronavirus briefing at 2pm on Sunday that Calderwood could not and should not quit because her expertise was essential to her; Sturgeon hinted the CMO had offered to resign, but she had rejected it.</p> <p>At 4.40pm Sturgeon announced via press release Calderwood would stand back from all public-facing work on the epidemic. At 9.54pm, the Scottish government announced she had quit.</p> <p>Sturgeon said on Monday she had seen emails and tweets from the public on Sunday evening that made clear allowing Calderwood to remain in office put the lockdown policy at risk. \u201cThat\u2019s not a risk that I, and to be fair to her, she was prepared to take,\u201d the first minister said.</p> <p>Sturgeon said Calderwood had not told the Scottish government she and her husband had made two visits to Earlsferry during the lockdown on Saturday, when the government was first asked for comment by the Scottish Sun.</p> <p>That government statement claimed she had visited to \u201ccheck on\u201d the property. \u201cThe statement which went out was a reflection of our understanding at that time of the reasons for her visit that weekend,\u201d Sturgeon said. \u201cShe later made clear that there had been a second visit and of course made that clear at the briefing yesterday, so that\u2019s the situation there.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 April 2020 to remove a reference to Catherine Calderwood being a \u201cmember\u201d of the GMC.

It looped in his head for months like a mantra before becoming the basis of the first song the band recorded for their forthcoming album: the excellently titled Mostly Sunny. And it\u2019s quite a statement. Over snake-charmer drums that conjure the same voodoo allure as Sympathy for the Devil, a technicolour blend of funk and soul, disco and rock breaks forth, echoing the dizzying, experimental highs of Odelay-era Beck, with a sweat-drenched swagger that belongs in the Hacienda. By the time the song amps up a few minutes in and Cromack is screaming at you, demanding that you change your ways, you feel like you\u2019ve jogged up the Rocky steps. </p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Ball Park Music\u2019s sixth album Mostly Sunny will be out later this year.</p> <h2><strong>The Avalanches \u2013 Running Red Lights ft. Rivers Cuomo and Pink Siifa</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>MGMT, the Flaming Lips, Klaatu</p> <p>Shimmering into focus like a 1930s Disney film intercut with wobbling sci-fi spaceship sonics, Running Red Lights offers a Sliding Doors-peek into what would have happened if Weezer\u2019s Rivers Cuomo had followed up his 90s success by indulging weirder tendencies, instead of applying mathematics and memes in an unsuccessful attempt to calculate a hit. It\u2019s the purest pop song either the Avalanches or Cuomo have released in years \u2013 a psychedelic tab of California sunshine. The highlight comes as the hypnotic bob of the chorus makes way for a spoken-word section by renaissance man Pink Siifu, who twists positivity out of bleak lyrics written by the late David Berman, before Cuomo leaps in with a gloriously warm outro chorus worthy of a Beach Boys greatest hits record. In an age when people are being fined for sitting on park benches, when we are locked in dark apartments with views of brick walls, this dose of summer sun seems almost cruelly mistimed.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>The Avalanches\u2019 third album will be out in \u2026 2038?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9c8d203ee6da74da56fcd06a7fdbd3e8223dfdd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c8d203ee6da74da56fcd06a7fdbd3e8223dfdd4/0_103_673_905/372..jpg\" alt=\"Something for Kate\" width=\"372\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Situation Room is Something for Kate\u2019s first release in eight years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EMI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Something for Kate \u2013 Situation Room</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Powderfinger, Cheap Trick, Augie March</p> <p>Something for Kate ease majestically into their first song in eight years, with raindrop piano and stately strings backing some of Dempsey\u2019s most frustrated self-analysis to date. This is a power ballad in the very best sense of the term, the type of song that moves slowly and surely because it knows what it is building towards. But then the band holds the hook back for two long minutes, teasing something big, letting the dreamy sway push and pull you through a second verse before launching a huge sweeping chorus that sounds like Cheap Trick, like Bonnie Tyler, like every powerful anthem from every important movie moment ever. If this song came out in 1986, it would have been No 1 for half a year. As it stands, this is the perfect return for a band that somehow, after 25 years, keep sharpening their craft.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Something for Kate\u2019s seventh album will be out later this year. Until then, revisit their underrated 2012 gem Leave Your Soul to Science.</p> <h2><strong>Kwame \u2013 Schleep</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Migos, Earl Sweatshirt, Swae Lee</p> <p>Kwame doesn\u2019t make his music for the radio. There are no easy hooks here, no nasal choruses sung by upcoming R&amp;B stars, no anonymous Auto-Tune smoothing out his skills or accompanying dance moves. This is straight hip-hop, just the western Sydney MC showcasing his dexterity over a menacing, repetitive beat. Earl Sweatshirt named his most impenetrable album Some Rap Songs because he didn\u2019t want to present it as anything further from what it was \u2013 and the same intent of purpose comes to mind when listening to Kwame rap. He isn\u2019t chasing hits; he is making mood music, darkly stark sounds that are hypnotic, relentless and perfect for these end times.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Check out Kwame\u2019s previous single Nobody, which will feature on his forthcoming EP.</p> <h2><strong>Husky \u2013 Cut Myself Loose</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Oh Mercy, Crowded House, Richard Clapton</p> <p>There\u2019s something charmingly out-of-step about the music of Husky, despite the band having ridden the same zeitgeisty wave as the likes of Fleet Foxes and Mumford and Sons, washing up with a contract with Seattle label Sub Pop. Their sound has shifted since their debut in 2012, from something steeped in Americana \u2013 everything from the aforementioned Fleet Foxes back through Simon and Garfunkel and Pete Seeger \u2013 to a wholly Australian sound, sun-warped guitars and gentle melodies. Whether this is a result of the band becoming more comfortable in their collective skins, or simply a broadening of what was always quite a broad sound, who knows \u2013 but the results are breezy, pleasing and the perfect soundtrack to an afternoon spent doing nothing much at all.</p> <p><strong>For more</strong>: Husky\u2019s new album Stardust Blues is out 7 August. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"13e8287e5e5d528684fb7ce46173f0c446364add\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13e8287e5e5d528684fb7ce46173f0c446364add/1368_1219_4051_2741/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Husky\" width=\"1000\" height=\"677\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The perfect soundtrack to an afternoon spent doing nothing much at all\u2019: Husky.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ditto Music</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Caiti Baker - Gasoline</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Fiona Apple, Kate Miller-Heidke, Jon Brion</p> <p>The four songs on Caiti Baker\u2019s latest EP Dust (Part 1) see the Northern Territory artist bouncing from ballads, to soul anthems, to this: an off-beat chamber pop song that takes the palette of Tori Amos and strips it of pretension, bathing it in soulful backing vocals that recall Vika and Linda\u2019s work on many Paul Kelly classics. A moody, plonking piano walks a tightrope between quirky and ominous, and the song\u2019s woozy rhythm and hypnotic harmonies are unsettling. At times it sounds like the piano has tripped down the stairs; at others Baker\u2019s vocals soar like a soul singer of old. Her 2017 debut album Zinc was a striking first foray, but across four songs on Dust, she manages to exceed the lofty bar she set for herself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/06/a-chance-to-be-more-than-a-number-the-women-inmates-podcasting-from-a-darwin-prison\">'A chance to be more than a number': the female inmates podcasting from a Darwin prison</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>For more: </strong>Dust (Part 1) EP is out now \u2013 or revisit her debut album Zinc.</p> <h2><strong>RVG \u2013 Christian Neurosurgeon</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> the Triffids, the Church, the Go-Betweens</p> <p>There are plenty of Australian bands that combine the bookish insularity of British indie music, the suburban jangle of 80s Aussie rock, and a punkish sneer straight from CBGB\u2019s \u2013 but Melbourne\u2019s RVG manage to sound like they rolled out of bed and into the studio fully formed, such is the languid way this song unfolds. The wackier-than-thou title suggests a novelty song (if not quite Weird Al then at least Ben Folds), but the lyrics make a whip-smart point about blind faith, scientific method and the cognitive dissonance that comes when blending the two.The song opens with a muted, reverbed guitar part reminiscent of Another Girl, Another Planet \u2013 and as with that classic song, all you can do is try to hold on as RVG blasts into the stratosphere.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>RVG\u2019s second album Feral is out 24 April.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d9cbe676e962b96819cce06eaa8e18f733f8650\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d9cbe676e962b96819cce06eaa8e18f733f8650/0_0_5444_3648/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Melbourne punk band RVG in press shot from 2020,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Melbourne punk band RVG.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Our Golden Friend</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Cub Sport</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Yeezus, U2, Pet Shop Boys</p> <p>This is the most ambitious song Cub Sport have released \u2013 quite a statement given the breadth and depth of their catalogue, which includes a recent bossa nova ballad with Darren Hayes on vocals. A relentless driving rhythm is the engine behind vocalist Tim Nelson\u2019s spoken-word confessionals, about everything from his sexuality to his bodily insecurities, through to smiling his way through a boring dinner and not really wanting to be with friends. \u201cThe lyrics flowed in a stream of consciousness and when I listened back, I realised I\u2019d articulated lots of things I\u2019d been avoiding saying out loud,\u201d Nelson says in the song\u2019s press release. The guitars are distorted to a noisy wash, and the vocals crackle like he is communicating through a CB radio before being overtaken by a robotic Auto-Tune that sounds like the most industrial, apocalyptic moments from Kanye\u2019s Yeezus record. It\u2019s intimate, yet otherworldly.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Cub Sport\u2019s album Like Nirvana is out 24 July.</p> <h2><strong>Custard \u2013 Funky Still</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Skyhooks, the Cat Empire, TISM</p> <p>This is not at all what I expected from the (latest) mighty return of 90s indie kids Custard; although their catalogue was always infused with a certain sly, ironic self-deprecation, this song is almost swallowed up by it. Funky Still sits somewhere between How Bizarre by OMC and Coffee and TV by Blur, with a brief visit from Edwyn Collins\u2019 A Girl Like You in the chorus. The band released their \u201ccomeback\u201d album in 2015 and another in 2017, both of which were faithful to their earlier sound \u2013 but this song feels like an outlier, with its cartoon falsetto, relentless upstrokes and ska-lite bounce. If Custard wanted to prove they are funky still, they have succeeded. If they wanted to show their canny knack for an earworm melody, that\u2019s another tick in the box. If, however, you wanted them to sound like 90s Custard, well, those CDs are still under the bed at your parents\u2019 house.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Custard new album Respect All Lifeforms will be out 22 May.</p> <h2><strong>e4444e - Wolves</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> Bored Nothing, (Sandy) Alex G, the Shins</p> <p>There\u2019s a fine line between warm lo-fi bedroom pop \u2013 private universes self-recorded in a hushed manner that suggests roommates may be sleeping on the other side of a thin wall \u2013 and shitty GarageBand indulgent that is begging for a hook or a producer. Happily, Wolves lands firmly in the former category: a pocket classic that sounds emboldened by its self-imposed limitations rather than restrained by them. A calming, repetitive chorus marches along lazily to a 4/4 drum that sounds like it is covered in blankets on the floor of a wardrobe. The unpronounceable Newcastle-based artist (read name Romy Church) keeps his personable vocals front and centre for most of the track, and as the music swells around him in the dying moments, electronic squiggles of indiscernible origin snake through and slowly infect the acoustic folk song, his vocals now looped over one note, a record caught in an infinite groove.</p> <p><strong>For more</strong>: Listen to his 2019 EP highwaymusic.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>This article was amended on 27 April to update the release date for Husky\u2019s album</em></p>",

He was also convicted of carrying out an unrelated hit on a businessman in 2016. The alleged mastermind of the murder, a businessman who had previously threatened Kuciak, will stand trial in a separate court case.</p> <p>\u201cIt was cold-blooded and malicious. The victims did not have a chance to defend themselves,\u201d said the presiding judge, Ruzena Szabova, handing down the verdict to Mar\u010dek. She said his confession and eventual cooperation with authorities had been a mitigating circumstance. Mar\u010dek can appeal to Slovakia\u2019s supreme court over the verdict.</p> <p>Kuciak was a young and well-liked reporter specialising in data journalism, who had reported on corruption and links between the crime world and official figures for the Slovak news outlet Aktuality.sk. At the time of his death, he was midway through an investigation about links between Italian mafia groups and the Slovak political system.</p> <p>The businessman Mari\u00e1n Ko\u010dner is accused of organising and paying for the murder. Three other people are also charged with aiding the murder. Last month, Slovak police said they had arrested 18 people, including 13 judges, who are accused of attempting to obstruct the investigation into the murders.</p> <p>Ko\u010dner has admitted carrying an illegal firearm but denies murder. Kuciak had written about Ko\u010dner and even been threatened by him, but few believed his life was in danger, and the murders shocked the country. The killings sparked large-scale protests, which led to the resignation of long-standing prime minister Robert Fico a month later. Then, last year, the liberal former civil society activist Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/13/zuzana-caputova-slovakia-president-spiritual-liberal-progressive-values\">won the presidency</a> after promising a gentler and kinder politics.</p> <p>Fico\u2019s Smer party continued to be the governing party until two months ago, when it was ousted by a coalition of four other parties, after a general election campaign in which rule of law and the legacy of the Kuciak murder played a large part.</p> <p>Ko\u010dner\u2019s trial is due to start later this month.</p>",

But because they are so sensitive they pick up other sources too, including human activity, so road traffic, people walking past and nearby factories,\u201d said Brian Baptie, a seismologist at BGS in Edinburgh. \u201cAll these things generate vibrations and those propagate through the Earth.\u201d</p> \n<p>Human-induced vibrations, known in the trade as \u201ccultural noise\u201d, spread through the planet differently to tremors from earthquakes and tend to die away a few miles from their origins. But seismometers placed near urban centres still pick up plenty of noise that makes it harder for scientists to analyse the more valuable seismic data.</p> \n<p>The UK\u2019s network of sensitive instruments picked up markedly fewer vibrations last week as the coronavirus lockdown took hold, the researchers found. \u201cWe had a look at the data from some of our seismic stations around the UK and we do see an effect,\u201d said Baptie. At some sensors, cultural noise is running at five decibels lower than normal, about a quarter down on usual readings. Similar falls have been spotted by Belgian seismologists based in Brussels.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"69e1f072-d353-4bcb-a8d6-6cc8e2ebf165\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z8YfSMf7S6s?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The BGS operates a national network of about 80 seismometers from Shetland to Jersey that provide a constant ear to the ground. The data are pored over by BGS scientists and fed into a global network that is used to monitor earthquakes anywhere on the planet. In contrast to low-frequency tremors, cultural noise vibrations are high-frequency waves, around one to 100Hz, that tend to travel through the surface layers of the Earth.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn theory, this reduction in noise means we should be able to detect more earthquakes in the UK, in Europe and all around the world,\u201d said Baptie. If so, it would shed light on the frequency of different magnitude earthquakes and, in the case of more distant tremors, how the seismic waves are affected by the Earth\u2019s structure and the characteristics of the shifting faults that unleash them.</p> \n<p>Researchers at the BGS now hope to check all their seismometers for the fall in human noise with the aim of producing a map that will reveal which areas of Britain have seen the most stark declines in the human hum. The hunt for smaller earthquakes may take longer than the lockdown holds, however. \u201cWe aren\u2019t in a particularly active region,\u201d said Baptie. \u201cSo we may not get anything in the short term.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Many actors might have objected to being associated throughout their careers with a character called Pussy Galore. But Honor Blackman, who has died aged 94, revelled in the notoriety of the role of the aviator she played in the James Bond film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/goldfinger\" title=\"\">Goldfinger</a> (1964).</p> <p>Having been knocked out with a tranquilliser gun by a hench- man, the first thing Bond (Sean Connery) sees when he regains consciousness is Blackman\u2019s face leaning over him. \u201cWho are you?\u201d, he asks. \u201cMy name is Pussy Galore,\u201d she says. \u201cI must be dreaming,\u201d he replies. Later, after trying a few judo moves on each other, they fall into a different kind of clinch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"97415a143d103d5889a942c3266c9fcd071ebaed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97415a143d103d5889a942c3266c9fcd071ebaed/0_0_2689_3504/767..jpg\" alt=\"Honor Blackman and Sean Connery in Goldfinger.\" width=\"767\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Honor Blackman and Sean Connery in Goldfinger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/United Artists</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Blackman thus became, and remained, according to most polls, the top Bond girl, helped to a certain extent by the double entendre name. The producers thought about changing the character\u2019s name but decided against it. However, the US censors refused to allow Pussy Galore to appear on promotional materials and she was consequently billed as Miss Galore. During promotion in the US, Blackman, who had already found fame in Britain as the agile, black leather-clad Cathy Gale in the television series The Avengers, took delight in embarrassing interviewers by repeatedly mentioning the character\u2019s name.</p> <p>Born in Plaistow, east London, Blackman always called herself a cockney. Her father, Frederick, a civil service statistician, who believed he was passed over for promotion because of his accent, was determined that his four children should have better opportunities. </p> <p>For Honor\u2019s 15th birthday, he offered her the choice between a bicycle and elocution lessons, and she chose the latter. \u201cMy teacher was wonderful,\u201d Blackman recalled. \u201cShe introduced me to poetry and plays and convinced my father that I had some talent. So, after attending North Ealing primary school and Ealing County grammar school for girls, I went to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, though only one evening a week.\u201d</p> <p>At the age of 22, Blackman started to get ingenue parts, palely loitering in mostly J Arthur Rank films. Among her better early roles was that of a middle-class girl hoping that her fiance (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/may/10/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Dirk Bogarde</a>) will get his idea of becoming a concert pianist out of his system in the The Alien Corn episode of the anthology film Quartet (1948); and Susie Bates, one of the three title roles in the rather dated A Boy, a Girl and a Bike (1949).</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/12/a-night-to-remember-review\" title=\"\">A Night to Remember</a> (1958), Blackman was one of the first-class passengers on the Titanic, determined not to leave the ship without her husband, and she was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/05/sir-norman-wisdom-obituary\" title=\"\">Norman Wisdom</a>\u2019s love interest as a secret agent in the second world war farce The Square Peg (1958). Her final pre-Goldfinger film was as the Greek goddess Hera in Jason and the Argonauts (1963), bickering with her husband Zeus on Mount Olympus.</p> <p>In 1962, as Cathy Gale, who could get the better of any villain in a fight, Blackman joined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/25/patrick-macnee\" title=\"\">Patrick Macnee</a> in the second season of the TV series The Avengers, setting the pattern for intelligent, stylish and assertive women who followed her in the show and elsewhere on films and television. The song that she recorded with Macnee, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFzdqlZGcw8\" title=\"\">Kinky Boots</a>, did not make a great impression when released in 1964, but fared better as a piece of 1960s nostalgia when reissued in 1990.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"01d97ccbc9140094bae3dc5a2b2746c84cfd7599\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01d97ccbc9140094bae3dc5a2b2746c84cfd7599/46_24_1850_2911/636..jpg\" alt=\"Honor Blackman and Patrick Macnee on the set of The Avengers.\" width=\"636\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Honor Blackman and Patrick Macnee on the set of The Avengers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Terry O\u2019Neill/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because of The Avengers, Blackman was cast as Pussy Galore. She later stated that when she was playing the role of Pussy, she knew her character had been written as a lesbian in the novel, unlike in the film where, despite claiming to be immune to his charms, she is eventually bedded by Bond.</p> <p>Her early demure days at Rank long behind her, Blackman settled into a number of secondary \u201cother woman\u201d roles. In Life at the Top (1965), Blackman was seductive and sly as a TV commentator who lures Joe Lampton (Laurence Harvey) away from his wife, and as the unfulfilled wife of a pompous aristocrat (Jack Hawkins), she has a tumble in the hay with Bosky Fulton (Stephen Boyd) in the mediocre British western Shalako (1968), though the leads were Connery and Brigitte Bardot.</p> <p>After a topless scene in the unremarkable Canadian-set drama The Age of Innocence (1977) and appearing in the creaky gothic horror film The Cat and the Canary (1978), Blackman was not seen on the big screen for another two decades.</p> <p>Meanwhile, she was appearing regularly on television \u2013 principally as a glamorous, young-at-heart, man-eating mother in all 96 episodes of the sitcom The Upper Hand (1990-96) \u2013 and consistently on stage.</p> <p>Blackman\u2019s West End appearances included Wait Until Dark (1966) and The Deep Blue Sea (1977) and transfers of Broadway musicals, as the baroness in The Sound of Music (1981), Peggy in On Your Toes (1984), Mrs Higgins in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/mar/28/1\" title=\"\">My Fair Lady</a> (2006) and Fr\u00e4ulein Schneider in Cabaret (2007). She spent most of 1987 as Mother Superior in the musical Nunsense at the Fortune theatre.</p> <p>Her return to feature films in the late 90s included a portrayal of Joy Adamson in To Walk With Lions (1999) and roles in Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary (2001) and Cockneys vs Zombies (2012), a horror-comedy in which Blackman, returning to her roots, is a gun-toting senior citizen. In her late 80s, she toured with her one-woman show Honor Blackman as Herself, in which she sang songs , recited and told personal anecdotes.</p> <p>Blackman, a keen Liberal Democrat, was never afraid to express her political views. In 2002, she refused a CBE because she was a supporter of Republic, the campaign to replace the monarchy.</p> <p>\u201cThey ring you beforehand to ask if you\u2019d like to accept, and I think they were quite shocked when I declined,\u201d she commented. \u201cBut since I\u2019m a republican I thought it would be somewhat hypocritical to pop up to the palace.\u201d She always had sharp things to say about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\" title=\"\">Margaret Thatcher</a>\u2019s period as prime minister and even took Connery to task for his status as a tax exile.</p> <p>Blackman was twice married and divorced.

  "<p>The UK government must ensure pupils from poor backgrounds have computers and internet connections during the coronavirus lockdown or face legal action for depriving children of their education, according to a group of legal activists.</p> <p>The Good Law Project argues that the widespread reliance on online learning during the lockdown is illegally disadvantaging state school pupils who lack access to tablets, laptops or adequate broadband. It says it will sue local authorities to try to push the government into action.</p> <p>The move could lead to courts forcing the government to ensure the provision of adequate internet connections and IT equipment to hundreds of thousands of children from poor or vulnerable backgrounds while the lockdown continues and schools remain closed.</p> <p>\u201cLocal authorities in England have a clear obligation to ensure that all children can access teaching, so there\u2019s a very strong claim against them to ensure that they are doing so,\u201d Jolyon Maugham, the Good Law Project\u2019s founder, told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cRemember that the government hasn\u2019t closed schools down, and because they are still teaching online then children who can\u2019t access that teaching are missing out and likely to fall behind their peers. And that\u2019s what we want to stop happening.\u201d</p> <p>In many families, children are sharing a tablet or laptop with siblings and working parents or have access only to mobile phones, while the internet access they might have had through schools, libraries or cafes has been cut off by the coronavirus crisis. Research published by Ofcom in 2018 suggested that as many as a million children and their families did not have adequate access to a device or connectivity.</p> <p>The Good Law Project, which has won recent court victories against Uber that could lead to the ride-hailing service being held liable for \u00a31.5bn in unpaid tax, is to back legal action against the London borough of Southwark on behalf of parents whose children attend state schools in the area, arguing that it has failed to meet its legal obligations.</p> <p>\u201cI have sympathy for the position of local authorities, who have found themselves landed with a new set of legal responsibilities to educate children remotely without matching funding from central government,\u201d Maugham said. \u201cSouthwark is an inner-city local authority with a high percentage of children eligible for free school meals who we know to be unable to effectively access education online.\u201d</p> <p>Cassie Buchanan, the headteacher of Charles Dickens primary school in Southwark, said she supported the legal action. She has been concerned at how many children at her school and others are struggling to get appropriate access to technology for learning, often because the lockdown has meant children having to share limited equipment with adults working from home.</p> <p>\u201cWe know from our own experience that for many families their only online access is via a parent\u2019s phone. And we\u2019ve designed our learning material to cope with that. But in secondary schools where the work is more interactive, these children really need to use a laptop and in many cases they can\u2019t,\u201d Buchanan said.</p> <p>Buchanan said her school of 500 pupils had about 150 eligible for free school meals, and its multi-academy trust, the Charter Schools Education Trust, was lending out computers to secondary school pupils and asking parent to donate laptops or tablets that could also be loaned out.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s more complex than just giving everyone access to a computer; they also have to access to broadband as well,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The lawyers say the obligations under the Education Act are \u201cbuttressed\u201d by wider national responsibilities under the Human Rights Act and the United Nations\u2019 convention on the rights of the child, to which the UK is a signatory, which establish access to education as a legal right.</p> <p>The group is being advised by specialist education solicitors and two prominent human rights barristers, Caoilfhionn Gallagher and Adam Wagner of Doughty Street chambers, and is hoping to crowdfund an initial \u00a325,000 to cover costs.</p> <p>Maugham said the group would call for the government to step in with funding to avoid placing a further strain on local authorities, and would write directly to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, asking him to consider the issue.</p>",

One of the first victims, as always, is freedom of speech.

Still, too <a href=\"https://www.thenewfederalist.eu/is-the-eu-doing-enough-to-fight-fake-news?lang=fr\">little progress</a> has been made. This is not that surprising, though, given the daily barrage of fake news coming out of some of the most powerful political offices in the world, including Downing Street and the White House.</p> <p>Since the term was popularized by Donald Trump, it should come as no surprise that populists in power have enthusiastically embraced the fight against \u201cfake news\u201d. And now the coronavirus has given them an opportunity to intensify that fight by passing draconian new laws, allegedly to prevent fake news from worsening the crisis.</p> <p>One of the worst examples, as so often in recent years, comes out of Hungary, where the rubber stamp parliament has passed a set of \u201cemergency measures\u201d \u2013 without actually facing an emergency (as of 31 March, <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1103206/hungary-coronavirus-cases/\">Hungary</a> has officially had only 492 cases, including 16 deaths) \u2013 to give the far-right prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n \u201c<a href=\"https://hungarianspectrum.org/2020/03/21/kim-lane-scheppele-orbans-emergency/\">dictatorial powers</a>\u201d.

These are the people best informed about the situation, and thus the best potential antidotes to fake news. Yet, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-nhs-uk-doctors-gagged-england-a9433171.html\">according</a> to the Independent, British NHS doctors are being gagged over protective equipment shortages, while NHS England has taken control of communications for many NHS hospitals and staff.</p> <p>In the US, one of the few western democracies without a universal public healthcare system, individual private hospitals are <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-31/hospitals-tell-doctors-they-ll-be-fired-if-they-talk-to-press\">doing the censoring</a>. Prioritizing their brand and profits over the health of their patients and staff, private hospitals across the US have threatened staff with termination if they speak out about the lack of protective gear. Several hospital staff have already been fired after speaking out, an incredible waste of crucial but sparse resources during a pandemic.</p> <p>Leaving aside the problem of employers regulating the speech of their employees, incidentally an increasingly common development (even at universities), censoring healthcare professionals is outright dangerous to the broader community. These are the people who actually have day-to-day experience with the coronavirus and risk their lives to help others \u2013 particularly if their employers don\u2019t provide them with adequate protective gear.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Free speech makes us more rather than less safe, both as citizens and patients</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Moreover, we know how dangerous this type of censorship is from recent experiences in China.

For instance, the British cabinet minister <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-michael-gove-china-wuhan-covid-19-pandemic-a9432496.html\">Michael Gove</a> recently blamed China for failing to stop the spread of coronavirus, while <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/china-coronavirus-cover-up-wuhan-pandemic-fa894bb8-998d-494b-8e7a-e834f86d2ea9.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=organic&amp;utm_content=1100\">Michael McCaul</a>, the top Republican on the House foreign affairs committee, even called China\u2019s response \u201cone of the worst cover-ups in human history\u201d.</p> <p>To ensure that we are not making the same mistakes as China, and to protect the health and lives of the heroic healthcare workers (including the many volunteers) who are putting their lives on the line every day to keep us alive and healthy, we must resist these dangerous attacks on free speech, as well as other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/wartime-coronavirus-powers-state-of-emergency\">unnecessary authoritarian measures</a> in response to the coronavirus crisis.

And since its founding, the network has been a home for \u201cextreme conservatism\u201d. See: its hosts, such as Graham Ledger, who called the Black Lives Matter movement a \u201ccriminal organization\u201d, being transgender \u201ca mental problem\u201d, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/\">said Muslims shouldn\u2019t enter the country</a>.

Last year, they traveled with Trump sidekick Rudy Giuliani to Ukraine to film a series about his \u201cinvestigations\u201d in the country, and Rion recently hosted a special boosting a conspiracy theory that coronavirus was developed as a bioweapon in a lab in North Carolina.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole selling point of OAN is that they are Fox News with even less shame, and even fewer scruples,\u201d Oliver said.

My own loose theory is that you could use them to track much more than just the spread of coronavirus: change the label on the <em>x</em> axis and every one of them could easily represent data on how many people in the UK are currently getting too into jigsaws, for example, or growing very weak moustaches, or grappling with a sourdough. (The frighteningly steep lines depicting the out-of-control spread of new cases also neatly illustrate the world\u2019s horniness pandemic \u2013 with everyone locked inside and the rising sap of spring, this is arguably the most sexually desperate moment in all of human history. Look at the graphs. The planet has never been hornier.)</p> <p>The graphs are also neatly tracking two other viral trends right now: \u201cbeing extremely furious at your neighbours\u201d and \u201cburning down a 5G tower because Facebook told you to\u201d. Both have really skyrocketed this week \u2013 we are outperforming even Italy in burning down our 5G towers! \u2013 but also have yet to reach a pinnacle, let alone a long curve down. We\u2019ll take each one in turn.</p> <p>First, Neighbourhood Watch has now gone nuclear. Britain has always had a fine tradition of curtain-twitching \u2013 does any other culture have such reverence for net curtains, to comment on people\u2019s parking, how big their weekly shop is, how often their grownup daughter does or does not visit with the kids?</p> <p>In lockdown, the government has given us all a gift by issuing behavioural guidelines but not actually making them sovereign \u2013 so we all get the pleasure of helping to enforce the rules. What that should mean in theory is we come together as a great neighbourly morass, pooling resources and scheduling our trips to help the infirm and the quarantined, one great big blitz spirit effort to get through this, together. What it actually means is once a week we all get furious at each other about going to the park.</p> <p>Even I have fallen into this trap, and I\u2019m normal. More than once this week I\u2019ve been out on my still-permitted daily walk and thought: \u201cWow, a lot of people in this park. <em>Go home, idiots</em>.\u201d I have thought that thought, while in a park, presumably while other people in the park have looked at me and thought: \u201cWow, look at that guy in the park. <em>Go home, idiot</em>.\u201d</p> <p>There is a divide down the nation, now. First, the Virtuous Saints, who read the government guidelines like a Bible and live by them, and get really arsey with you when you walk slightly too close to them on the pavement even if the pavement is quite narrow and they are right in the damn middle of it \u2013 and who have this sort of divine blind spot to their own presence outside, in the forbidden and unholy places.</p> <p>Then we have the Sinners, people without gardens who go and lie down in a park on weekends when it\u2019s sunny or think a bike ride (which the government still deems \u201cacceptable\u201d) is acceptable. We all want to do our bit, I understand that. We all have a weird kink for the Keep Calm and Carry On spirit of the NHS in crisis. But I do think we\u2019re about a week away from riots breaking out between Good Outside People and Bad Outside People.</p> <p>Then A&amp;E departments are going to have to mop all that up, and the whole fracas will unflatten the curve and keep us all inside for an extra six weeks. Piers Morgan is going to do a really pink-in-the-face <em> </em>Good Morning Britain bit calling them all \u201ctraitors\u201d \u2013 and I\u2019m going to have to grit my teeth and watch as that goes righteously viral.</p> <p>Our other new national sport is apparently burning down 5G towers \u2013 inspired by what even <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/5G-not-accelerating-coronavirus/\">fact fans</a> must admit is a world-class conspiracy theory, which elegantly blends our fear of disease with our fear of China and our fear of new technology nobody really understands to begin with. As the BBC reports, there have been at least three mast fires in the past week \u2013 in Birmingham, Liverpool and Melling \u2013 but the graphs tell us there are surely more on the way.</p> <p>Last week broadcasters were told by Ofcom that they\u2019d face sanctions if they spread baseless 5G theories, after the community radio station Uckfield FM gave airtime to a woman who introduced herself as a \u201cregistered nurse\u201d (who you might expect to be in a hospital rather than typing out long Facebook posts about how 5G infected bats in Wuhan with corona), who explained that 5G is somehow sucking the air out of our lungs, along with other stuff that has gained a weird traction on WhatsApp and made people harass <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/03/broadband-engineers-threatened-due-to-5g-coronavirus-conspiracies\">fibre-optics engineers</a> in the street. As a precautionary measure I went out to get some tinfoil to wrap around my head but all the shelves had been raided.</p> <p>There has been speculation that 5G disinformation has connections to Russia, like all the finest disinformation \u2013 as the Verge pointed out in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/4/21207927/5g-towers-burning-uk-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory-link\">a new report </a>on Britain\u2019s world-beating cellular arson industry, the New York Times warned last year that Moscow\u2019s propaganda channels were<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/12/science/5g-phone-safety-health-russia.html\"> pushing stories</a> that 5G led to brain cancer, infertility, Alzheimer\u2019s, autism and heart tumours. But even if the stories come from Russia, it still takes British people to believe them before a cell tower gets burned down in Merseyside.</p> <p>For some reason, destroying forward-thinking technology \u2013 which is also particularly useful for, say, staying in touch with people without leaving the house, which in my opinion is a vaguely useful service right now \u2013 because you\u2019re worried about it impacting on your health, all while an unseen and real threat actually does impact on people\u2019s health, seems to me a particularly British unreaction to this whole mess. We\u2019re living through history, and we\u2019re living through it abominably. Kids will be learning about this in schools, one day. Think about that next time you politicise sun exposure and set fire to a big lamppost.</p> <p>\u2022 Joel Golby is a writer for the Guardian and Vice, and the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Europe\u2019s governments have begun to look ahead to the post-lockdown phase of their battle against Covid-19 as curves on the continent flatten, while the US braces for \u201cpeak death week\u201d and Japan prepares to declare a state of national emergency.</p> \n<p>Austria on Monday became the first EU country to publicly announce plans to lift its restrictions. \u201cThe aim is that from April 14 ... smaller shops up to 400 square metres, as well as hardware and garden stores, can open again, under strict security conditions,\u201d the chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said.</p> \n<p>If the government\u2019s timetable goes to plan, larger shops could reopen on 1 May and hotels, restaurants and other services from mid-May, Kurz said, adding that \u201ceverything will depend\u201d on whether citizens continue to obey draconian distancing rules this week and over the Easter break.</p> \n<p>Denmark also announced plans to start reopening nurseries and primary schools from 15 April if the number of Covid-19 deaths and new cases remain stable.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt will probably be a bit like walking the rope. If we stand still along the way we could fall and if we go too fast it can go wrong. Therefore, we must take one cautious step at a time,\u201d said the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, adding that a ban on large social gatherings would remain in place until at least August.</p> \n<p>In Germany, the chancellor, Angela Merkel, said on Monday that the coronavirus pandemic was \u201cthe EU\u2019s biggest test since its foundation\u201d and thanked Germans for following the government\u2019s instructions. But she added that it was still too early to set a date for lifting the country\u2019s lockdown.</p> \n<p>However, as Germany reported its its fourth consecutive daily drop in cases, a leaked interior ministry document revealed a list of measures that officials seemingly believe might allow public life to gradually resume after the end of the country\u2019s lockdown, currently scheduled for 19 April.</p> \n<p>The measures include an obligation to wear masks in public, limits on public gatherings, and mechanisms to allow more than 80% of people an infected person has been in contact with to be traced within 24 hours of diagnosis, permitting schools to reopen on a regional basis and strict border controls to be relaxed.</p> \n<p>Like several EU countries, Austria and Germany look set to rely on mobile phone apps to trace citizens\u2019 movements and warn them of potential risks of infection, prompting the bloc\u2019s data protection supervisor on Monday to urge the development of a single, more secure pan-European app.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74ca3ea1041510e9d4cb911b7f0d0e07635e360a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74ca3ea1041510e9d4cb911b7f0d0e07635e360a/0_0_7952_5304/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Italy hopes to be back on the move soon after seeing virus cases reach a plateau.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Italy hopes to be back on the move soon after seeing virus cases reach a plateau.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Medichini/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Spain, which has recorded the second highest Covid-19 death toll in the world so far after Italy, also reported a fourth consecutive fall in its daily death tally as well as falls in hospital admissions and critical care cases.</p> \n<p>While strict confinement rules introduced on 14 March will remain in force until 26 April, the government announced on Monday that it is planning to widen coronavirus testing to include people without symptoms, as a first step towards slowly easing the lockdown.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are preparing ourselves for de-escalation, for which it will be very important to know who is contaminated,\u201d said the foreign minister, Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez Laya.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/cases_6_april/giv-3902C9ZIJC1n1K6n/\" data-alt=\"Cases in Italy, Spain and France\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/cases_6_april/giv-3902C9ZIJC1n1K6n/\">Cases in Italy, Spain and France</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Italy on Monday reported 636 deaths, roughly 100 more than the previous day, but its infection rate slowed again, with the number of new positive cases rising by under 2,000, or 2.1%.

Despite a saturated but still growing market of streaming services \u2013 titans Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime and HBO and relative newcomers Disney +, Apple TV+, CBS AllAccess, the list could go on \u2013 Quibi sees a potentially rich corner in mobile-specific content diced into seven-to-10-minute \u201cquick bites\u201d (qui-bi, get it?). Which means it\u2019s competing less with the full-length streamers than with Facebook, YouTube and TikTok \u2013 frenetic, lucrative factories of distraction and amusement for the snippets of time formerly reserved for your ambient mind.</p> <p>It\u2019s perhaps a bit weird that this new service, aimed to be the disruptive insurgent of entertainment platforms and specifically conceived for younger audiences born with phones in their hands, emerges from the depths of Hollywood and the Silicon Valley establishment. Katzenberg, 69, was once chairman of Walt Disney Studios (1984 to 1994) and co-founded DreamWorks Animation, where he was the longtime CEO; Whitman, 63, was CEO of eBay as it mushroomed into a billion-dollar online marketplace, and was later CEO of Hewlett-Packard from 2011-2017 (she also unsuccessfully ran for governor of California as a Republican in 2010). Both are billionaires, with the connections and wealth to pay for an army of prestige and/or popular talent, and the cache to sell their attention experiment as revolutionary and informed.

Shows feature a call-sheet of such generationally varied stars as Joe Jonas, Idris Elba, Sophie Turner, Chrissy Teigen, Chance the Rapper, LeBron James, Jennifer Lopez, Reese Witherspoon, Liam Hemsworth, Christoph Waltz, Lena Waithe, Nicole Richie, Demi Lovato, Will Smith, Laura Dern, Kevin Hart, Tyra Banks, Zac Efron, Bill Murray and Laurence Fishburne. A-list creators including Steven Speilberg, Guillermo del Toro, Ridley Scott, Antoine Fuqua, Catherine Hardwicke and Sam Raimi have produced or directed shows exclusively for the service. Quibi has patented a new film-making technology, Turnstyle, which I\u2019m sure is very complicated to engineer but essentially means you can shift your viewing from portrait mode to landscape and back seamlessly.</p> <p>And whereas other streaming giants have amassed or purchased their libraries of original or licensed content over time, Quibi will launch with a tsunami of homegrown shows. The service begins with three episodes each of its first 50 titles, and will roll out 25 episodes (or, as it calls it in a press release, \u201cthree hours of fresh, original, premium content\u201d) every weekday afterward. All told, it\u2019s planning to release 175 original shows in its first year, which translates into 8,500 \u201cquibis\u201d of content. The service has delineated its hulk of productions into three categories: Movies in Chapters, which will tell feature- or season-length stories in seven-to-10-minute bits; Unscripted and Docs, perhaps its most promising category given its persona power (internet star Chrissy Teigen being herself, but as Judge Judy!) and alignment with the most successful house style of YouTube; and Daily Essentials, five-to-six-minute news updates from such established houses as the BBC, NBC News, the Weather Channel, Telemundo and ESPN (also: Rotten Tomatoes, TMZ, and \u201cTrailers by Fandango\u201d).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2331d9ed17a6c32620a60be0a6a6cbf0ec6b34fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2331d9ed17a6c32620a60be0a6a6cbf0ec6b34fc/0_0_5000_3102/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"620\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Quibi launches with a free 90-day trial \u2013 far more time than competitors Netflix and Amazon Prime (30 days) or Apple TV+ or Hulu/Disney+ (seven days).

  "<p>On Wednesday, Three Rivers, a small hospital in rural Washington, had exactly nine days left before it would run out of money to pay its staff and be forced to close. That same day, its CEO learned the hospital probably had its first coronavirus patient.</p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic has put a strain even on the wealthier parts of America\u2019s vast, fragmented healthcare system: there are not enough beds, not enough ventilators, not enough protective equipment. But in rural communities, the stakes are different: not whether there will be enough beds at the local hospital, but whether the local hospital will be able to stay open at all.</p> <p>Like many American families, rural hospitals in the United States have been operating paycheck to paycheck for years, never making enough money to save up for an emergency. Now, the pandemic is threatening the survival of many rural hospitals, which would leave communities particularly vulnerable to the impact of the virus with fewer hospital beds and fewer options.</p> <h2>\u2018What little cash we had evaporated\u2019</h2> <p>At least three rural hospitals have announced abrupt closures in recent weeks, including one in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/31/what-happens-when-a-citys-hospital-closes-without-warning-during-a-pandemic\">Wellington, Kansas</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.wvpublic.org/post/fairmont-hospital-closing-days-owner-says-letter#stream/0\">two in West Virginia</a>, leaving local residents and healthcare providers scrambling to make new plans for the pandemic.</p> <p>Three Rivers hospital, in a remote area of Washington state near the border with Canada, has been at the frontlines of the crisis.</p> <p>The hospital serves about 15,000 people scattered over 2,500 sq miles (about 6,400 sq km), according to its CEO, Scott Graham. Its surrounding<strong> </strong> towns are tiny: one or two grocery stores, one gas station. \u201cWe think of it as more frontier than rural,\u201d Graham said.</p> <p>Three Rivers hospital had scraped by for years with a smaller-than-optimal staff and careful economizing, he said. Then, Washington became the first state with a confirmed case of coronavirus, and a confirmed coronavirus death.</p> <p>Once social distancing guidelines were put in place, including guidelines to stop elective surgeries, \u201cour source of revenue basically stopped\u201d, Graham said. Patients who would typically visit the hospital for non-coronavirus-related health issues now seemed reluctant to come in. The volume of emergency room visits dropped. So did primary care. \u201cWhat little cash we had evaporated,\u201d Graham said.</p> <p>By late March, Graham, who had been the hospital\u2019s CEO for six years, was starting to plan for something he had never done before: shutting<strong> </strong>down a hospital that no longer had enough money to function.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49cf71d6683d9a00c8e267bc70b3c925e8448b47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49cf71d6683d9a00c8e267bc70b3c925e8448b47/0_54_1600_1058/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sumner Community hospital in Wellington, Kansas, stands closed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sumner community hospital in Wellington, Kansas, stands closed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McGreal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On 20 March, the state\u2019s hospital association wrote to the governor, Jay Inslee, <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6818594/Governor-WSHA-Emergency-Funding-Request.pdf\">warning</a> that five rural hospitals, including Three Rivers, were \u201cfacing imminent closure\u201d.</p> <p>The response from Washington state officials was swift, Graham said. Within hours of raising his concerns, he was on the phone with Sue Birch, a former nurse who had spent decades living in rural Colorado and now runs Washington state\u2019s healthcare authority.</p> <p>Birch said she promised Graham that they<strong> </strong>would find a way to get the hospital through the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cWe can talk about closures later,\u201d she recalled telling him. \u201cRight now, I need you holding my frontline.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>A catastrophic blow</strong></h2> <p>Losing a hospital is a serious blow to rural communities, whose residents are disproportionately older, and often struggle with existing health conditions. While Three Rivers does not have an intensive care unit (ICU), it\u2019s a place to go for immediate care, for health problems small and large, that\u2019s not an hour or more away. </p> <p>A hospital closure also has a huge economic toll, since in towns with \u201ca school and a Walmart and a church and a post office\u201d, as Birch put it, a small local hospital may be one of the major local employers. And it has ripple effects far beyond the rural areas the hospital directly serves.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to remind ourselves that we are all in this together,\u201d Birch said. Rural areas \u201care where our food is produced. We urban areas need them, and they need us.\u201d</p> <p>Amid the coronavirus pandemic, rural hospitals play a critical role.</p> <p>As urban hospitals brace for a wave of seriously ill coronavirus patients, Three Rivers has been planning to use its beds to take in the overflow of other patients from those larger hospitals, helping the state hospital system as a whole stay afloat, Graham said.</p> <p>While Three Rivers could provide about one or two patients with ventilators, Graham said, it does not have a formal ICU, or staff trained to work with ICU patients. But it will help take in and stabilize more seriously ill coronavirus patients before sending them to a larger hospital, with more advanced equipment, about an hour away.</p> <p>It can only do any of these things if its own doors stay open.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b92ab5e00ebce3cc73be17df5708f8afd961ad4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b92ab5e00ebce3cc73be17df5708f8afd961ad4/0_0_3000_2002/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Medical workers tape a notice on the emergency room door of Fairmont Regional Medical Center in Fairmont, West Virginia, after the hospital closed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medical workers tape notice on the emergency room door of Fairmont regional medical center in Fairmont, West Virginia, after hospital closed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tammy Shriver/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>A lifeline</h2> <p>The first financial lifeline for Three Rivers came from Washington state, which sent an emergency $2m out to a small group of struggling rural hospitals in March. Three Rivers got about $200,000.</p> <p>But keeping the hospital running costs roughly $1m a month, Graham said, with payroll for staff alone costing at least $700,000 a month. The emergency funds from the state, although helpful, only pushed the hospital\u2019s money crisis back about two weeks.</p> <p>As he was trying to secure protective gear for hospital staff and prepare for a surge of coronavirus patients, Graham also made desperate calls to lawmakers and journalists, trying to secure enough cash to make it through the hospital\u2019s next payday.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Birch, the state healthcare administrator, tried to work with federal healthcare authorities to open up more emergency money for rural hospitals in her state, and in others.</p> <p>The federal government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/trump-administration-provides-financial-relief-medicare-providers\">lifeline for struggling hospitals</a>, announced on 27 March, would send Three Rivers and other financially vulnerable hospitals an advance of three months of their typical payments for Medicare, the federally funded health insurance program for senior citizens.</p> <p>That advance funding would allow the hospital to pay its staff at least through the spring and summer, until about early August. By then, Graham hopes, the virus will be more under control, and more normal hospital care, and the income from patients getting that care, will resume.</p> <p>Three Rivers submitted the paperwork for the Medicare advance on Wednesday, Graham said. Federal authorities told hospitals that they anticipated they could send out the payments <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/trump-administration-provides-financial-relief-medicare-providers\">within seven days</a>.</p> <p>The next day payroll for the hospitals\u2019 roughly 100 employees is Friday. If the payment comes as quickly as promised, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be OK.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018<strong>The </strong><strong>death </strong><strong>knell\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Still, Graham worries about the consequences of even a brief bureaucratic delay.</p> <p>That\u2019s a fear shared by rural health experts, said George Pink, the deputy director of North Carolina rural health research program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. </p> <p>\u201cIf a hospital misses payroll once, that can be the death knell,\u201d Pink said. \u201cYou\u2019re telling the community and the vendors and the staff that you\u2019re on the ropes.\u201d</p> <p>At least 128 rural hospitals have shut down in the past decade alone, according to data assembled by the rural health research program.</p> <p>There may be more substantial federal help on the way for rural hospitals at the brink of closure. Congress\u2019s $2.2tn emergency relief bill includes $100bn for hospitals. But how that money will be distributed and, again, how fast it will go out, is still not clear on the ground.</p> <p>\u201cThe details have been really, really sparse,\u201d Graham said.</p> <p>Birch said she is optimistic that the safety net for rural hospitals will hold through the pandemic. Emergency payments from the federal government should come reliably within seven days, if hospitals apply for them, she said.</p> <p>As of Friday night, Three Rivers still had not received the Covid-19 testing results for the first patient who had been showing symptoms that had initially seemed consistent with coronavirus. Test results, like emergency funding, were still coming very slowly, when they came at all.</p> <p>But one thing was clear: the number of confirmed coronavirus cases across the rural county was rising. On Wednesday, it had just been three, Graham said. On Friday, it was six.</p>",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>One person closely involved said: \u201cThe difficulty is that the crisis is so all-enveloping, the PM could not stop working. No one likes to think they are dispensable. The first step was to get him to admit to himself how ill he was becoming. What was subsequently admitted to the nation was a second order issue\u201d.</p> \n<p>Even now No 10 is reluctant to go into detail on the prime minister\u2019s health, stressing in its statement that the hospital admission was simply a precautionary step to undertake tests, rather than an acknowledgement that he had deteriorated. He would continue to be briefed at his hospital bed and was very much in charge.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d6a01fe6-79ff-49a8-89ef-f39231b8bcc6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0Q6jmZ7RLDw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>By contrast, Donald Trump in opening his Sunday press conference provided a dramatic, possibly melodramatic, medical bulletin on Johnson\u2019s health, offering the US\u2019s prayers to help Johnson in \u201chis personal fight with the virus\u201d. Trump has a relationship with the truth that could be described as sometimes adjacent, but he did not give the impression that Johnson was going to hospital for routine tests.</p> \n<p>If No 10 is being economical about a more serious illness, it would not be the first time the public has been misled by a serving prime minister about his health. The UK may be at war with an invisible virus, but British prime ministers at times of conflict have always been reluctant to admit they have been incapacitated. David Lloyd George in 1918 suffered a bout of influenza so severe his valet said it was touch and go whether he would survive. Medical bulletins at the time made no suggestion he was in any danger.</p> \n<p>Andrew Bonar Law resigned in 1923 only on receiving a diagnosis of terminal throat cancer, and Henry Campbell-Bannerman, prime minister from 1905 to 1908, died days after his resignation in 10 Downing Street.</p> \n<p>During Winston Churchill\u2019s two wartime illnesses, the full extent of them was never revealed. In February 1943, after the then 69-year-old contracted pneumonia, his personal physician Charles Wilson drafted a bulletin, but Churchill immediately demanded to see it. He dismissed it as \u201calarmist\u201d and liable to cause confusion and despondency and was, in any case, untrue.</p> \n<p>Churchill, therefore, dictated his own bulletin, but Wilson said it was inaccurate and misleading and he could not possibly sign it. Elaborate textual negotiations led to a compromise, and subsequent bulletins always referred to his improving condition.</p> \n<p>A further bout of pneumonia in August 1944 was not publicised at all, and according to his wife, Clementine, only the smallest circle was informed.</p> \n<p>Similarly, the cocktail of drugs being taken by Anthony Eden during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/14/past.education1\">Suez crisis</a> was known only to a few, and even now the impact on his judgment is a matter of dispute.</p> \n<p>But these were more discreet times, and the ruling class could form a small circle of trust. That in turn made it easier to put out bland medical bulletins that disguised more than they revealed.</p> \n<p>The White House has been equally skilled at suppressing the truth about its president\u2019s health. Franklin D Roosevelt famously had polio, Dwight D Eisenhower had both a heart attack and a stroke while in office. John F Kennedy suffered Addison\u2019s disease, hypothyroidism and severe back pain, none of which was publicly disclosed during his lifetime. Grover Cleveland in 1893 even had a secret operation to remove a cancerous growth that took place on a boat, dressed up as a fishing trip on a lake.</p> \n<p>The fear that power, credibility and respect will seep away if ill health is revealed remains. Not just the electorate will lose faith, but your cabinet colleagues may sniff a succession. Tony Blair was reluctant to reveal his heart issues for fear allies of the the then chancellor, Gordon Brown, might take advantage.</p> \n<p>Hillary Clinton was hammered when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-health-pneumonia\">she contracted pneumonia</a>, and wobbled in front of the TV cameras when walking to a car. In 2016 news of her illness received 13 times more coverage than revelations about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/07/donald-trump-charity-foundation-misuse-lawsuit\">fraud in Trump\u2019s charitable foundation</a>. Bernie Sanders has frantically denied <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/04/bernie-sanders-heart-attack-hospital-release\">his heart attack</a> makes him the weaker of the three septuagenarians seeking the presidency.</p> \n<p>But outright suppression of the truth in modern politics has its downsides. Figures such as Peter Mandelson, Gordon Brown\u2019s chief communicator after the financial crash, have warned the prerequisite for national unity at a time of genuine crisis is a government that levels with the British public about the difficulties the Whitehall machine is facing. </p> \n<p>There will come a point when, if Johnson\u2019s condition is serious, the medical and spin doctors will have to tell the public as much.</p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson is ill and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/06/boris-johnson-can-run-country-from-hospital-bed-says-uk-minister-coronavirus\">in hospital</a>. That must be wretched for him and his family. We can only wish him well and a speedy recovery. His infection by Covid-19 indicates the extraordinary contagiousness of this disease and possibly its widespread prevalence. Of the first there is now no doubt. Of the second, without testing, there is no clue.</p> <p>That a prime minister is ill is a serious matter. Yesterday the Queen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/queen-urges-britons-stay-strong-coronavirus-covid-lockdown\">performed her duty</a> as the nation\u2019s figurehead with remarkable assurance. In clear, undramatic language, she spoke free of cliche and with sincerity. Her few words of hope shone through the darkening forest of the media coverage of these events. It was the first time I smiled at the television in a month.</p> <p>A prime minister too is a figurehead, but has a harder task. Johnson is the nation\u2019s elected leader at a time of crisis, with millions reliant on his decisiveness, judgment and public demeanour. At least one cabinet minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/06/boris-johnson-can-run-country-from-hospital-bed-says-uk-minister-coronavirus\">maintains</a> that these qualities can be deployed from his hospital bed. Sometime soon, that idea will become absurd. It presents the government machine as a driverless car which, in the style of Yes Minister, will perform equally well, if not better, with no politician at the wheel. Leave the experts and \u201cthe science\u201d to get on with it, and all will be well.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/06/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-spends-night-in-hospital\">UK coronavirus live: Boris Johnson remains in hospital 'for observation' after 'comfortable night'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rumours abound that since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, this machine has been ramshackle. The nation\u2019s health services, so proudly championed for so long, were unprepared both centrally and locally. This was despite trial runs and forewarning. It does not matter who was to blame. The system malfunctioned. Then in mid-stream the cabinet reversed its policy from mitigation to suppression. Ministers ran in and out of Downing Street press conferences, making pledges, setting targets and micro-managing social distancing. Little of what they said carried full conviction.</p> <p>Suddenly, leadership mattered. Who was in charge? Johnson\u2019s initial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/enemy-deadly-boris-johnson-invokes-wartime-language-coronavirus\">glib Churchill imitations</a> (the Queen wisely chose Vera Lynn) had to change, and they did. As Johnson fell ill, news conferences were conducted by the dull, steady Dominic Raab or the flashy, impetuous Matt Hancock. Experts came and went, spurring debate as to what side they were on.</p> <p>Government lurched into lecture mode. It began telling people not to work, how to shop, and where and with whom to walk. These are not the normal actions of government in a free society. They are painful and massively intrusive on daily life. They are also being taken by ministers and officials amid extremes of risk and uncertainty. The instinct under pressure was not to welcome argument or accountability. It was to demand obedience.</p> <p>That is not enough. At the very least the use of such powers requires the most explicit public leadership. Bluntly, they need the qualities of communication for which Johnson was supposedly elected. They also need ready scrutiny and challenge, which is currently being supplied only by the media. Parliament has abandoned what should be its primary role: holding executive decision to account. The new Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, was therefore right to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/04/new-labour-leader-keir-starmer-pledges-to-work-with-boris-johnson-on-covid-19\">refuse</a> Johnson automatic support.</p> <p>The cabinet cannot operate with half its members in varying degrees of isolation. The wonders of Skype and Zoom cannot replicate the cut and thrust, the body language, the public and private exchanges of a truly deliberative forum. There has to be a conductor knowing when and how to bring the instruments of government into play. There has to be a boss.</p> <p>Past experience of sick leaders is not happy. Churchill\u2019s doctor, Lord Moran, and his wartime aide, Lord Alanbrooke, related the impact his clinical depressions had on war cabinet morale. The same message came through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/05/politics1\">the 2008 study of sickness in power</a> by the former foreign secretary, David Owen. He traced the hubristic impact that power can have on those who wield it, not least a refusal to believe they might be ill.</p> <p>Democracies vote for leaders, not anarchists. Every leader\u2019s style is different. Attlee could hardly have been less like Churchill, Heath less like Thatcher, Brown less like Blair. All depended on their close relations in Downing Street with advisers and cabinet colleagues \u2013 and suffered when these broke down. Johnson decided from the start that he would not harbour critics in Downing Street, preferring the second rate to the second thought. He made his own indispensability a feature of his rule. In normal times, that is unwise. In a crisis it is stupid.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s present predicament is yielding lessons aplenty. One is that the formal machinery of government matters. Johnson\u2019s response to coronavirus has been to nationalise, standardise, command and control everything. In his lockdown, one rule must fit all. Such is Britain\u2019s centralist constitution. But if so, it must depend on one thing: efficient and accountable leadership. At present the prime minister is clearly unfit. A public and functioning alternative must surely be in place.</p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p>",

And no, the glow isn\u2019t only that of romantic love. The latter is a strong contributory factor, of course: its pains are rekindled for the speaker when her ex-boyfriend walks by \u201cholding a bunch of flowers\u201d. The question \u201cAre those flowers for your girl?\u201d contextualises it a little, while retaining the tonal mystery. Is the voice angry, sarcastic, sorrowful? We might guess it\u2019s all three.</p> <p>I like the mixed emotions playing throughout the earlier passages of the poem, and how they are finally resolved. Easter eggs initially supply the poetic calories. All three players in the love triangle are turned into chocolate, the man\u2019s current girlfriend being a particularly sickly and triumphant example \u201cdressed up \u2026 / in yellow and pink\u201d. The man is seen as the more vulnerable.</p> <p>Writing a kind of verse letter to the man in question, the speaker imagines tapping him and \u201ccracking your thin chocolate shell\u201d. Birth may be suggested, but death occurs first. She imagines her own comic-extreme self-sacrifice, breaking off parts of her chocolate self to give the man and his girl.</p> <p>Later on, imagery from the Passion of Christ recalls the numbness and sense of being buried alive \u201cafter he rolled / a stone over my heart / and shut me off from the world\u201d. Probably the same boyfriend was the culprit, though not necessarily. Kelly\u2019s change of pronoun leaves it ambiguous. The \u201csepulchre\u201d analogy is pitched high, yet it\u2019s also faithful to the experience of severe depression, a suffocating stone that\u2019s all too real.</p> <p>Now the speaker returns the ex-lover to mortal form, a little self-mockingly at first \u2013 \u201cgodlike in jeans / and an old t-shirt, the sun glinting on one / silver earring\u201d. The mood has changed, perhaps with the recovery of simultaneously erotic and sublimated feelings.</p> <p>Words withheld and words given become the dominant theme. In line nine, the first of the special, italicised words and phrases, <em>garden</em>, helps the transition to biblical analogy. There is an implied betrayal. But the words are magically potent. They ignite the rose, although they include <em>thorn</em>. They produce birds who lay \u201cblue speckled egg(s)\u201d in nests high in trees. Kelly\u2019s italics slow the reader, so we savour these archetypal symbols, these ordinary happy words, and, importantly, imagine them as the especially meaningful gifts originally offered in the poet\u2019s native Irish language.</p> <p>Six lines from the end, the poet turns on her full power with that marvellous image of the man clothed in, covered in, words that \u201cmove / up and down you, as if they\u2019re alive\u201d. Most significantly, \u201cthe words bring themselves to me / and tell my tongue <em>sweetness</em> over and over\u201d. They enable the speaker to find her own words and \u201cThe words are everything\u2026\u201d Once more, I was reminded of <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1&amp;version=KJV\">a passage from the New Testament</a>: \u201cIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God. And the word was God.\u201d</p> <p>Out of the rediscovery of inspiration and language comes the generosity of forgiveness \u2013 and, of course, the miracle. A miracle was first attributed to the man in the poem\u2019s second line: now, an old-new miracle is performed by the speaker. What could be more generous than turning water to wine at a rival\u2019s wedding feast? And of course the wine is also the poet\u2019s gift-to-self \u2013 part of her own word feast, now freely flowing.</p> <p>\u2022 Easter is reproduced with permission from <a href=\"https://www.bloodaxebooks.com/ecs/category/r-is-n-kelly\">R\u00f3is\u00edn Kelly\u2019s collection, Mercy</a> (Bloodaxe Books, 2020)</p>",

But as the next decade dawned, the contract <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/05/stevie-wonder-every-studio-album-ranked\">Stevie Wonder</a> had signed as a minor expired and, desperate not to lose his star, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/motown\">Motown</a> boss Berry Gordy granted Wonder hitherto-unknown creative freedom from the label\u2019s legendary \u201chit factory\u201d production line.</p> <p>Wonder recast himself as an auteur with something powerful to say \u2013 and, thanks to a fruitful creative relationship with early synthesiser pioneers Malcolm Cecil and Robert Margouleff, a revolutionary way of delivering that message. Further breaking from Motown tradition, the newly liberated Wonder treated the album format as an art form in and of itself, rather than just bundling his latest hit single with lesser, filler tracks. Armed with a bank of still-futuristic Arp and Moog synthesisers, Wonder went on to deliver five solid-gold masterpieces across the decade. It\u2019s tough to pick a favourite from the bunch, but Talking Book\u2019s devotional fervour wins it by a nose.</p> <p>Talking Book mostly eschewed the political edge that would characterise its follow-up, Innervisions \u2013 love is its dominant theme. Where contemporary Marvin Gaye investigated love\u2019s darker side, finding inspiration in its paranoid shadows, Wonder was an apostle of the light, proselytising for love as a sacred, ecstatic, rejuvenating force. And Talking Book\u2019s master stroke is how it eulogised love without ever succumbing to schmaltz, drawing power and profundity from Wonder\u2019s superlative lightness of touch (You Are the Sunshine of My Life, Tuesday Heartbreak) and otherworldly sounds \u2013 You and I (We Can Conquer the World), a sublime secular hymn, saw Wonder duetting with soaring, theremin-like synths.</p> <p>His other key collaborator on Talking Book was the inspiration for You and I, his wife, singer-songwriter Syreeta Wright. Though the couple divorced during the album\u2019s production, she wrote the lyrics for two of the album\u2019s final three songs, a redemptive arc tracing a path from heartbreak and recrimination (Blame It on the Sun), through healing (the achingly happy/sad Lookin\u2019 for Another Pure Love), to hope (the closing, gospel-esque I Believe (When I Fall in Love). She remained Wonder\u2019s close confidante until her death in 2004 \u2013 he later said they \u201cwere better friends when we weren\u2019t married than when we were\u201d \u2013 and their enduring relationship seemed a testament to Wonder\u2019s belief in the power of love.</p> <p>Talking Book\u2019s biggest hit, meanwhile, ditched Wonder\u2019s romantic theme. The sharp, cynical Superstition saw Stevie lay down one of the most instantly recognisable drum-licks in pop history, and realise all the funky potential within the clavinet on a track so blessed with groove it turned even <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ul7X5js1vE\">the set of Sesame Street into a raucous dancefloor</a>. Indeed, Talking Book was enough to suggest there wasn\u2019t anything Stevie Wonder couldn\u2019t do \u2013 and he would hold the world under that spell for the rest of the decade.</p> <h2><strong>The three albums to check out next</strong></h2> <p><strong>Music of My Mind (1972)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3yaodgDV60\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w3yaodgDV60?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Wonder\u2019s first post-emancipation release had its shaky moments \u2013 not least the misjudged Sweet Little Girl, where Stevie warns his obsession, \u201cDon\u2019t make me get mad and act like a nigga\u201d \u2013 but Music of My Mind was a bold statement of intent. Juggling ambitious epics like Superwoman (Where Were You When I Needed You) and Love Having You Around with the deliriously pretty pop of Happier Than the Morning Sun and I Love Every Little Thing About You, the album sounded drunk on the possibilities of new technology, and revelled in the abundant talents of Wonder, who \u2013 aside from one guitar solo and one trombone part \u2013 sang and performed every note.</p> <p><strong>Innervisions (1973)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu95a_RiH54\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Nu95a_RiH54?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>More ambitious, perhaps, than Talking Book, you can hear Wonder\u2019s confidence flexing throughout the many audacious strokes of Innervisions. He made the first of many successful experiments with Latin rhythms (Don\u2019t You Worry \u2019Bout a Thing), proved himself a one-man funk colossus to rival Sly Stone on the synthesiser and clavinet-driven Too High and Higher Ground, and revealed himself an astute observer of human character on the closing He\u2019s Misstra Know-It All. Best of all was Living for the City, tracing the journey of an unsuspecting country boy who falls foul of the racist system across a seven-minute track that played out like a movie.</p> <p><strong>Songs in the Key of Life (1976)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CB0_YU4G6Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3CB0_YU4G6Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>With his contract up for renegotiation again, Wonder briefly considered quitting music for charitable works in Africa before signing again with Motown for an unprecedented $37m. The label got its money\u2019s worth with his next release, however: 105 minutes of music across four LP sides, plus a bonus EP. Its epic sprawl is part of Key of Life\u2019s charm, switching between genius hit singles (the infectiously joyful Sir Duke and I Wish), blasts of deep fusion (Contusion), moments of disco-gospel ecstasy (As), visionary synthesiser symphonies (Village Ghetto Land) and effervescent, impossibly beautiful balladry (Knocks Me Off My Feet). Songs in the Key of Life is vast, it contains multitudes \u2013 and it maintains a standard most artists could only dream of.</p> <h2><strong>One for the heads</strong></h2> <p><strong>Jungle Fever (1991)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cOuhcqRHnI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1cOuhcqRHnI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>While Wonder\u2019s 70s output was inspiring in its quality and abundance \u2013 also producing classic albums by Minnie Riperton and Wright, and giving songs to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckuyFT706mA\">the Supremes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvLZzQXkVI4\">the Pointer Sisters</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cm_cFzVAoo8\">Chaka Khan</a> \u2013 the next decade witnessed a precipitous descent into triteness, signalled by 1984 chart-topper I Just Called to Say I Love You.

The elastic funk of the title track and the excellent Queen in the Black were Wonder playing the new jack swing generation at their own game, but Jungle Fever\u2019s peaks were firmly in his own voice: the keening ache of I Go Sailing, the unabashedly emotive These Three Words, and the precious whimsy of If She Breaks Your Heart.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/17/eddie-and-brian-holland-on-their-greatest-songs-motown-feels-like-it-was-a-miracle\">Eddie and Brian Holland on their greatest songs: 'Motown feels like it was a miracle'</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>The primer playlist</h2> <p>For Spotify users, listen below or click on the Spotify icon in the top right of the playlist; for Apple Music users, <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/gb/playlist/listeners-digest-where-to-start-with-stevie-wonder/pl.u-KVXBDE3IZRxk1VN\">click here</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6CuDwbX3JpcmTQz7dpUeGh\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/6CuDwbX3JpcmTQz7dpUeGh\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <h2><strong>Further reading</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-wild-stevie-wonder-rolling-stones-1973-interview-178127/\">The Wild Stevie Wonder, by Ben Fong-Torres</a> <br></strong>An in-depth 1973 Rolling Stone magazine profile that finds Wonder reminiscing about his early days at Motown, talking on-the-road tensions with the Stones, and discussing his love for synthesiser music.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/30/stevie-wonder-blind-black-disadvantage\">Stevie Wonder: \u2018I never thought of being blind and black as a disadvantage,\u2019 by Paul Lester</a> <br></strong>Wonder tries out his cockney accent on the Guardian\u2019s Paul Lester, revisits the 1973 car accident that almost ended his life, and muses, \u201cI\u2019m always optimistic \u2013 but the world isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.okayplayer.com/music/stevie-wonder-malcolm-cecil-tonto-music-of-my-mind-interview.html\">Stevie Wonder producer Malcolm Cecil breaks down the making of Music </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.okayplayer.com/music/stevie-wonder-malcolm-cecil-tonto-music-of-my-mind-interview.html\">of My Mind</a><br></strong>Wonder is rarely the most revealing interviewee.

  "<p><em>Spoiler alert: this blog is published after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/westworld\">Westworld</a> airs on HBO in the US and Sky Atlantic in the UK on Sunday night/Monday morning. Do not read unless you have watched season three, episode four.</em></p> <p>Poor old William. Well, maybe just the old bit. The nastiest man in Westworld has fallen apart. Wracked by guilt, he is unable to distinguish hallucination from luxe furnishings and, most troubling of all, he has been outwitted by a host.</p> <p>Dolores has got the better of her long-time tormentor, by persuading him to take his company, Delos, off the stock market and turn it private. That means it can\u2019t be bought by nasty man Serac, but it also means that it is now in the control of a nasty robot who tends to see humanity (not without reason) as a blight that would be better off in the evolutionary bin. Dolores, while looking like Charlotte Hale, achieves this by declaring William insane and deposing him from the top of Delos. William is aghast, but it turns out that wandering around shouting: \u201cI know who the fuck I am!\u201d is not a particularly persuasive counterpoint.</p> <p>For regular readers, an apology follows. Last week you may have been given the impression that Dolores was a lovely robot woman who recognised good people for good people and was our only hope in the battle against the billionaire misanthrope Serac. I am happy to correct that observation, now being very much of the mind that Dolores is an imminent and absolute danger and, what\u2019s more, there are five of her.</p> <p>Yes, after all that speculation (what, a red herring in Westworld?!), it turns out that Dolores did not smuggle a series of hosts out of the park when she left Westworld at the end of the last season. Instead, she smuggled out four clones of herself, because if you want to do the job of conquering the world properly, you are better off doing it yourself. So, no Teddy, no Clementine, no leering dude with mutton chops (he is called Rebus, but he will always be Mutton Chops to me), no Ford. Just Dolores and a Bernard for cosmic balance.</p> <p>That is fine with me. This week\u2019s episode, while a bit glitchy when showing us around William\u2019s mind, was as straightforward as Westworld has been for a while \u2013 and that is a good thing. We now know the parameters of the conflict: Serac versus Dolores, with Bernard and Maeve (and surely Caleb, soon enough) in the middle. At stake: the future of humanity and a question over whether anyone can ever be free.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06e3aa27fc1010619403f8a84fb5f1e1e340bc0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06e3aa27fc1010619403f8a84fb5f1e1e340bc0c/0_0_6720_4480/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Serac (Vincent Cassel) in Westworld.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Man with a plan ... Serac (Vincent Cassel) in Westworld.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Caleb is currently in Camp Dolores, having helped her to capture Liam at a 1% orgy. This orgy is basically <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/29/eyes-wide-shut-review-stanley-kubrick-tom-cruise-nicole-kidman\">Eyes Wide Shut</a> with added \u201cdigital psychopharma\u201d, which is basically drugs via a dongle. Liam is in attendance with some of his disgusting pals, but he has lost his appetite for delinquency. Why so? Because he has been confronted by his security chief, Malcolm Tucker \u2013 sorry, Martin \u2013 and mocked for his proclivities.</p> <p>Anyway, no matter, Liam can\u2019t partake in the orgy anyway, because he has had all his money stolen by Dolores. Which as a result leaves me confused as to why she wants to kidnap him, too. Maybe it is something to do with the Rehohohoboam. Anyway, it is all moot as Bernard, sexy orgy mask and all, turns up with Stubbs to pinch Liam first.</p> <p>Bernard wants Liam because he believes he is Dolores\u2019s plant and a secret host. He is not, however, as Bernard finds out when he tries to switch him off with a button. But with Malcolm/Martin having spotted Bernard from his eagle-eye view, Dolores is soon bearing down on our furrow-browed hero and Stubbs is forced to step in to fight her.</p> <p>I swear Stubbs wasn\u2019t nearly as spiky and sarky and, well, interesting in previous series, but as Dolores descends he has time to compliment her little black dress before the pair go at it. Yet despite his weight advantage, Bernard\u2019s minder is no match for Dolores; after exchanging a few quick blows, she throws him off a balcony.</p> <p>Bernard has escaped with Liam, but is soon tracked down by Malcolm/Martin, who also turns out to be Dolores. Get it? Got it? Good.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a1263a16fda4d73f25e05b3433960bb2d448ba9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a1263a16fda4d73f25e05b3433960bb2d448ba9/0_0_1920_1080/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Maeve (Thandie Newton) in Westworld\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Date with destiny ... Maeve (Thandie Newton).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over in Singapore, Maeve is having a similar experience. Having been recruited to Team Serac two weeks ago, we see her enjoy a ginormous glass of sherry with the billionaire Frenchman at the beginning of this episode. He is explaining his hopes for humanity, which involve getting them to do what he thinks is right, but he then also offers an intriguing insight into what has been going on in the world at large while we have been watching Delos\u2019s \u201cmurder simulation theme parks\u201d (copyright Stubbs). When Serac was a boy growing up in Paris, he was witness to a massive bio-terror event that destroyed the city. Fortunately for Serac, he was gambolling in a field overlooking the city at the time (you know, that field), but millions of other people perished. Yes, it was a bit eerie to watch, wasn\u2019t it?</p> <p>So, anyway, a lot of the world is now uninhabitable, we are led to assume. And Serac wants to control the rest of it. You get the impression that Maeve loses her affection for the guy after he blows out the brains of an informer who had helped Dolores after her escape from Westworld. This guy\u2019s dying confession sets up a trail first to \u201cThe Mortician\u201d, then an underworld kingpin called Sato, who looks just like Hector\u2019s Shogun World double, Musashi. But the truth is that he is none other than \u2013 you got there before me, didn\u2019t you? \u2013 Dolores.</p> <p>Following this revelation, there is another fight, this time with swords. We learn that Sato\u2019s distillery isn\u2019t making whisky, but host milk. We see that Maeve is able to control electronics with her mind, which allows her to mess up a few goons with machine guns. Just as with Stubbs before, however, the Dolores double is too good. Sato deals Maeve a big sword to the tum and soon her red blood is pouring out over the white milk in a symbolic mixture of materials that makes you wonder, once more, why she doesn\u2019t bleed white in the first place.</p> <h2>Divergence and anomalies</h2> <ul> <li><p>Can anyone name the song being played by the string section during the orgy? I thought it was Hot Chip\u2019s Over and Over for a minute, but I suspect that dates me; it is probably some contemporary R&amp;B.</p></li> <li><p>\u201cAll sex is commerce.

  "<p>Lombardy is one of the richest and most productive regions in Italy and Bergamo is its beating heart. It is also my home town: the city where I spent my childhood and adolescence. The province\u2019s million inhabitants are characterised by a strong sense of belonging: to region and to family. They take pride too in a no-nonsense, practical approach to life and a powerful work ethic.</p> <p>Today, Bergamo holds the European record that no town wants: it is the place where the coronavirus pandemic has cast its darkest shadow. Bergamo is a lazaretto of pain, where the priority of hospital managers is to select only the patients they think will survive. Its undertakers are so overwhelmed they have to ask neighbouring communes to take their corpses for cremation.</p> <p>Italy\u2019s death toll from this pandemic passed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance-4-april-6pm\">15,000 on 4 April</a>, although the number of actual deaths is probably higher.

Forced confinement, physical distancing and care for the weakest seem futile. The virus seemed to defeat any effort, annihilate any commitment. Here, no one took to singing on balconies, to giving concerts online: the place is in perpetual mourning.</p> <p>But was the initial reluctance to shut down Bergamo\u2019s factories and thriving economy a factor in spreading the infection?</p> <p>To grasp that first reaction it helps to understand just how efficient and solid the economic and industrial fabric here has been for generations. The province has Italy\u2019s biggest concentration of the country\u2019s best-performing small and medium-sized enterprises, clustered mostly in the lower Bergamo region. But it is also home to big international companies such as Brembo, which makes automotive braking systems, and Kiko, the international cosmetics brand founded by Antonio Percassi, also president of the local football team, Atalanta. Some Bergamo success stories such as the drinks company San Pellegrino, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, have been absorbed by multinationals.</p> <p>The three Alpine valleys of the province have more farms than businesses. The small towns that make up these valleys have strong rural communities that maintain their traditions at parish level, but can feel closed in on themselves. Everyone knows everyone else, many elderly people still speak the dialect, and even teenagers stick close to home.</p> <p>The city of Bergamo by contrast could hardly be more open: it is directly linked to the main European capitals by Orio al Serio airport (also known as Milan/Bergamo), which is a hub for Ryanair and had nearly 14 million passengers in 2019. These frequent connections are an important source of tourism for the city. </p> <p>In 1913, the German-Swiss writer and intellectual Hermann Hesse visited Bergamo and observed: \u201cI was greeted by a modern railway station and a modern city \u2026 the evening stroll was crowded and the tramway crowded.\u201d Then he took the funicular to reach the upper town, the historical part of the city surrounded by Venetian walls, \u201cbelow me, the nightlife of the city was off \u2026 here I was in the middle of an ancient and dark city, swallowed up by a narrow and deserted alleyway, just as the shops were closing \u2026 it suddenly seemed to me that I was in southern Tuscany\u201d.</p> <p>Hesse immediately grasped the duality of Bergamo: modern and ancient, economically open to the world but closed in on its traditions. On the one hand, a strong social and cultural life linked by voluntary work through the Catholic church. On the other, a remarkable focus on productivity, work, the family and above all the family business.</p> <p>It is clear looking back that this rich and dynamic city struggled to come to a halt when the virus arrived. For the <em>Bergamaschi,</em> work and self-reliance have always been fundamental values. But faced with a health emergency, was a strong business ethic a tragic disadvantage?</p> <p>By 23 February, the virus had already infected Val Seriana, the Bergamo valley where two villages, Alzano Lombardo and Nembro, quickly became the ground zero of the epidemic in the region.</p> <p>Four days earlier, on 19 February, an <a href=\"https://talksport.com/football/687311/atalanta-valencia-champions-coronavirus-bergamo-mayor/\">Atalanta-Valencia Champions League football match</a> was attended by 45,000 fans in Milan, an event widely blamed for having accelerated the spread across the region.</p> <p>The contagion reached Codogno (a small town in Lodi province, 65km from Bergamo) two days after the game, and Codogno was immediately made a \u201cred zone\u201d, in other words quarantined with police checkpoints guarding entry and exit. By contrast, in Bergamo schools closed, but there was resistance to any sweeping stay-at-home measures until 8 March when all of Lombardy went into full lockdown.</p> <p>The Italian government had declared a nationwide health emergency on 31 January but Stefano Scaglia, the president of Confindustria Bergamo, which represents 1,200 businesses employing 80,000 people, offered reassurance. On 29 February, the organisation published a <a href=\"https://www.bergamonews.it/2020/02/29/confindustria-bergamo-ai-partners-internazionali-delle-imprese-orobiche-pronti-a-ripartire/356831/\">message in English </a>aimed at the region\u2019s international export partners, accompanied by the hashtag \u201c#Bergamoisrunning\u201d.

  "<p>The Jerry Springer Show didn\u2019t so much jump the shark as arrive on television in mid-leap. On a daily basis, it served up a clumpy gruel of screaming and fistfights that first defined and then accelerated the concept of the Ugly American across the world. It was a low-rent, knock-down, barroom brawl of a show that splashed around in humanity\u2019s very worst excesses. And people couldn\u2019t get enough of it.</p> <p>It is almost impossible now to grasp how huge The Jerry Springer Show was in its time. In a typical episode, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/06/jerry-springer-tabloid-holocaust-tv\">Springer</a> \u2013 a former mayor of Cincinnati who was born in Highgate tube station during a second world war German bombing raid \u2013 would play ringmaster to a tawdry parade of domestic disputes. In episodes with titles such as I\u2019m Pregnant by a Transsexual! and Lesbolicious, Springer would introduce a guest, hear their complaints, bring on an aggressor and watch as they verbally and physically attacked each other.</p> <p>Sometimes he would offer half-baked witticisms from the sidelines \u2013 \u201cBetcha can\u2019t say that 12 times in a row,\u201d he shrugged during one episode after a woman described her daughter-in-law as \u201ca bigmouth, bully, badass bitch\u201d \u2013 and other times he\u2019d step back while the audience chanted his name like they would a WWE wrestler. It seemed unstoppable.</p> <p>But what did for The Jerry Springer Show was Springer himself. Erudite and politically conscious in person, he repeatedly distanced himself from the show that bore his name, telling Reuters in 2000: \u201cI would never watch my show. I\u2019m not interested in it.\u201d The real nail in the coffin, though, came in 2005, when Springer came to the UK for a British spin-off entitled The Springer Show.</p> <p>Running on ITV in place of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/27/trisha-goddard-rule-out-people-with-mental-health-problems-and-youd-get-nobody-on-tv\">Trisha Goddard</a>, The Springer Show was warmer and more subdued than its American progenitor. There was a sense that Springer had gone out of his way to inject more of his own personality into it, in a bid to stop the runaway train he had created. The show did fine, but the consensus was that it was a little boring. So ITV replaced him with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/jeremykyle\">Jeremy Kyle</a>.</p> <p>And Jeremy Kyle killed Jerry Springer. Where Springer was wry and detached from the tawdriness of his show, Kyle seemed fully invested in it. He didn\u2019t stand at the back and crack wise; he crouched down on his stage, dripping with judgment, and openly shouted at his guests. He really meant it. Suddenly the whole talkshow shtick lost its sense of self-awareness, and whatever grain of fun it once had was flushed down the toilet for ever.</p> <p>Kyle was such a sensation that he eventually took his screaming villainy to the US, where his show ran for 300 episodes. Compared to this bare-knuckle confrontational style, Springer started to look even more like a clapped-out sideshow; miraculously, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/19/farewell-to-the-jerry-springer-show-27-years-of-fights-bleeps-and-outrage\">his show managed to lumber on until 2018</a> before finally sputtering out.</p> <p>Springer now hosts a programme called Judge Jerry, where he finally gets to flex his legal qualifications. Kyle\u2019s show was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/may/15/itv-axes-jeremy-kyle-show-after-death-of-participant\">cancelled last year after the death</a> of a former guest.

  "<p>\u201cWe are asking hard questions like who might be facing bankruptcy in the short term, because that\u2019s the reality right now,\u201d Katherine Grainger says, in her role as the head of UK Sport, as she considers the financial devastation of the global coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cThese are the honest conversations we need to have. Some sports are at short-term risk while other major sports have much bigger budgets. But because they don\u2019t have money coming in from their partners and they are not hosting events they expected some of the big sports could also be under threat. It\u2019s across the board. People\u2019s jobs and the future of sporting bodies are at stake.

As a rower she won a medal at each of the past five Olympic Games, with her gold at London 2012 being the high point. The 44-year-old is also a six-time world champion who earned a PhD in criminal law.</p> <p>She is as amiable as ever as we talk for more than an hour but, surveying the impact of Covid-19, Grainger does not conceal the severity of the situation. UK Sport is in the midst of obtaining a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/02/british-sports-bodies-fear-financial-ruin-because-of-coronavirus-pandemic\" title=\"\">comprehensive health check</a> on the finances of all its Olympic and Paralympic sports. Key information is still to be collected but the early indications worry Grainger as she concedes some sports are in danger. \u201cIf [the crisis] goes on for another six months there will be a handful of sports, three or four [which could go under]. If no other financial stability was guaranteed it would go up into the teens. We have talked to about 30 sports and I think about half would be in quite serious threat if this went on.\u201d</p> <p>Grainger is understandably reluctant to name the sports in potential jeopardy but says: \u201cWe have started talking to the government and they are sympathetic but as much as we will be fighting for sport to get reassurance [of government help] as early as possible we know there are very big decisions to be made in health, education, industry and the economy. The impact on these areas must be considered first and we\u2019re not saying sport should be ahead of any of these.\u201d</p> <p>Does Grainger envisage a situation where she may have to choose which sporting bodies are kept alive? \u201cI don\u2019t know if we will be in that position but there is a chance we will end up there if we can\u2019t get some financial certainty.\u201d</p> <p>The worst effects could well be mitigated by the \u00a3195m Sport England plans to inject into grassroots sport. Grainger also looks up on my laptop screen, as we are doing this interview remotely, and offers a familiar smile of encouragement. \u201cThe Olympics and Paralympics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/24/tokyo-olympics-to-be-postponed-to-2021-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic\" title=\"\">will be next summer</a> as long as this pandemic hasn\u2019t worsened. It would be an incredible opportunity for fit and healthy nations to come together again. We could have quite a celebration if the world\u2019s in a better place.</p> <p>\u201cJust think how it would feel if we could all come together again, watching something together, united in actual physical contact. With that in mind you feel Great Britain would want our teams to be as best prepared as possible but everyone is going to have some financial need over the next 12 months, in different areas, and rightly so.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b33d5ff8da0e7187feb1cbb73264579c53461695\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b33d5ff8da0e7187feb1cbb73264579c53461695/0_219_3600_2160/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Katherine Grainger and Anna Watkins with their gold medals for the women\u2019s double sculls at the London 2012 Olympic Games.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katherine Grainger and Anna Watkins with their gold medals for the women\u2019s double sculls at the London 2012 Olympic Games.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Has the crisis made her think even more deeply about moral questions as to how sport is funded \u2013 and how much money it deserves compared with health and education? \u201cIt has because we\u2019re suddenly in a very different world. We\u2019re always needing more money and we feel sport can spread inspiration across the nation but the pandemic has put everything on hold. It forces you to ask the right questions. Ultimately, what is important? What role should sport play in our lives?</p> <p>\u201cIn a global crisis we need to think how we will feel when we look back at this period in a year or 10 years\u2019 time. We will think: \u2018What part did we play?\u2019 Those of us who work in sport and love sport always believe in its inspiration. But when deaths are coming and people are losing jobs, sport has a deeper role. How can sport help communities rebuild? Sport still has its part to play but not in the way we expect in more ordinary times.\u201d</p> <p>Sport will almost certainly have to accept less money than it has been given in the past. The problem is complicated by the fact that the current four-year cycle for Olympic and Paralympic sport ends next March. How will sporting bodies fund their teams as they prepare for Tokyo that summer? \u201cSome money will be saved by not travelling and not competing but we\u2019re looking at a cycle when some sports will suffer big losses. We\u2019re looking at who\u2019s going to be at risk in the next few months and what is ultimately needed.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve reassured everyone the money is in place until March and going right through next summer but we don\u2019t have any money for next summer yet so we\u2019re putting it to government as well. We could say it\u2019s as simple as needing a 12-month rollover, because we have a new Olympic year coming up, but do we accept a reduced three-year funding cycle for Paris in 2024?</p> <p>\u201cEach has different ramifications so a few scenarios are being worked on. We\u2019ve had a call with the sports minister and the people in the civil service, the DCMS [the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport], have been very supportive and understanding. We\u2019re confident they feel sport has to remain ambitious and our teams prepare properly. We just have to see whether that\u2019s feasible.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/04/olympic-football-age-limit-raised-to-24-tokyo-games-postponement\">Olympic men's football age limit raised to 24 after Tokyo Games postponement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is an additional worry for Grainger because much of UK Sport\u2019s funding comes from the national lottery \u2013 and ticket sales had begun to dwindle long before coronavirus. \u201cIt\u2019s always a concern. Other lotteries have emerged and that\u2019s complicated things. The obvious prediction is that this is not going to be a good time for lottery sales. This will have a direct impact on sport. So we do not have an easy financial future.\u201d</p> <p>Grainger has been the chair of UK Sport for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/21/katherine-grainger-chair-uk-sport\" title=\"\">exactly three years this month</a> and feels confident she can negotiate the minefield as to which sports deserve funding when the next cycle begins. She acknowledges some sports \u2013 including badminton and wheelchair rugby \u2013 have cause to feel they have been harshly treated and suggests the crisis will demand an even more thoughtful approach.</p> <p>When she began the job, UK Sport was emerging from 10 years where the mantra of \u201cno compromise\u201d underpinned the belief that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/12/uk-sport-no-compromise-funding-olympics\" title=\"\">only medals counted</a>. A bullying culture pervaded some sports and the mental health of many athletes was affected. Grainger has encouraged a more balanced approach to elite sport but stresses the climate had already shifted in 2016.</p> <p>\u201cRio was our most successful Olympics and Paralympics but it didn\u2019t take long for athletes to say there was a human cost. When I came in UK Sport was already responding, so I can\u2019t take all the credit for changing the culture. As a former athlete I could say of course it\u2019s competitive high performance and it will always feel hard. That\u2019s not a bad thing but it should also feel safe and people should be able to speak out.</p> <p>\u201cWe had an environment where some people thought they could behave in any way as long as medals were being won. That\u2019s wrong and it\u2019s a lot better now but we shouldn\u2019t sit back because it\u2019s constantly evolving.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a5c6a8f312b90ed3fecf41a43b4088b85bf063f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a5c6a8f312b90ed3fecf41a43b4088b85bf063f/266_0_2592_1556/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Katherine Grainger and Victoria Thornley in action during the women\u2019s double sculls heats at Rio 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katherine Grainger and Victoria Thornley in action during the women\u2019s double sculls heats at Rio 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franck Robichon/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before Covid-19 Grainger\u2019s ambition had been evident in her belief it was conceivable GB could one day top the medals table at an Olympic Games. Was this a specific aim? \u201cNot necessarily. We had been asked about our biggest ambitions by the media. Could we ever become the best Olympic nation globally? We did a piece of work to see whether it was feasible to become No 1. The results were that it\u2019s possible but it would take a significant investment over three Olympic cycles.</p> <p>\u201cIt was useful to tell our government this was possible but some of the new Olympic sports haven\u2019t played to our strengths. So we\u2019re up against more than expected and it would be at least three Olympics away. It\u2019s a long-term thing but we were looking mainly for public feedback as to what they want from sport. They wanted more sports to be given the opportunity. The public like a broader range of sports to win medals. The key move would be to maximise the number of sports with medal potential.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and thebiggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such talk hardly matters now. Surely Grainger would settle for Britain slipping down from second in Rio to fifth or sixth place at Tokyo if money was spent in areas of society which need it most? \u201cThere\u2019s some comfort being in the top five. If we\u2019re anywhere in that top five we can take a lot of pride. I don\u2019t think people will remember where we finished after a while. They will remember the stories rather than the details and numbers.\u201d</p> <p>We discuss how sport can lift a national mood and the conversation lightens. \u201cI am ultimately a helpless optimist,\u201d Grainger says. \u201cThat helped me through a lot of worry and adversity when I was competing. So I am still excited about the future of UK Sport not only in terms of medals but in having a positive impact on society once we get out of this crisis. I see all the good sport can do. So we should remain ambitious. Sport still has an important role to play.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/boris-johnson-admitted-to-hospital-with-coronavirus\">admitted to hospital </a>for tests on Sunday night with persistent coronavirus symptoms, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/mar/27/boris-johnson-promises-to-lead-national-fightback-despite-testing-positive-for-coronavirus-video\">10 days after testing positive</a>. Some estimates suggest that about 5-10% of people with Covid-19 require hospital treatment.</p> <p>His admission to hospital indicates doctors want to check how his body is responding to the virus, which will probably involve carrying out the following tests:</p> <h2><strong>Ultrasound</strong><strong>/CT scans</strong></h2> <p>Imaging of the lungs through ultrasound or CT scans is used to get an indication of how badly the patient\u2019s lungs have been affected. It can show up patches, mainly on the edges of the lungs, which suggest infectious changes. The information can be used to determine whether assistance with breathing is needed and if so to what extent. At the lower end of the scale, oxygen can be provided via a mask, but patients with more serious breathing problems may require a ventilator.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/johnsons-hospital-admission-suggests-virus-may-have-progressed\">Boris Johnson's hospital admission suggests his infection has progressed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The scans can also show whether pneumonia is catching hold. Dr Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter\u2019s medical school, said it was not possible to determine whether Johnson had pneumonia based solely on his admission to hospital. <em>\u201c</em>It may be just precautionary. If a patient is developing pneumonia, it can get progressively worse very quickly and hence early admission upon the first signs of difficulty with breathing are very important,\u201d he said.</p> <h2><strong>Blood tests</strong></h2> <p>Assessing white blood cell counts will show the response of the prime minister\u2019s immune system to the virus, in other words how effectively his body is fighting the virus. Doctors will be looking for progression of the disease and to establish that he has not entered the second phase, where the immune system goes into overdrive. Tests also assess liver and kidney function for any warning signs. Both of these organs are at risk of damage from coronavirus and a lack of oxygen.</p> <h2><strong>Electocardiagram (ECG)</strong></h2> <p>This measures the electrical activity of the heart to show if it is working normally. Like the liver and kidney, the heart is also at risk from lack of oxygen. Coronavirus has been found to cause problems such as arrhythmia and acute cardiac injury in some patients.</p>",
  "<p>For many people who are homeless, or those struggling with insecure, unaffordable housing, the idea of a steady, rewarding job is little more than a pipe dream. Aside from the lack of suitable accommodation \u2013 without which it\u2019s hard to build foundations for the future \u2013 they may have to overcome additional issues, such as mental health problems. This can make employment opportunities more challenging.</p> <p>Gareth Jones, 37, from Blackburn, who experienced homelessness and has battled addiction, puts it succinctly: \u201cYou think no one will ever give you a chance because your past looks like you always mess up.\u201d</p> <p>To address this vicious cycle, an initiative by Shelter is helping homeless people turn their lives around with full-time employment. Getting Real Opportunities of Work (GROW) traineeships are 12- to 18-month paid placements that offer people with lived experience of homelessness and housing problems, as well as ex-offenders, and people with mental health or addiction problems, access to meaningful work, training and personal development opportunities.</p> <p>The scheme was launched in 2014 by Shelter\u2019s <a href=\"https://inspiringchangemanchester.shelter.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inspiring Change Manchester</a>, a National Lottery Community-funded programme. GROW aims to provide meaningful employment opportunities within a supportive environment that allows people to learn on the job and, importantly, use their own lived experience positively. The programme also ensures that \u201cexperts by experience\u201d help shape and are integral in developing Shelter\u2019s services, new initiatives and policy solutions.</p> <p>Jones is one of seven trainees currently employed by the <a href=\"https://blog.shelter.org.uk/2019/07/how-co-production-creates-opportunities-for-all/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GROW programme</a>. He suffered three spells of homelessness, including nine months sleeping rough in Amsterdam. A cannabis habit, which started at the age of 15, had escalated into addiction.</p> <p>\u201cI made stupid decisions,\u201d he says. \u201cI blew my wages on hedonistic pursuits and the lack of stability became worse and worse. Living the life I was, building my day around weed, I knew I was never going to get anywhere in life. Ultimately I had to admit it to myself and do something about it.\u201d</p> <p>Jones was eventually persuaded to return to Blackburn to live with his parents. He set about tackling his dependency and attempted to find a stable job. While he was looking for work at a jobcentre, he came across GROW.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/shelter-supporting-those-who-are-struggling/2020/apr/06/until-they-got-involved-i-was-beginning-to-think-this-was-the-end-of-me-how-shelter-changes-the-lives-of-those-in-need\">\u2018Until they got involved I was beginning to think this was the end of me\u2019: how Shelter changes the lives of those in need</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d like to help others going through the same thing I had, so I typed \u2018homelessness\u2019 into the job finder and among the results it generated was the GROW traineeship.\u201d He was offered an interview and it was clear from the start, he says, this was not the typical box-ticking process or a tokenistic placement. \u201cI\u2019ve had loads of interviews and lots of jobs, all of them manual but they were purely to make enough money to live and buy weed. This instantly looked different and useful.\u201d</p> <p>GROW applicants are carefully selected because a job offer entails a considerable commitment from everyone, particularly staff, as programme coordinator Darren de Vally, explains.</p> <p>\u201cThe process is very important. You\u2019re recruiting people with very complex personal histories so it\u2019s important they feel it\u2019s worthwhile applying in the first place. We make it simple, but we need to identify the right people who would really benefit from the traineeship in order to move forward.\u201d</p> <p>All interviews are conducted by a panel of three, which includes someone with lived experience. Anyone who doesn\u2019t receive an offer is given thorough feedback and encouragement to stay involved with Shelter in some way.</p> <p>Once an offer is made and a job assigned \u2013 for Jones this was a placement with Inspiring Change Manchester\u2019s Engagement team \u2013 a careful structure is put in place to ensure the applicant receives meaningful training and support throughout their employment. They\u2019re assigned a day-to-day line manager and a development officer responsible for wellbeing and development, who is someone with lived experience of their own.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very important that people are properly supported,\u201d says de Vally. \u201cWe make sure every trainee gets as much support as they require. It can be quite intensive sometimes, but we find the benefits far outweigh the effort, not just for them but for the people they support in turn and the expertise they bring to the organisation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0df9aa9a7d08682bb82b82799b3f2bd31ad94682\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0df9aa9a7d08682bb82b82799b3f2bd31ad94682/0_151_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"SUPPORTING GROW trainee project Manchester June 2019 Gareth \u00a9 SHELTER Alexandra Smart 2019 34\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gareth Jones (above) now works with Inspiring Change Manchester\u2019s Engagement team, helping people who are homeless off the street and into temporary accommodation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexandra Smart/Shelter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jones has now been a GROW trainee for 10 months. His daily workload involves dealing with homeless referrals, helping people off the street into temporary accommodation, setting them up with benefits and addressing other challenges. Sometimes it\u2019s pressured \u2013 our first interview is cancelled because one of his clients is threatened with eviction and Jones has to access legal support and help him to find alternative accommodation as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>\u201cI never would have imagined getting into this line of work before, but I\u2019ve now got the confidence to liaise with other professionals,\u201d he says. \u201cI understand a lot about the law and how it relates to people leaving custody on probation, and the conditionalities of being released under licence. I can help people to access support with medical issues and I\u2019m capable of engaging with them about their drug issues. I can do outreach on the streets and people relate to me because I\u2019ve been there.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of my own recovery I can hardly go and encourage people to turn their back on substances if I\u2019m still doing it myself, it gives me some discipline to practise what I preach.\u201d</p> <p>The GROW programme\u2019s target is to help people like Jones into full-time employment but the trainees\u2019 experience also benefits Shelter because many trainees move on to further roles, in addition to helping to effect wider systems change.</p> <p>\u201cThe scheme has a huge impact on the individuals who go through it, but beyond that they go on to shape the way we deliver our services and campaigns going forward,\u201d says Lucy Flegg, Shelter\u2019s national involvement manager, of why the programme has begun to take on such importance. \u201cWe believe the best way to deliver our services is if we\u2019re led by people who have firsthand experience of the issues.\u201d</p> <p>The GROW programme is proving a success. To date, 56 people have been enrolled, seven are still with the programme and 44 have moved on to further employment. Others have gone into study or further training. The scheme has expanded to London and Sheffield and places will be offered in Plymouth and Lancashire in the next few months. Shelter is keen to roll out the GROW programme nationally but it requires significant investment.</p> <p>The programme has also been key to generating wider public and political engagement on the issues facing people who are homeless or in precarious accommodation. Notably, a traineeship with the Greater Manchester Combined Authority helped to shape some of the city\u2019s homelessness strategy, and a GROW trainee appeared with Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham for a number of public and media engagements, including BBC Breakfast.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tested model that has excellent outcomes and the scope for growth within our organisation and the wider homeless sector, especially in areas like housing policy development and research, is huge. However, we need to attract further funding,\u201d says Flegg.</p> <p>Those who go through the programme have no doubt about its value. \u201cI\u2019d like to think I\u2019ve made real progress,\u201d says Jones. \u201cI hope other professions would consider employing people with lived experience in their workforce. You can\u2019t afford to write off all those people out there. For me, the ability to tackle these issues daily is empowering.

  "<p>Searching for a new home can be stressful at the best of times, but for those in receipt of housing benefit it can sometimes feel like an impossible task. When Amanda Staples was served with a section 21 \u201cno fault\u201d eviction notice by her landlord, demanding she vacate the property because he wanted to sell, she was unprepared for the difficulties her family would face. In many regards, Staples would be considered the model tenant \u2013 she had an excellent record of paying rent on time, a guarantor and some savings, following the sale of a family home after her divorce. She was even willing to pay six to 12 months\u2019 rent in advance. But despite this, she was refused a property that she could afford, in her preferred location, purely on the grounds that she received some of her income from state security benefits.</p> <p>\u201cI really felt like there was a total lack of understanding from the letting agent, even though I\u2019d explained I was a really good tenant and that [moving out of the village] meant uprooting my children again, changing school, losing work and community links completely unnecessarily,\u201d she says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to listen and they had no interest in my employment, my income, my savings or situation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b259eb6f66cbe88bf5cab103f362036735612c8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b259eb6f66cbe88bf5cab103f362036735612c8c/0_134_533_666/400.jpg\" alt=\"SUPPORTING1 Amanda 1 DSS Discrimination \u00a9 Shelter Alexandra Smart 2019\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Despite offering a year\u2019s rent in advance, Amanda Staples was refused because of her benefit status.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexandra Smart/Shelter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Staples\u2019 experience is far from unique. A 2019 YouGov survey found that 54% of private renters in England who receive housing benefit (equating to 820,000 people) say they have been unable to rent a home because the property was advertised as <a href=\"https://blog.shelter.org.uk/2018/08/ending-dss-discrimination/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201cNo DSS\u201d</a>. The knock-on effect of this discrimination is much less choice in the private rental market for those who need housing benefit, often leaving them with little option than to put up with properties that are in disrepair or unsuitable in other ways, or face the threat of homelessness.</p> <p>In 2017, Rosie Keogh, a single mother in Birmingham, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/04/no-benefits-landlords-rosie-keogh-sex-discrimination\">won \u00a32,000 compensation</a> from a letting agency with the help of Shelter\u2019s strategic litigation team. The agent had refused to consider her as a tenant because she received housing benefit, despite her unblemished 11-year record as a private renter. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42979242\" rel=\"nofollow\">Keogh told the BBC</a> it made her feel like a second-class citizen: \u201cI felt something had to be done to challenge it. I was motivated by anger at such inequitable practice \u2026 it\u2019s women and women with children who are bearing the brunt of this because they need to work part time.\u201d Later that year, a Shelter investigation found that <a href=\"https://england.shelter.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/1581687/Stop_DSS_Discrimination_-_Ending_prejudice_against_renters_on_housing_benefit.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">five out of six </a>letting agent brands had an outright ban on renters on housing benefit in at least one of their branches, and almost half (48%) had no properties available for housing benefit claimants at all.</p> <p>With a chronic shortage of social housing in the UK, such policies leave families with few other options and Shelter has campaigned hard on the issue to accelerate change. The End DSS Discrimination campaign has had a number of <a href=\"https://blog.shelter.org.uk/2018/11/stop-dss-discrimination-live-blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\">significant successes</a>, including convincing NatWest, The Co-Operative Bank and Metro Bank to change the terms of their buy-to-let mortgages, which had precluded landlords from renting to housing benefit tenants (all other major lenders followed suit). Nationwide Building Society, having changed its policy in 2013, also contacted any mortgage holders with a historic \u201cNo DSS\u201d clause to reassure them that it would never be enforced.<em> </em>Further to this<em>, </em>Zoopla and Right Move agreed to ban the inclusion of \u201cno DSS\u201d conditions on their listings; and an update by the Competition and Markets Authority to the consumer protection law for lettings professionals now includes clarification on DSS discrimination.</p> <p>Over the past 18 months, Shelter\u2019s strategic litigation team has played a central role, working as part of the campaign team to coordinate <a href=\"http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/work-and-pensions-committee/no-dss-discrimination-against-benefit-claimants-in-the-housing-sector/written/97946.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">legal challenges</a> to the policies and practices of letting agents, banks, and landlords, as well as counsel affected tenants to take their complaint further if they are willing. \u201cPart of the work of the strategic litigation team is to be horizon scanners,\u201d says Jo Underwood, head of strategic litigation at Shelter. \u201cTo take a step back and monitor the common legal problems coming up in each Shelter office, liaise with our national campaigns and media teams \u2026 to tackle systemic failures in a more proactive and efficient way. Even a settlement out of court can be a step in the right direction because we can publicise that and show other landlords and agents they\u2019re using unlawful practices and running the risk of a court case.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1a70c83cbf79036bbc73c4c913c14f7fcc28c1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1a70c83cbf79036bbc73c4c913c14f7fcc28c1a/15_42_1069_642/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rose Arnall, the solicitor embedded into the campaign, says legal action is just one tool to achieve change.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rose Arnall, the solicitor embedded into the campaign, says legal action is just one tool to achieve change.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shelter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shelter\u2019s legal team spans its 15 locations across England, works with the telephone and online advice services, and includes 40 solicitors and 30 legal advisers and paralegals.

Funded by the Legal Aid Agency, anyone facing eviction or a claim for possession can access legal advice or representation from a Shelter solicitor in courts across the country. There are four solicitors on the strategic litigation team itself.

Indirect discrimination occurs when a practice is not, on the face of it, directly discriminatory, but puts people with a protected characteristic (such as gender or disability) at a particular disadvantage.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality of how these practices impact people is that because women and those with disabilities are more likely to be in receipt of benefits than others, they are the ones who are more likely to be made homeless and not find a home as a result of this exclusion,\u201d says Arnall. \u201cOver the past two years I\u2019ve had an increasing number of clients reveal to me how their housing problems are contributing to stress, anxiety and severe depression.\u201d</p> <p>Thousands tell Shelter they have been impacted by No DSS policies, but only some feel able to take on the hard task of enforcing their right to equal treatment through bringing a legal case.</p> <p>Of those who do enter the courts, not all those who wish to report or challenge these practices have kept detailed records of what happened. \u201cPeople don\u2019t necessarily identify what they\u2019ve experienced as a legal problem\u201d, says Arnall of the cases they hear about.</p> <p>Other challenges include accessing legal aid funding, and a requirement that any complaint must be filed with the court no more than six months after the discrimination occurred. The design of the Equality Act itself, which relies on the victims of discrimination being the ones to enforce it, makes bringing legal action against unscrupulous letting agents even more difficult. For those with complex needs, this can be yet another barrier to redress.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a large task, you can see why the people who carry the cases forward tend to be incredibly determined,\u201d Arnall says. \u201cThey\u2019re not in it for compensation, they\u2019re not in it for themselves \u2013 they just know firsthand the unnecessary unfairness and injustice of these practices, and they want to see the end to them.\u201d</p> <p>Represented by Arnall, Staples would eventually take legal action against the letting agent and landlord that refused to consider her as a tenant. The case totaled \u00a313,000 in compensation, legal and court costs, and the agents issued a public apology. Since then, Staples and her family have been offered a secure social home in the same village and are now happily settled. \u201cThe rule of no DSS shows such ignorance,\u201d she says. \u201c[Being in receipt of benefits] could happen to anybody.\u201d</p> <p><em>Head to <a href=\"https://england.shelter.org.uk/support_us/campaigns/dss\" rel=\"nofollow\">england.shelter.org.uk</a> to find out how you can help end DSS discrimination</em></p>",

By <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-cjPUigxk9/\">day seven</a>, \u201cthe last day for now\u201d, she had painted \u201cI wanted you to fuck me so much I couldn\u2019t paint any more\u201d on the artwork.</p> <p>The Guardian art critic Jonathan Jones said the diary was \u201cnot just a trenchant response to these frightening times but a subtle meditation on how art can rise to them\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt starts out as an apparently random account of her self-isolation at her Spitalfields home, but becomes a short story about the life of an artist. It\u2019s actually rather optimistic because it shows how to exist in solitude \u2013 inside your feelings, your perceptions, your creativity.\u201d</p> <p>Jones noted that the epic canvas Emin was working on kept getting blacker. \u201cShe can\u2019t stop herself slapping on more black. In a plague year, is there any other colour to paint?\u201d</p> <p>Emin is one of a number of contemporary artists using Instagram during the lockdown. Damien Hirst\u2019s posts are cheerful insights from the studio about the way he works. On Wednesday he wrote \u201cI love paint\u201d and posted a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-ZvxLWHWmZ/\">short film from his studio</a> on progress with new enormous cherry blossom paintings.</p> <p>The trunks and branches of the trees he painted were too thick, he said. The solution? Painting blue lines of sky showing through the middle of them. \u201cIt\u2019s building up layers,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t like these until now.\u201d</p> <p>Other artists are giving practical advice. Kara Walker, the American artist whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/30/kara-walker-turbine-hall-review-a-shark-infested-monument-to-the-victims-of-british-slavery\">giant fountain</a> filled Tate Modern\u2019s Turbine Hall until its closure, has been posting #confinementbookclub tips, the latest being Wade Davis\u2019s The Serpent and the Rainbow.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/bob-and-roberta-smith\">artist Bob and Roberta Smith</a> has been posting regular #StayAtHome art tasks such as, on Friday morning, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-glT2NFQW_/\">painting </a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-glT2NFQW_/\">clouds</a> and a statement to a loved one.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI think artists, writers, poets, musicians, composers have a responsibility to keep working and keep doing things. Other people are continuing to work, NHS workers, the corner shop, refuse workers \u2026 so we should. It\u2019s important because it is now that people really understand what culture is all about.\u201d </p>",

The most common symptoms are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell.</p> \n<p>About 80% of people experience a mild case and recover without needing any special treatment. About one in six people become seriously ill.</p> \n<p><strong>How do I know if I have coronavirus and what happens next?</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bde155c3-43e7-4929-8506-bb043a798a88\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2JsWf-2nN1Y?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>How do I protect myself and others from the coronavirus?</strong></p> \n<p>Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds each time, and use hand sanitiser gel. Catch coughs and sneezes with a disposable tissue and bin the tissue. If you don\u2019t have a tissue available, cough and sneeze into the crook of your arm. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</p> \n<p><strong>How should I self-isolate if I am showing symptoms?</strong></p> \n<p>Different countries have set different rules, but broadly speaking, if you live alone and develop a new continuous cough or a high temperature it is recommended to stay at home for seven days after symptoms began. If you live with others, everyone in the house must stay at home and not leave for 14 days. Studies show that people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/09/coronavirus-sufferers-symptom-free-for-five-days-on-average-study\">have the coronavirus without symptoms for five days on average</a>.</p> \n<p>The infection may spread from person to person in shared houses. If anyone else starts to show symptoms while already in isolation, they must stay at home for seven days from the moment their own symptoms start, regardless of where they are in the 14-day isolation period. <strong>Check with your local medical authorities for specific advice that may be applied in your area.</strong></p> \n<p><strong>What is social and physical distancing?</strong></p> \n<p>Many authorities are asking people to practise social and physical distancing. To reduce the spread of the virus, you should avoid meeting up with friends and family who don\u2019t live with you. If you need to see the doctor or other essential services, use the phone, internet or social media if possible. In some places, you can go out for a walk for exercise and to buy essentials, but stay two metres apart from others. <strong>Check with local authorities for specific rules that may be applied in your area.</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/shopping-tips-20200324-4-zip/giv-3902rCHOYPc81Nh7\" data-alt=\"Tips for safer shopping\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/shopping-tips-20200324-4-zip/giv-3902rCHOYPc81Nh7\">Tips for safer shopping</a> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>How do I care for someone suffering from Covid-19?</strong></p> \n<p>Keep the patient rested and comfortable in loose-fitting clothing, keep the room where they are well ventilated, and ensure they drink plenty of water. Over-the counter pain relief may be helpful \u2013 but paracetamol (Tylenol) is recommended rather than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen (Advil).</p> \n<p>To prevent the coronavirus spreading within the household, if possible keep the patient in their own separate room and using a separate bathroom. They should have separate cutlery, crockery, bedding and towels, and preferably wear a mask. Regularly clean and disinfect high-frequency touch surfaces in the home such as door handles, toilets, kitchen counters and tabletops.

Masks are effective at capturing droplets, a main transmission route of coronavirus. If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you\u2019re showing symptoms of coronavirus or have been diagnosed, wearing a mask can also protect others. However, masks will probably make little difference if you\u2019re just walking around town, and are no guarantee of protection.

They found that it was still detectable on copper for up to four hours, on cardboard for up to 24 hours, and on plastic and steel for up to 72 hours. But it\u2019s important to note that the amount of virus decreased rapidly over time on each of those surfaces. And so the risk of infection from touching them would probably decrease over time as well.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>Find out more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/31/how-long-does-coronavirus-live-on-different-surfaces\">How long does coronavirus live on different surfaces?</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>What do we know about Covid-19 and children?</strong></p> \n<p>Reassuringly for parents, the disease has generally been milder in children, though they can spread it without displaying any symptoms.

The spikes lock on to receptors on the surface of cells lining the human lung allowing the virus to break into the cell. Once inside, it hijacks the cell\u2019s reproductive machinery to produce more copies of itself, before breaking out of the cell again and killing it in the process. The spikes latch on to human cells about four times more strongly than those on the related Sars coronavirus. This suggests that coronavirus particles inhaled through the nose or mouth have a high chance of attaching to cells in the upper respiratory tract, meaning relatively few are needed for an infection to gain a foothold.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>Find out more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/new-study-sheds-light-on-coronavirus-infection-mechanism\">Study sheds light on coronavirus infection mechanism</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>What happens to people\u2019s lungs when they get coronavirus?</strong></p> \n<p>The cough and fever is a result of the infection reaching the air passages that conduct air between the lungs and the outside. The lining of the air passages become injured, causing inflammation. The inflammation can spread throughout the lungs, causing them to fill with liquid, making breathing difficult. The lungs are then unable to get enough oxygen to the bloodstream, which can cause death.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>Find out more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-what-happens-to-peoples-lungs-if-they-get-covid-19\">What happens to people\u2019s lungs when they get coronavirus</a>?</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>Where did the coronavirus originate?</strong></p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/first-covid-19-case-happened-in-november-china-government-records-show-report\">first recorded case of the coronavirus</a> is believed to have emerged in November 2019 in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China. Many of those first affected had worked in or visited the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the city of 11 million people.</p> \n<p><strong>Have there been other coronaviruses?</strong></p> \n<p>Yes. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) were both caused by coronaviruses that made the leap from animals to humans. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750.</p> \n<p><strong>What is the mortality rate of the new coronavirus?</strong></p> \n<p>It is probably about or a bit less than 1%. The rate appears to be as high as 4% from globally confirmed case figures, but it is likely that many mild cases are going undetected. However a 1% mortality rate would still make Covid-19 about 10 times more deadly than seasonal flu, which is estimated to kill between 290,000 and 650,000 people a year globally. The death rate also increases significantly for people over 60.</p> \n<p><strong>Why is it a pandemic and what does that mean?</strong></p> \n<p>A pandemic is declared by WHO when a new disease for which people do not have immunity spreads in multiple countries simultaneously. Declaring a pandemic has nothing to do with changes to the characteristics of the disease or how dangerous it is.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>Find out more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/what-is-a-pandemic-coronavirus-covid-19\">What is a pandemic?</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>When will there be a coronavirus vaccine?</strong></p> \n<p>Currently there is no cure or vaccine for the coronavirus.

  "<p>A top executive at the tabloid publisher behind the National Enquirer said in a private email that he was \u201csaving for my tombstone\u201d the untold story of how the tabloid uncovered a 2019 exclusive about Jeff Bezos\u2019s extramarital relationship, according to a lawsuit against the publisher.</p> <p>The claim raises new questions about how American Media Inc (AMI) discovered the Amazon CEO\u2019s relationship, and how it obtained knowledge of explicit sexual photographs that Bezos, one of the world\u2019s richest men, has alleged were used against him by the publisher for <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">\u201cextortion and blackmail\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The claim by Bezos that he was being blackmailed by AMI is the subject of an FBI investigation.</p> <p>AMI has publicly insisted that it relied on only one source for its salacious scoop about the Bezos affair: Michael Sanchez, who is the brother of Lauren Sanchez, Bezos\u2019s girlfriend.</p> <p>Michael Sanchez was reportedly paid $200,000 by the tabloid for intimate texts and other information about the secret affair, which ultimately led to Bezos\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/30/amazon-jeff-bezos-ex-wife-mackenzie-handed-38bn-in-divorce-settlement\">multi</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/30/amazon-jeff-bezos-ex-wife-mackenzie-handed-38bn-in-divorce-settlement\">billion-dollar divorce from his wife, MacKenzie Bezos</a>.</p> <p>But in a new lawsuit filed in March against AMI, the Enquirer and top AMI executives, Michael Sanchez has accused the company of an elaborate plot to \u201cscapegoat\u201d him, and has cast doubt on the claim that he was the \u201csole source\u201d of all the information and materials the tabloid obtained before it published its stories about the extramarital relationship.</p> <p>Instead, Sanchez has claimed in court documents that the Enquirer publisher relied on multiple sources, including the use of \u201chigh-tech spyware\u201d to secretly hack Bezos\u2019s phone and extract \u201chis most private and confidential information\u201d.</p> <p>Sanchez\u2019s allegations echo claims that have been levelled against AMI by Bezos\u2019s own security team. In a <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeff-bezos-investigation-finds-the-saudis-obtained-his-private-information\">Daily Beast op-ed last year, Gavin De Becker</a>, Bezos\u2019s top security consultant, said he believed that Michael Sanchez had played a relatively minor role in the Enquirer\u2019s story, and compared him to a \u201clow-level Watergate burglar\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cReality is complicated, and can\u2019t always be boiled down to a simple narrative like \u2018the brother did it,\u2019 even when that brother is a person who certainly supplied some information to a supermarket tabloid,\u201d De Becker wrote.</p> <p>It is still far from clear how the supermarket tabloid landed its scoop, and how it obtained information about some \u201cbelow the belt\u201d photographs Bezos sent to Lauren Sanchez while their relationship was still secret.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/21/amazon-boss-jeff-bezoss-phone-hacked-by-saudi-crown-prince\">Jeff Bezos hack: Amazon boss's phone 'hacked by Saudi crown prince'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Guardian reported in January that Bezos, the owner of the Washington Post, had his mobile phone \u201chacked\u201d in 2018 after receiving a WhatsApp message that had apparently been sent from the personal account of the crown prince of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia\">Saudi Arabia</a>, Mohammed bin Salman.</p> <p>The matter is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/22/jeff-bezos-un-calls-for-investigation-into-alleged-saudi-hack\">under investigation by experts at the United Nations</a>. Saudi Arabia has denied it hacked Bezos.</p> <p>In his lawsuit, Michael Sanchez admits having played a role in the Enquirer story, and claims to have done so \u201cstrategically\u201d to minimise fallout for his sister and control the \u201cnarrative\u201d of the story. While he has not denied supplying the tabloid with some of the couple\u2019s private texts , he has denied the allegation that he ever gave AMI sexually explicit photographs.</p> <p>Those photographs have never been published, but Bezos referred to them in an <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">extraordinary blogpost statement</a> on the matter in February 2019, a few weeks after the Enquirer story was published. Bezos claimed in the post that he was the victim of an extortion attempt by AMI.</p> <p>The billionaire executive also published emails from AMI executives which he claimed showed the company threatening to publish sexually explicit photographs \u2013 which it described in detail \u2013 if Bezos did not publicly state that he had \u201cno knowledge or basis for suggesting that AMI\u2019s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces\u201d.</p> <p>At the time Bezos said he had decided to publish the AMI emails \u201cdespite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten\u201d.</p> <p>In his lawsuit, Michael Sanchez described himself as his sister\u2019s \u201cprimary confidant and advisor\u201d when he learned about her relationships with Bezos in March 2018. He said he was introduced to Bezos a month later over dinner, and said he had immediately \u201chit it off\u201d with the billionaire.</p> <p>A preliminary investigation that was commissioned by the Amazon CEO found that it was \u201chighly probable\u201d that an intrusion into Bezos\u2019s mobile phone was triggered after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/21/revealed-the-saudi-heir-and-the-alleged-plot-to-undermine-jeff-bezos\">an infected video file was sent to him over WhatsApp </a>from the account of the Saudi crown prince on 1 May 2018.</p> <p>In his lawsuit, Sanchez has alleged that he was first contacted by the Enquirer about his sister\u2019s affair with Bezos in July 2018, and has claimed \u201con information and belief\u201d that AMI was \u201calready in possession of raunchy text messages and nude selfies exchanged\u201d between Lauren Sanchez and Bezos.</p> <p>Sanchez also referred in his lawsuit to a cryptic email he said was sent by Dylan Howard, AMI\u2019s vice-president, dated 22 January 2019. A person close to the matter said it was a response to a previous email from Sanchez about the Bezos story, which had been published a few weeks earlier.</p> <p>\u201cThe untold story \u2013 if you will \u2013 has not been told as to how we uncovered the story. I\u2019m saving it for my tombstone,\u201d Howard wrote in the email, according to Sanchez\u2019s legal filing.</p> <p>In a statement, AMI denied Sanchez\u2019s allegations. \u201cThe fact, as we have maintained throughout, is that Mr Sanchez sold the National Enquirer the story about his sister\u2019s secret affair and was the sole source for its reporting. His frivolous lawsuit underscores what his true motivation is, his own greed,\u201d the company said.</p> <p>AMI did not respond to multiple requests for comment about Howard\u2019s email or what the executive was referring to.</p> <p>An attorney representing Bezos did not respond to a request for comment.</p>",

  "<p>You may have noticed it\u2019s a lot easier these days to get things \u201cdone\u201d online with government departments. After years of relying on the public to post forms or queue in an office to pick up the right documents, government bodies are now using the cloud to launch services which in the private sector would probably make headlines for being years ahead of their time.</p> <p>Whether it\u2019s filing and paying taxes online, renewing a passport, booking a driving test or registering to vote, online services are instantly and seamlessly connecting citizens with the information and services they need in their daily lives. When they are accessed, users are also finding data is being freed from silos so the latest information is made available and acted on.</p> <p>The Driver and Vehicle Safety Agency (DVSA) is a good example. Deloitte has developed an innovative <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/impact-report-2019/stories/dvsa.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">app</a> for the organisation that allows assessors to check and record all aspects of a vehicle\u2019s safety digitally, reducing processing times and removing the risk of lost paperwork. It can scan licence plates for immediate access to a vehicle\u2019s test history and take and upload photos of any faults. When a vehicle passes, it is certified instantly.</p> <p>This is a classic use-case for cloud technology. Opening up access from any mobile device or location ensures the safe and efficient transfer and processing of safety information, and means enforcement teams out on the roads have up-to-date data at their fingertips, so they can more easily identify unsafe and non-compliant vehicles. And, using only serverless technologies means it\u2019s infinitely scalable and cost effective.</p> <p>Mobile services such as this would not be possible without the cloud. It enables a new way of developing solutions to support business challenges and it frees up an organisation from traditional functions such as hosting and servicing data centres and patching software, allowing services to run via a third-party platform and empowering employees to focus on more value-added functions.</p> <p>According to Kerry Appleton-Norman, partner for public sector cloud at Deloitte, the appeal of this approach comes down mainly to speed, flexibility and, sometimes, cost.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/deloitte-public-sector-in-a-digital-world/2020/apr/06/why-cybersecurity-presents-the-public-sector-with-an-opportunity-to-innovate\">Why cybersecurity presents the public sector with an opportunity to innovate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Moving to the cloud not only saves time on purchasing and managing physical environments, it also opens up access to a suite of software on the internet as a service. It is far quicker to amend these to an organisation\u2019s requirements, rather than have software written from scratch. \u201cTraditional procurement and development processes could take several months, by which time an organisation\u2019s needs may have moved on,\u201d Appleton-Norman explains.</p> <p>By moving to the cloud, Appleton-Norman has found that Deloitte\u2019s public sector clients are able to embrace the pioneering attitude found at exciting startups where new ideas can be tested at breakneck speed.</p> <p>\u201cThe cloud empowers companies to be part of the new wave of fail-fast, agile development,\u201d she says. \u201cWith the cloud you can leverage the necessary storage capacity very quickly and there are usually software packages you can try out and adapt that already work on that platform. The real beauty for organisations is that the technology enables them to get pilot projects set up really quickly. If they work, it\u2019s great, if they don\u2019t, they can be shut down immediately with no extra expense incurred.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23da6eac52c59364007a67d622ab0c900dde114c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23da6eac52c59364007a67d622ab0c900dde114c/0_100_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abstract glowing wave of connected particles on a blue background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A move to the cloud is part of a broader organisational transformation,\u2019 says Kerry Appleton-Norman, partner for public sector cloud at Deloitte.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: piranka/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This flexibility applies to the server space required, too. One of the drawbacks of traditional software development has always been that a server would be commissioned and set up to permanently handle the peak flow of traffic it needs to deal with.</p> <p>\u201cYou would typically end with situations where a computer system was set up to be able to permanently work at maximum performance, but that\u2019s just not necessary all year round,\u201d says Appleton-Norman.</p> <p>\u201cIt works out way too expensive to have that capability available to you all the time when, say, a tax authority only needs to handle their maximum level of traffic around particular deadlines at known times of the year. Most organisations will have peaks that are far more efficiently handled by moving to the cloud where capacity can be dialled up or down as needed, it doesn\u2019t have to be permanently available.\u201d</p> <p>Experience of working with public sector bodies has shown there is more to digital transformation than the project at hand. One of the biggest impacts is a change in how the organisation serves the public and this often changes the roles of employees. For this reason, Appleton-Norman believes they need to be aware of the need for strategy and to consider the knock-on effects of what they are trying to achieve.</p> <p>\u201cMost organisations start out considering the cloud as part of their digital transformation work, they generally want to work more efficiently and provide new frictionless online service to the public,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing they don\u2019t always realise, without guidance, is that the programme will impact their entire organisation, it\u2019s not just about servers and software. If you\u2019re rolling out new interfaces that staff or the public use, you will also need to look at how to best structure your organisation to do this and how to equip your staff with the right skills to execute. A move to the cloud is part of a broader organisational transformation, and organisations need to understand how this will often require a change to the culture of the organisation. How can you support increased collaboration, how do you deal with more focus on the citizen, what are the new roles and responsibilities that are going to be created?\u201d</p> <p>This extra strategic perspective empowers public sector bodies to test and launch innovative services that make citizens\u2019 lives much more convenient while also getting the most out of IT budgets. Forward planning also makes sure that the organisation\u2019s employees are prepared for their changed roles in serving the public in a new way.</p>",
  "<p>Public sector organisations are embracing digital transformation to make it easier for citizens to interact with them. We see the benefits of this in our daily lives, whether it\u2019s filing and paying taxes online, renewing a passport, booking a driving test or registering to vote. Offering services online means they can be provided far quicker and at a lower administrative cost, saving citizens time and helping government bodies to get the most out of finite budgets.</p> <p>However, because the services are now available through a computer or smartphone, there is an inherent risk of hackers gaining access to highly sensitive personal information.</p> <p>The public sector is now realising, as are many private companies, that this means cybersecurity can never be just an afterthought, and nor is it just a means of protecting online services from hackers.</p> <p>Important though that still is, digitally astute public bodies are starting to see cybersecurity as a mindset and a suite of enabling tools that help innovate new services to make life more convenient for the public. They also drive budgetary efficiencies through reduced administration, less paperwork and smoother running IT projects.</p> <p>As Stephen Wray, director of the cyber risk services team at Deloitte, explains, this means public organisations are now embracing cybersecurity as a vital consideration right from the start of a project. \u201cIt used to be a case of building something and then passing it on to the cyber team at the end of a project to see if it was secure,\u201d he says. \u201cToday, though, smart organisations realise they need to build in security-by-design throughout the entire process.\u201d</p> <p>This is not just because compliance has been brought into sharper focus by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which offers members of the public more privacy and greater control over how companies and government departments collect and store their information.</p> <p>In Wray\u2019s opinion, public organisations seeking the best advice will come to see compliance as \u201ca carrot, not a stick\u201d, because by ensuring secure-by-design practice is incorporated from the start to the end of all projects, government services are empowered to deliver optimal features and at the same time provide a defendable position should there be a cybersecurity incident.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/deloitte-public-sector-in-a-digital-world/2020/apr/06/the-switch-to-cloud-how-public-services-are-becoming-more-agile-and-innovative\">The switch to cloud: how public services are becoming more agile and innovative</a> </p> </aside>  <p>People expect any provider of public services to be as flexible as any private company they deal with. Rather than fill in forms and queue in a town hall, they want to press a button on a smartphone to access services. This digital first approach requires a total rethink about how security is applied.</p> <p>\u201cCybersecurity has just got so much bigger. It used to be about securing a clearly defined perimeter,\u201d says Wray. \u201cNow cyber is everywhere. It is foundational and an enabler for all digital technology. Organisations are having to think about the wider picture, often critical systems and key assets are not within an organisation\u2019s control and a significant portion of the value of the organisation rests in its supply chain. They may have computer-controlled devices, such as security cameras or automated doors to a public building, or huge swathes of citizen data managed and maintained by somebody else. Systems are built on systems and things can get complicated very quickly. It is within this complexity that hackers thrive. That\u2019s why you need to start out every project with security in mind from the start.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3df8987d2ab551ab38d711f2f2544bd1309a62d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3df8987d2ab551ab38d711f2f2544bd1309a62d6/141_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Digital identity scanner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Anything that is connected to the internet needs to be secure or it could be used by hackers to get into a system,\u2019 says Deloitte\u2019s Stephen Wray.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: dem10/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Deloitte is finding that embracing this approach of security-by-design is enabling public bodies to turn around the preconception of cybersecurity as an expensive bolt-on to a suite of tools that can actually boost IT efficiency. \u201cWhen organisations build security-by-design into everything they do, they prevent over-specification of the solution and avoid putting in too many features that are often unnecessary, unused and expand the opportunity for vulnerabilities from a security perspective,\u201d says Wray. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that when cyber is built in from the start, public sector bodies don\u2019t overscope, they can get it just right.\u201d</p> <p>And when they get it right, they achieve two huge strategic goals at the same time. Not only do they protect citizens\u2019 data and help maintain the public\u2019s trust in government services, they also keep pace with the public\u2019s expectations for how they should be empowered to interact with those services. Rather than get left behind, the public sector can be at the forefront of designing innovative services.</p> <p>\u201cPeople want to use the latest, smartest products and services, but they can\u2019t unless they\u2019re safe,\u201d says Wray. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what new technology can do, it\u2019s only of use if it can be made secure for the public to enjoy. That\u2019s what makes cybersecurity such an exciting, enabling capability. Without it, you couldn\u2019t launch anything new without risking the trust customers have in you.\u201d</p> <p>There is still work to be done, however, in demonstrating the value of cybersecurity to public bodies. Deloitte <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/public-sector/articles/governments-technology-transformation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">research</a> has discovered that public sector organisations often fear technology will be too expensive, and only one in five public sector workers (19%) feel that their organisation is in line or ahead of private sector organisations when asked about technology adoption. And almost half of civil servants reported they are not sure, or are not confident, their organisation could deal with a cyber-attack.</p> <p>Wray cautions that government bodies must not only work on the technology but also the people within their organisations. \u201cPeople can be your strongest link,\u201d says Wray. A user-enabled security approach means that well-trained and cyber savvy workers can contribute to the overall security posture of the organisation. A single compromised computer could provide a path to a treasure trove of citizen data. But healthy password use, security policy adoption and being able to identify and report phishing will counter some of the most prevalent and common attack vectors.</p> <p>Getting the people focus right and embracing cybersecurity throughout the life cycle of any new service is essential. When combined, these measures allow the public sector to delight citizens with convenient, slick new ways of accessing services that they might have previously only imagined was possible through a Silicon Valley startup.</p>",
  "<p>When he completed Images, in 1971, Robert Altman <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=T8e0xl5vtFAC&amp;pg=RA4-PA30&amp;lpg=RA4-PA30&amp;dq=Everyone+is+just+going+to+flip+over+this+film.+It%E2%80%99s+going+to+be+the+greatest+discovery+since+hash&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6W4B0IW_uX&amp;sig=ACfU3U01QnZQw60NRHwdIVHHu1Ode782sQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiHh9Hg18zoAhXqlnIEHaR6D6wQ6AEwAHoECAYQKA#v=onepage&amp;q=Everyone%20is%20just%20going%20to%20flip%20over%20this%20film.%20It%E2%80%99s%20going%20to%20be%20the%20greatest%20discovery%20since%20hash&amp;f=false\">thought to himself</a>: \u201cEveryone is just going to flip over this film.

Partly that\u2019s because this strange, elegant psychological horror doesn\u2019t feel like a Robert Altman film at all. Think of Altman and you think of his orchestrated ensemble pieces \u2013 Nashville, Short Cuts, The Player, Gosford Park \u2013 or his earlier, New Hollywood genre reinventions: McCabe And Mrs Miller or The Long Goodbye. Between those last two came Images, set in a remote Irish country house, and closer in spirit to Bergman\u2019s Persona or Polanski\u2019s Repulsion.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/03/breakdown-film-1997-kurt-russell-my-streaming-gem\">My streaming gem: why you should watch Breakdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Images takes us into the fractured psyche of Cathryn, a children\u2019s author played by Susannah York. We find her alone in her apartment, narrating passages from her new book \u2013 a fantasy tale of unicorns and magical lands with funny names (York actually wrote and published this book in real life). Late at night, Cathryn receives a phone call from a woman who sounds mysteriously like herself, informing her that her husband, Hugh, is with another woman. When Hugh (Altman regular Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois) returns he begins kissing Cathryn, but suddenly, he changes into another man, and Cathryn recoils, horrified. Deciding they need a break, they flee their chic city apartment and drive to their country house that night. But once there, things become ever stranger, as Cathryn struggles to separate illusion and reality.</p> <p>The other man turns out to be Rene, Cathryn\u2019s former lover, who died three years ago. There is a third man, Marcel, a neighbour who also seems to have been Cathryn\u2019s lover at some point. Marcel has a teenage daughter (Cathryn Harrison, granddaughter of Rex), whom Cathryn takes under her wing, recognising something of herself in her \u2013 not a good sign under the circumstances. The identities of these three men seem to switch around, so we\u2019re never quite sure which one is which. She\u2019ll be talking to Rene one moment, but in the next shot, it\u2019s actually Hugh. To complicate matters further, Cathryn also sees another version of herself from time to time.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCEdP2ObHGA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BCEdP2ObHGA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Deepening her plight is the fact that all three men are, to some extent, assholes. Hugh in particular is a classic 70s man: patronising and insensitive, likes photography and shooting game, tells terrible jokes, wears driving gloves even when he\u2019s not driving. Rene seems intent on rekindling their relationship, despite being dead. And lecherous Marcel, who has recently separated from his wife, is constantly trying to grope her. You can hardly blame Cathryn for wanting to kill one or more of them, and let\u2019s just say there will be blood, but which one is which? Does it matter anyway?</p> <p>True to Altman\u2019s style, there\u2019s an unshowy, improvisatory naturalism to the performances. Despite being a man, Altman clearly identifies with his female lead, and York is magnificent, the cracks in her poised demeanour steadily widening as sexual guilt, male predation and mental illness take hold (she won best actress at Cannes for this performance). Added to which, her outfits are a 70s fashion style guide. But there\u2019s still a creepy, fairytale horror feel to the whole exercise. Vilmos Zsigmond\u2019s roving, impressionistic photography lends the film a dreamlike quality \u2013 all tinkling wind chimes and rain-streaked windows and fractured reflections, not to mention some rich exterior scenes in the autumnal Irish countryside. The score, too, is a strange mix of dissonant orchestral swells and percussive stabs. It was composed by John Williams, of all people, with help from Japanese prog musician Stomu Yamashta.</p> <p>Despite the Cannes award, the film received a mixed critical reception and had a botched release, which explains its relative obscurity. Altman himself judged the film to be a little heavy-handed in retrospect (he went on to rework similar themes in his better known 1977 movie Three Women), but Images stands up far better than most of its contemporaries. Not quite the greatest discovery since hash, but an intoxicating watch all the same.</p> <ul> <li><p>Images is available to stream on Amazon Prime in both the UK and US.</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>When Olfert Landt first heard about a novel virus ravaging parts of China, he sprung into action, and by the 10 January, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-12/a-berlin-biotech-company-got-a-head-start-on-coronavirus-tests?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=businessweek&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-businessweek&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic\">according to Bloomberg</a>, the microbiologist, working with researchers at Berlin\u2019s Charit\u00e9 hospital, had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-testing-how-some-countries-germany-south-korea-got-ahead-of-the-rest\">developed a viable test for the disease</a>. </p> <p>TIB Molbiol Syntheselabor GmbH, the small company Landt leads, had produced more than 4 million tests by 12<sup> </sup>March. It\u2019s the kind of story that has fuelled claims that Germany\u2019s strong biotech industry has provided the country with a unique advantage in combating the coronavirus. Donald Trump retweeted the Bloomberg story about Landt. The UK\u2019s health minister, Matt Hancock, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-matt-hancock-sets-goal-of-100000-tests-per-day-by-end-of-april-video\">held his first press conference</a> on Thursday after recovering from coronavirus himself, didn\u2019t mention Landt, but he was quick to point to the strength of the German pharmaceutical industry as the primary reason for the country\u2019s aggressive testing regime and low death rate: \u201cMy German counterpart, for instance,\u201d Hancock said, \u201ccould call upon 100 test labs ready and waiting when the crisis stuck, thanks in large part to Roche, one of the biggest diagnostic companies in the world.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to understand why the UK, in particular, is feeling defensive: while Germany has tested nearly a million samples for Covid-19, the UK, <a href=\"https://www.abpi.org.uk/facts-and-figures/global-pharmaceutical-market/shares-of-the-global-pharmaceutical-markets/\">according to data</a> from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, has tested just 152,979 people for the Corona virus according to the Department of Health and Social Care has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DHSCgovuk/status/1246791324231176193\">tested just 195,524 people</a> up until yesterday morning.</p> <p>But Hancock\u2019s attempt to attribute Germany\u2019s success to a strong biotech sector rings false. The four million tests produced by Landt\u2019s company have been distributed throughout the world. Indeed, the biochemist told <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/de/corona-tests-maschinen-auf-hochtouren/a-52853100\">Deutsche Welle</a> that he would like to start delivering tests to Russia, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Iran \u2013 countries that are currently under embargo. </p> <p>For all its might in the industry, Germany\u2019s output is dwarfed by the scale of the US pharmaceutical industry: Germany <a href=\"https://www.abpi.org.uk/facts-and-figures/global-pharmaceutical-market/shares-of-the-global-pharmaceutical-markets/\">captured </a><a href=\"https://www.abpi.org.uk/facts-and-figures/global-pharmaceutical-market/shares-of-the-global-pharmaceutical-markets/\">4.01% of global pharmaceutical sales in 2016</a>, whereas the US controlled 44.45% of the market in the same year, and the UK captured 2.35%. Indeed, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoffmann-La_Roche\">Hoffmann-La Roche</a>, the company to which Hancock seems to have attributed the strength of the German testing infrastructure, is Swiss, not German.</p> <p>Hancock\u2019s errors disguise inconvenient truths about the German situation. Though Roche has developed tests and manufactures equipment, it is laboratories at universities, hospitals and government agencies that have taken the lead in testing for Covid-19 in Germany. Private laboratories have played a crucial role in Germany\u2019s testing regime, but big business has not; according to statistics compiled by <a href=\"https://www.alm-ev.de/files/site-files/03%20Downloads/08%20Praesentationen/2019/190123%20ALM-Labore-in-Deutschland.pdf\">Akkredierte Labore in der Medizin</a>, a trade group for the medical diagnostics industry, the six largest private providers of Covid-19 tests together account for 36% of the laboratories currently testing in Germany. Indeed, the distributed nature of the German response can be seen in the rapid increase in the number of facilities doing testing. Between 2 and 8 March, 43 laboratories conducted 36,067 tests. Last week, 97 laboratories conducted 313,957 tests.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t an accident that, unlike the UK, Germany has had such success in engaging a wide network of laboratories to conduct Covid-19 testing. The country\u2019s federal system has long assigned the national government to a coordinating role, and regional autonomy over large parts of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/the-guardian-view-on-the-uks-testing-failure-much-to-learn-from-germany\">healthcare system</a> may have helped to create more resilient systems, better able to coordinate the work of different laboratories.</p> <p>Even as the country\u2019s more distributed healthcare system has helped to spread the burden of testing more evenly, a strong bureaucratic state has stepped in to help coordinate testing, containment and treatment efforts. In Bavaria, teachers and other furloughed state employees have been <a href=\"https://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/coronavirus-bayern-hotline-lehrer-beamte-gesundheitsamt-1.4864668\">reassigned to service</a> at the health departments, where they help to coordinate the logistics of the response.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/1918-flu-pandemic-coronavirus-drug-trials-scientists-treatments-evidence\">What the 1918 flu pandemic can teach us about coronavirus drug trials | Laura Spinney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite the success of Germany\u2019s response to the pandemic so far, <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/de/epidemiologe-kurth-corona-zahlen-sind-nicht-vergleichbar/a-52972246\">many</a> <a href=\"https://www.sueddeutsche.de/gesundheit/coronavirus-zahlen-statistik-1.4864439\">voices</a> in the country have called for caution. The virus seems to have gained a foothold relatively late here, which has allowed for a more coordinated response than would have been possible in Italy or China. Even so, and despite aggressive testing, it is still entirely possible that the number of cases will spike, overwhelming the healthcare system and leading to much higher mortality.</p> <p>Still, if current trends continue, Germany will have shown itself to be uniquely capable among western nations of dealing with a global pandemic. The huge number of tests and its low mortality rate can be attributed to a number of different factors \u2013 <strong> </strong>the<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/03/20/dissecting-germanys-low-coronavirus-death-rate.html\">relative youth of many people</a> infected by the virus and <a href=\"https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/coronavirus-in-europa-letalitaet-in-deutschland-30-mal-niedriger-als-in-italien-wie-ist-das-moeglich/25626678.html\">potential underreporting especially</a><strong> </strong>\u2013<strong> </strong>but the country\u2019s proximity to a major Swiss biotech firm is very low among them indeed.

  "<p>Michael Sheen is at home in south Wales, looking out on his garden. The sun catches the side of his face, lighting up his scraggly hair and beard. \u201cWe\u2019re very lucky to have a garden to go out in. I know not everybody does,\u201d he says. In the current climate of famous people churning out endless videos of their isolation struggles from the side of a pool in a mansion, it\u2019s a telling sentiment.</p> <p>A few years ago, after a successful stage and screen career, the actor, 51, \u201crefocused\u201d his life <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/dec/17/michael-sheen-to-swap-acting-for-activism-against-populist-right\">away from entertainment towards community work and activism</a>, and moved back to Wales from Los Angeles. He had been living there for much of the past two decades, to be near his eldest daughter, Lily (her mother is the actor Kate Beckinsale, and they remain close). \u201cAnd then when my daughter was 18 and went off to a life of her own, I realised: \u2018Oh, I can go home again now.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He has a new daughter, six-month-old Lyra, with the Swedish actor Anna Lundberg, and the baby burbles away in the background as we speak. Having a young child has given him a sense of routine during the current crisis. He went on Newsnight recently, to talk about clapping for the NHS, which he called \u201cthat wonder of the world\u201d. The presenter, Emma Barnett, asked him for an isolation coping tip. \u201cAnd I said well \u2026 the baby has a routine, and I\u2019ve found that that\u2019s helping us. And then I noticed that somebody said that was an example of my condescending class-blind privilege,\u201d he says, smiling, and shakes his head.</p> <p>Sheen grew up in Port Talbot and there is a long history of showbiz in the family. His great great grandmother was an elephant- and lion-tamer, and his father spent some time as a Jack Nicholson impersonator. How does he define himself, in terms of class? \u201cGod, I\u2019m not really sure,\u201d he says, \u201cI came from a working-class town, my family was a working-class family, for generations. My dad got a job in middle management at a certain point, and I suppose that took us up a step. My mum worked as a secretary, my grandmother was a cleaner at the local police station. But then I went off and became a successful actor. Middle class, I guess?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a605735cbc6ce877510fc2047bba533666a322c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a605735cbc6ce877510fc2047bba533666a322c/0_159_3096_1857/1000.jpg\" alt=\"As Brian Clough in The Damned United.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As Brian Clough in The Damned United.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sony Pics/Everett/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Sheen feels a strong connection to the community he grew up in. \u201cMore and more as I\u2019ve got older, it\u2019s been that which has guided the choices I\u2019ve made, about what it is I want to do with the privilege and the resources that I do have,\u201d he says. </p> <p>Moving back to Wales changed his life considerably. He set up a production company, Red Seam, to develop specifically Welsh stories. \u201cWe have these incredibly big productions coming over here and using our locations and infrastructure and talent,\u201d he says, \u201cbut those stories are not about Wales.\u201d Sheen has so far managed to avoid the criticism faced by many famous people when they \u201cget political\u201d, probably because he isn\u2019t paying lip service to it. He really is there, doing the work.</p> <p>Acting was supposed to be on the back burner, yet Sheen has continued to appear on screen. Over the past couple of years, he has been in Good Omens, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/14/the-good-fight-cbs-tv-drama\">The Good Fight</a> and the US drama Prodigal Son. \u201cI\u2019ve actually ended up spending the last six months in New York working, which is not what I intended,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when I gave all my money away, I suddenly had to go and earn money again.\u201d</p> <p>He says he gave all of his money away to bring the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/13/actor-michael-sheen-hosts-homeless-world-cup-in-cardiff\">Homeless World Cup to Cardiff</a> last summer. With eight weeks to go until the big charity event, \u201csomeone completely fucked us over\u201d, says Sheen, leaving him with two weeks to come up with enough money to keep it afloat (event organisers have said it costs <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-49168731\">\u00a32m a year</a> to put on). \u201cFive hundred of the most vulnerable people from all over the world [were] on their way to Cardiff, for a tournament that was potentially transformative and life-changing. And so,\u201d he says, as if it were the easiest decision in the world, \u201cI gave all my money to it.\u201d He will be paying it off for years, he adds, cheerfully, which explains why he\u2019s working in the US again, on Prodigal Son. But, he says, tactfully: \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m forcing myself to do it. It\u2019s a great job.\u201d</p> <p>Soon, Sheen will return to British television, playing Chris Tarrant in Quiz, a three-part adaptation of the James Graham play that tells the story of the infamous \u201ccoughing major\u201d cheating scandal on Who Wants To Be a Millionaire. Its director, Stephen Frears, got in touch to see if Sheen would be interested in playing Tarrant. \u201cLike most people, I felt like I\u2019d seen those episodes. Then I subsequently discovered they never got transmitted, so nobody had seen those episodes,\u201d he says. I\u2019m shocked. \u201cITV rushed out a documentary about it, literally the next week or something like that. So people think they\u2019ve seen it, but actually what they saw was the documentary, which was certainly true in my case.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hAIGa2IQOY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9hAIGa2IQOY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Sheen is well-known for playing real people: Brian Clough in The Damned United, David Frost in Frost/Nixon, Kenneth Williams in Fantabulosa! and Tony Blair, three times, in The Deal, The Queen and The Special Relationship. Is there a sense that whoever is casting Sheen has seen something of that real person in him?</p> <p>\u201cI suppose I have to assume that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just, oh, Michael does real people, let\u2019s get him in to play whoever. When I look at all the real people I have played, the majority of them tend to be quite flashy. If you wanted to be ungenerous, you could say there\u2019s a bit of surface razzle-dazzle covering over slightly more questionable qualities. Not that I\u2019m saying that\u2019s Tarrant,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut that kind of frontman, the person who has lots of apparent confidence and ease.\u201d</p> <p>He has always chosen not to meet the people he will play. \u201cOnce you meet someone,\u2019 he says, \u201cinevitably you want to take responsibility for them. And no matter how it goes, if you really get on with each other and you really like a person, inevitably you will shy away from certain things.\u201d He did end up meeting Tarrant, a couple of days after he had finished filming Quiz. \u201cJust coincidentally, I bumped into him at the Pride of Britain awards. I was having a photograph taken, and I heard a voice going\u201d \u2013 he slips into an impeccable Tarrant \u2013 \u201c\u2018You don\u2019t look anything like me.\u2019 And there was Chris Tarrant.\u201d</p> <p>Just before he started work on The Special Relationship, which came out in 2010, he met Blair for the first time. By that point, he had already played him twice, and felt comfortable enough to meet him. \u201cHe was very wary of me,\u201d Sheen recalls. \u201cIt was interesting because he\u2019s clearly someone who is very socially charming and engaging, and clearly wants the social interaction to go well.\u201d He knew this anyway, he says, from all the research and work he had done. \u201cBut I could see that actively happening, at the same time as this other part of him was going: \u2018Hang on, this guy might be copying me.\u2019 There was an odd dynamic there. Also, it was very peculiar circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>This turns out to be an understatement. \u201cIt was at the Murdoch residence in Los Angeles,\u201d he begins. He had been introduced to Wendi Murdoch, as she was at the time, at a charity event in New York. \u201cAnd someone had said to her, that\u2019s the guy who plays Blair. And she got very excited about this. She said: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m having a dinner for Tony soon, you must come.\u2019\u201d His curiosity about meeting Blair got the better of him. \u201cIt took a little while for it to dawn on me: oh, but it\u2019s going to be at Rupert Murdoch\u2019s house,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d9251638cd985d94fcb3e164a7f501bbfb634678\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9251638cd985d94fcb3e164a7f501bbfb634678/0_45_3225_1934/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sheen as Tony Blair in The Queen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheen as Tony Blair in The Queen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: c Miramax/Everett/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before the party, Wendi had emailed. \u201cShe would get in touch with me and say, maybe you could make your hair look like him? Maybe you could dress like him, and we could hide you, and bring you out, and surprise him? I remember writing back to her in an email and going: \u2018I don\u2019t want to put anyone in an uncomfortable position, so I think we should just leave it.\u2019 I thought, she\u2019s going to have me jumping out of a cake or something.\u201d</p> <p>She told him not to worry, and to come along anyway. He drove to the party, in the Hollywood Hills. \u201cSuddenly I found myself face-to-face with Tony Blair,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd he found himself face-to-face with me, with a group of people suddenly around us, and Wendi Murdoch saying: \u2018Tony? It\u2019s you!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Another guest asked Blair if he thought Sheen\u2019s portrayals had been accurate. Blair replied that he had not watched any of the films. \u201cWhen people dispersed and it was just me and him, he started talking in fairly minute detail about individual scenes,\u201d says Sheen. Before they sat down to eat, he had an encounter with Rupert Murdoch himself. \u201cThere was a very peculiar moment with Murdoch. I remember standing looking out at the view, and then I realised that Murdoch was standing next to me. It was quite a hot day. I just remember seeing a little bead of black dye, running down his face.\u201d He drags a finger from his forehead down the side of his cheek. \u201cI thought, oh, Ozymandias.\u201d</p> <p>Sheen is fascinated by Blair\u2019s legacy now, by how his personal popularity has been shredded and how deep divisions about that era continue to rage within the Labour party. But the relationship he has with the real people he has played is a strange one. \u201cObviously, Blair is someone I played the most,\u201d says Sheen. \u201cIt feels like a very long time ago now so it\u2019s not quite the same, but I still can\u2019t quite trust what I feel. Because there\u2019s still a little bit of me that when I see him or read about him that I\u2019m sort of seeing myself. That\u2019s a weird thing to have.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to the current prime minister, he is less ambivalent. \u201cI don\u2019t know [Johnson], I\u2019ve never met him,\u201d says Sheen. \u201cBut my fear is that he\u2019s someone that it\u2019s all a game to. It\u2019s very hard to avoid the feeling that he\u2019s still playing games in a common room at his school. Aside from being totally opposite to his politics anyway, just as a personality, it\u2019s all a game, it\u2019s all about winning the debate, the empty debate. There\u2019s no real heart there, there\u2019s no real commitment there, to anything.\u201d</p> <p>Sheen finds the existence of the two versions of Johnson\u2019s column on Brexit, one arguing for remain, and one arguing for leave, particularly abhorrent. \u201cOne of the most consequential and divisive things in our cultural life, and the man who was at the forefront of it could have gone either way, really.\u201d He says this as if still astonished by it. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to trust someone who can go so easily in different ways.\u201d</p> <p>Sheen has done so much political work, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/mar/20/michael-sheen-launches-campaign-against-high-cost-lenders\">campaigning to end high-cost credit agreements</a> to trying to help find a solution to the crisis in local journalism, that he is often asked if he harbours political ambitions.</p> <p>\u201cI think my condescending class-blind privilege is getting in the way, to be honest,\u201d he says, smiling. Since he moved back to Wales and focused on community work, he has realised it is no longer enough to simply tell people what they are doing wrong. \u201cI\u2019m part of now trying to come up with a better way, rather than just criticising the way other people are doing things,\u201d he says. \u201cI have to work with people that I really disagree with, or I have to try and find a way to compromise or find a way forward with people who you really don\u2019t agree with.\u201d</p> <p>As the situation stands, Sheen does not have to toe any party line. \u201cI could walk away from it all, whenever I want, and I\u2019d be fine, and there\u2019s a strength in that,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019d gain by giving that up, right now.\u201d So he has no interest in running for office? \u201cI used to say, there\u2019s only one community that I feel that I could in any way justify representing, and that\u2019s the community that I grew up in, and that position is already taken.\u201d It\u2019s taken by Stephen Kinnock, MP for Aberavon. \u201cBut of course, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/29/stephen-kinnock-targeted-by-police-for-visiting-father-neil\">he might be arrested for visiting his father</a>, so that role might become vacant very soon,\u201d Sheen says. He is joking, though part of me hopes he might one day take the idea of Michael Sheen MP seriously, after all.</p> <p><em>Part one of Quiz is on at 9pm on 13 April on ITV</em></p>",

Whether it was heartbreaking or petty, there was a sense of relief to having been asked, she says.</p> <p>One woman wrote a seven-page \u201cessay\u201d about the difficulties she was experiencing with her husband. \u201cShe was just so thankful that someone was opening up a space to talk about relationship issues during quarantine,\u201d says Zukin. \u201cPeople were definitely looking for a place to vent.\u201d</p> <p>Another woman, a teacher, wrote that her husband was so worried about contracting coronavirus from her, he had moved in with his mother. \u201cThe impact on people\u2019s personal lives \u2013 it\u2019s almost overwhelming to think about,\u201d says Zukin.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like a lot of people feel as though their personal anxieties or fights with their partner or family member are not important and they should just be grateful that they have a place to live \u2013 but it\u2019s not nothing, just because it\u2019s not top-billed news.\u201d</p> <p>In that first flood following her tweet, Zukin received some 500 messages. When her friends started asking for the juiciest stories she\u2019d been told, she realised that there was a market for them.</p> <p>With permission, Zukin brought together their stories anonymously in a Google document \u2013 then requested a small donation in exchange for the link to access it.</p> <p>From an average donation of US $1, she has <a href=\"https://www.thesocialdistanceproject.org/donations\">raised</a> almost $9,000 for food banks, housing support and Covid-19 relief.</p> <p>Though the rate of giving has slowed, Zukin continues to be sent slices of life from strangers in lockdown, which she shares on The Social Distance\u2019s website and Instagram account, which now has 15,000 followers. \u201cI don\u2019t really see the project slowing down, as long as we\u2019re still in isolation,\u201d she says.</p> <p>One man, while browsing the \u201cwonderful project\u201d, realised he was reading about his own <a href=\"https://www.thesocialdistanceproject.org/stories/quarantined-with-my-shitty-boyfriend\">infidelity</a> \u2013 then submitted <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-bTvpGpR19/\">his own follow-up</a>, about sharing \u201ca break-up cake\u201d with his now ex-girlfriend.</p> <p>Zukin\u2019s aim now is to create a sense of community, in spite of quarantine \u2013 \u201cjust reminding people they\u2019re not alone during this\u201d. Plus, Zukin points out: shut in our homes, away from our friends and coworkers, we might be feeling a little starved of gossip right now.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019re all fascinated by other people\u2019s business \u2026 When not much is going on in your day, there\u2019s only so much to say or do.\u201d</p> <p>But it has not been just the drama that has registered. A 68-year-old woman wrote <a href=\"https://www.thesocialdistanceproject.org/stories/a-tale-in-two-parts\">this week</a> about how her husband of almost 50 years had come across their old love letters. \u201cFor the next hour or so he would run in with another letter, I would read it, and we would laugh and reminisce about how young and in love we were,\u201d she wrote, of the \u201cmoment of togetherness, caused by the Covid-19 shutdown\u201d.</p> <p>Zukin says readers have responded well to such positive stories. \u201cAt first I was thinking that misery loves company, but \u2026 it\u2019s about feeling connected when we are physically isolated.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The government has been accused of missing an opportunity after it failed to deploy 5,000 contact tracing experts employed by councils to help limit the spread of coronavirus.</p> <p>Environmental health workers in local government have wide experience in contact tracing, a process used to prevent infections spreading and routinely carried out in outbreaks such as of norovirus, salmonella or legionnaires\u2019 disease. But a spokesperson for Public Health England (PHE), which leads on significant outbreaks, said the organisation did not call upon environmental health workers to carry out contact tracing for coronavirus, instead using its own local health protection teams.</p> <p>According to the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health the UK has, at a conservative estimate, 5,000 environmental health officers working in local councils nationwide.</p> <p>The institute\u2019s Northern Ireland director, Gary McFarlane, said government health bodies \u201cabsolutely should be drawing on the skills set of EHOs [environmental health officers] and if they aren\u2019t, it\u2019s a missed opportunity\u201d. He said: \u201cThere is significant capacity that is sitting there for this kind of work to be done.\u201d</p> <p>PHE\u2019s contact tracing response team was boosted to just under 300 staff, deemed adequate for the containment phase of handling the Covid-19 virus up to mid-March. In that time the team, working around the clock, traced 3,500 people and supported the 3% of contacts found to be infected to self-isolate. Tracing was scaled back when the UK moved to the delay phase of tackling coronavirus in mid-March. It is now carried out in limited form, mainly for vulnerable communities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/recruit-volunteer-army-to-trace-coronavirus-contacts-now-urge-top-scientists\">Recruit volunteer army to trace Covid-19 contacts now, urge top scientists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An environmental health worker for a council in Scotland, who does not want to be named, said: \u201cIf councils had been given the go-ahead from the start, they could have put plans in place and now have a much flatter curve.\u201d Another, with decades of experience, said he was \u201cstruggling to figure out\u201d why this was not the case.</p> <p>One environmental health worker for a north-western council said his team were expecting a call at the start of the coronavirus outbreak. He said: \u201cWe are pretty good at infection control and contact tracing, it\u2019s part of the job. We thought we\u2019d be asked and were shelving other work.\u201d</p> <p>Environmental health workers have recently been tasked with ensuring the public stick to social distancing rules. They have also been monitoring takeaways and food deliveries. Environment health departments have, like other areas of local government, suffered austerity cuts since 2010.</p> <p>Contact tracing involves getting in touch with everyone an infected person might have seen and asking them to self-isolate in an effort to contain the virus.</p> <p>The government decision to all but abandon contact tracing is not consistent with WHO guidelines, which urge a test-and-trace approach. At a WHO media briefing on Covid-19 in March, director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: \u201cTracing every contact must be the backbone of the response in every country.\u201d</p> <p>The approach has been carried out in other countries, including Ireland, Germany, South Korea and Singapore. In Germany, thousands of contact tracers are still working \u2013 with more being recruited \u2013 in part clearing a backlog of infections that occurred before the nation\u2019s shutdown measures, according to Dr Philipp Zanger , head of the Institute of Hygiene, Infection Control and Prevention at the Rhineland-Palatinate agency for consumer and public protection.</p> <p>Contact tracing is also used to prepare to tackle any outbreaks when the lockdown is eased, since \u201conce we let ourselves out again, we will see more transmission again,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The UK government approach is understood to be that once virus infection numbers have tipped, manual contact tracing is unworkable, while social distancing and self-isolation measures reproduce much of its effect.</p> <p>But Anthony Costello, professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London, said giving up on it was a mistake. \u201cYou still need to do it,\u201d he said, highlighting regions where infection numbers were relatively small. \u201cIn low-intensity areas you could ramp up your testing \u2026 use all your people to jump on it.\u201d</p> <p>Environmental health officers say that as well as helping to slow the spread of a virus, tracing could provide information on how it spreads and, if successful in containing outbreaks in specific areas, could help direct healthcare resources.</p> <p>The UK, US and Germany are developing smartphone apps to help trace coronavirus infections to ease national lockdowns. Versions of this technology have been used in South Korea and Singapore. Initial reports suggest the UK app would operate on a voluntary basis, while there are privacy concerns around the security of health and location data provided.</p> <p>A PHE spokesperson said that contact tracing was no longer useful because \u201cwith such a level of sustained community transmission there is limited value in doing so\u201d.</p>",

The majority of art galleries and museums.</p> <p>The arts minister, Paul Fletcher, argues that arts organisations affected by the restrictions can apply for the government\u2019s jobkeeper package \u2013 indeed, he wrote in a <a href=\"https://minister.infrastructure.gov.au/fletcher/media-release/jobkeeper-payment-keep-spotlights-shining-arts-sector\">media release</a> that the stimulus could total billions of dollars across the cultural sector when finally totted up. \u201cMost organisations in the arts sector are expected to meet the eligibility requirement of revenue having fallen by 30% or more, given that performances have been suspended and venues closed,\u201d Fletcher\u2019s statement notes.</p> <p>This is scant consolation for the organisations that lost their funding late last week. The jobkeeper package is not even legislated yet, and there are many questions as to how it might apply.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are now throwing nationally significant arts companies to the wolves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Why would the Australia Council slash arts funding during the worst crisis in Australian culture in a century?</p> <p>The answers are depressingly familiar. The current funding round is the tortuous outcome of years of creeping austerity levelled on the Australia Council by successive Coalition governments. The pain began in Joe Hockey\u2019s first budget of 2014, and was followed by the notorious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jul/04/australias-arts-funding-crisis-george-brandis-one-man-show\">\u201cExcellence Fund\u201d raid</a> sortied by George Brandis, in which $105 million was ripped out of the Australia Council to pay for a parallel funding program dreamed up by the former arts minister in a flight of vainglory.</p> <p>Some of the excellence funding was eventually returned, but in real terms Australia Council funding has declined by nearly 20% since Labor left office in 2013.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/dec/06/lumping-the-arts-portfolio-in-with-infrastructure-is-retrograde-and-unimaginative\">Lumping the arts portfolio in with infrastructure is retrograde and unimaginative | Esther Anatolitis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To compound matters, most of the Australia Council\u2019s funding is quarantined for a group of larger performing arts companies co-funded with the states and territories, known as the Major Performing Arts organisations. These big companies, such as Opera Australia, the Australian Ballet, and the various state orchestras and theatre companies, soak up three-fifths of the Australia Council\u2019s total budget. There simply isn\u2019t much funding left to go round.</p> <p>The dilemma is made even more painful by the fact the smaller companies (often known as the \u201csmall-to-medium\u201d sector) have double the audiences of the majors, and produce around four times as much work each year. However, they get about a quarter of the funding.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is enough money to fund Australian culture properly, of course. It\u2019s simply a matter of political will</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a result, the Australia Council has been left in an invidious situation. As a matter of policy, it is not allowed to take money from the major companies. But it doesn\u2019t have the money to fund the small-to-medium sector properly.</p> <p>The inevitable result was Friday\u2019s bloodbath.</p> <p>For a lover of culture, going over the list of who missed out is shocking. Companies of the calibre of La Mama, Australian Theatre for Young People, Polyglot, Liquid Architecture, Australian Book Review, Overland, Information and Cultural Exchange, the Sydney Writers festival, St Martins, Restless Dance Theatre, The Blue Room Theatre, Barking Gekko, the Sydney Review of Books and Ensemble Offspring are some of the most significant cultural organisations in the country. There can be no pretence that they have failed to win funding because they lack merit. They aren\u2019t getting funding because there isn\u2019t enough money.</p> <p>There <em>is</em> enough money to fund Australian culture properly, of course. It\u2019s simply a matter of political will. While the Australia Council\u2019s annual budget is less than $200 million, <strong> </strong>the government has announced economic stimulus measures worth nearly $200 <em>billion</em> in recent weeks. Yes, some cultural organisations will benefit from the stimulus measures. But we are now throwing nationally significant arts companies to the wolves.</p> <p>Aren\u2019t there bigger priorities than arts funding in a pandemic, you might ask? Yes, of course there are. Everyone in Australian culture agrees that social distancing is necessary and that the festivals and theatres must shut. No one argues that arts funding should take priority over hospitals. But surely we can now agree that culture matters too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/27/in-times-of-crisis-we-turn-to-the-arts-now-the-arts-is-in-crisis-and-the-federal-government-is-missing-in-action\">In times of crisis, we turn to the arts.

Why, even in an emergency, can\u2019t we find the money to fund a couple of hundred of the most important arts organisations in the country properly?</p> <p>The answers are both complex, and simple. Historical precedent, conservative antipathy to arts funding, and enduring beliefs that artists are not really deserving and that culture is not a real industry all play a part.</p> <p>But the simpler explanation is a failure of imagination.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Ben Eltham is an Australian writer</em></p>",

It is a less toxic version of chloroquine, another malaria drug, which itself is related to quinine, an ingredient in tonic water.</li> \n   <li>Like many drugs, hydroxychloroquine comes with a number of potential side-effects. These include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, weight loss and mood changes. </li> \n   <li>A sudden surge in demand for hydroxychloroquine risks shortages of the drug for those who need it most. Hydroxychloroquine is able to keep lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease, in check but some people with the condition have complained they are now unable to find Plaquenil. Trump\u2019s pushing of the treatment has caused many Americans, whether they need it or not, to stock up on the drug.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8a65e88f08c9eaf0daf04c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T23:13:24.910Z\">12.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>US president Donald Trump opened tonight\u2019s White House briefing with well wishes for UK PM Boris Johnson. </p> \n  <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a great friend of mine,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m sure he is going to be fine, he\u2019s a strong man, a strong person.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8a65658f08c35a1d11a814\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarahboseley\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T23:11:14.340Z\">12.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Johnson\u2019s hospital admission suggests virus may have progressed</h2> \n  <p>Most people recover from Covid-19 within a week and cannot even be certain they had it, as they probably won\u2019t be tested.

Spain has recorded 130,759 confirmed cases, according to the health ministry. </p> \n  <p>The latest data suggests the growth in the number of infections has slowed to around 5% \u2013 the smallest increase seen since officials began tracking the outbreak. The actual number of cases in the country, however, is likely higher after hard-hit regions such as Madrid and Catalonia instructed people with mild symptoms to self-isolate rather than seek testing,</p> \n  <p>While officials urged caution in interpreting the data, they noted the figures hint at a downward trend, with fewer hospitalisations and a drop in patients needing critical care. \u201cThe sense that we\u2019re getting from the regions is that the pressure is easing,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Sierra of Spain\u2019s health emergency centre. \u201cIt\u2019s what we expected after three weeks of distancing measures.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Hans Kluge of the World Health Organization echoed her cautious tone. \u201cCareful optimism as a result of bold measures, innovative approaches and courageous decisions,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hans_kluge/status/1246732106946023430\">he wrote on Twitter</a> after wrapping up a mission to Spain. </p> \n  <p>He added that he had been deeply impressed by the heroism of the country\u2019s frontline workers and the solidarity among Spain\u2019s residents.</p> \n  <p> The impact of the virus has been widespread across the country, which not a single Spanish region spared. As the number of cases continues its steady climb upwards, a handful of municipalities have cut themselves off from the rest of Spain \u2013 and the world \u2013 in hopes of keeping the virus out.</p> \n  <p>Among the most fervent is the southern Spanish municipality of Zahara de la Sierra. Home to some 1,400 people and perched high on a mountain, local officials have used chains and fences to block off all but one of the five access roads to the white village.</p> \n  <p> Police keep constant watch over the one road that remains open, stopping every vehicle that passes to ensure they have the necessary authorisation to enter the town. </p> \n  <p>Those that are allowed through are sprayed with disinfectant before they can proceed up to the fortress town. \u201cFortunately, we don\u2019t have one (coronavirus) case in this municipality, nor anyone in quarantine,\u201d mayor Santiago Galv\u00e1n told Europa Press. </p> \n  <p> Nearby, the village of Setenil de las Bodegas has also sprang into action. Popular with daytrippers who flock to visit its houses built into the rocks that loom over the village, officials have dumped hundreds of kilograms of dirt to block off most roads leading into the municipality.</p> \n  <p> Home to some 2,700 people, the local council <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aytodesetenil/status/1243961681346248705\">recently announced plans to disinfect</a> all of the streets of the village on a daily basis while any vehicle that enters must pass under a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aytodesetenil/status/1244986737052524545\">custom-built arch</a> that showers them with disinfectant.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T12:20:42.889Z\">at 1.20pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e89c4398f080bdb9f53482d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T11:45:52.497Z\">12.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Singapore </strong>has recorded a 60% increase in coronavirus cases in a single day.</p> \n  <p>The county\u2019s health ministry reported 120 new cases of the virus on Sunday, in comparison to 75 on Saturday.
