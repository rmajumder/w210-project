The spike protein is the main target of leading vaccine programmes around the world, and if it changes too much those vaccines may no longer work.

The government cannot immediately ensure a return to normality ... we are still in this pandemic.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Autonomous moves by regions would be considered illegitimate, he added, opening the way for confrontations with regional chiefs set on defying the central government.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T14:01:54.973Z\">at 3.01pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaad1b78f08a459b6585143\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T13:26:58.472Z\">2.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>It\u2019s <strong>Simon Murphy</strong> here taking over the live blog while my colleague, <strong>Alexandra Topping,</strong> takes a well-earned break.

<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not yet at the peak of the distress as a result of the lockdown. It will emerge over the coming weeks,\u201d said Sir Peter Gluckman, who was the chief science advisor to New Zealand\u2019s prime minister from 2009 until 2018.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWith that will emerge some groups of people who will do well, they will find in the change opportunity, but many people who will be very uncertain, very scared, frustrated, angry, and we know from other disasters that about 10% or more even will progress to actual depression and to suicidality.\u201d</p> \n  <p>However Gluckman also said the country possessed unique assets that could see it navigate the coronavirus crisis better than other nations would.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/emotional-fallout-of-covid-19-lockdown-yet-to-peak-says-new-zealand-scientist\">Emotional fallout of Covid-19 lockdown yet to peak, says New Zealand scientist</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaa5da48f08745586318479\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martinfarrer\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T05:10:32.755Z\">6.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the UK, the cabinet will meet today to discuss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/social-bubbles-of-small-groups-could-be-early-step-out-of-lockdown\">when to start easing the lockdown</a> as the government deadline for testing 100,000 people per day looks like passing without the target being reached.

Under that scheme, people are referred for help by their GPs. In some cases, volunteers have called the person \u201cin need\u201d and they have no idea why they are being contacted. Mutual aid networks, in comparison, work almost street by street, with most doors have had a flyer offering help pushed through the letterbox. These networks are also not hamstrung by concerns about data protection and privacy regulations or worries about insurance.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/sitting-at-home-seems-wrong-coronavirus-volunteers-helping-the-nhs-a-photo-essay\">'Sitting at home seems wrong': NHS coronavirus volunteers \u2013 a photo essay</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaa57e48f0882b206dcfbe0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T04:55:09.300Z\">5.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Dr Deborah Birx, the White House\u2019s coronavirus taskforce coordinator is known for her reassuring appearances at Donald Trump\u2019s erratic and often astonishing White House press briefings.<br></p> \n  <p>Most recently, a video of her face <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-birx-trump-disinfectant-remarks\">as the US president suggested injecting disinfectant </a>into human beings might cure coronavirus went viral.

  "<p>Two large US landing craft that were torpedoed and sank with huge loss of life during a secret rehearsal for D-day have been given scheduled protection by the British government.</p> <p>At least 749 US servicemen died when the vessels, known as LSTs, were attacked by German forces and sank off the south coast of England during a training drill known as <a href=\"https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/Exercise-Tiger/\">Exercise Tiger</a>.</p> <p>The top-secret exercise in late April 1944 was intended to prepare the troops for the planned nighttime crossing and amphibious assault on the Normandy beaches six weeks later. But the flat-bottomed landing craft, each around 100 metres in length and carrying military vehicles and ammunition as well as hundreds of army and navy personnel, were intercepted by chance by enemy ships.</p> <p>Almost exactly 76 years after they sank 12 miles from the coast in Lyme Bay, Dorset, the two vessels have been given <a href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/hpg/has/scheduledmonuments/\">legal scheduled status</a>, the same designation given to monuments including Stonehenge, at the recommendation of <a href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/\">Historic England</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"84a8f4049a7fcba86495beffef3dabbf9a7b12f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84a8f4049a7fcba86495beffef3dabbf9a7b12f1/562_26_468_585/400.jpg\" alt=\"A sonar image of one of the vessels\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sonar image of one of the vessels.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mark Dunkley, a maritime archaeologist at Historic England, said the decision to protect the wrecks had been taken after consultation with the US navy \u2013 still their legal owner \u2013 and the Ministry of Defence. He said it was an important step \u201cin order to ensure that they are safe from criminal damage, unauthorised interference, but also to keep the memory of those that had lost their lives alive.\u201d</p> <p>Despite being maritime military graves, the wrecks were previously protected only by a US law that applied to its nationals alone, Dunkley said. As scheduled sites 50 metres deep, they could be monitored by satellite and radar to reduce the risk of large-scale metal theft, he said, but they are still accessible to divers so long as they respect them.</p> <p>\u201cDespite exploding and sitting on the seabed for 76 years, they are in remarkable condition, and we can see the remains of all of its armaments, the guns that it used to defend itself, its life craft, as well as the remains of its cargo of military vehicles and ammunition.\u201d</p> <p>Exercise Tiger was part of a series of large-scale D-day rehearsals. American troops trained secretly for the coming landings at Slapton Sands, south Devon, while British and Canadian forces prepared elsewhere. But the interception of the US training flotilla by German E-boats was devastating.</p> <p>LST-507, carrying nearly 500 US army personnel, trucks and 22 amphibious vehicles as well as live ammunition, was struck in the engine room by a torpedo, which knocked out the ship\u2019s electricity meaning its lifeboats could not be lowered while petrol tanks and ammunition exploded on the stricken vessel.</p> <p>The other landing-craft, LST-531, was hit twice and burst into a fireball, forcing many onboard to jump into the freezing sea amid burning fuel, while others were trapped below decks as the ship rolled over and sank. Two other vessels were severely damaged in the attack, leading to further loss of life.</p> <p>The losses were compounded by a friendly-fire incident in which many more died on the beach. The devastating scale of the losses meant details of the incidents remained classified for decades.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the big challenges that the relatives have is knowing exactly which personnel lie within those two landing craft, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something we will ever know,\u201d said Dunkley. \u201cBut I just hope that having the protection given today on both LSTs provides some comfort to the family that the memory of their ancestors will be memorialised in some way.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the huge scale of the tragedy, he said, \u201cwithout the losses of Slapton Sands, D-day would never have been the success it was. Mistakes were made in Exercise Tiger, but in understanding and identifying those mistakes, changes to operational orders were made that allowed D-day to be the success it was.</p> <p>\u201cSo the underlying reason to remember Tiger and other exercises is that those who gave their lives did so to enable D-day to be successful.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 May 2020. The landing craft were attacked in Lyme Bay 12 miles off the Dorset coast, not 12 miles off Slapton Sands in Devon as an earlier version stated. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>An \u201carmada\u201d of more than 100 fishing vessels are illegally plundering south Atlantic waters close to Argentina, environmental groups say, raising concerns that the coronavirus lockdown has weakened already fragile marine protections.</p> <p>The incursion of the ships, mostly from east Asia, appears to have been carried out by stealth. The vessels waited until nightfall, shut down satellite tracking systems in coordination and then moved into the squid-rich waters of Argentina\u2019s exclusive economic zone, Greenpeace said.</p> <p>The ships were detected in Mar del Plata on the radar of a legal vessel, which reported the incident to coastguard officials and fishing authorities. </p> <p>By <a href=\"https://www.pescare.com.ar/pesca-ilegal-camaras-empresarias-piden-mayor-control-y-patrullaje/\">one estimate</a>, the ships \u2013 each capable of taking 50 tonnes per day \u2013 could in less than three weeks exceed the Argentinian fleet\u2019s quota for the entire season. </p> <p>The incident has prompted questions in parliament and underlined how commercial interests are trying to capitalise on the relaxation of environmental monitoring and enforcement during the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cMost people think that the global pandemic means that nature is finally having a chance to heal. But this is not what we are seeing in the unregulated waters of the South Atlantic ocean,\u201d said Luisina Vueso, from Greenpeace\u2019s Protect the Oceans campaign. </p> <p>\u201cJust one look at this shocking<a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/etGEDoi9xnBTvpdb7\"> radar image</a> shows you that this armada \u2026 is taking advantage of the lack of governance in the high seas to empty our oceans of life.\u201d</p> <p>Similar concerns have been raised in other areas of the world. In the Amazon, deforestation is accelerating and more illegal miners are invading indigenous territories following the Brazilian government\u2019s admission that it would have fewer rangers on the ground. </p> <p>On the savannahs of east Africa, conservation groups warn of a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/24/coronavirus-poachers-kill-more-animals-as-tourism-to-africa-plummets.html\">rise</a> in wildlife poaching. And in the US, oil companies have lobbied to develop wells inside national parks and for the criminalisation of pipeline protesters.</p> <p>The oceans pose an even greater worry, environmental groups say, because even before the pandemic there was very little regulation of fishing and mining in international waters. This is the least patrolled domain in the world. Monitoring has declined further since the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> <p>This month the marine conservation group Sea Shepherd reluctantly <a href=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/sea-shepherd-vaquita-coronavirus-2645712469.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1\">suspended</a> its campaign to protect the critically endangered vaquita porpoise in Mexico\u2019s Upper Gulf of California because it was unable to secure fuel due to the pandemic.</p> <p>Industrial tuna fishing companies have persuaded maritime organisations to remove onboard monitors, reduce port inspections and loosen trans-shipment requirements. </p> <p>The Canadian government has followed several countries in <a href=\"https://thenarwhal.ca/fisheries-oceans-canada-pulls-at-sea-observers-fishing-boats-coronavirus-covid-19/\">removing observers </a>from all fishing vessels until the end of May, which means no oversight of what is caught and discarded.</p> <p>This has alarmed ocean conservationists and some of the more responsible fishing companies. The <a href=\"https://iss-foundation.org/\">International Seafood Sustainability Foundation</a> said the lower level of surveillance would \u201copen the door to increased illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and in doing so could undermine the recovery and resilience of many important fish stocks globally.\u201d</p> <p>Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Le Manach, the scientific director of <a href=\"http://www.bloomassociation.org/en/\">the ocean protection group Bloom Association</a>, said fishing fleets around the world were pushing for fewer restraints on their activities, which could have disastrous implications.</p> <p>\u201cThe pandemic is a good excuse for industrial fisheries because without observers you can do exactly what you want,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it would be a major mistake to allow weaker regulations at a time of crisis because once you do that it is hard to go back. If anything we need stronger monitoring during this crisis. This could be the moment when we put CCTV cameras onboard every fishing ship.

  "<p>Domestic abuse victims will be able to access safe spaces at Boots pharmacies across the country from Friday under measures to improve access to support during the coronavirus lockdown.</p> <p>Multiple support services for domestic abuse have reported a surge in calls to helplines since the lockdown was imposed, while the Metropolitan police said it was making an average of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/24/charges-and-cautions-for-domestic-violence-rise-by-24-in-london\">about 100 arrests a day</a> for offences linked to abuse in the home.</p> <p>Many victims who are now unable to seek help while at home trapped with their abusers will still be expected to shop for food and medicine, and there have been calls for safe space initiatives to be introduced in supermarkets and more pharmacies.</p> <p>The domestic abuse charity Hestia is overseeing a safe space model in consultation rooms at most of the 2,400 Boots pharmacies across the country to provide access to support for anyone experiencing domestic abuse.</p> <p>People who wish to use the safe space consultation room need to ask at the pharmacy counter. Once inside, they will find the 24-hour national domestic abuse helpline, the men\u2019s advice line and phone numbers for services specific to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>There will be signposting to download Hestia\u2019s mobile app Bright Sky, which provides support and information to anyone who may be in an abusive relationship.</p> <p>Lyndsey Dearlove, the head of Hestia\u2019s UK SAYS NO MORE campaign, said: \u201cWhile lockdown and social distancing measures continue, it is restricting victims of domestic abuse reaching out to their friends, family and co-workers for support.</p> <p>\u201cWe know there is an increased level of uncertainty for people looking to escape an abusive relationship. Self-isolation offers a new method of control over victims making it very difficult for them to seek support.</p> <p>\u201cWe recognise that key workers in pharmacies hold a unique position within the community as a single point of contact for victims. By creating this safe space in Boots pharmacies, we hope many will be able to safely access support while following government guidelines.</p> <p>\u201cWe hope more pharmacies will follow Boots UK\u2019s lead and join the Safe Space initiative. Although we are in a period of lockdown and isolation, our message to victims is domestic abuse services are open and we can help you.\u201d</p> <p>Hestia said it had already seen a 47% increase in victims reaching out for information and support on its Bright Sky app during the lockdown period.</p> <p>The president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, Sandra Gidley, said: \u201cDuring the pandemic, when options for survivors and victims are even more limited than usual, pharmacies can provide the safe environment needed to get support. The trust that the public have in pharmacies make them an ideal place to access help and take a step away from harm towards a better future.\u201d</p> <p>Duncan Rudkin, the chief executive of the General Pharmaceutical Council, which regulates pharmacies in Britain, said: \u201cWe are encouraging all pharmacies to consider becoming a Safe Space, to help people experiencing domestic abuse access vital support they may need.</p> <p>\u201cPharmacies are in the frontline in supporting the healthcare needs of patients and the public during the Covid-19 pandemic in the community, and are one of the few places that are open to people who may need help.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The 24-hour national domestic abuse helpline can be reached on 0808 2000 247</p> <p><br></p>",

Below is a summary of the developments of the day. If you have any news tips or thoughts, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sarah_marsh_journalist/\">please do share them with me</a>.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson said the UK did the \u201cright thing at the right time\u201d.</strong> Johnson says people should understand that the collating of data internationally is bedevilled with difficulties. The only real comparison will be possible at the end of this, when you look at total excess deaths. He said<strong> </strong>the UK avoided an \u201cuncontrollable and catastrophic\u201d epidemic that could have caused 500,000 deaths and that we were now \u201cpast the peak\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Following the lead of various world cities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/world-cities-turn-their-streets-over-to-walkers-and-cyclists\">including Bogot\u00e1 and Berlin</a>, Manchester has announced plans to close part of one of its main streets to cars</strong> and widen the pavements along others in order to help people walk and cycle safely while maintaining physical distancing \u2014 and move towards a car-free future.</li> \n   <li><strong>There have now been 26,771 coronavirus deaths in the whole of the UK in all settings, an increase of 674 on yesterday. </strong>These figures are just for people who tested positive for coronavirus. They do not include people who may have died from coronavirus who were not tested.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK\u2019s Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has issued a stern warning that GCSE and A-level grade assessments this summer</strong> should not unfairly penalise children from minority ethnic minority backgrounds, as well as disabled pupils and those with special educational needs.</li> \n   <li><strong>More than 9,000 fines have been handed to people in England and Wales for allegedly flouting coronavirus lockdown laws, according to new figures.</strong> As PA Media reports, the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council<strong> </strong>(NPCC) said <a href=\"https://news.npcc.police.uk/releases/police-chiefs-welcome-positive-start-to-recruitment-drive\">8,877 fixed penalty notices (FPNs) had been recorded by forces in England between March 27 and April 27</a>, while 299 were issued in Wales over the same period. Some 397 were for repeat offenders, with one person fined six times.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eab03128f08fcc89d8bb448\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/andrewsparrow\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T18:01:05.979Z\">7.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson's press conference - Summary and analysis</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here are the main points from Boris Johnson\u2019s press conference.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson warned Britons that they could face an \u201ceven bigger\u201d coronavirus outbreak if the government rushed or mishandled the relaxation of the lockdown.</strong> He made the point in an opening speech which, while not giving any firm details of the government\u2019s plans, effectively paved the way for an announcement next week that seems likely to involve the lockdown being extended yet again in most significant respects. He made the point with a slightly confused Alpine metaphor. He said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have come through the peak.</p> \n   <p>Or rather we\u2019ve come under what could have been a vast peak, as though we\u2019ve been going through some huge alpine tunnel.</p> \n   <p>And we can now see the sunlight and pasture ahead of us.</p> \n   <p>And so it is vital that we do not now lose control and run slap into a second and even bigger mountain.</p> \n   <p>And so to avoid that disaster our fifth and final test is that nothing as I say we do should lift the R or the reproduction rate of that disease back above one.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson then showed a video explaining the R number (the reproduction number - the rate at which a virus spreads) and why it was so important to keep this below 1. It was very hard to see the video as anything other than an attempt to explain the stringent social distancing measures will have to stay in place for a considerable time to come. You can watch it here.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/10DowningStreet/status/1255893826457214979\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There are five tests that must be met before social distancing measures can be adjusted.<br><br>One of these is the rate of infection, or R.<br><br>Keeping the R down will be vital to our recovery, and we can only do it with discipline and by working together. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/StayHomeSaveLives?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#StayHomeSaveLives</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Z10K0Yp90m\">pic.twitter.com/Z10K0Yp90m</a></p>\u2014 UK Prime Minister (@10DowningStreet) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/10DowningStreet/status/1255893826457214979?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 30, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that the government would publish \u201ca comprehensive plan\u201d next week explaining how it would be possible to move away from the lockdown. </strong>The Scottish and Welsh governments have already published their own version, and Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has repeatedly called for a UK version. Johnson said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I will be setting out a comprehensive plan next week to explain how we can get our economy moving, one, how we can get our children back to school, back into childcare, second, and third how we can travel to work and how we can make life in the workplace safer.</p> \n   <p>And in short how we can continue to suppress the disease and at the same time re-start the economy.</p> \n   <p>A huge amount of work has been going on on that that plan and as we produce it we are being guided by the science, and we will try to build the maximum political consensus as we produce it across all parties and across the UK.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But, in response to a question from a member of the public (Michelle from Cornwall), Johnson also said that that the plan would not commit the government to relaxing particular restrictions by particular dates. That would depend on the data, he said. Michelle wanted to know when holidaymakers would be able to return to Cornwall. Johnson was unable to give her any firm indication at all.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said the government may find \u201cingenious ways\u201d of suppressing coronavirus.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have to .. make sure we not only unlock the economy gradually, but also find ways of continuing to suppress the disease, and possibly find new, more ingenious ways of suppressing the disease. That\u2019s what we are working on now and you\u2019ll be seeing a lot more of that, I hope, next week.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson did not elaborate on what he meant, but he may have given a clue in his answer to a question on face coverings.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson backed the wearing of face coverings by members of the public in some circumstances.</strong> He said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What I think Sage [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] is saying, and what I certainly agree with, is that as part of coming out of the lockdown, I do think that face coverings will be useful both for epidemiological reasons but also for giving people confidence they can go back to work. But you\u2019ll be hearing more about that thing next week.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/28/sturgeon-urges-scots-to-wear-coronavirus-face-masks-for-shopping-and-travel\">The Scottish government has already backed the wearing of face coverings on public transport and in certain shops. </a>Johnson\u2019s words suggest the UK government is going to issue very similar advice.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said the UK has passed the peak of the epidemic.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can confirm today for the first time that we are past the peak of this disease. We are past the peak and we are on the downward slope.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>That was less significant than it sounded, because it has been clear for some time now that the UK has passed the peak. <a href=\"https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2020/peak-covid-19-deaths-occurring-english-hospitals-passed-8-april\">This week scientists said the peak for coronavirus deaths in English hospitals was passed on 8 April </a>- 22 days ago.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson claimed that he did \u201cthe right thing at the right time\u201d when it came to imposing the lockdown.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think it was completely right to make our period of lockdown coincide as far as we possibly could with the peak of the epidemic.</p> \n   <p>That peak, as I said just now, has passed. I do think that broadly speaking, and we\u2019re learning lessons every day, but I do think that broadly speaking, we did the right thing at the right time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is is not a view shared my most members of the public; a poll today suggests two thirds of people think the lockdown was imposed too late. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/30/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5eaabe168f0882b206dcff8f#block-5eaabe168f0882b206dcff8f\"> 1.01pm.)</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson claimed that it would be best to wait until all-cause excess death figures are available for all countries before making a judgment as to which countries have been the best and the worst at fighting coronavirus.</strong> This is an argument also endorsed by government scientists, but Johnson sounded more defensive today than on Monday, when <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-in-downing-street-27-april-2020\">in his speech outside No 10</a> he was talking about the UK\u2019s \u201capparent success\u201d. As <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/\">this chart illustrates</a>, in terms of total coronavirus deaths, the UK now has the third most in the world, behind only the US and Italy.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He claimed that he would not resort to austerity to manage the increased debt generated by this crisis. </strong>Asked if there would be a new era of austerity, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think the economy will bounce back strongly, I think that this government will want to encourage that bounce back in all kinds of ways.</p> \n   <p>I\u2019ve never particularly liked the term that you just used [austerity] to describe government economic policy and it\u2019ll certainly not be part of our approach.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This might turn out to be more of an aspiration, or an insight into Johnson\u2019s linguistic preferences, than a guide to his likely economic policy. As explained earlier, this crisis is set to leave a \u00a3200bn hole in the national finances this year.

Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The prime minister\u2019s spokesman again played down the prospect of any significant change to the lockdown next week, saying it would be wrong to \u201cgamble away\u201d what has already been achieved.</strong> No 10 has been transmitting this message for some days, but this seemed to be an even stronger hint that people should not expect too much from the review of the lockdown due by Thursday next week. The spokesman said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We don\u2019t want to relax the social distancing measures or do anything which could lead to the virus, which the British public have done so much to suppress, being able to spread in an exponential way again, and that will guide our approach as we move forward. People have made huge sacrifices in order to bring down the rate of infection, to protect the NHS and ultimately to save lives and we are not going to gamble those sacrifices away by taking steps that could lead to an exponential growth in the disease again.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When asked if the lockdown could continue until June, the spokesman said people would have to wait for the government decision. But he also reminded reporters of what <strong>Prof Chris Whitty</strong>, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, has said about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/27/uk-coronavirus-live-news-boris-johnson-back-at-work-amid-talk-of-easing-lockdown?page=with:block-5ea7112c8f0821d5b0274a47#block-5ea7112c8f0821d5b0274a47\">how the virus will be around for a significant period of time.</a> The spokesman went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As the PM himself has said, the worst thing we could do is relax the social distancing measures too soon and throw away all of the progress that has been made.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that Sage, the scientific advisory group for emergencies, is still examining the impact that different relaxation measures might have on R, the reproduction number (the infection rate of the virus), and that it did not present any findings to cabinet today.</strong> This work will be crucial because the government will only implement measures relaxing the lockdown that, taken together, do not push R above 1.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said Boris Johnson chaired a political meeting of cabinet before the normal cabinet today.</strong> At normal cabinet ministers received updates from Whitty and <strong>Sir Patrick Vallance</strong>, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman came close to ruling out the lockdown measures being eased region by region, instead of on a UK-wide basis. </strong>Yesterday <strong>Michael Gove</strong>, the Cabinet Office minister, said that although he favoured maintaining a UK-wide approach, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/29/uk-coronavirus-live-priti-patel-questions-response-covid-19-crisis-pmqs-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ea9a2728f08745586317f39#block-5ea9a2728f08745586317f39\">there might be a case for letting island communities do their own thing.</a> But the spokesman played down the prospect of this happening. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We did consider, when we introduced the social distancing measures, bringing them in in some parts of the country ahead of others. We decided not to do that.

It could not legally be the basis for the suspension of repossession actions which had been imposed.</p> \n  <p>But Sir Geoffrey Vos, chancellor of the high court, suggested that the practice direction had been imposed in an emergency and that it was effectively \u201ctrialling\u201d changes to the rules. \u201cThis is to see what measures can deal with [cases] in the context of a clogging up of justice\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Lady Justice Simler said the emergency rules did not prevent access to justice but merely imposed a 90-day delay on the process of house repossessions.</p> \n  <p>Lawyers for the justice secretary, Robert Buckland QC, have intervened in the case because of its significance.</p> \n  <p>The Housing Lawyers Practitioners Committee has also been permitted to intervene. In a statement issued before the hearing, the organisation\u2019s co-chairs, Marina Sergides and Simon Mullings, said: \u201cThe issues are crucial to our members and their clients.\u201d</p> \n  <p>In their legal submissions to the court, lawyers for the HLPA said: \u201cIf the appellants succeed in persuading the court that [the practice direction] is ultra vires then [this freeze] will cease to apply to all possession claims.\u201d</p> \n  <p>That would expose many vulnerable people to losing their homes during the lockdown, they argued. \u201cA significant proportion of members\u2019 clients are also vulnerable as a result of physical and/or mental health problems, as a result of which they find it difficult properly to understand information and provide their solicitors with documents and instructions even face-to-face.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The submission added: \u201cThis is a time when litigants, particularly those of limited means, are liable to find it particularly difficult to engage with the courts and with their lawyers if they have them. Practitioners and the courts are under exceptional pressure and the resources available to them are depleted. The provisions take effect for a temporary period while court procedures in response to Covid-19 are evaluated and they are subject to review.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The hearing continues.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T12:36:19.435Z\">at 1.36pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaac2608f0874558631881d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rebeccasmithers\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T12:20:00.270Z\">1.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Consumers still panic-buying toilet roll have another option from today.

The Tory-run county councils\u2019 network was furious that its members, all of which provide social care services, had recevied a 29% cash reduction compared with the first bailout, and faced a collective financial shortfall of \u00a3600m.</p> \n  <p>Cllr David Williams, the county councils\u2019 network chair, said: \u201cUnless a solution is forthcoming to address these growing additional pressures as the crisis goes on, and, crucially, our lost income, it is inevitable that the resources in shire counties made available to life-critical social care services will be reduced, resulting in extremely difficult choices facing our member councils.</p> \n  <p>\u201cMost importantly, unless further support is provided to all councils, some may feel that they have no choice but to suspend all non-essential expenditure, hampering our national efforts to defeat the coronavirus and prepare for the economic recovery.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The big winners are smaller districts.

No 10 was very keen to play down those suggestions, and today it is expected that his tone will be much more cautious, stressing the dangers of any significant move away from the restrictions currently in place.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8271289/Blueprint-work-PM-warns-wont-risk-second-wave-coronavirus.html?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&amp;utm_campaign=0ee8e24982-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_04_30_05_59&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_10959edeb5-0ee8e24982-189782117\">In the Daily Mail</a> <strong>Jason Groves</strong> quotes a Whitehall source using an interesting image to suggest that only modest changes are in the pipeline for next week. The source told him:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are looking at whether we can undo the top button and make things more comfortable in one or two places for the economy.

I am told that what relaxation there will be will mostly concern outdoor activities. (Though it is worth remembering that there is more flex in the current guidelines than is generally realised. Anyone can go to work, for instance, if they can\u2019t work from home.) Schools in England are likely not to return until after half-term. Next week\u2019s review will, according to one of those involved, be about a \u2018timeline for when we can do things\u2019 rather than an opportunity to do them straight away.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s interview last night (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/30/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5eaa855b8f0882b206dcfced#block-5eaa855b8f0882b206dcfced\">9.53am)</a> may have constrained Johnson even further. Until now the four nations of the UK have (with minor exceptions) been adopting a joint approach to coronavirus, agreed at meetings of the emergency committee Cobra, at which the devolved administrations are represented. But Sturgeon has repeatedly said that Scotland would diverge from the UK approach if she thought that was justified. If she were to decide next week that any relaxation of the lockdown would be unacceptable (which is what she hinted last night), it would be risky for Johnson to set different rules for England. Perhaps he would get credit for opening up the economy, but if coronavirus infection rates were to start to soar again south of the border, he would be open to the charge of being reckless with people\u2019s lives.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T10:31:48.540Z\">at 11.31am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaa9dc58f08b27d8fdd71be\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jamie-grierson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T09:45:17.121Z\">10.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More than 3,000 additional officers have joined police forces under the recruitment pledge that formed a centrepiece to Boris Johnson\u2019s election campaign, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-than-3000-extra-officers-join-police-in-recruitment-drive\">new figures have shown.</a></p> \n  <p>Johnson promised to recruit 20,000 officers during the summer 2019 election campaign, which many noted would in fact replace roughly the same number that had been lost under 10 years of Conservative party austerity.</p> \n  <p>The government set out its plans to recruit 20,000 additional officers by March 2023 in September and the Home Office on Thursday published the first official set of statistics on progress towards that number.</p> \n  <p>They show 3,005 recruits joined the police specifically as part of the uplift programme.

As reported already (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/30/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5eaa76168f0882b206dcfc93#block-5eaa76168f0882b206dcfc93\">8.06am)</a>, he conceded that the government might miss its target of getting the daily number of coronavirus tests up to 100,000 by the end of April. (Although today is the last day of April, the government has said we might have to wait until Saturday until we officially know whether or not the target has been hit, because it takes time to find out what has happened with home-testing kits.)</p> \n  <p>Here are some of the other lines from his interviews.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Buckland said that Nicola Sturgeon was right to warn that it might not be possible to lift any lockdown measures next week.</strong> The government has to review the lockdown measures by next Thursday, three weeks after the original measures were extended. In an interview on ITV\u2019s Peston programme last night Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, said that it might be impossible to relax any of the measures currently in place. She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>People talk about lifting the lockdown - that is not going to be a flick of the switch moment, we\u2019re going to have to be very careful, very slow, very gradual. I\u2019m far from convinced at this stage that when we get to the next review point on the 7 May we\u2019ll be in a position to lift any of these measures right now, because the margins of manoeuvre that we\u2019re operating in right now are very, very, very tight and narrow.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked about her comment, Buckland said Sturgeon was \u201cright to be cautious\u201d.

Instead it will provide an opportunity for clubs to air their thoughts on possible next steps while the league waits for the go-ahead from government.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"987132f5-b7b5-4c8c-befe-4c7ba81bb1cf\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A meeting between the department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and executives from a number of sports, including the Premier League, is due to take place later in the day.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere in Europe countries continued to pursue varying approaches to resolving their seasons in the face of the coronavirus.

  "<p>Ibsen\u2019s 19th-century play <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Enemy_of_the_People\" title=\"\">An Enemy of the People</a> is a political drama about a physician who tries to save his town from water pollution only to wind up as a scapegoat. For the doctor the issue is health; after testing the water supply he urges a shutdown and new pipes to be laid to save lives. The town\u2019s mayor is concerned about the economic cost. Better, the politician reasons, to keep the town open and correct the problem gradually. In the moral combat that ensues it is the doctor who becomes alienated from the town he struggled to protect. The play\u2019s message is a counsel of democratic despair: that might is more powerful than right.</p> <p>This insight has not been lost on the British government. Like Ibsen\u2019s fictional politician, ministers refused to see the viral threat. Boris Johnson did not want to contemplate a draconian response. When they did act, ministers found they were behind in a global race for critical resources such as ventilators, testing capacity and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52440641\" title=\"\">personal protective equipment</a>. The failure to move decisively to suppress the pandemic lies at the root of the mess. Rather than admit responsibility for being behind the curve, ministers refuse to apologise and instead seek to <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/matt-hancock-snaps-journalists-ends-21875798\" title=\"\">delegitimise</a> the media for asking questions about why Britain failed.</p> <p>Downing Street claims that \u201cmany people will be looking at our apparent success\u201d. Having lost more than 26,000 lives to the coronavirus pandemic, the UK now accounts for an eighth of the world\u2019s Covid-19 deaths with less than a hundredth of its population. If this counts as success, one shudders to think what might be considered failure. Every mistake invites a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lewis_goodall/status/1253792952528375808?s=20\" title=\"\">rebuttal</a>. The government deploys a three-pronged denial familiar to observers of the Brexit culture wars. The first prong is to doubt that there is a serious problem; the second is to question the veracity of unwelcome reporting; last is to tar dissent as treason.</p> <p>Mr Johnson wants to co-opt the population in a national effort under his command. But Britain is set to lose more people in the coronavirus outbreak than in the blitz. He claims the frontline of the NHS has held, but does not want to own the heavy losses on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/29/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-revised-up-to-26097-dominic-raab-announces-video\" title=\"\">social care flank</a>. The prime minister wants no narrative to take hold that could trigger a backlash on the home front that his administration cannot contain.</p> <p>Instead the government is attempting to use data to create the sense that the pandemic can be monitored as it happens. But daily numbers tell a distorted story. The missed target of 100,000 tests a day is a case in point. The volume of testing is not the issue; the question is whether it is extensive enough to map the virus spread so that it can be rolled back. South Korea has a population of 52 million but has recorded fewer than 250 coronavirus deaths by running <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vietnam-fight-insi-idUSKBN22B34H\" title=\"\">57 tests for every confirmed Covid-19 case</a>. The number for the UK is less than a tenth of that. Britain has been too late in increasing its testing capacity, and nor does it have a tracing system to track down people who might have been exposed to the virus.</p> <p>Despite the facts, Mr Johnson will spend the weeks ahead claiming he will <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/boris-has-found-a-path-out-of-lockdown-but-it-wont-be-smooth\" title=\"\">out-Korea the Koreans</a> by halting virus transmission and will keep it in check with a \u201ctrack, trace and test\u201d approach. Performing this U-turn will open the prime minster up to the charge that he acted too late. Already the finger of blame is being pointed at the state, neglecting that it had been shrunk by a decade of Tory rule. Instead of sharing uncertainties with the public, Mr Johnson continues the self-deception. To err is human. Resolving the tension between the economy and health, as Ibsen\u2019s play ultimately reveals, cannot be solved by the god of public opinion.</p>",
  "<p>The number of domestic abuse prosecutions fell by almost a quarter in the last three months of 2019, compared to the previous year, according to quarterly figures released by the Crown Prosecution Service. Rape prosecutions also fell 23% in the last three months of 2019 compared to a year prior, maintaining a historic low.</p> <p>The fall in domestic violence prosecutions and convictions comes as police and refuges have seen a significant rise in cases during the coronavirus lockdown.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police force, which covers London, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/24/charges-and-cautions-for-domestic-violence-rise-by-24-in-london\">said charges and cautions for domestic violence were up 24% from 9 March</a>, when people with coronavirus symptoms were asked to self-isolate, compared with last year. Domestic violence refuges have said they are running out of space, with many full or effectively closed amid an \u201cepidemic inside this pandemic\u201d.</p> <p>According to the quarterly CPS figures, rape convictions fell 19% in the same period when compared to the previous year. The number of completed prosecutions dropped from 684 to 524 in rape cases, while convictions dropped from 445 to 362. The charging rate \u2013 which has been a key concern of groups in the violence against women and girls sector \u2013 has improved slightly. The proportion of suspects charged increased to 54.7% in the third quarter of 19/20, compared with 48.2% in 18/19.</p> <p>Sarah Green, director of End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed at stagnant charging figures, and note the number of cases coming in the front door from police are still far too low, with delays overall increasing.</p> <p>\u201cSo while the numbers across the last 12 months may show some minimal shifts, it is clear there is still a long way to go. The most recent crime outcomes data published last week show the overall charging rate for rape as 1.5%.</p> <p>\u201cImportantly these statistics represent the time before Covid-19, with the huge impacts it will have on the charging volumes, and the massive backlog of cases already awaiting trial.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/12/prosecutions-in-england-and-wales-at-lowest-level-in-a-decade\">Falling prosecution and conviction rates</a> for rape, which are at a 10-year low, prompted the government to announce an end-to-end review of the criminal justice system\u2019s treatment of the crime. The number of rape charges have dropped by 51% since 2014, while reported rapes have more than doubled in the same period, from 20,751 to 58,657 in 2018-19. The review was originally due to publish this spring.</p> <p>A CPS spokesperson said: \u201cWe want victims of sexual violence to come forward with confidence that whenever the legal test is met we will bring charges, no matter how challenging the case.</p> <p>\u201cWhile it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions at this stage, we welcome the promising beginning of a reversal of the recent trend as these figures show an increase in rape charging rates over the past year, and there are preliminary signs that the fall in the number of cases being referred to the CPS by the police is slowing down.</p> <p>\u201cProsecuting rape continues to be a CPS priority, and we remain committed to the ongoing cross-government review.\u201d</p>",

The UK\u2019s death toll is 26,097 and Spain has lost 24,543 lives.</p> <h2>Denmark says partial reopening has not accelerated virus spread</h2> <p>Authorities in Denmark said the spread of Covid-19 has not accelerated since it became the first country outside of Asia to ease lockdown measures a fortnight ago. Daycare centres and schools began reopening two weeks ago, followed by hairdressers and other small businesses on 20 April.</p> <p>\u201cThere are no signs that the Covid-19 epidemic is accelerating,\u201d said Denmark\u2019s State Serum Institute, which is responsible for preparedness against infectious diseases.</p> <h2>Further 674 deaths in the UK as Johnson says country is \u2018past the peak\u2019</h2> <p>There have been a further 674 recorded deaths from coronavirus, Boris Johnson said in his first Downing Street daily briefing in more than a month. He said the figure included deaths outside of hospital, bringing the total number of deaths to 26,771.</p> <p>Johnson said the UK was \u201cpast the peak of this disease\u201d and \u201con the downward slope\u201d.</p> <h2>UK government likely to miss testing target</h2> <p>The government will probably fail to reach its target of testing 100,000 people per day for coronavirus by the end of April, the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, has admitted.</p> <p>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, had previously promised to meet the goal by the end of Thursday.</p> <p>Buckland said 52,000 people were being tested per day and capacity was rising. He said of the target: \u201cEven if we don\u2019t hit it, and it\u2019s probable that we won\u2019t, we will in the next few days.\u201d</p> <p>Buckland added: \u201cIf he [Hancock] hadn\u2019t set a target, he would have been criticised for being unambitious.\u201d</p> <h2>US unemployment continues to grow</h2> <p>A further 3.8 million people lost their jobs in the US last week. The pace of layoffs appears to be slowing, but in six weeks 30 million Americans have now sought unemployment benefits.</p> <p>US unemployment remains on course to reach levels not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</p> <h2>Spain to allocate times slots for outdoor activities</h2> <p>Health authorities said time slots for specific outdoor activities would be used to help avoid confusion and further contagion when adults are allowed out to exercise from Saturday for the first time since mid-March.</p> <p>Children in Spain have been allowed out to exercise with a parent or guardian since last Sunday.</p> <p>The transport minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos, said trips outside would be \u201csequenced\u201d to prevent what he called \u201can explosive exit\u201d.</p> <p>The number of fatalities related to Covid-19 recorded overnight in Spain fell to 268, the lowest in nearly six weeks, the health ministry said.</p> <h2>Italy enters recession</h2> <p>Italy has joined France in recession after recording its worst slump in decades. Italian GDP shrank by 4.7% in the first quarter of 2020, figures from ISTAT show, its worst performance since the data series began in 1995. There was a 0.3% contraction in October to December, meaning Italy has notched up two consecutive quarters of contraction and is in recession.</p> <h2>South Korea records no new domestically transmitted cases</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/south-korea\">South Korea</a> reported no new domestic coronavirus cases on Wednesday for the first time since February, the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.</p> <p>It reported four new infections, all imported cases, taking the national tally to 10,765. The death toll rose by one to 247.</p>",
  "<p>Claims that environmental regulations have risen \u201cby 445%\u201d are based on a flawed word-counting methodology developed at a US conservative thinktank and should not be relied upon, legal experts have told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>Last week the Melbourne-based libertarian thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs claimed its analysis showed that since 2000 regulations under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act had increased by 10% a year.</p> <p>The methodology used for the IPA\u2019s analysis was developed at the US-based thinktank the Mercatus Center, linked to the powerful billionaire industrialist and Republican donor Charles Koch.</p> <p>But experts who spoke to Guardian Australia have dismissed the methodology \u2013 known as RegData \u2013 as fundamentally flawed and ideologically motivated.</p> <p>Prof Jodi Short, of the University of California\u2019s Hastings law school, is a critic of \u201cregulation counting\u201d efforts.

Just counting types of words tells us little about the legislation and if it\u2019s efficient.\u201d</p> <p>He said Australia\u2019s environmental laws were \u201cfailing to protect Australia\u2019s unique places and wildlife\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe EPBC Act needs to focus on this, rather on those that seek to strip away environmental laws.\u201d</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.umn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1054&amp;context=mlr\">2018 critique of RegData</a>, Short wrote: \u201cRegulation counts do not account for the weight of the things counted. This is a fundamental flaw if regulation counts are meant to measure regulatory costs, burdens, or constraints on regulated entities.</p> <p>\u201cThe burden of carrying 1,000 feathers is very different from the burden of carrying 1,000 anvils, yet regulation counts make no attempt to differentiate between regulatory feathers and anvils.\u201d</p> <p>Short told Guardian Australia that RegData \u201ccreates a powerful political narrative about the volume of regulation crushing the populace, undermining political support for regulation\u201d.</p> <p>She said RegData forced regulators into examining \u201cthe mundane but extraordinarily time consuming task of regulation accounting\u201d instead of \u201cdeveloping quality regulations that protect public health, safety, economic wellbeing, and the environment\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFor people who purport to shun red tape, Mercatus has been highly adept at tying regulators\u2019 hands with it,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Mercatus and the IPA say cutting regulations will be good for the economy, but Short said: \u201cThere is no credible empirical evidence that they are causally related (or even correlated with) the economic outcomes that Mercatus claims.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cI am, frankly, shocked that Mercatus and its political allies continue to forge ahead with their agenda to hobble effective regulation.\u201d</p> <p>Chris McGrath, a barrister and environmental law expert, told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe whole idea of just counting key words to track a rise in environmental regulation, as RegData does, then saying, \u2018That\u2019s bad and it should go back to the starting level,\u2019 is a fallacy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>RegData is a significant improvement in the science of regulation</p> <footer> <cite>Patrick McLaughlin, Mercatus Center</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn reviewing any law, you need to look at the effectiveness, efficiency and equity of the law in the context of the nature of the complex problems they are trying to address. That\u2019s a hard task and one that the RegData approach avoids doing. The RegData analysis is fundamentally lazy.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Jason Potts, of Melbourne\u2019s RMIT University, <a href=\"https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/mclaughlin-regdata-australia-mercatus-working-paper-v1.pdf\">worked to develop the Australian version of RegData</a> that was used by the IPA.</p> <p>\u201cDisputes between academics are normal,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a vibrant academic debate related to the measurement of regulation, and we have contributed to that in top peer-reviewed journals developing an innovative empirical methodology.\u201d</p> <p>He said the RegData methodology had been published in \u201ctop US academic journals\u201d, adding: \u201cWe are certainly proud to be working with top US university researchers.\u201d</p> <p>He said one way economists studied the effects of law was to have a \u201cquantitative measure of regulation at a point in time and for a jurisdiction\u201d.</p> <p>Patrick McLaughlin, a senior fellow at Mercatus Center who devised RegData, said it \u201cwas a way to measure, like a scale\u201d and that it provided a \u201cuseful number\u201d. He said \u201chundreds of third-party academics\u201d had used it.</p> <p>It was \u201cutter nonsense\u201d to claim it was a \u201cpolitical project\u201d, he said: \u201cRegData is a significant improvement in the science of regulation. You would only make this argument if you don\u2019t think science can lead to improvement.\u201d</p> <p>An IPA spokesman also rejected the claim that RegData was ideologically driven.</p> <p>The thinktank\u2019s director of research, Daniel Wild, said RegData was a \u201crevolutionary approach to measuring and cutting red tape\u201d and could be \u201cused to measure the red tape burden, track government progress in reducing red tape, compare the regulatory burden across industries and across states and identify areas of prioritisation for governments\u201d.</p> <p>The Mercatus Center is based at George Mason University\u2019s Arlington campus. It says it \u201cadvances knowledge about how markets work to improve people\u2019s lives\u201d.</p> <p>According to its website, it is a not-for-profit organisation \u201csupported by foundations (58%), individuals (40%), and businesses (2%) from around the country\u201d.</p> <p>Charles Koch, with his late brother David, donated many millions to a network of libertarian and conservative thinkthanks, including those that have challenged the science and risks of human-caused climate change.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/18/rebuild-it-shade-it-breed-it-three-tactics-to-buy-time-for-the-great-barrier-reef\">Rebuild it, shade it, breed it: three tactics to buy time for the Great Barrier Reef</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One counting of financial disclosures <a href=\"http://conservativetransparency.org/recipient/mercatus-center/?og_tot=289&amp;order_by=&amp;adv=koch&amp;min=&amp;max=&amp;yr=&amp;yr1=&amp;yr2=&amp;submit=\">shows that the Charles Koch Foundation donated</a> more than $9m to the Mercatus Center between 2002 and 2012.

  "<p>It has been a whirlwind few weeks for the 25-year-old Penny Smith.

What would the outcome be?\u201d</p> <p>Recently, while horse-riding on her family farm in Bookaar, Victoria, Smith received a congratulatory phone call: in 15 months\u2019 time she will make her Olympic debut.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/29/tokyo-olympics-not-reliant-on-covid-19-vaccine-senior-ioc-member\">Tokyo Olympics in 2021 at risk of cancellation admits Japan's PM</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Smith is one of 71 Australians who have been selected for the Tokyo Games, around 14% of the 480 or so athletes that the AOC expects to send to Japan. They come from a range of sports: track-cycling, sailing, canoe/kayak, artistic- and open-water swimming, modern pentathlon, archery and shooting. Some were confirmed months ago prior to the postponement, others \u2013 like Smith \u2013 were only announced recently.</p> <p>The International Olympic Committee\u2019s decision to delay the Games by 12 months due to coronavirus has left the AOC and its national sporting bodies with major selection dilemmas. Given some sports had already completed their processes, it would be a blow to those athletes for selection to now be deferred \u2013 potentially compounding the mental health challenges caused by the pandemic.</p> <p>But there are no guarantees that squads picked in early 2020 will still represent the best selections come mid-2021. Form is temporary, young names emerge and veterans fade \u2013 there are good reasons why Olympic selection is typically concluded just months out from the Games.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no perfect solution,\u201d says Shooting Australia\u2019s chief executive Luke van Kempen. \u201cAfter our final selection event we inquired with the AOC about whether we could postpone the team nomination, and whether or not that might be a good thing to do, but it turned out that we were obliged to continue with the selection process.</p> <p>\u201cThe squad we have announced is the squad that will go to Tokyo. That is the AOC policy: there is no room to de-select athletes, although of course an athlete can withdraw due to injury or changes in personal circumstances. The responsibility is on us to make sure we establish appropriate training and competition programmes \u2013 we have to do the best we can to ensure everyone is in peak performance when July 2021 comes around.\u201d</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, there is heightened sensitivity about selections right now. Athletes who just missed the cut wonder where they will be in 12 months\u2019 time, while coaches consider how best to motivate selected and non-selected athletes. \u201cThere were some selections that were quite close, some tight competition for places,\u201d says Van Kempen. \u201cThat drives good performance.\u201d Such is the delicacy around the topic that one major sport refused to comment, instead directing queries to the AOC.</p> <p>It told Guardian Australia that completed selection processes should be honoured. \u201cAthletes have done everything that was asked of them and it is consistent with the International Olympic Committee\u2019s position that those who are qualified remain qualified,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cIt also means those athletes can now focus entirely on their preparation for Tokyo, which they are seeing as an advantage. In these uncertain times, certainty should be provided wherever possible in the best interest of sports and their athletes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"baf67732b209cc93872cba94adeb2694e50f47c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/baf67732b209cc93872cba94adeb2694e50f47c9/0_330_4978_2988/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Wearn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Wearn is one of the lucky Australians to have already secured his place at the Tokyo Games.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason McCawley/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Certainty has certainly been a big help for the Australian sailor Matt Wearn, who was among the first to be selected for the Games last year. \u201cWe felt the stress of a close selection would have a negative impact, and thought an early selection would help ensure a result come Tokyo,\u201d says Wearn, who two months ago won silver in the Laser class world championships.</p> <p>Having counted down the days to the Olympics since September, the postponement was at first a major blow. \u201cWe were ready to go,\u201d says Wearn \u201cI have been working towards this for quite a while so to have that taken away was hard to deal with. But now, to already be selected is a nice feeling \u2013 particularly in my class, where it is extremely tight for remaining spots among other countries.\u201d</p> <p>Wearn and his fellow sailors can now fully focus on their preparations for 2021. \u201cThe delay is a perfect opportunity to tick off a few more one-percenters that we might not have been able to work on prior to July,\u201d the West Australian adds. \u201cNow that we have more time we will keep thinking of things we can work on \u2013 in a way, that is a great upside.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately Wearn, Smith and the other 69 are in the fortunate minority. For the remainder of Australia\u2019s Olympic hopefuls, coronavirus has put their qualification plans on hold and left them facing an uncertain year With travel halted and Australians isolating indoors, domestic and international selection opportunities are non-existent. It will likely be months or even a year before the AOC can announce any additions to the Olympic squad.</p> <p>\u201cThe AOC is awaiting further advice from the IOC on adjusted qualification systems,\u201d the spokesperson added. Given the turbulent situation, the AOC \u2013 and the hundreds of Australians yet to qualify \u2013 may be waiting a while.</p>",
  "<p>Libya\u2019s internationally recognised government has said its forces will keep fighting, after a unilateral ceasefire declaration by its eastern-based opponents in the country\u2019s brutal civil war.</p> <p>The Government of National Accord (GNA), based in Tripoli, said it did not trust the Libyan National Army (LNA) of renegade general Khalifa Haftar.</p> <p>Late on Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/eastern-libyan-forces-have-agreed-a-ceasefire-during-ramadan\">a spokesman for Haftar said the LNA was adopting a ceasefire</a> for Islam\u2019s holy month of Ramadan in response to requests by the international community and \u201cfriendly countries\u201d.</p> <p>Libya has been split since 2014 between rival administrations in Tripoli and Benghazi. Haftar launched a war to capture Tripoli a year ago, advancing into the southern suburbs before his offensive stalled. His forces, backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, have continually bombarded the capital.</p> <p>In recent weeks Haftar\u2019s forces have suffered a series of battlefield reverses during a surge in violence that has included indiscriminate shelling of clearly marked hospitals.</p> <p>On Monday he abruptly declared a popular mandate to take control of the whole country. The ceasefire offer suggests that he was told by his backers that he had overstepped the mark and needed to bow to international pressure for a lull in fighting if he was to recover lost diplomatic ground. He may also have reasoned that a ceasefire would give him time to reorganise his battered supply lines.</p> <p>Monday\u2019s political declaration was denounced by the US embassy in Libya and by the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, as well as indirectly criticised by France, one of Haftar\u2019s strongest covert backers.</p> <p>The declaration also implied that Haftar no longer recognised the authority of the elected house of representatives (HoR) in the eastern city of Tobruk, which he had been broadly allied with for many years.</p> <p>The head of the HoR, Ageela Saleh, had just put forward an eight-point political plan to try to reconcile the east of the country with the GNA.</p> <p>Haftar has presented himself to his overseas backers as the man to bring security to Libya and crush the Muslim Brotherhood. He has been either tolerated or supported by some countries as the legitimate representative of political forces in the east, but his apparent clash with Saleh, a leading political force in the east, made that claim less tenable.</p> <p>During the recent escalation in violence and attendant rise in civilian casualties, the LNA shelled a civilian hospital in Tareeq al-Shouq, destroying an intensive care unit. The hospital had been earmarked to take a leading role in the event of a coronavirus outbreak in Libya.</p> <p>The Dutch embassy in Libya said there had been 12 attacks on medical facilities since the beginning of the year and that the bulk had occurred in GNA-held areas \u2013 a diplomatic way of blaming the LNA.</p> <p>Some of the most intense recent fighting has been around Tarhuna, a town 40 miles south-east of Tripoli used as a platform for the LNA to supply its forces attacking the capital. Electricity has been cut off to Tarhuna for weeks, in retaliation for Hafta\u2019s forces temporarily stopping the gas supply to the Khoms power station (which also supplies Tarhuna). The World Health Organization in Libya had warned the fighting was impeding its work to prepare for a coronavirus outbreak</p> <p>The GNA, increasingly supported by Turkish drone strikes on LNA supply lines, has also widened its military counteroffensive, including by shelling the LNA\u2019s al-Watyia airbase, the main source of the air threat to civilians in Tripoli. Haftar had previously suffered reverses in a string of coastal towns close to the Tunisian border.</p> <p>He retains control of the main oilfields and his supporters have closed oil terminals, forcing a two-month shutdown of Libyan production, the country\u2019s economic lifeblood. </p> <p>Haftar had envisaged his Tripoli offensive as a lightning strike, but he quickly became bogged down south of the city.</p> <p>On Monday he dismissed the UN-brokered Skhirat <a href=\"https://unsmil.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/Libyan%20Political%20Agreement%20-%20ENG%20.pdf\">political agreement (pdf)</a>, laboriously negotiated in 2015, rejecting all the political institutions set up under it and in effect wiping the constitutional slate clean.</p> <p>The agreement, he said, had \u201cdestroyed\u201d the country, and the Libyan people had tasked the LNA general command with a \u201chistoric\u201d duty in such extraordinary times.</p> <p>Some analysts believe Haftar\u2019s rejection of all previous political agreements was in part a reaction to his recent military reverses. Tarek Megerisi, a Libya specialist at the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank, said: \u201cThis move suggests an acknowledgement by Haftar that his attack on Tripoli is unsalvageable, so he is trying to consolidate his case before the ramifications of that failure lead to unmanageable unrest or attempts at an internal coup.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Regarding your editorial (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/the-guardian-view-on-children-in-the-pandemic-hidden-victims\" title=\"\">The Guardian view on children in the pandemic: hidden victims</a>, 28 April), the government\u2019s priority for vulnerable children now, as it always has been, is to keep them safe and put their best interests at the heart of every decision. Covid-19 has put new pressures on children\u2019s social care. We have seen the impact of this virus on our frontline public services. We must make sure every safeguarding professional can react to the pressures they face in these unprecedented times \u2013 which may increase still as we enter the recovery phase.</p> <p>As a responsible government, we must protect services and enable them to respond to the greatest need. We have worked across the children\u2019s social care sector to develop legislation to do so. In cases where social workers cannot work as they did before, we are allowing them to make pragmatic decisions through minor, temporary amendments to regulations, while always keeping children\u2019s safety paramount.</p> <p>The vast majority of regulations remain unchanged. Any amendments should only to be used when absolutely necessary, with senior management oversight, and must be consistent with the overarching safeguarding and welfare duties that remain in place. They will remain in place only for so long as needed.</p> <p>Our focus remains fixed on protecting all vulnerable children. The duties on local authorities and providers to report their decision-making remain the same. Ofsted inspections continue where there are safeguarding concerns. And new teams are working around the country to improve our understanding about the risks facing these children.</p> <p>I hope these flexibilities will not have to be used. But it is my responsibility to those who care for our most vulnerable children and families to provide the necessary tools to make the right decisions during these challenging times.<br><strong>Vicky Ford</strong><br><em>Minister for children and families</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your editorial details the wide-ranging risks to vulnerable children and young people and how these will be amplified by 10 regulatory changes introduced to reduce the protection of looked-after children. Deregulation seems inexplicable at this time, not least the provision that fostering services are no longer required to report infectious diseases to Ofsted.</p> <p>In the context of the Department for Education\u2019s failed proposals to deregulate protection on two occasions from 2016, due to widespread opposition, it is evident that this is a key component of government policy at the highest level, including reducing the role of local authorities and opening the door to the privatisation of services and other providers. The government\u2019s response, including the lack of parliamentary scrutiny, is a salutary reminder to all those who believe the pandemic will result in a radical revival of progressive public policy that this is very unlikely to happen under this government.<br><strong>Prof Mike Stein</strong><br><em>University of York</em></p> <p>\u2022 Carolyne Willow and Article 39 are correct to point to the abomination that is removing safeguards to protect the UK\u2019s most vulnerable children during the Covid-19 pandemic, when they are most at risk from a society in \u201clockdown\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/28/children-in-care-at-risk-since-coronavirus-crisis-say-campaigners\" title=\"\">Children in care at risk since coronavirus crisis, say campaigners</a>, 29 April).</p> <p>It is somewhat reassuring that the shadow minister for early years has raised the issue in parliament, but the more fundamental question remains: in the face of appropriate governmental prioritisation of the needs of adults and particularly the elderly in danger from Covid-19, who is responsible and accountable for the best interests of children and young people? There seems to be a stark lack of political focus and absence of public discussion on the effect of Covid-19 on their lives across health, education, social care, justice and poverty.</p> <p>We need government to work with key actors in the children\u2019s sector now to understand the impact of Covid-19, develop mitigation strategies, and start to plan the childhood we want to create for these children of the pandemic.<br><strong>Dr Sunil Bhopal</strong> <em>Clinical lecturer in population health, Population Health Science Institute, Newcastle University</em><br><strong>Al Aynsley-Green</strong> <em>Professor emeritus, University College London; Author, The British Betrayal of Childhood</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"http://gu.com/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson promised to set out next week how schools and workplaces could safely reopen once lockdown restrictions were eased, as he claimed the UK was past the peak of the coronavirus outbreak.</p> \n<p>Despite announcing an increase of 674 in the death toll of the virus, taking it to a total of 26,771, the prime minister suggested the worst was over.</p> \n<p>\u201cI can confirm today for the first time that we are past the peak of this disease. We are past the peak and we are on the downward slope,\u201d he said, three days after returning to work as he recovers from Covid-19 himself.</p> \n<p>Presenting his first Downing Street press conference since being discharged from hospital, the prime minister at times appeared breathless.</p> \n<p>He robustly defended his government\u2019s handling of the outbreak, after a slew of criticism during his absence from the political frontline. \u201cWe\u2019re learning lessons every day \u2013 but I do think that, broadly speaking, we did the right thing at the right time,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Responding to the argument that a more stringent lockdown should have been imposed sooner, he said: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, it\u2019s a very very demanding thing to ask a population to do \u2013 very tough \u2013 and so I think it was completely right to make our period of lockdown coincide as far as possible with the peak of the epidemic.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson announced that the government would next week publish what he called a \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d setting out \u201chow we can continue to suppress the disease and at the same time restart the economy\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, he stressed any changes would only be enacted once the government was confident the outbreak was under control.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat you are going to get next week is really a road map, a menu of options. The dates and times of each individual measure will be very much driven by where we are in the epidemic, what the data is really saying and we are getting in a lot more data every day now and in the course of the next few days.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, welcomed the prime minister\u2019s statement, after repeatedly calling on the government to set out its \u201cexit strategy\u201d \u2013 though Johnson declined to use that precise phrase.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been calling on the prime minister to have a plan for the next stage and exit strategy,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pushing hard on that in the last week or two. The prime minister has now said he\u2019s going to have a plan next week. So I think that shows that we were right to challenge on it, and I\u2019m pleased that we\u2019re going to see a plan. We\u2019ll look at it when we see it, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s five tests for relaxing lockdown restrictions include the availability of adequate PPE and testing, and a sustained fall in the death rate.</p> \n<p>But the prime minister laid particular emphasis on R, the reproduction number for the virus, measured as the average number of people each sufferer infects.</p> \n<p>The target is to keep the R rate of transmission below 1, but even small reductions in the rate can help avoid thousands of new infections a day. At the moment, the government\u2019s scientific advisers believe it is between 0.6 and 0.9.</p> \n<p>England\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, urged caution, saying: \u201cAs soon as R goes over one, then you restart exponential growth \u2013 it may be slow if it is just over one, it may be a lot faster if it goes a lot above one \u2013 but exponential growth restarts and, sooner or later \u2013 and the higher it is, the sooner it is \u2013 the NHS will go back to the risk of being overwhelmed and the number of cases will go up.\u201d</p> \n<p>One source close to Downing Street said the government was also reluctant to lift the lockdown until the number of new daily infections was lower than around 5,000 per day \u2013 the measure which was used by Germany to determine when to ease social distancing.</p> \n<p>However, the UK is quite some way off that goal. The official figures show at least 6,000 people tested positive on Wednesday, but the real number is likely to be much higher than that because many cases in the community are not being tested.</p> \n<p>The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, told the Scottish public on Wednesday it was highly unlikely that there would be a loosening of lockdown restrictions next week.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is likely by the time we get to this time next week, which is the 7 May review day, it will not be possible in any meaningful way to lift these restrictions,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have worked very hard to bring down the transmission rate of the virus and we are definitely seeing results from those efforts. But our progress against the virus is too fragile for us to let up.\u201d</p> \n<p>In Whitehall, ministers have been scrambling to draw up plans for the next phase of the crisis, which Johnson\u2019s deputy, Dominic Raab, has described as a \u201cnew normal\u201d, rather than a return to the pre-lockdown life.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5004b969-1bd0-4dd3-8068-05fe213d0195\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4tHEEIWjxds?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Johnson said for the first time on Thursdaythat this could include the public being advised to wear face masks.</p> \n<p>Asked about the issue, the prime minister said: \u201cI do think face masks will be useful, both for epidemiological reasons, and to give people the confidence that it is safe to go back to work.\u201d</p> \n<p>His remarks contradicted the stance of some cabinet colleagues. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said earlier this week there was only \u201cweak science\u201d supporting the use of face masks.

  "<p>It\u2019s funny how quickly the strange and unfamiliar become routine. After weeks of awkwardness at the supermarket checkout, suddenly the choreography is getting easier: I\u2019ve almost mastered the new rhythm of packing, waiting decorously for the cashier to move their hand away before swooping on whatever they\u2019ve passed across the scanner. Even the sight of conveyor belts being doused with disinfectant after every customer seems almost normal now, although it shouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>Supermarket workers have been the forgotten heroes of lockdown, valiantly turning up to work for not much money in one of the few public places the virus can still easily spread, providing the only friendly faces some customers will see until next week. All of which makes the constant appeals over the in-store PA for shoppers to download self-scanning apps \u2013 don\u2019t check out, just zap everything as you sling it in the trolley and go! \u2013 frankly disconcerting. It sounds the kindest thing, shielding till staff from our filthy germs. But what stops me signing up is a nagging worry about what happens to the cashiers when most people no longer need them. Doing them out of a job seems no way to reward their service. But is queueing at their checkouts morally any better, if all it does is endanger them?</p> <p>Here then is the horrible choice coronavirus will spring on us as the working world creaks slowly back to life: between lingering fear of infection on one hand, and the relentless march of automation on the other. Recessions don\u2019t so much change the world as speed it up, accelerating trends already rippling beneath the surface. And even before this epidemic hit, a much-quoted Office for National Statistics study estimated around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/mar/25/automation-threatens-15-million-workers-britain-says-ons\">1.5</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/mar/25/automation-threatens-15-million-workers-britain-says-ons\">m</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/mar/25/automation-threatens-15-million-workers-britain-says-ons\"> British jobs</a> were at high risk from automation. Now the epidemic is pressing fast-forward on all of that, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/bosses-speed-up-automation-as-virus-keeps-workers-home\">four in </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/bosses-speed-up-automation-as-virus-keeps-workers-home\">10 companies</a> surveyed by the consultants EY admitting they\u2019re now bringing forward their plans for automation. Machines can still pass on the virus \u2013 think of all the grubby paws touching that bank ATM before yours \u2013 but at least they don\u2019t get sick themselves.</p> <p>Microsoft\u2019s CEO, Satya Nadella, said this week the software giant had seen <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/microsoft-sees-yearlong-digital-transformation-happen-in-2-months-nadella-120043000184_1.html\">\u201ctwo years\u2019 worth of digital transformation in two months</a><a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/microsoft-sees-yearlong-digital-transformation-happen-in-2-months-nadella-120043000184_1.html\">\u201d</a> thanks to coronavirus shifting our lives abruptly online. Expect more big names to disappear from the physical high street (why mooch around shopping malls if you can\u2019t even try things on, with changing rooms expected to stay shut even when fashion stores reopen, and beauty-counter testers a relic of our unhygienic past). Bank branches were already closing in droves before the epidemic, but here is the perfect excuse to shut more. And that\u2019s not all. The authors of an Oxford University <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162516302244?mod=article_inline\">study</a> thought that by 2035 it would be possible to automate 86% of restaurant jobs, three-quarters of retail jobs, and 59% of recreation jobs. By unlucky coincidence, those are among the very industries hardest hit by an epidemic now demanding quantum leaps in efficiency if some companies are to avoid going under.</p> <p>The business secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/ministers-meet-unions-and-business-to-plan-getting-uk-back-to-work\">Alok Sharma</a>, will shortly publish detailed safety guidance for opening businesses back up. But we know that social distancing will be in place until at least the end of the year, or maybe longer without a vaccine. When people can\u2019t safely hotdesk, stand side by side on a production line, or even queue up for lunch together in the canteen, the only realistic way of operating many offices and factories will be with far fewer people moving around the same space.</p> <p>For some, that might just mean more working from home. But how does, say, a fast-food restaurant kitchen churn out the same number of burgers with less than half the staff? The best employers will move heaven and earth to protect their people, but for some the obvious answer is automating, and slashing the wage bill.</p> <p>What has saved many jobs until now is that new technology tends to be expensive and disruptive, annoying customers. But disruption is the new norm, and if lockdown has intensified a craving for human contact it\u2019s also left both businesses and customers strapped for cash.</p> <p>Online yoga at home can\u2019t match the conviviality of a live class, but if it\u2019s cheaper and safer than going to the gym, people might settle for it. This week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/british-airways-plans-to-make-up-to-12000-staff-redundant\">mass redundancies at British Airways</a>, meanwhile, reflect the harsh reality that the days of middle managers hopping unthinkingly on a plane to Brussels or Frankfurt probably aren\u2019t coming back. Weeks of being forcibly grounded have taught companies that video meetings have their drawbacks, but they\u2019re cheap by comparison. What could have been a gentle managed decline for aviation, driven by the climate crisis, now looks like more of a crash landing with knock-on consequences for others reliant on business travellers: hotel chains, cab drivers, expense-account dining. It has never just been about robots taking work from humans, but technology reinventing processes in ways that mean the work is no longer there to be done.</p> <p>Like every technological revolution before it, this one will surely bring some changes that genuinely enhance our lives, even some that may protect us from shocks to come. We\u2019d barely have survived this one if it hadn\u2019t been for the high-speed broadband that makes working from home feasible, or the consolations of Zoom calls and family WhatsApp groups, and this time the race for tests and vaccines may drive valuable innovation in pharmaceutical industries. But the coming turmoil will be tough on the low paid and low skilled, on older workers who don\u2019t have years left to rethink their choices, on people whose lives were already precarious and now will get more so. The economist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/29/ten-reasons-why-greater-depression-for-the-2020s-is-inevitable-covid\">Nouriel Roubini warns </a>ominously of a new wave of automation \u201cfurther fanning the flames of populism, nationalism and xenophobia\u201d as wages are forced down all over again.</p> <p>The idea that taxing our new tech overlords, and redistributing the money to support a happy life of leisure for all, will resolve all this is comforting but scarcely credible. A major rethink of tax and welfare systems will obviously be part of the answer. But a universal basic income can\u2019t realistically be high enough to guarantee the good life for everyone, and lockdown has taught us there\u2019s only so much sourdough most people can bake before starting to crave something real to do.</p> <p>There are no easy answers here, only the grim certainty that if politicians don\u2019t start grappling seriously with the question then once again they risk being overtaken by events. Britain planned for a pandemic like this for years, but still wasn\u2019t ready for it. Don\u2019t let the same be true of its aftermath.</p> <p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Congressional Republicans rejected funding for the postal service in the latest stimulus bill, as Trump called it a \u201cjoke\u201d and claimed it undercharges Amazon for its packages (his administration has debunked this) on account of his personal obsession with Jeff Bezos for owning the Washington Post.</p> <p>The postal service, crucial for mail-in voting, has seen volume drop by a third, more than 1,200 workers out with coronavirus and many more concerned about lack of basic supplies and protections on the job.

It\u2019s a public good,\u201d Bee said. \u201cExpecting the post office to turn a profit is like expecting public libraries to sell the right to use their bathroom.\u201d</p> <h2>Trevor Noah</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1255692600343883776\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A look at how COVID-19 is wreaking havoc on the food supply chain around the world: <a href=\"https://t.co/IPqV4wAKmg\">pic.twitter.com/IPqV4wAKmg</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1255692600343883776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 30, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah addressed food supply fears, as meat-processing plants across the country shut down due to coronavirus updates. Earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/trump-executive-order-meat-processing-plants-coronavirus\">Trump signed an executive order</a> under the Defense Production Act to keep some processing plants open and running at maximum capacity. \u201cYou know, I will say this about Trump: he is very clear about what his priorities are in life,\u201d said Noah. \u201cBecause he was warned for months about the pandemic coming to America and he did practically nothing. But you tell the man once that there could be a beef shortage and he springs into action like the world\u2019s hungriest superhero.\u201d</p> <p>Still, few places in America have experienced higher rates of coronavirus than meat-processing plants. And \u201calthough there doesn\u2019t seem to be a danger to the food itself, in most of these facilities, the workers are quite literally putting their lives on the line\u201d. At many plants, several thousand employees work in close proximity; workers have alleged they were given hairnets to use as face masks.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really sad that these workers are being forced to keep the food chain going but nobody is being forced to protect them while they do it,\u201d Noah concluded. \u201cThey need equipment to keep safe while doing their jobs. And if you eat meat, you especially should want these workers to be treated right, because without them, the only way you\u2019ll get your bacon is if you fight the pig yourself.\u201d</p>",
  "<h2>JOS\u00c9 IT AIN\u2019T SO</h2> \n<p>How the mighty have fallen. Fifteen years ago today, Jose Mourinho delivered Chelsea\u2019s first title in 50 years. He was the best manager in the world, adored by his players, with a roguish twinkle in his eye, a Clooneyish flash of grey in his hair and face muscles that still worked. Now he\u2019s delivering vegetables. Sure, there\u2019s a global pandemic and all that, but the Fiver is merely following the scien- sorry, stating the facts. In 2005, Mourinho was the best manager in the world. In 2020, he\u2019s a grocer\u2019s lackey, no better than David Moyes.</p> \n<p>And whether it\u2019s because of an incurable addiction to post-match interviews or a squeamishness about his own brain every time he handles a cauliflower, Mourinho is keen to get back to his day job. \u201cI miss football,\u201d he said in an exclusive interview with Vera, 72, while delivering some artichokes and tatsoi. \u201cBut I prefer to say I miss our world, like I think we all do. Football is just part of my world.

We will need to be ready.</p> <p>Without a vaccine, nothing except isolation will be entirely risk-free but we can find solutions that minimise risk as much as possible. Perhaps if enough community testing is done to know the virus is not getting out of control, plus reduced capacities at stadiums, mandatory masks and plenty of gloves and hand sanitiser, there could be a way to go back to football while keeping the risk to our health at minimal levels.</p> <p>Testing of players will also be important to ensure their health and safety. Daily health checks can be done before training and, of course, matches: everything from resting heart rates to the colour of urine can be measured on a normal day, so I envisage regular testing for Covid-19 is more than feasible.</p> <p>Without wishing in any way to play down this virus, we need to look for ways to reopen as many sectors of our economy as possible and I believe in the absence of a vaccine there must be an acceptable level of risk.

I think everyone will have found it difficult sometimes to motivate players during lockdown but we have such a strong team of coaches, sports scientists and conditioning coaches that the players have always known exactly what to focus their training on.</p> <p>Away from work I have been feeling very grateful for what I have. Before this, people might not have appreciated simple things such as their gardens and fresh air, with roads quiet but nature speaking loudly. I\u2019m in the countryside and it has been beautiful to go on a long run and appreciate my surroundings. I have people I love around me who have kept me entertained and I have slowed my life right down.</p> <p>I think it is important to get to know yourself a bit better during this period of forced isolation. Technology has helped \u2013 Zoom and Microsoft Teams have become indispensable, and I\u2019ve also downloaded an app called MasterClass, which offers lessons from the leading people in their fields. Every week I am trying to learn something new. This week it is the art of negotiation by a leading FBI agent and a fashion leadership class by Anna Wintour.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/30/football-league-hopes-fading-over-finishing-season-amid-coronavirus-efl\">Football League hopes fading over finishing season amid coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Technology has its downsides as well. A couple of weeks ago I turned off Twitter completely: I wanted to control how much I\u2019m reading the depressing news, how often I\u2019m seeing the death tolls \u2013 while recovery rates were always difficult to find. I want to stay informed without it dominating my life.</p> <p>My days have a structure and a schedule and I am trying to go forward with a lot of positive energy but I think Twitter is a wholly negative platform. It seems full of hindsight geniuses, living in the past without trying to find solutions for today.</p> <p>We absolutely have to question the government and hold them to account, for example, but we also have to live our lives and be in control of the energy we need to do that in such a difficult time.</p> <p>Switching off Twitter has been a great decision, because it has given me the right head space and time to appreciate my health, my family and my surroundings. We are fortunate for even the smallest of things.</p>",
  "<p>Former Jacksonville Jaguars linebacker Telvin Smith has been arrested on a charge of unlawful sexual activity with certain minors.</p> <p>The 29-year-old Smith was booked into the Jacksonville sheriff\u2019s office jail around 5pm on Wednesday and was being held on a $50,003 bond.</p> <p>No details or police report was immediately available. According to Florida Statute 794.05, which was the listed charge in the jail log, unlawful sexual activity with certain minors is a second-degree felony and applies to any person age 24 or older who engages in sexual activity with a person 16 or 17 years old.</p> <p>\u201cThe Jaguars are aware of the report involving former linebacker Telvin Smith,\u201d the team said in a statement. \u201cThe club is unable to comment further on this ongoing investigation.\u201d</p> <p>Citing an anonymous law enforcement source, ESPN reported that Smith is accused of having sex with a 17-year-old girl multiple times, both at his home and in his vehicle, last August and September. The ESPN source said the victim told a friend and family member what happened after the first encounter with Smith. The source also said investigators found evidence in Smith\u2019s car linking him to the victim.</p> <p>Officers were at Smith\u2019s home on Nov. 27, and his SUV was towed. He was not arrested then.</p> <p>A fifth-round draft pick from Florida State in 2014 and a Pro Bowl selection in 2017, Smith announced last April that he was stepping away from football to \u201cget my world in order.\u201d</p> <p>Smith has 586 total tackles with 445 solo tackles, nine interceptions, 7\u00bd sacks and five forced fumbles in five seasons in Jacksonville. He\u2019s one of only 13 players in NFL history to record 100 or more tackles in each of their first five years in the league.</p> <p>He signed a four-year, $45 million extension in October 2017 that included $20 million guaranteed. He restructured that deal in March 2018, turning an $8 million roster bonus into a signing bonus to create extra cap space for the team.</p> <p>He walked away from $9.75 million last season and has three years remaining on his contract.</p> <p>The Jaguars fined Smith more than $88,000 for missing a mandatory minicamp in June. Smith avoided future fines by filing retirement paperwork with the NFL before training camp.</p> <p>Jacksonville placed him on the league\u2019s reserve/retired list, which paused his contract and freed up a roster spot. It also protected Smith from fines and NFL testing policies.</p>",
  "<p>The Treasury and UK banks are locked in tense discussions about the final terms of a new fast-tracked business loan scheme due to launch on Monday, as figures showed lenders have approved less than 50% of the applications for government-backed funding as part of the existing programme.</p> \n<p>The new \u201cbounce back\u201d loan scheme <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/sunak-backs-down-and-offers-small-firms-100-loan-guarantees\">was announced</a> by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, at the start of the week with some key details still to be ironed out, and is scheduled to become available on Monday. </p> \n<p>Some banks are concerned that the chancellor\u2019s pledge to distribute cash within 24 hours of receiving a funding request could prove unrealistic, and are still waiting to confirm the questions that will be included in the scheme\u2019s one-page application form. </p> \n<p>The Treasury is expected to force banks to offer a standardised interest rate or cap on the loans once the initial 12-month interest-free period runs out. That rate could be set as early as Friday once UK banks hand in their own pricing information, though there has been speculation that the number could end up around 2.5%. Neither of the existing government-backed loan schemes have involved capping rates.</p> \n<p>Some lenders are also worried that they may breach regulations by taking part in the scheme.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/apr/30/france-recession-covid-19-lockdown-economy-eurozone-ecb-us-job-lossess-business-live\">France and Italy fall into recession; US jobless claims hit 30m - business live</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Preparations are expected to continue throughout the weekend, according to industry sources, who said it could come down to the wire.

That equates to only 48% of the 52,807 businesses that have applied. By contrast, France said it expected to distribute \u20ac40bn (\u00a335bn) worth of loans to local businesses by the end of the month.</p> \n<p>The bounce back loan scheme offers 100% government-backed loans to small businesses worth up to 25% of their turnover, up to \u00a350,000. The standardised application, which is expected to be an online form, is expected to speed up the process for businesses affected by the Covid-19 outbreak and resulting lockdown.</p> \n<p>Lenders have been accused of dragging their heels on CBILS and being too slow to distribute the loans, which are 80% backed by the government. However, banks have said they have been carrying out the appropriate checks and have been working overtime to get money to customers.</p> \n<p>Banks are concerned they could be breaching regulatory duties to carry out affordability checks for their smallest business borrowers, who are protected by the Consumer Credit Act. Under those rules, banks have to make sure borrowers fully understand the terms of the loan, otherwise the loan contract could be cancelled.

  "<p>Bloody sci-fi shooter series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/sep/06/gears-5-review-thrills-kills-and-belly-laughs-in-a-refreshing-reboot\">Gears of War</a> and the term \u201ctactics\u201d may not seem like natural bedfellows, given that these games are best known for their macho space soldiers and chainsaw machine guns. Yet strategy has always played a far bigger role in the games than may be initially apparent. After all, the key innovation of the titles was to add cover-and-fire manoeuvres into a fast-paced action game. Gears Tactics simply inverts the emphasis. Whereas previously the tactical layer existed to complement the action, here all that gore greases the cogs of a smart and fiercely entertaining strategy machine.</p> <p>Set before the original Gears of War, Gears Tactics sees players control squads of soldiers led by two veterans of its seemingly eternal conflict: walking chin Gabe Diaz and weaponised moustache Sid Redburn. Together, they seek to eliminate a troublesome general of the Locust Horde, a race of brawny subterranean monsters who have taken over Earth.</p> <p>Gears of War\u2019s storytelling has always held ambitions somewhat beyond its ham-fisted reach, but if you\u2019ve previously enjoyed watching its slabs of virtual muscle do emotions, know that Tactics tells its story with pizzazz if not subtlety, featuring lovingly crafted cinematics, top-tier voice acting and some fairly major reveals for what is essentially a spin-off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdb1e385e8d8d21e7b64bf5b8f5f19f39924e93a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdb1e385e8d8d21e7b64bf5b8f5f19f39924e93a/0_41_3470_2082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gears Tactics\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Strategy that feels like action ... Gears Tactics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Microsoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indeed, Gears Tactics has lost little of the series\u2019s perennially high production values in the switch from shooter to strategy, boasting stunning visuals and slick animations alongside an incredibly intuitive interface. Also like earlier games, it is ferociously violent, with your soldiers frequently bursting and dismembering the Locust with bombs, bayonets and chainsaws.</p> <p>Gears Tactics is a strategy game designed to <em>feel </em>like an action game, and this philosophy goes beyond the sharp visuals and the viscera dispersion rate. Any given mission sees your squad pitted against a much larger number of Locust, with each side taking turns to move their units between cover and eliminate as many of the opposing force as possible. Your soldiers have a limited number of \u201caction points\u201d per turn. These can be used to move, shoot at an enemy or deploy special abilities such as \u201coverwatch\u201d, which lets you set up ambushes, firing at any enemy who wanders into its cone-shaped kill-zone.</p> <p>This foundation is familiar among tactics games, but Gears adds to it abilities such as \u201cexecutions\u201d, where theatrically killing an incapacitated enemy gives teammates an additional action point. Moreover, certain soldier-types sport powers such as \u201cbayonet charge\u201d, letting them rush across the battlefield to quickly take an enemy out of commission. Many abilities can be upgraded to provide free actions or even add actions to your pool. Some of the combinations you can pull off are truly exhilarating. In the late game, one of my snipers could pop the heads of a half-dozen Locust in a single turn.</p> <p>Gears Tactics constantly encourages players to push forward into battle, to be aggressive and daring and think on their feet. Yet, while boldness is often rewarded, recklessness will be punished severely. Even the lowliest Locust grunt can blast half a health bar off one of your soldiers, while together they create overlapping overwatch traps that need to be surgically dismantled to prevent your squad from being wiped out.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5eYR5Pu4Io\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M5eYR5Pu4Io?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The way the game injects pace and momentum into a traditionally slow-burn genre is its greatest success, so it isn\u2019t surprising that it is weakest when the pace falters. Gears Tactics lacks the broader strategic layer of games such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/apr/23/xcom-chimera-squad-review-pc-2k-games\">XCOM</a>, featuring instead a linear story campaign. This is the right call, but problems arise with the side missions embedded into this structure. Initially, they\u2019re a welcome opportunity to flex your tactical muscles, whether you need to hold two separate control points against assault, or retreat from an encroaching artillery barrage as the Locust try to slow you down. In the latter acts, however, Gears Tactics forces you to complete two or even three side missions before moving on to the next story beat.</p> <p>There is a logic to the idea \u2013 soldiers sent on one side-mission cannot be deployed in another, so you need to manage your squads carefully to ensure success. But it has the effect of slowing progress to a crawl when the story should be ramping up to the conclusion. There also aren\u2019t enough mission types to prevent a sense of repetition creeping into those final hours. The latter half of the third act is a slog when it should be a sprint.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Gears Tactics is a triumphant twist on an old favourite, capturing the fury and spectacle of its shooter-based brethren while also offering a more cerebral experience. Gears has always exhibited shades of American football, from the hypermasculine tone to its disconcertingly swole characters. Now it has the conspicuous brains to match its conspicuous braun.</p>",
  "<p>Being a relative of a care home resident today means guilt, frustration and fear. With close to 2,400 residents a week dying from the virus and predictions of a death toll higher than in hospitals, the anguish of not being able to hold loved ones is compounded by struggles to find out what is happening inside locked-down homes and concerns about exposure to the virus because of a lack of protective kit.

The 82-year-old had died 90 minutes earlier of suspected Covid-19 in a care home in Harrow. For weeks, the only contact between them had been a weekly 20-minute WhatsApp video call. That was all that the home would arrange for residents during lockdown. Now she insisted on seeing him one last time by video link.</p> <p>\u201cIt was just so weird,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are looking at him and someone else is holding the phone. I managed to take a couple of screenshots. I was in shock, I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d He looked blue, which she thought meant he had lacked oxygen before he died. He suffered from dementia, but otherwise had been reasonably healthy.</p> <p>Diana was full of praise for the care staff: \u201cThey are suffering just as much if not more than NHS staff. They have no protection for themselves but have had to watch the people who they have had a strong relationship with die without any medical care.\u201d</p> <p>She has been left feeling angry at the home\u2019s management, though, because after Harvey fell ill with a temperature and chest infection, she asked for daily calls with him and they did not happen.</p> <p>\u201cI feel absolutely gutted,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel completely lost. It is like a bad dream for me. I was not told he was going into a decline. They didn\u2019t tell me they thought he wasn\u2019t going to live. I could have spoken to him. I feel so let down by it all.\u201d</p> <p>She said his death was ascribed to dementia on the death certificate, but his symptoms and the speed of his decline indicated Covid-19. The last proper conversation she had with him was on the Thursday before Easter when he told her he didn\u2019t feel well.</p> <p>\u201cI told him I loved him and he told me he loved me.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Susan and Ruby Birch</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI have been sick with anxiety,\u201d said Susan Birch, whose mother, Ruby Birch, was diagnosed with Covid-19 on 22 April in her Birmingham care home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"80cb93c51cf6e96e3198bb374bdf9bb3396913b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80cb93c51cf6e96e3198bb374bdf9bb3396913b9/0_0_800_1200/667.jpg\" alt=\"Susan Birch, top, talking to her mother Ruby Birch by Skype in her care home\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Susan Birch, top, talking to her mother on Skype.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It did not help when the call came saying she was being placed into isolation so they could not speak to her for a week.

I have a keyboard and play Amazing Grace and we sing together.\u201d One day, Susan dug out a recording of her late father talking and played that back to her mother via Skype.</p> <p>The inability to find out what is happening in the home causes a lot of worry. Susan relies on \u201csnatched phone conversations with care workers\u201d. She does not understand why the manager has not contacted her.</p> <p>\u201cI saw care workers in the background in a Skype call a few weeks ago with zero PPE on,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are trying to source some from my husband\u2019s employer in Brighton.

It feels like whatever decision we take is not going to be right.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Katrina and Pat Wheeler</strong></h2> <p>On 20 April, Katrina Wheeler heard that coronavirus had entered the care home where her 81-year-old mother, Pat, lives 300 miles away. It meant Pat and the other residents would be confined to their rooms indefinitely.</p> <p>\u201cShe feels that she is imprisoned,\u201d said Katrina. \u201cShe knows why, but she can\u2019t make the connection with her being on her own.\u201d Pat, who has mental health difficulties, is struggling without being able to see her closest friend in the home, with whom she used to share much of her time.</p> <p>\u201cI feel guilty that I can\u2019t take her away from the environment and make her safe,\u201d said Katrina. She also spoke of difficulty getting information about how the outbreak is being handled.</p> <p>\u201cThey are not being forthcoming,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are probably extremely busy and it\u2019s the last thing on their mind, but information is really important in terms of what is going on.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday this week they were told that Pat was being tested for Covid-19 after showing symptoms.</p> <p>\u201cShe might not test positive but she is going to be in isolation until at least the end of the year,\u201d said Katrina. \u201cHow is she going to be able to cope with that?\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Cathy Gard</strong><strong>ner and Michael Gibson</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIt was just awful, it\u2019s devastating,\u201d said Dr Cathy Gardner. A carer at her father\u2019s care home 150 miles away had called twice to say her 88-year-old father, Michael Gibson, was deteriorating with probable Covid-19 and she should come.</p> <p>After driving as fast as they could from Devon to the care home in Bicester, Gardner and her husband decided they could not go in and risk her mother catching the virus. So they looked at Michael, a former superintendent registrar of births, marriages and deaths, through the window instead.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you expect the situation to be at the end of someone\u2019s life and you can\u2019t be there and you can\u2019t hold his hand,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cHe looked peaceful, the staff were brilliant but not being with him was terrible.\u201d</p> <p>He was living at the home in Bicester because he had severe Alzheimer\u2019s.</p> <p>He had a chest infection five weeks ago and the GP was worried it was coronavirus, but they did not travel to see him because of the lockdown.</p> <p>\u201cI felt guilty. I felt we should be doing the right thing and shouldn\u2019t make the journey. You don\u2019t want to break the rules. Then one of his carers phoned us to tell us to come. We waited a bit but then she phoned again and said she didn\u2019t think he would survive as she\u2019d seen this before. Her own father had died the week before in the room next to my dad.\u201d</p> <p>Gardner said four other residents had died at the home and the number might be higher. She felt her father\u2019s death could have been prevented and was critical of the lack of testing of staff and residents. \u201cIt should have been a matter of course for care homes.\u201d she said. \u201cThe most vulnerable sector of the population and you decide not to test. That\u2019s bordering on manslaughter, in my view.\u201d</p> <p>As for the urgent drive to Bicester, she said: \u201cI was glad I saw him, as he died the next evening.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Himani Weir and Octavia Jayasuriya</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1272daa28f7d211f31eb2c0978abba41c26636bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1272daa28f7d211f31eb2c0978abba41c26636bd/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Himani Weir.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Himani Weir.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Himani Weir now wishes she had broken her mother out of the care home in south-east London where she died of a confirmed case Covid-19 on 16 April. The last weeks were that difficult.</p> <p>For 18 months, Weir had visited Octavia Jayasuriya, 84, four times a week as she endured Parkinson\u2019s disease and heart problems. Then came the lockdown and her decline began.</p> <p>\u201cI felt immediately out of touch with my mother,\u201d Weir said. \u201cDuring the first week we were doing video calls and she was reassuring me that she was OK. But a week or so later I got very concerned when I saw her on a FaceTime video. She looked very unwell.\u201d</p> <p>The care home was not allowing visitors but she went with her daughters and saw her though the window.</p> <p>\u201cShe was looking terrible,\u201d she said. \u201cHer eyes were closed and none of the staff who were going in and out were in PPE. I raised my concern about that with the manager and she said that they were not wearing PPE until they saw symptoms with the residents.\u201d</p> <p>A resident had died of confirmed coronavirus in hospital and Weir was increasingly worried. By mid-April, staff were so concerned they called the family for an end-of-life visit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-tributes-and-memories\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-tributes-and-memories&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus-tributes-and-memories&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cI could see there were tears in her eyes,\u201d she recalled. \u201cShe was sad. She gave me a look and it was a look of unconditional love. If you could hug a person with your eyes, that\u2019s what she did.\u201d</p> <p>Weir was with her mother on the day she died and, while she feels the staff cared for her well, she is frustrated her mother died from the virus.</p> <p>\u201cI felt guilty and I felt confused because the information was patchy. I felt I\u2019d let my mum down. I would have kidnapped her, if I\u2019d known. She was a sitting duck and I told the manager after she died that I wish I\u2019d broken her out. She was trapped there.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Senior figures in the Trump administration have put pressure on US intelligence agencies to provide evidence supporting claims that the coronavirus outbreak originated in state-run laboratories in China, a report in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/us/politics/trump-administration-intelligence-coronavirus-china.html\">the New York Times claims</a>.</p> <p>Intelligence analysts fear Donald Trump is looking for propaganda to be used in the escalating blame game over whether China covered up the crisis or even generated the virus in its laboratories. </p> <p>Trump has claimed that China\u2019s handling of the pandemic is proof that Beijing \u201cwill do anything they can\u201d to make him lose his re-election bid in November and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-china-exclusive/exclusive-trump-says-china-wants-him-to-lose-his-re-election-bid-idUSKBN22C01F\">told Reuters</a> he was considering different forms of retaliation.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/30/trump-china-coronavirus-retaliation/\">Washington Post reported</a> that high-level meetings were under way in the White House to discuss options, including suing for compensation, which would involve stripping China of \u201csovereign immunity\u201d or cancelling debt obligations to China.</p> <p>The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has repeatedly suggested that the coronavirus could have come from a virology laboratory in Wuhan, after <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/14/state-department-cables-warned-safety-issues-wuhan-lab-studying-bat-coronaviruses/\">cables surfaced</a> from early 2018 in which US diplomats expressed concern about safety standards at the facility.</p> <p>The office of the director of national intelligence said in a statement on Thursday that it had concluded that the virus was \u201cnot manmade or genetically modified\u201d, but said that officials were still examining whether the origins of the pandemic could be traced to contact with infected animals or an accident at a Chinese lab.</p> <p>\u201cThe intelligence community [IC] also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified,\u201d said the statement. \u201cThe IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.\u201d</p> <p>Most scientists who have studied the genetics of the coronavirus provided by China say that the overwhelming probability is that it leapt jumped from animal to human in a non-laboratory setting, as was the case with previous pandemics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/trump-us-coronavirus-theory-china\">Trump fans flames of Chinese lab coronavirus theory during daily briefing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In recent days Trump and his allies have sharpened their rhetoric on China, accusing it of failing to act swiftly enough to stop the spread of the virus or sound the alarm about the outbreak.</p> <p>Those reported as pushing US intelligence agencies to lend credence to the theory that the virus was created in Chinese labs include the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, the deputy national security adviser, Matthew Pottinger, and Richard Grenell, the acting director of national intelligence.</p> <p>In numerous TV interviews, Pompeo has said China suppressed information on the virus and withheld key facts from the World Health Organization, and he has hinted that he believes the virus originated in Chinese laboratories.</p> <p>But the suggestion that intelligence agencies are being put under pressure to produce evidence represents a step up from such comments. Such a finding would turn the international disaster into something akin to biological warfare, or a lab accident of catastrophic proportions.</p> <p>More than 1 million people have been infected and more than 60,000 have died in the US from the virus, adding political urgency to Trump\u2019s desire to shift blame for the crisis on to China. </p> <p>China has been resisting an international inquiry into the origins of the outbreak in Wuhan and, under pressure, says it is a matter for the WHO to investigate. The proposal is unlikely to mollify Trump, who has condemned the WHO as Chinese-centric and has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/world-health-organization-why-has-trump-suspended-funding\">suspended US funding</a> from the UN agency pending a review.</p> <p>Chris Patten, the former governor general of Hong Kong and a long-term critic of Chinese efforts to control democracy in the former colony, has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/chris-patten-urges-uk-investigate-coronavirus-origins-china\"> joined the calls</a> for an international inquiry, accusing China of initially covering up the outbreak.</p> <p>The calls for an inquiry have been strongest in Australia, leading to a diplomatic confrontation between the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the Chinese ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye. The calls have also been supported by Winston Peters, New Zealand\u2019s foreign minister.</p> <p>Peters said: \u201cIt is very hard to conceive, no matter what country it is, of there not being a desire from every country around the world \u2013 including the country of origin \u2013 for an investigation to find out how this happened.\u201d</p> <p>Cheng has warned of a Chinese boycott of Australian goods and services.</p> <p>Beijing has been caught in a bind, with its diplomats sometimes saying it is not even clear whether the virus originated in China, contending that it is a legitimate matter for inquiry by scientists, but then rejecting an international inquiry into the source of the outbreak. Chinese diplomats distinguish between an international inquiry, which they say is likely to be a political blame game, and a dispassionate examination by WHO scientists.</p> <p>Critics of China counter that the WHO\u2019s record shows it has neither the will nor the investigative powers required to look deep into the entrails of the Chinese Communist party and expose any cover-up. The WHO is dependent on the cooperation of its member states for access and has no mechanism to punish countries that keep its officials in the dark.</p> <p>Proposals have been floated for the WHO to be given the power to impose sanctions on countries that are not transparent with it, but this proposal would need to pass the WHO\u2019s general assembly, and would require nation states handing over a degree of sovereignty to a multilateral body.</p> <p>The Chinese ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, delivered a lengthy rebuttal to the prospect of an international inquiry last week. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about independent investigation. It\u2019s up to the WHO. We support the WHO. We believe we should play by international norms and international rules, not by some other countries\u2019 rules. Some other country even sues China at its local court. It\u2019s absurd,\u201dhe said in remarks to the Asia Society in London.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not the first time that some politicians want to play world police. This is not the era of \u2018gunboat diplomacy\u2019. This is not the era when China was still in a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. This is the third decade of the 21st century. Those people cannot understand it. They think they still live in the old days when they can bully China and the world. If the WHO does not act their way, they stop their support and criticise the WHO to be \u2018China-centric\u2019. That\u2019s simply not right.</p> <p>\u201cSo we are calling for international cooperation. That\u2019s the only weapon and only way out to win this battle against the virus. Not by scapegoating, not by playing games, not by politicising the virus, not by spreading a political virus.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office said: \u201cCoronavirus is a global challenge and it\u2019s vital that countries come together to tackle this shared threat. The Foreign Secretary has been clear that, in time, we will need to learn lessons and ask rigorous questions about why this outbreak happened, why it couldn\u2019t be stopped earlier and what can be done to prevent another outbreak in future. This is something that we will look at with all of our international partners.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>On Friday morning when representatives of each of the Premier League\u2019s 20 clubs log on for the most heavily trailed conference call of the sporting lockdown, the question will concern how rather than when. How can the game be brought back into our lives as the Covid-19 crisis tramples over every aspect? How would it look logistically and ethically? The problem of timing is for another day and other people.</p> <p>It is seven weeks since the Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, became the first person in the Premier League to test positive for the virus, even if it feels like seven years and, amid a terrible sense of foreboding, everything suddenly stopped. The show must go on or, at least, it must find a way to return; somehow, any how. It was the mantra of the time. The season must be completed and resolve has endured, that sense of bloody-mindedness, certainly from executives at the top of the Premier League.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/29/premier-leagues-project-restart-what-is-it-and-is-it-feasible\">Premier League's Project Restart: what is it and is it feasible?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was and remains a good deal of reference to the integrity of the competition, a buzz phrase that shudders at the thought of an unfinished season and its repercussions, bringing to mind a fairness and purity around the topics of relegation and promotion.</p> <p>But bubbling close to the surface has been a fear that failure to play on will lead to huge financial losses and characters who are accustomed to getting their way seeking recourse via the courts. It is easy to make out the principal drivers and they do not sit comfortably alongside each other. In one corner is medicine; in the other, money.</p> <p>\u201cThis is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/28/premier-league-clubs-fear-becoming-scapegoats-if-game-returns-too-soon\">a very dangerous situation,\u201d Dr Michel D\u2019Hooghe</a>, the chair of Fifa\u2019s medical committee, said on Wednesday. \u201cIt is a fight between health and economic values.\u201d D\u2019Hooghe has worked as president of the Belgian Football Federation and Club Brugge. He knows both sides. Right now he is backing medicine and he says the season ought to end.</p> <p>The greatest worry for Premier League clubs is that, if it does, broadcasters whose riches drive the whole shooting match will demand refunds. The clubs are not as concerned about Sky and BT, having enjoyed a hugely fruitful partnership with the former in particular. It is the international companies that fund the overseas rights who may be more uncompromising.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc1c8cd9d17e3414f03c5525c811ea744b1bd70d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc1c8cd9d17e3414f03c5525c811ea744b1bd70d/0_305_4905_2946/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grounds such as Bournemouth\u2019s are being used to stockpile supplies for food banks while football waits to resume.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grounds such as Bournemouth\u2019s are being used to stockpile supplies for food banks while football waits to resume.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bournemouth/via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The worst-case scenario would be any broadcasters seeking to recoup the full value of their contracts for the season rather than a pro-rata refund based on matches unplayed. This would be based on the argument that an incomplete competition would be wholly devalued \u2013 a little like Wimbledon being halted in the quarter-finals. At the very least, there is a well understood theory in the broadcast industry that games have different values, with those at the end of a season often more significant and valuable than some at the start.</p> <p>It has been estimated clubs stand to lose around \u00a350m each, the lion\u2019s share from lost broadcast revenues, if the season is not completed. The breakdowns are different in the Football League, where gate money makes up a much greater percentage of turnover. Resuming behind closed doors would be economically crippling for each one, from the Championship leaders, Leeds, down.</p> <p>At the top end the money is the TV, which is why there is a desire to screen as many of the remaining 92 matches as possible, even behind closed doors, which would damage the spectacle for the viewer. The host stadiums that are selected \u2013 expected to be neutral ones \u2013 would have to be broadcast compliant and not only because the cameras at such grounds also support VAR. St George\u2019s Park, the national training centre, has been mentioned as a possible venue and the pitches there could be fitted with the requisite cameras, although this would be more challenging.</p> <p>The conference call will discuss Project Restart, with the use of neutral stadiums set to cause conflict. Some clubs will be unhappy at the loss of home advantage. The national lead for football policing, Mark Roberts, said on Wednesday there could be \u201cbenefits of playing at a neutral, controlled venue both from health aspects but also minimising any disruption to the police, ambulance service and other functions\u201d.</p> <p>Consensus is difficult to gauge but it appears most would prefer closed doors to no action at all. Clearly, football without fans is rubbish but imperfect or least-bad solutions are demanded.</p> <p>Hoped-for timeframes will be put forward, with clubs planning for a return to training on 11 May or 18 May before a possible restart on the weekend of 13-14 June with the domestic season to finish at the end of July \u2013 but, as with everything, this opens up other problems. What will group training look like? Moreover, how to accommodate players who are out of contract after 30 June? Could contracts be extended on a short-term basis? Would players want that, knowing how an injury could jeopardise a planned move?</p> <p>With money central to so much there have been accusations of clubs being guided by selfish agendas \u2013 for example, those above the relegation zone wanting the season to be annulled. But if it is all about the broadcast cash, surely there are solutions. Perhaps clubs could arrange loans from the TV companies secured against the solidity of future broadcast revenues. Maybe the broadcasters could be promised extra games next season.</p> <p>It would be interesting to see how many clubs would remain committed to finishing the season under difficult circumstances if a way could be found to advance the money they might lose. Nobody wants to play without crowds. Nobody wants to risk spreading the virus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/29/footballs-biggest-matches-should-be-played-at-neutral-grounds-police-say\">Football's biggest matches should be played at neutral grounds, police say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The risks and the what-ifs will frame Friday\u2019s talks, with a big one being the nightmare of a player or member of staff testing positive after the restart. This could mean quarantine for a club or clubs and the end of the competition.</p> <p>At the heart of everything is testing. Players would have to be tested regularly, as would the few hundred others who attend the sealed-off matches, but how would that be delivered and how could a sterile environment be maintained? Nobody in the game wants to be seen to be taking away tests from frontline workers and there will be those who consider it crass that football intends to return while there are so many problems regarding testing in the UK.</p> <p>In the end there is the knowledge that whatever happens on Friday, whatever common ground is found, it may count for nothing. What the government does next Thursday in terms of easing the lockdown or otherwise will shape the fate of the season. A prerequisite will surely be the relaxing of physical distancing because how could players challenge each other if the rest of the population had to remain two metres apart?</p> <p>Football is doing all it can to prepare for what would be the most sentimental of reunions. The obstacles remain oppressive.</p>",
  "<p>One of the most surprising reveals of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/oct/22/netflix-most-watched-tv-shows-films-figures\">last October\u2019s unprecedented Netflix data dump</a> was the astounding popularity of cheap psycho-thriller Secret Obsession. While the streamer proudly touted new films from Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, Paul Greengrass and the Coens in the same period, it was a no-star, dim-plotted slab of schlock that netted more viewers, with an estimated 40m households eager to find out just how secret that obsession really was. Modelled after a Lifetime TV movie (with a Lifetime TV director at the helm), it was an important victory for Netflix because it revealed a substantial audience for tiny-budgeted thrillers with generic titles, a bracket they could easily fill at little expense.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/30/the-half-of-it-review-netfix\">The Half of It review \u2013 charming Netflix teen comedy takes on Cyrano</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Which brings us to Dangerous Lies, a comically titled new thriller from the director of Fatal Lessons, Dangerous Heart and It\u2019s Christmas, Carol!, a similarly cheap yet not unenjoyable Friday night diversion. Originally called Windfall, the patchwork plot follows a young couple living on the breadline, or what a film such as this thinks is the breadline (their \u201clousy\u201d apartment is enviably spacious). In the first scene, we see Katie (Riverdale\u2019s Camila Mendes) and Adam (The Boys\u2019 Jessie T Usher) stumbling across an aborted robbery at the diner where she works. Adam shoots and kills the assailant and four months later, they\u2019re dealing with the aftermath. Katie is now working as a carer for Leonard (Elliot Gould), whose loneliness has made her an important part of his life. When he suddenly dies and the couple find a large stash of money in his house, they find themselves telling some \u2026 DANGEROUS LIES!</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzJJo0whbJ4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EzJJo0whbJ4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>If anything, that awful title helps to fill us in on exactly what to expect here, despite how generic it might be. This is the sort of low-rent, trope-filled thriller that used to exist on the bottom shelf of a video store, aiming for undemanding customers whose first, second and third choices were all rented out for the night. Taken as such, it\u2019s perfectly passable, a solidly made time-waster that drip-feeds its reveals with enough skill to keep us onboard, even as we sigh and rage at the characters for acting in increasingly dopey ways. It\u2019s one of those films where smart people do stupid things and the script, from Hallmark channel regular David Golden (whose credits include Finding Father Christmas, Engaging Father Christmas and Marrying Father Christmas), stretches credulity so far that the film frequently threatens to buckle under the weight of its characters\u2019 terrible choices.</p> <p>It\u2019s pacy enough to secure at least our divided attention, competently trotting along in the background revealing surprises that aren\u2019t really that surprising, like a pulpy, well-worn airplane novel that you guiltily devour in a day. You\u2019ll be wrapped up in the moment before poking through its many many holes seconds later. Mendes and Usher make for a charismatic pairing, there\u2019s some silly snarling from The OC\u2019s Cam Gigandet as a mysterious realtor, some concerned lawyering from Gotham\u2019s Jamie Chung and some embittered detecting from Dawson\u2019s Creek\u2019s Sasha Alexander, a low-paid parade of \u201cOh that one from that thing\u201d actors (strangely the weakest link is a frankly bored Gould, barely phoning it in).</p> <p>The familiarity of the title, the premise and the cast will all help to thrust it to big numbers, I imagine, and I\u2019m sure there are plenty of others like this on the way: clumsily titled, scrappily written and easily consumed. I just wish those lies had been a bit <em>more</em> dangerous \u2026</p> <ul> <li><p>Dangerous Lies is now available on Netflix</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>One particle of Covid-19 typically measures 100 nanometers in diameter. That is a ten-thousandth of a millimetre; invisible, in other words. But the virus has transformed how the world looks: the empty streets, the trail-free blue skies, the rainbow-decked windows \u2013 and the clothes we wear. <br><br>Clothes \u2013 not fashion, but clothes \u2013 have been on newspaper front pages for weeks. The public health and political crisis around PPE has filled our screens with arresting images of NHS workers in robes and visors. This is a human drama on an enormous scale, and in our highly visual culture, it calls for an image more vivid and more emotionally resonant more than any line graph. <br><br>Masks are, suddenly, all around us. Our lockdown wardrobes, a sartorial journal of emotions \u2013 first the run on tracksuits, then the pivot to video-call power dressing \u2013 is shifting into a new gear. With every passing day, my Instagram feed features fewer sweatshirts and more masks. As the world begins looking ahead to a post-lockdown world, face masks look set to play an increasingly central role in our lives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e22b93b2913d8075ced48286b58a557cab5f7b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e22b93b2913d8075ced48286b58a557cab5f7b0/0_379_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Off-White\u2019s face mask\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Off-White\u2019s face mask</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Off White</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The latest <a href=\"https://www.lyst.co.uk/the-lyst-index/2018/q3/?atc_campaign=UK+%3E%3E+Lyst&amp;atc_content=UK+%3E%3E+Lyst+%3E+Brand+-+Core+%5BExact%5D&amp;atc_country=UK&amp;atc_grouping=search&amp;atc_medium=cpc&amp;atc_source=google&amp;atc_term=lyst%20index&amp;sem_id=A962410059&amp;atc_remarketing=kwd-549158851563&amp;atc_label=bulksheet-2018/10/25&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsZyP_feN6QIVh63tCh21zwdtEAAYASAAEgJMe_D_BwE\">Lyst</a> Index, a quarterly report that analyses the behaviour of 9 million shoppers each month to track consumer demand, reports a 496% surge in searches for face masks in the last quarter, and names the Off-White arrow logo face mask \u2013 retail price $95 (\u00a375), now inevitably sold out \u2013 as the most coveted buy of the moment. Some analysts are suggesting that the face mask could overtake the trainer as the best-selling accessory for mass market fashion. <br><br>\u201dBest-selling accessory\u201d is, of course, deeply unsettling phrasing when discussing protection against a deadly disease. But the demand for face masks is about more than their efficacy, about which consensus remains elusive. Disposable gloves, which can play an important role in hygiene but are not in our eyeline in the way that masks are, have a low profile by comparison. Mask-wearing is not just about doing the right thing, but about being seen to do it. Mask-wearing, unfamiliar in British culture, is becoming more common as people find that the embarrassment of being the only person in the supermarket without a mask outweighs the self-consciousness of wearing one. In the pavement-dance of physical distancing, a mask is a way of signalling to others that you are a responsible citizen \u2013 not the runner to barge sweatily past others, nor the shopper who squeezes all the melons while breathing heavily.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8444d2429381ed02d4e0273321db1be5dcf6dce2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8444d2429381ed02d4e0273321db1be5dcf6dce2/0_0_2128_2660/800.jpg\" alt=\"A Christopher Kane mask\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Christopher Kane mask</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fashion has always been about both fitting in and standing out. Mask wearing can be a way of pledging allegiance to good citizenship \u2013 like wearing a poppy in the first week of November, or a T-shirt in support of the NHS \u2013 and an opportunity for self-expression. There are sleek high-tech masks and there are sweetly homespun ones; there are designer logo masks and sloganned high-street ones. Jeans, running shoes, even sunglasses: many of fashion\u2019s hero products have utilitarian roots. Although where mandated by law as it already is in some regions, the mask will bring new meaning to the phrase \u201cmust-have\u201d. <br><br>The New York-based fashion brand Collina Strada is selling brightly coloured masks fastened with ribbon-trailing bows, made from deadstock fabric from past collections. The masks, which have an opening to insert a filter, retail for $100; for every one sold, the brand donate five to healthcare workers. A note on the website adds: \u201cIf you or a loved one is sick and this is out of your price range, please reach out to us directly we have other masks available to send to you at no charge.\u201d</p> <p>Fashion can be tone deaf at moments such as this. Boohoo was quick to market with jaunty \u00a35 fabric masks, with the slogans \u201cEat, sleep, isolate, repeat\u201d or \u201cIf you can read this, you\u2019re too close\u201d, but withdrew them swiftly after a backlash. But many designers want to put their skillset to good use, rather than plunder panic for profits. The independent London fashion week designer Christopher Kane offered on Instagram to post unused fabric and a simple mask-making pattern to anyone who asked. Having now fulfilled thousands of requests, the studio has used up all its fabric, but has made the pattern <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2020/04/30/Christopher_Kane_Mask_Pattern.pdf\">available to download</a>, so that you can make a mask at home with any cotton fabric, and ribbon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e5a3f1a0d246bc7af104b3413b04200ee546ab7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e5a3f1a0d246bc7af104b3413b04200ee546ab7/50_106_1421_1421/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edeline Lee mask\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alena Bramall wears a face mask by Edeline Lee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Bramall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Edeline Lee, another young London fashion week talent, whose dresses are worn by Olivia Colman and Taylor Swift, has launched a nonprofit mask project selling <a href=\"https://edelinelee.com/products/pack-of-three-masks\">packs of three masks for \u00a324</a>. Instead of cotton, Lee\u2019s masks are made from nonwoven spunbound polyproylene, the fluid-resistant, breathable fabric used to make surgical masks. Each purchase covers the cost of a further 80 masks sent to frontline workers who, Lee says, can wear them over their officially issued respirators to make them last longer. <br><br>On the Edeline Lee Instagram feed, the masks can be seen in elegant black and white, shot by a husband-and-wife team of photographer and model and styled over Zoom. A fashion statement and a statement of solidarity are not, it seems, mutually exclusive. <br></p>",
  "<p>In 2018 I published a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/11/my-year-rest-relaxation-ottessa-moshfegh-review\">novel</a> about a young woman in New York City who doesn\u2019t leave her apartment. It was an interesting premise to me at the time, Manhattan being a place where daily living has much to do with going out and mixing with people, witnessing and being witnessed, taking part in the collective excitement of being alive.</p> <p>I wondered just how jaded, depressed, antisocial, irreverent and irritable one must be to want to hide from life to such an extreme. I figured this character must be suffering deeply, so I built her backstory to include a cold, drunk, critical mother and a sterile, unfeeling father. And then I killed them, just to make my protagonist even worse off. She doesn\u2019t want to feel the resulting grief of being orphaned in her 20s, so she tries to bypass it by sleeping. She theorises that if she spends long enough asleep, her cells will regenerate the number of times necessary for them to forget the memory of trauma they\u2019ve stored inside. If grief were an illness, sleep is the cure.</p> <p>To be asleep is to retire into a space of interiority, to allow the body to rest and recuperate, to let the subconscious work out the kinks of life lived on the outside. Sleep is necessarily private. We don\u2019t communicate or move much (usually). Sleep requires little effort. I think that\u2019s why it made for such an appealing method by which my protagonist could heal.</p> <p>In dreams, we mine ourselves for wisdom that we can\u2019t access with our conscious mind. And there is something ineffable about that wisdom. We can attempt to recount our dreams narratively upon awakening, but it\u2019s nearly impossible to do it accurately. Dreams are more poems than short stories, but I think they have a fabulist, parabolic quality that makes them feel like allegory, even though the who-what-where of them might seem random to anyone but the dreamer: we each dream in a language peculiar to our own lives. Equally, sleep is a universe of self.</p> <p>It was obvious that the protagonist in my novel would need to self-isolate in order to achieve her goal of self-renewal. She elects to go into isolation for personal reasons, not in a response to social distress, a terrorist attack or a plague. She is in control. At any moment she could wake up and decide to go to the movies, or to get drunk at a bar, or to go to a museum or a restaurant or a casino. She simply doesn\u2019t want to.</p> <p>Her isolation is very different from that in which we find ourselves in the middle of this Covid-19 pandemic. We are isolating ourselves away from illness. My protagonist is isolating herself towards wellness.</p> <p>Thinking of this novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/22/my-year-of-rest-and-relaxation-ottessa-moshfegh-review\">My Year of Rest and Relaxation</a>, I am experiencing a bit of whiplash \u2013 my creative and professional life jerking back at me like a prophecy gone very wrong. On the one hand, the coronavirus has given me the greatest excuse to indulge in my biggest personality defect: I\u2019m an isolator. Outside of my professional responsibilities, I tend to disengage from society. A lot. As a writer, yes, and as a person, I thrive at home by myself. A meeting or public event, or even a coffee date with a friend, can inspire resentment in me for having to break up the quietude and steadfast immersion into my own mind with some real-life experience. Of course, it\u2019s the real-life experience that largely influences my personal development and my creative writing. One can\u2019t exist in a vacuum. Except, actually, you <em>can</em> \u2013 provided with enough food, water and toilet paper \u2013 if you\u2019re lucky.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/29/portuguese-authors-collaborate-on-serial-lockdown-novel\">Portuguese authors collaborate on serial lockdown novel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Until the shutdown, I had agency in deciding to what degree I wanted to isolate. Now I am just thrust into it, full stop. I haven\u2019t driven my car in six weeks. I haven\u2019t seen anyone but my husband and a few distant neighbours. I\u2019m taking advantage of this time for sure \u2013 finishing up projects, starting a new one. And without the outside world to inspire me, I\u2019m focused on my immediate surroundings and my inner world. Of course, all those coffee dates with friends, cancelled at the last minute because I was \u201cbusy at home\u201d, are haunting me now.</p> <p>\u201cDoing time\u201d is what we call a sentence in a penal institution. I like to recall what a former prison inmate told me when I asked him what it was like living in solitary confinement: go into your bathroom and lock the door and don\u2019t leave. I tried it. About six minutes in, I started to panic. If I was any good at meditation, maybe I could have actually left my body. I told myself to imagine sun-kissed beaches, puppies, my living room, my mother\u2019s hands, a field of flowers. But the entrapment laced every thought with menace. I got dark inside. Even as someone who has made a career out of her \u201cdark\u201d imagination, I didn\u2019t like it in there. I lasted 10 minutes. And I left, angry with myself that I wasn\u2019t better at thinking nice thoughts.</p> <p>One day this pandemic will be in the past tense. We will look at this time with distance, and sadness, and relief. We will suffer from other things then. And we will try to piece out how the experience of self-isolation changed us. Did we take advantage of it? Were we even able to? Did we enjoy being with our families, or did we want to hide even from them? Did we actually unplug, or did we plug in harder? Did a break from society free us from a system that holds us captive, slaves to commerce and media? Or did time outside of the system paralyse us? Are our minds really free?</p> <p>My dreams these days are about my husband falling out of love with me. I wake up desperate and shaky, imploring him to confirm that he has not abandoned me while I\u2019ve been asleep. \u201cI love you,\u201d I say. \u201cDo you still love me?\u201d I understand that this is my mind resting on the only real thing it knows outside of itself: love. Without it, life is just \u201cdoing time\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 Ottessa Moshfegh is the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/my-year-of-rest-and-relaxation-9781784707422.html\">My Year of Rest and Relaxation</a></p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>A watchdog has dropped its misconduct investigation into Greater Manchester police\u2019s handling of a case involving the death of a schoolboy in Cheshire.</p> <p>Yousef Makki, 17, a scholarship pupil at Manchester Grammar school, died after being stabbed by his friend Joshua Molnar, 18, during a fight in Hale Barns on 2 March last year.</p> <p>Molnar claimed the incident was self-defence and was acquitted of murder and manslaughter by a jury after a trial at Manchester crown court last July, but he admitted lying to police and possession of a knife. He was given 16 months in custody.</p> <p>Makki\u2019s family had said they were \u201cextremely\u201d unhappy with investigations carried out by both Cheshire police and Greater Manchester police (GMP) around the case, and the forces referred themselves to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).</p> <p>On Thursday, the IOPC said the GMP investigation had been discontinued.</p> <p>Amanda Rowe, the regional director of the IOPC, said the investigation, which began in February, was discontinued after no evidence was found of \u201cpotential misconduct by any individual officer\u201d.</p> <p>She added: \u201cWe also assessed GMP\u2019s own review of its murder investigation and acknowledge that a number of changes to its procedures will be implemented as a result of learning recommendations made. Taking these factors into consideration, our investigation has been discontinued and the force has been informed.</p> <p>\u201cOn 27 April we spoke to Yousef Makki\u2019s family to inform them of this development. Our thoughts and sympathies remain with them.\u201d</p> <p>The investigation into Cheshire constabulary\u2019s response to incidents before Makki\u2019s death continues.</p> <p>At a pre-inquest hearing this year, Matthew Stanbury, representing the Makki family, said matters surrounding the teenager\u2019s death \u201chave not been sufficiently aired\u201d and some things put before the trial jury were \u201cpresented on a false premise\u201d.</p> <p>Amy Caves, representing Cheshire police, told the hearing the force was concerned with \u201congoing criminal investigations\u201d involving \u201ctwo robberies and an assault\u201d, but no further details were made public during the hearing.</p> <p>The coroner, Alison Mutch, told the family if a final inquest was held, by law it could not come to a conclusion \u201cinconsistent with the findings of a criminal court\u201d.</p> <p>Adam Chowdhary, 18, a second defendant who went on trial alongside Molnar, was acquitted of perverting the course of justice. He was given a four-month detention order after admitting possession of a flick knife. Both he and Molnar were acquitted of conspiracy to commit robbery in the lead-up to Makki\u2019s death.</p> <p>The decision to discontinue the investigation came after a lengthy meeting with Makki\u2019s family, the Crown Prosecution Service, GMP and Cheshire police at the end of January.</p> <p>In a statement, the family said they remained \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that the findings of the separate investigation into Cheshire police may provide them with the accountability they sought from the authorities, at a time when their \u201cconfidence feels like it has hit an all-time low\u201d.</p> <p>The statement added: \u201cAt present, the coronavirus outbreak is making it extremely difficult for families like ours to get justice for their loves ones, in part due to the delay in legal proceedings and the need for us all to self-isolate. </p> <p>\u201cThe added isolation we are all experiencing at this time does, on bad days, prove challenging to remain \u2026 strong \u2013 but with our extended family, friends, supporters and legal team remaining committed to fighting to get justice for Yousef, we remain hopeful that a full inquest into Yousef\u2019s death will go ahead to uncover the answers our family so desperately deserve, in the short term. The fight must go on.\u201d </p>",

  "<h2>20. Beauty and the Beast (2017)</h2> <p>Stanley Tucci plays Maestro Cadenza in this recent version of Beauty and the Beast, a florid and neurotic musical star who, at the beginning of the film, is transformed into a harpsichord, while his wife, played by Audra McDonald, is mortifyingly turned into a wardrobe. A cartoony cameo-sketch playing on Tucci\u2019s gift for uptight, diva-ish roles.</p> <h2>19. The Road to Perdition (2002)</h2> <p>A classic, and perhaps rather basic supporting character turn for Tucci, the sort of unpromising role that he invests with authority. In Sam Mendes\u2019s 30s mob drama, he plays Frank Nitti, the Chicago wiseguy who has to reject an overture from Mafia footsoldier Mike Sullivan, played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/26/tom-hanks-25-best-performances-ranked\">Tom Hanks</a>. A solid, but unremarkable Tucci turn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/23/stanley-tucci-negroni-video\">Why is Stanley Tucci making a negroni so hot? I decided to investigate</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>18. A Modern Affair (1995)</h2> <p>A very rare example of Tucci getting an alpha-romantic lead role, in which his iconic baldness signifies old-school virility. He plays the philandering photographer who has donated sperm to a fertility lab, and then finds himself being (illegally) tracked down by the woman (Lisa Eichhorn) who has got pregnant by his seed and now wants to have a real relationship with the father of her child \u2013 to his bemused dismay.</p> <h2>17. Swing Vote (2008)</h2> <p>Here is Tucci in pure comic cynical-bad-guy role, the sort of thing that has been his bread and butter during his career, although he can do so much more. He plays the ruthless campaign manager of a US presidential candidate, played by Kelsey Grammer, who is horrified to learn that the poll is so close that it hinges on just one guy: an amiably clueless good ol\u2019 boy, played by Kevin Costner, who isn\u2019t sure how he\u2019s going to vote. And so Costner\u2019s innocence comes up against Tucci\u2019s reptilian corruption.

A Little Chaos (2014)</h2> <p>Tucci roles divide into wig and non-wig and this, with Alan Rickman directing, is very much the first category. He is Philippe, Duc d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans, the roguish brother of Louis XIV (played by Rickman himself), who wears a long flowing tonsorial creation under a similarly lavish hat. He also has a playful quasi-Brit accent to emphasise how louche and racy he is supposed to be, exchanging waspish badinage with everyone at court.</p> <h2>15. The Hunger Games (2012)</h2> <p>There have been some jaw-dropping wig roles for Tucci in his career, and this has to be the most outrageous, which also foregrounds his gift for the menacing and sinister. In The Hunger Games, he plays Caesar Flickerman, the smoothie blue-haired TV celebrity whose job is to interview the gladiatorial contestants (such as Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s Katniss Everdeen) before they go out to face certain death. His creepy blue wig is complemented by fake teeth.</p> <h2>14. Julie &amp; Julia (2009)</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/27/nora-ephron\">Nora Ephron</a>\u2019s film is the second (and less successful) pairing of Tucci with Meryl Streep. Here he plays Paul Child, a smart, discreet and very masculine character who is a US diplomat in Paris in the 1950s, married to the eccentric and forceful Julia Child, played, of course, by Streep. He is gently tolerant and affectionate about her search for a real pastime. When she becomes a star of cooking, he must take a back seat that\u2019s even further back. Tucci handles this supporting role with gallantry and aplomb.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"74ffafbf6e283445e22b16dcb4ec67939ec171d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74ffafbf6e283445e22b16dcb4ec67939ec171d9/0_137_1600_1990/804.jpg\" alt=\"Stanley Tucci with Meryl Streep in Julie & Julia\" width=\"804\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As Paul Child with Meryl Streep as Julia in Julie &amp; Julia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Columbia Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>13. Monkey Shines (1988)</h2> <p>George A Romero\u2019s horror classic gives Tucci a juicy but small villainous role. He plays Dr John Wiseman, the obnoxious, incompetent and philandering surgeon whose mistakes cause a law student to become paralysed. And when this man gets a trained monkey to help him with his daily tasks, he finds that this monkey can carry out acts of revenge, which is bad news for Dr Wiseman.</p> <h2>12. Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)</h2> <p>So many actors find that superhero roles are a career must, and perhaps Tucci will one day play a great supervillain. However, he had another potent supporting role in this MCU adventure, laying out the origin of Steve Rogers\u2019s Captain America. He is Dr Abraham Erskine, a mysterious German scientist at a military recruiting station \u2013 and a refugee from the Nazis \u2013 who spots Steve and sees the potential in him.</p> <h2>11. Submission (2017)</h2> <p>Here is another of the louche, sexually calculating and slightly smug roles that Tucci knows so well how to play, bringing something unexpectedly sympathetic to the table \u2013 and it\u2019s one of his rare lead roles. Tucci is the creative writing professor and failed novelist who is appallingly and humiliatingly attracted to a student, who submits to him \u2013 and there, incidentally, is the title pun \u2013 the first chapter of a novel she is writing. The chaotic sex scene is rich in disaster for this conceited middle-aged male.</p> <h2>10. Deconstructing Harry (1997)</h2> <p>Perhaps it was always Tucci\u2019s destiny to play the quasi-Woody Allen character in a Woody Allen film, but he does it without an out-and-out impersonation, probably because Allen himself is in the picture. Tucci plays the writer Paul Epstein, who is, in fact, a character who has sprung from the mind of writer Harry Block (played by Allen) and clearly a cipher for Harry. Tucci has some nice scenes opposite Demi Moore, who plays his former therapist, now wife, who becomes an increasingly devout in her Judaism \u2013 although, again, Tucci is a little upstaged.</p> <h2>9. Spotlight (2015)</h2> <p>Here is another type of role that Tucci was born to play \u2013 the tough, overworked, slightly eccentric lawyer who takes on pro bono work to fight for the underdog; his hairpiece here has something frizzy, wiry and greying. Tucci plays the real-life attorney Mitchell Garabedian, who represented people who were abused as children by Catholic priests in Boston but then found powerful vested interests associated with the church were closing ranks against him. The press, in the form of Mark Ruffalo, ride to his assistance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8ce094c1600f3e214393e425e67bd07e1458703e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ce094c1600f3e214393e425e67bd07e1458703e/2_0_1690_1014/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stanley Tucci stars alongside Emma Thompson in The Children Act\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A smart pairing: Tucci stars alongside Emma Thompson in The Children Act.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/BBC Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>8. The Children Act (2017)</h2> <p>Tucci and Emma Thompson is a smart pairing, so much so that it is a surprise that they haven\u2019t worked together more often. Here, he plays Jack, an academic, who is discontented with his marriage to Fiona, a workaholic high court judge, played by Thompson. Depressed by the declining intimacy in their marriage, but declaring his intention to be honest, he tells her he is thinking of having an affair \u2013 if that\u2019s all right with her. It\u2019s a strange, complex role: sympathetic in a way, but asking your wife\u2019s permission for an affair is curious. Tucci carries the contradictions well.</p> <h2>7. Easy A (2010)</h2> <p>Here is the kind of seductive, persuasive, humorous supporting performance that is a keynote of Tucci\u2019s career. In this comedy inspired by Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/06/scarlet-letter-nathaniel-hawthorne-100-best-novels\">The Scarlet Letter</a>, Tucci plays Dill, the liberal, understanding father of a high-school student, Olive (played by Emma Stone), and married to Rosemary (played by Patricia Clarkson). As the parents, the two have a lovely chemistry. It is when Olive becomes the centre of gossip at her school that her parents (chiefly her mum) have to take an interest. Tucci and Clarkson have great family scenes in the kitchen and it\u2019s entirely plausible that smart, funny Tucci is Emma Stone\u2019s dad.</p> <h2>6. Margin Call (2011)</h2> <p>This JC Chandor drama about the 2008 financial crash features Tucci as Eric Dale, the head of risk analysis at an investment bank who is laid off at the very beginning of the film. The humiliation of a proud, difficult man is well conveyed by Tucci. But his character is in possession of a terrible secret that had been revealed by the research he had been doing: the bank is horribly overextended in its investment positions and could collapse at any moment. Eric is now caught between still wanting to warn people inside the firm, and being quite content to let the whole thing go.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"942f6eac797d368c43d2dc5bf882d7752ae22616\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/942f6eac797d368c43d2dc5bf882d7752ae22616/0_51_2465_1479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stanley Tucci as Puck with Rupert Everett as Oberon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mischievous: Tucci as Puck with Rupert Everett as Oberon in A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5. A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream (1999)</h2> <p>Tucci fans are crying out for the great man to be given a big Shakespearian role on screen: something like Claudius in Hamlet or maybe Brutus or Coriolanus from the Roman plays. Puck in A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream is a nice role for Tucci nevertheless. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,85170,00.html\">At the time</a>, I thought Michael Hofmann\u2019s version of the play, starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Rupert Everett as Titania and Oberon with Kevin Kline as Bottom, was a bit chocolate boxy, but it has a charm that I perhaps overlooked. Puck is a relatively innocuous figure in the film, and Tucci plays him as something like a Martian, but with tiny horns. Of course, Tucci has always been a Puckish figure in films generally, someone with a propensity for mischief.</p> <h2>4. Shall We Dance (2004)</h2> <p>Here is one of the outrageous Tucci comedy extravaganzas, one of the few films that really taps into his gift for broad humour, his physicality, and indeed makes a comic point about his legendary baldness. Tucci plays Link, the office colleague and pal of Bobby, played by Richard Gere. When Bobby signs up for ballroom dance lessons because he is in love with a woman there (Jennifer Lopez), he discovers to his astonishment that Link is a secret ballroom enthusiast and there is an amazing dance-contest scene in which Link throws away an absurd wig and, reinvigorated by his public baldness, dances a spectacular cha-cha-cha and pasodoble. The scene is cleverly shot to flatter Tucci\u2019s dancing skills and his lean frame looks good in his figure-hugging catsuit with flame motif.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05b7fd135c5f2eeac1de8175c124d11995b7ea3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05b7fd135c5f2eeac1de8175c124d11995b7ea3a/110_0_1928_1157/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stanley Tucci as the serial killer George Harvey in The Lovely Bones\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Creepy: Tucci as the serial killer George Harvey in The Lovely Bones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Dreamworks SKG</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3. The Lovely Bones (2009)</h2> <p>Throughout his film career, Tucci has kept really villainous typecasting at a careful arm\u2019s length, although on TV he notably played the creepy and possibly murderous philanthropist Richard Cross in Steven Bochco\u2019s pioneering long-form TV drama Murder One and got a Golden Globe for playing the Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in the TV movie <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/recommends/watch/conspiracy-a-withering-study-of-nazis-in-a-room\">Conspiracy</a>. In Peter Jackson\u2019s movie version of Alice Sebold\u2019s novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/aug/11/fiction.features2\">The Lovely Bones</a> he plays a serial killer \u2013 the murderer responsible for the death of Saoirse Ronan\u2019s character, with whom he has an excruciating, all-but-unwatchable scene as he lures the innocent young girl into his lair. This is the performance that got Tucci his Academy Award nomination and perhaps it is precisely because Tucci always manages to get humanity and charm into his \u201cbad guy\u201d performances that he is a good fit with this role. His murderer is not just a cartoon sweaty creep but someone who could, however briefly and unconvincingly, convey something sufficiently amiable or avuncular to get away with his monstrous murders.</p> <h2>2. The Devil Wears Prada (2006)</h2> <p>For many, this will always be the classic Tucci performance: at the age of 46, he nailed a glorious comic role that won the hearts of audiences young and old, male and female. He plays Nigel Kipling, the fastidious, quick-tempered, but warm-hearted art director who works at the super-prestigious Manhattan fashion bible Runway, effectively a lieutenant to Runway\u2019s terrifying editor Miranda Priestly, played by Meryl Streep. (The story was based on Anna Wintour at Vogue.) It is Nigel who has to explain the workings of the magazine to the wide-eyed newbie played by Anne Hathaway, and he appears to be the only person who is not totally terrified of Miranda. With marvellous brio and technique, Tucci shows us who Nigel is \u2013 the smalltown boy who idolised fashion at a young age and, for all his airy sophistication, is still thrilled, every day, to be working at Runway. But he is also the vulnerable, lonely man who is deeply hurt when Miranda appears to be grooming him for a top job only to take it away from him at the last moment for her own machiavellian reasons. A Tuccissimo film.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f50af4d34309b5844e3781a21834fa9e628688b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f50af4d34309b5844e3781a21834fa9e628688b7/0_36_1746_1048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stanley Tucci with Tony Shalhoub in Big Night\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Primo e Secondo: Tucci (right) with Tony Shalhoub in the foodie magnum opus Big Night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Samuel Goldwyn Company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>1. Big Night (1996)</h2> <p>The whole online world is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/23/stanley-tucci-negroni-video\">thrilling to Stanley Tucci\u2019s lockdown videos showing how to make perfect cocktails</a> \u2013 but he has always had a certain theatrical savoir faire around a kitchen. And this foodie film has to be his magnum opus, the passion project he co-wrote and also co-directed with Campbell Scott, a longtime friend and colleague. Tucci himself starred with Tony Shalhoub (another close friend) playing two Italian immigrant brothers, called respectively Secondo and Primo, in New Jersey in the 1950s, who jointly run a restaurant called Paradise. Primo is the head chef and Secondo is the manager, and it is Secondo\u2019s unhappy responsibility to deal with the clientele who are a little baffled and intimidated by Primo\u2019s fiercely purist attitude to the authentic Italian dishes he is serving. Secondo figures they should be serving safer and more Americanised dishes as their competition do, and when a rival restaurateur kindly offers to set up a special promotional \u201cbig night\u201d at Paradise featuring a visiting celebrity singer, Secondo jumps at the chance, little guessing that this man might have his own ulterior motive. It\u2019s a big, generous, passionate role for Tucci, who sparks off Shalhoub well. He has a part hairpiece, indicating receding rather than a vanishing hairline, and we are allowed to see Tucci as a younger man: more idealistic, more vulnerable and even more boyish.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 May 2020 to correct the spelling of George A Romero.</p>",

One Friday in April, it was legal to get an abortion.

  "<p>If you want to see who influences the government, you can do worse than look at Whitehall\u2019s neighbours. In a grand Victorian building opposite the House of Commons in Parliament Square stands the headquarters of the <a href=\"https://www.rics.org/uk/\">Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors</a>. With a history dating back to 1792, the RICS is an illustrious professional body, promoting the highest international standards in the valuation and development of land and property. But it has another side.<br><br>Its royal charter states that it exists to serve the public interest, yet most of its members\u2019 fees come from landowners and developers, not the public sector. Through its <a href=\"https://www.rics.org/uk/upholding-professional-standards/sector-standards/valuation/red-book/\">Red Book</a>, the RICS sets the standards by which land and property are valued, but it is one of the most powerful lobbying groups in the development industry, representing the interests of landowners and developers at the highest levels of government. It directly advised on the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) in 2012, which led to 1,300 pages of policy being reduced to 65 in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/17/truth-property-developers-builders-exploit-planning-cities\">triumphant bonfire of red tape</a>, and it has numerous committees influencing policy on all aspects of land planning and valuation. It describes part of its mission as \u201cunlocking the inherent value held within the world\u2019s physical assets\u201d, but the question is, for whom is the value being unlocked? And who, consequently, is missing out?<br><br>In the eyes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/06/housing-trickle-strategic-choice\">Bob Colenutt</a>, the answer is clear. In his urgent new book, <a href=\"https://policy.bristoluniversitypress.co.uk/the-property-lobby\">The Property Lobby</a>, he identifies the RICS as one of numerous actors in a complex network of landowners, housebuilders, financial backers, professional bodies and politicians who are engaged in propping up the status quo to ensure that their interests prosper \u2013 at the expense of everyone else. The housing crisis is no accident, he argues, but the calculated product of an elite group who have no reason to fix it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f32e66b0b0e2409c8a7d0f173d45833967f4ce5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f32e66b0b0e2409c8a7d0f173d45833967f4ce5f/0_0_6924_4537/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taking action ...

His career in community planning and local government regeneration has taken him from campaigning in Southwark, south London (helping to lay the foundations for the community-led <a href=\"https://coinstreet.org/\">Coin Street housing project</a> on the South Bank) to battling the development of Docklands and working for various London councils, before moving into academia. In 1975, he co-authored <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Property-Machine-Penguin-special/dp/0140523030\">The Property Machine</a>, a book whose message was nicely summed up by its cover illustration of a fat-cat developer gobbling up people\u2019s homes. Then, the big developers were office builders, backed by insurance companies and pension funds. Now, they are housebuilders, armed with an unimaginable arsenal of global capital. Many of the themes remain the same, but, in the intervening years, through successive takeovers, intensive political lobbying and close integration with the finance sector, the leading developers have swollen into an unstoppable force.<br><br>Combining the methodical precision of an academic with the persuasive passion of a radical campaigner, Colenutt identifies how we got into this situation, and provides several suggestions for a possible way out. In succinct chapters, he lays out the structure of what he calls the \u201cfinance-housebuilding complex\u201d, explaining how the housebuilding business works, how housing finance underpins the entire UK economy, how the powerful network of lobbying groups operates, how it has shaped planning policy, and how the grim cycle of low supply, high prices and poor quality homes is relentlessly perpetuated by vested interests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1e306104d249bc207fa3dbab249f572475173f29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e306104d249bc207fa3dbab249f572475173f29/0_0_1500_2368/633.jpg\" alt=\"The Property Machine by Peter Ambrose and Bob Colenutt.\" width=\"633\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Property Machine by Peter Ambrose and Bob Colenutt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penguin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over the decades, governments of all colours have announced bold new methods to solve the housing crisis, but little has changed. Headlines have continually told us that we are short of 4m homes, that thousands are homeless, that 1.2 million people are on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/09/more-than-1m-families-waiting-for-social-housing-in-england\">council house waiting lists</a> and that a million private tenants are in deep poverty \u2013 not counting the impending impact of the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 but no effective action is taken. Instead, funding for social housing has been slashed while subsidies are lavished on the private sector housebuilders, in the hope that affordable housing will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright\">delivered through \u201cplanning gain\u201d</a>. Meanwhile, local authorities have been forced into public-private partnerships for major developments on their own land, including the \u201cregeneration\u201d of estates that leads to the loss of thousands of council houses and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/14/winners-and-losers-london-social-housing-divide-barnet-camden\">break-up of communities</a>. It\u2019s a Faustian pact from which the public is doomed never to benefit. As Colenutt puts it, the situation has led to \u201cthe ultimate absurdity of public authorities actively pursuing higher values from market-led development in order to find crumbs for social housing development.\u201d<br><br>Meanwhile, the housebuilders get ever richer. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/berkeleygroupholdings\">Berkeley Group</a>, one of the Top 10 UK builders, built 3,536 homes in 2017, which sounds like a decent contribution to meeting the housing shortage. That is, until you realise that the average price of these homes \u2013 proudly described as \u201cpopular with overseas investors\u201d \u2013 was \u00a3715,000. Tony Pidgley, the company\u2019s founder and chairman, received a personal payout of \u00a348m in 2018, after a previous payout of \u00a323m in 2015, when profits rose 42%. At the same time, Berkeley has consistently reduced the amount of affordable housing on its developments across London, on the grounds that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/03/berkeley-calls-affordable-housing-targets-unviable-as-chairman-earns-174m\">local authority targets were \u201cunviable\u201d</a>. Over the past eight years, Berkeley made a profit of more than <a href=\"https://www.building.co.uk/news/berkeley-profit-hit/5100149.article\">\u00a33bn</a>.<br><br>As Colenutt argues, it is not only the distribution of profits to a tiny number of executives that is so shocking, it is the political influence that goes with it. Pidgley was a member of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/heseltine-launches-panel-of-experts-to-kick-start-estates-regeneration\">Michael Heseltine\u2019s Estate Regeneration Advisory Panel</a> in 2016 and advised the government on the disposal of public sector land. He received a CBE from David Cameron in 2012, and the Berkeley Group won the <a href=\"https://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/news-and-insights/news/2014/berkeley-wins-queens-award-for-sustainable-development\">Queen\u2019s Award for Sustainable Development in 2014</a>. The next year, Pidgley <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2015/apr/01/tory-100-industry-captains-party-donors-tax-avoiders\">gave a donation to the Conservative party</a> and wrote to the Daily Telegraph before the 2015 general election expressing his support for the Conservatives, citing their housing and development policies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4b68829c76d4513933047332255f2f5886ea0d8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b68829c76d4513933047332255f2f5886ea0d8d/0_107_4292_2574/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steering profits ...

But these vast profits are not the product of great expertise, nor of success in a free market. Colenutt outlines how they are fuelled by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/01/help-to-buy-pushes-uk-housebuilder-dividends-to-23bn\">government subsidy through Help to Buy</a>, along with grants from Homes England and deregulation of the planning system that enables housebuilders to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright\">dodge their affordable housing obligations</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.cih.org/\">Chartered Institute for Housing</a> estimated that of the total \u00a353bn in government housing investment in 2017, almost 80% went in direct subsidies to the private sector. Persimmon, which infamously awarded its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/07/persimmon-boss-asked-to-leave-amid-ongoing-outrage-over-bonus\">CEO Jeff Fairburn a \u00a375m bonus</a>, revealed that nearly half of its house sales in 2018 were partly funded by Help to Buy. The disastrous policy has simply maintained house prices at their high level and maximised housebuilder profits in the process.<br><br>All of this is great news for the <a href=\"https://www.hbf.co.uk/\">Home Builders Federation</a>, the powerful volume housebuilders\u2019 lobby, whose members construct most of the new homes in England and Wales. Through constant political lobbying and direct ministerial contact, the HBF has been instrumental in shaping government policies, from the nature of the NPPF, to the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright\">viability assessment</a>\u201d of planning obligations, to the Help to Buy mortgage scheme. Countless reports have highlighted the damaging practices of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jan/31/britain-land-housing-crisis-developers-not-building-land-banking\">land-banking</a> and drip-feeding the supply of homes to keep prices high, yet the HBF insists that the housing shortage is caused by local authorities not allocating enough land for housing and asking for too much from planning obligations. As Colenutt notes, the central contradiction in the HBF platform is that at the same time as wanting the state to reduce its control over development, they lobby for more state subsidies and government intervention to support their business model and bolster their profits.<br><br>The list of powerful interests goes on. There is <a href=\"https://www.cla.org.uk/\">the CLA</a> (formerly the Country Landowners\u2019 Association, a more accurate description of its purpose), whose 33,000 members make up the largest private landowning group in England and Wales. When planning consent for housing is granted on farmland, its value can rocket a hundredfold. The National Housing Federation estimates that <a href=\"https://www.progressive-policy.net/press-releases/press-release-landowners-make-13bn-profit-in-one-year-as-high-land-prices-stifle-affordable-housing\">landowners in England made a \u00a313bn profit from land sales in 2016-17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/net-income\">far more than Amazon\u2019s net annual global profit in the same period, or since</a>. Yet the CLA is incensed by accusations that its members are pocketing unearned windfalls. The organisation has proved wildly successful in protecting the interests of landowners, arguing that any attempt to capture the uplift in value for the public good through the planning process would stifle growth and remove any incentive to develop. The result is endless inflation in land values, which in turn reduces the amount of affordable housing that will ever be delivered. Meanwhile, the landowner lobby ensures that any attempt at reforming this byzantine system is decried in newspaper headlines as a \u201cStalinist land grab\u201d or a \u201cgarden tax\u201d.<br><br>Colenutt packs many more targets into his 160 pages, from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/30/revolving-door-between-councils-and-lobbyists-raises-transparency-issues\">revolving doors between councils and developers</a>, to the culture of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/10/tory-westminster-councillor-resigns-after-hospitality-inquiry\">hospitality and political donations</a>, to the innumerable loopholes and get-out clauses that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/17/truth-property-developers-builders-exploit-planning-cities\">riddle the planning system</a> \u2013 which has itself been fundamentally altered, he argues, from dealing with the best use of land to safeguarding developers\u2019 profits.<br><br>There is no easy means of untangling all this, but Colenutt offers some ideas. First, he calls for a national housing drive, \u201cpart of a newly reinvigorated welfare state, where housing, like health, is available to those in need as a human right\u201d. It would be just as repugnant to the property lobby as the idea of a UK-style NHS is to the US health insurance industry \u2013 a comparison that vividly illustrates how much it is needed.<br><br>Second, there must be fundamental land reform to bring development land forward for housing at sensible prices so that new housing can be truly affordable and existing prices can stabilise. Colenutt points to the <a href=\"https://righttobuildtoolkit.org.uk/briefing-notes/different-ways-to-bring-forward-land/\">examples of Germany and the Netherlands</a>, where local authorities buy up development land at its existing use value, draw up real masterplans, then offer sites to housebuilders, who build to the plans of the local authority. In this way, housebuilders are simply builders of houses, not land speculators.<br><br>He says it is finally time to tax developers\u2019 land banks and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25396103\">implement \u201cuse or lose it\u201d measures</a>, to discourage housebuilders from hoarding plots with planning permission. And, most importantly, the Treasury and the Bank of England must be weaned off their dependence on land and house prices, and rebalance the economy away from property. All of this is eminently possible, if the powerful property lobby can be resisted, and some local authorities are already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/oct/28/meet-the-councils-quietly-building-a-housing-revolution\">beginning to take the lead</a>, in spite of central government policy.

More recently, in the 20th century, two catastrophic world wars and the Communist revolution led to a long era of reduced inequality lasting until the early 1980s and giving rise to the modern welfare state, labour unions and progressive taxation.</p> <p>So could the pandemic of our era, <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1060702\">already considered</a> the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/coronavirus-biggest-global-threat-since-wwii-un-chief-2020-4\">greatest global crisis</a> since the second world war, turn out to be a great societal leveller?</p> <p>Scheidel\u2019s short answer is that the longer the pandemic wreaks havoc on the global economy, the greater the potential for radical equalising change. \u201cIt depends on how severe the crisis is going to be, how long it\u2019s going to last and how much it\u2019s ultimately going to interrupt supply chains.\u201d</p> <p>The pandemic has already exposed the limits of the market and highlighted the importance of effective state intervention and strong public healthcare provision. In the future this may well create a tolerance for higher and more progressive taxation. Governments have had to intervene to prop up businesses and jobs in ways that only months ago would have seemed unimaginable. The viability of a universal basic income \u2014 a dream for egalitarians worldwide \u2014 is once again part of the mainstream debate in many countries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e58a0521d46896c34820f75ea3caff8c2337f66d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e58a0521d46896c34820f75ea3caff8c2337f66d/0_0_2126_1517/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pieter Bruegel the Elder, The Triumph of Death Probably after 1562, Madrid, Museo Nacional del Prado\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pieter Bruegel the Elder\u2019s The Triumph of Death: \u2018The Black Death led to the wipeout of a third of Europe\u2019s population.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Baztan Lacasa Jose/Museo Nacional del Prado</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The response at EU level also shows a willingness for strong public intervention and an end to the fiscal restraint approach of the last decade \u2014 at least, temporarily. </p> <p>As people start to believe in government intervention again, the post-corona political landscape may well provide fertile soil for reversing a situation where, since 1980, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2019/may/14/britain-risks-heading-to-us-levels-of-inequality-warns-top-economist\">richest 1% in the UK</a> have tripled their share of household income and the wealth of the <a href=\"https://wid.world/document/bcg2019-full-paper/\">European top 1%</a> grew twice as fast as the bottom 50%.</p> <p>But Scheidel cautions that, while disasters are not uncommon, tectonic shifts are historical anomalies. In other words, it may take a disaster to usher in more equality, but not every disaster does.</p> <p>\u201cWe had very special circumstances for a generation after the second world war, when all the factors were present in the right way \u2014 strong growth, low inequality, a strong middle class, expansion of the welfare state, all these things simultaneously. That may be very difficult to replicate,\u201d says Scheidel.</p> <p>Nobody would want mass death on the scale of the bubonic plague in the 14th century to be the instrument by which we achieve social change. And fortunately mortality rates from coronavirus will be nothing equivalent to those levels. \u201cEvery year, 60 million people die of natural causes worldwide. The death toll from corona is probably going to be less, even in the worst case scenario.\u201d</p> <p>Coronavirus\u2019s transformative potential, Scheidel explains, consists in adding a shock to an already powerful groundswell of anger.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m very sceptical about is the idea that ideology, or rhetoric, or just political agitation by itself can change things. What you need is essentially a combination of a certain kind of ideas being out there, and then a shock to the established order that allows those ideas to become mainstream.\u201d</p> <p>Lockdown culture has divided the haves from the have nots in the most tangible ways: while middle- and upper-class urbanites could flee to holiday homes, the lowest paid have been confined to cramped flats or forced to run the gauntlet of public transport to get to their key worker jobs.</p> <p>And, while white-collar workers complain about the complications of remote working, for a sizeable chunk of the world\u2019s labour force self-isolation means <a href=\"https://www.arabnews.com/node/1650216/world\">going hungry</a>.</p> <p>Similarly, as Scheidel points out, the damage done by the closure of schools has been felt unevenly. \u201cWe have a billion children around the world who are not going to school \u2026 and some are able to be schooled online because the households have proper internet connections and others don\u2019t. That\u2019s a very fundamental inequality. There are a number of these inequalities that have always existed, but we\u2019re becoming very painfully aware of them.\u201d</p> <p>Will all this awareness spill over into demands for political transformation? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take all that much,\u201d says Scheidel. \u201cAll we really need is a certain increase in the percentage of people who support certain policies for those policies to become mainstream. There is now a greater potential for a sufficiently large number of people to say, \u2018maybe we should be doing something about this\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>But there\u2019s an important caveat; much of the coronavirus\u2019s levelling potential will depend on our willingness to suffer significant economic losses in the short and medium term.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The less equal countries face darker choices between carrying on as before and experiencing real change</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Since the \u201cend of history\u201d in the 1980s ushered in 40 years of neoliberal deregulation, inequality has generally been seen as an acceptable or even necessary price to pay for prosperity. That changed after the 2008 financial crash ignited the Occupy movement, lifting the veil on the existence of the 1%. Suddenly, inequality went from being a subject studied by a handful of economists to one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/21/world-26-richest-people-own-as-much-as-poorest-50-per-cent-oxfam-report\">defining issues</a> of the last decade.</p> <p>Still, the 2008 crash <a href=\"https://www.socialeurope.eu/eu-income-inequality-great-recession\">wasn\u2019t the leveller </a>many had hoped it would be. In fact, it <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/09/research-how-the-financial-crisis-drastically-increased-wealth-inequality-in-the-u-s\">produced the largest spike in wealth inequality</a> in postwar history by devastating the one thing low-income people in most western economies depend on most for their wealth: home ownership.</p> <p>On the same day that coronavirus caused the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/27/stock-market-today-live.html\">worst point drop</a> in the history of the Dow Jones, the economist Branko Milanovi\u0107 optimistically <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brankomilan/status/1232850693926637570?lang=en\">tweeted</a>: \u201cMy friend @WalterScheidel must feel vindicated. Coronavirus has already shaved off about 1/2 a Gini point of US wealth inequality. And this seems to be only a beginning.\u201d</p> <p>Milanovi\u0107 was referring to the Gini coefficient, a commonly used measure of inequality that measures income or wealth distribution among a population.</p> <p>Scheidel sees the newly collapsed assets of billionaires rebounding over the next few years as they did after the 2008 financial crash. \u201cIt took a few years, and then the top 1% were back to where they were before the financial crisis. That\u2019s likely to happen again with all the measures taken to shore up corporations and preserve the financial sector.\u201d </p> <p>Meanwhile, mass unemployment and the loss of income or healthcare will hit the poor hardest, pushing many people into debt, further widening the gap between rich and poor.</p> <p>But could the coronavirus crash do what the 2008 crash didn\u2019t? Not if there\u2019s a swift recovery but, says Scheidel: \u201cIf we\u2019re entering a more long-term depression as a result of Covid-19, I think all kinds of more radical policies will be on the table for the first time in a very long time.\u201d</p> <p>Much, he thinks, depends on the early discovery of a vaccine. \u201cThen you could say science will save the status quo, because it makes it possible for us to return to business as usual quite swiftly.</p> <p>But now assume that science fails to do that because the virus is more complicated and can\u2019t be fixed in the short term, then you\u2019ll have a more severe protracted crisis, with greater potential for transformative change.\u201d</p> <p>That may translate to stronger state intervention, better protections for workers in domestic industries, limits to outsourcing, higher taxation and more robust healthcare systems \u2014 if only because it will be impossible to justify the shortages of face masks and other essential equipment that have already cost countless lives.</p> <p>It will also be difficult to resist the temptation to go back to business as usual. \u201cThere will be a strong push to go back to growth to finance the huge deficits that governments have been racking up, so, if anything, growth will be more important than before,\u201d says Scheidel. \u201cAt the same time, if the effects of the pandemic polarise societies even more, there will also be stronger agitation for more progressive or distributive policies. It will be very difficult to reconcile those two motivations.\u201d</p> <p>The real clash of interests, he predicts, will be between those determined to go back to the status quo even at the price of making existing inequality worse and those who want a reset.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see enough engagement with the fact that this is going to be a real struggle between countervailing forces that push in different directions. The big question is which one will have the upper hand, in which place, and for how long.\u201d</p> <p>The most unequal democracies like the US and the UK, where inequality of income is estimated to be among the highest in Europe, could experience the biggest shifts. \u201cThe less equal countries face darker choices between carrying on as before and experiencing real change,\u201d says Scheidel. \u201cSo, somewhat paradoxically, the potential for actual change is biggest in the less equal countries.\u201d</p> <p>By contrast, \u201cIf you are in China, the shock will not lead to more equalising policies. It will lead to a tightening of control and more business as usual.\u201d</p> <p>Time will tell if Scheidel can feel the vindication of Milanovi\u0107\u2019s forecast. As the pandemic devastates the world economy, hitting the poor hardest of all, short-term solutions aimed at restoring \u201cnormality\u201d are likely to outweigh lofty visions for a more equal society.</p> <p>And if he is right that the recipe for equality is prolonged suffering, things may have to get a lot worse before they can get better.

  "<p>Widely regarded as the godmother of modern Scandinavian crime fiction, Maj Sj\u00f6wall, who has died aged 84, was the co-author of 10 detective stories featuring the Swedish policeman Martin Beck \u2013 a series remarkable as much for the way it was written as for its impact on crime-writing internationally. </p> <p>Sj\u00f6wall and Per Wahl\u00f6\u00f6 met in 1962 while working as magazine journalists and translators in Stockholm. She was 27, twice divorced and a single mother; he was 36, married with one child. They were instantly attracted to each other, shared a love of leftwing politics and detective stories, and soon decided to live together.</p> <p>Influenced by the crime novels of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/georgessimenon\" title=\"\">Georges Simenon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jul/08/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\" title=\"\">Ed McBain</a>, they developed a \u201cproject\u201d to do something different: they conceived a series of 10 books, with each of them writing alternate chapters (30 in each book), which when completed could be seen as a single, Marxist critique of Swedish society. They wrote in the evenings after work, sometimes throughout the night, passing drafts across the kitchen table. The spare, pared-down style they developed garnered rave reviews in the UK and the US when the books began to appear in translation in 1968.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/30/maj-sjowall-nordic-noir-pioneer-author-of-the-martin-beck-series-dies-aged-84\">Maj Sj\u00f6wall: \u2018Nordic noir\u2019 pioneer, author of the Martin Beck series, dies aged 84</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pair had produced a new style of detective story from the start. In Roseanna (1965), the first Beck novel, a naked body is dredged out of a canal. It takes Beck and his colleagues, in the days before DNA, computers and mobile phones, seven months of methodical, unglamorous police work to snare the killer. As the series continued, recognition grew. The Guardian\u2019s reviewer Matthew Coady noted in 1970 that \u201cfor Beck as with Maigret, each investigation is less a riddle to be answered than a human situation to be understood\u201d.</p> <p>Not only were the novels painstakingly researched and unflinching in their descriptions of horrific crimes, but each chipped away at an aspect of contemporary Swedish life to reveal (as the authors saw it) a growing materialism and heartlessness. In the character of Martin Beck, their dogged, dyspeptic, chain-smoking policeman, with a gloomy marriage and a son he admits he doesn\u2019t like, Sj\u00f6wall and Wahl\u00f6\u00f6 set a new template for fictional detectives, and not just Swedish ones. A DNA trace on many of today\u2019s troubled detective heroes worldwide, both on page and screen, could well turn up Swedish ancestry.</p> <p>Sj\u00f6wall was born and grew up in Stockholm, where her family lived in one of the hotels her father managed. She described her young self as \u201crather wild\u201d, rebelling against her middle-class background. Aged 21, and not long launched on a career in journalism, Sj\u00f6wall found she was pregnant by a former boyfriend. Under pressure from her father, she married an older colleague, but this, and a second marriage, did not last. Soon afterwards she met Wahl\u00f6\u00f6.</p> <p>He had been ill for some years by the time the Martin Beck project was completed with The Terrorists in 1975, and died at the age of 49 shortly before its publication. The books remained in print in Scandinavia and numerous television incarnations eventually followed in Sweden, but Sj\u00f6wall resisted the temptation to continue or expand the series, claiming that it would feel \u201ctoo lonely\u201d to do so without her partner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2e6e69d2395a5ed16d2e77ae9198fa0828eef761\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e6e69d2395a5ed16d2e77ae9198fa0828eef761/0_0_3066_3280/935.jpg\" alt=\"After the death of her writing partner, Maj Sj\u00f6wall resisted the temptation to continue or expand the Martin Beck series.\" width=\"935\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">After the death of her writing partner, Maj Sj\u00f6wall resisted the temptation to continue or expand the Martin Beck series.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Nilsson/TT/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She returned to the bohemian life she had always favoured, writing for magazines, co-authoring a number of books and translating the American private eye novels of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/20/robert-b-parker-obituary\" title=\"\">Robert B</a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/20/robert-b-parker-obituary\" title=\"\"> Parker</a> into Swedish. She also began to appear as an uncredited extra in episodes of the Swedish television series Beck, which ran from 1997 to 2009, and was revived in 2015.</p> <p>Having won an Edgar award in America in 1971, the Sj\u00f6wall-Wahl\u00f6\u00f6 novels were subsequently honoured in Sweden, Denmark, Italy and Spain. Sj\u00f6wall regularly appeared at literary festivals and crime-writing conventions, including at Crimefest in Bristol in 2015, where she was interviewed as the international guest of honour by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/lee-child\" title=\"\">Lee Child</a>.</p> <p>Despite the critical acclaim for and the success of the Martin Beck novels, and the fourth, The Laughing Policeman, being filmed by Hollywood in 1976 (with Stockholm replaced by San Francisco; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/jul/03/guardianobituaries.filmnews\" title=\"\">Walter Matthau</a> in the lead role), the financial returns for the authors were modest and Sj\u00f6wall often said later that the couple had \u201calways had money problems\u201d.

  "<p>Coronaviruses have been causing problems for humanity for a long time. Several versions are known to trigger common colds and more recently two types have set off outbreaks of deadly illnesses: severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers).</p> \n<p>But their impact has been mild compared with the global havoc unleashed by the coronavirus that is causing the Covid-19 pandemic. In only a few months it has triggered lockdowns in dozens of nations and claimed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/world/coronavirus-world-news-updates.html\">more than 100,000 lives.</a> And the disease continues to spread.</p> \n<p>That is an extraordinary achievement for a spiky ball of genetic material coated in fatty chemicals called lipids, and which measures 80 billionths of a metre in diameter. Humanity has been brought low by a very humble assailant.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, our knowledge about the Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is also remarkable. This was an organism unknown to science five months ago. Today it is the subject of study on an unprecedented scale. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/when-will-coronavirus-vaccine-be-ready\">Vaccines projects proliferate,</a> antiviral drug trials have been launched and new diagnostic tests are appearing. </p> \n<p>The questions are therefore straightforward: what have we learned over the past five months and how might that knowledge put an end to this pandemic?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qV7R2iYVXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Where did it come from and how did it first infect humans?</h2> \n<p>The Sars-CoV-2 virus almost certainly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/how-did-the-coronavirus-start-where-did-it-come-from-how-did-it-spread-humans-was-it-really-bats-pangolins-wuhan-animal-market\">originated in bats,</a> which have evolved fierce immune responses to viruses, researchers have discovered. These defences drive viruses to replicate faster so that they can get past bats\u2019 immune defences. In turn, that transforms the bat into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/10/sars-virus-bats-china-severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome\">a reservoir of rapidly reproducing and highly transmissible</a> viruses. Then when these bat viruses move into other mammals, creatures that lack a fast-response immune system, the viruses quickly spread into their new hosts. Most evidence suggests that Sars-CoV-2 started infecting humans via an intermediary species, such as pangolins.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-statistics-what-can-we-trust-and-what-should-we-ignore\">Coronavirus statistics: what can we trust and what should we ignore?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThis virus probably jumped from a bat into another animal, and that other animal was probably near a human, maybe in a market,\u201d says virologist Professor Edward Holmes of Sydney University. \u201cAnd so if that wildlife animal has a virus it\u2019s picked up from a bat and we\u2019re interacting with it, there\u2019s a good chance that the virus will then spread to the person handling the animal. Then that person will go home and spread it to someone else and we have an outbreak.\u201d</p> \n<p>As to the transmission of Sars-CoV-2, that occurs when droplets of water containing the virus are expelled by an infected person in a cough or sneeze.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5cd7885ddb57e8ad5a16fc8146db6dbb81b1c5ca\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5cd7885ddb57e8ad5a16fc8146db6dbb81b1c5ca/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Health officials inspect bats to be confiscated in the wake of a coronavirus outbreak at a live animal market in Solo, Central Java, Indonesia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Health officials inspect bats to be confiscated in the wake of a coronavirus outbreak at a live animal market in Solo, Central Java, Indonesia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>How does the virus spread and how does it affect people?</strong></h2> \n<p>Virus-ridden particles are inhaled by others and come into contact with cells lining the throat and larynx. These cells have large numbers of receptors \u2013 known as Ace-2 receptors \u2013 on their surfaces. (Cell receptors play a key role in passing chemicals into cells and in triggering signals between cells.) \u201cThis virus has a surface protein that is primed to lock on that receptor and slip its RNA into the cell,\u201d says virologist Professor Jonathan Ball of Nottingham University.</p> \n<p>Once inside, that RNA inserts itself into the cell\u2019s own replication machinery and makes multiple copies of the virus. These burst out of the cell, and the infection spreads. Antibodies generated by the body\u2019s immune system eventually target the virus and in most cases halt its progress.</p> \n<p>\u201cA Covid-19 infection is generally mild, and that really is the secret of the virus\u2019s success,\u201d adds Ball. \u201cMany people don\u2019t even notice they have got an infection and so go around their work, homes and supermarkets infecting others.\u201d</p> \n<p>By contrast, Sars \u2013 which is also caused by a coronavirus \u2013 makes patients much sicker and kills about one in 10 of those infected. In most cases, these patients are hospitalised and that stops them infecting others \u2013 by cutting the transmission chain. Milder Covid-19 avoids that issue.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"04fcb605-dc6b-400f-9a32-dea28497dcee\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sMtzWVTPmLI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Why does the virus sometimes cause death?</h2> \n<p>Occasionally, however, the virus can cause severe problems. This happens when it moves down the respiratory tract and infects the lungs, which are even richer in cells with Ace-2 receptors. Many of these cells are destroyed, and lungs become congested with bits of broken cell. In these cases, patients will require treatment in intensive care.</p> \n<p>Even worse, in some cases, a person\u2019s immune system goes into overdrive, attracting cells to the lungs in order to attack the virus, resulting in inflammation. This process can run out of control, more immune cells pour in, and the inflammation gets worse. This is known as a <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/term/cytokine-storm/\">cytokine storm.</a> (In Greek, \u201ccyto\u201d means cell and \u201ckino\u201d means movement.) In some cases, this can kill the patient.</p> \n<p>Just why cytokine storms occur in some patients but not in the vast majority is unclear. One possibility is that some people have versions of Ace-2 receptors that are slightly more vulnerable to attacks from the coronavirus than are those of most people.</p> \n<h2><strong>Are we protected for life if we get infected?</strong></h2> \n<p>Doctors examining patients recovering from a Covid-19 infection are finding fairly high levels of neutralising antibodies in their blood. These <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/10/heres-how-body-gains-immunity-coronavirus\">antibodies are made by the immune system</a>, and they coat an invading virus at specific points, blocking its ability to break into cells.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is clear that immune responses are being mounted against Covid-19 in infected people,\u201d says virologist Mike Skinner of Imperial College London. \u201cAnd the antibodies created by that response will provide protection against future infections \u2013 but we should note that it is unlikely this protection will be for life.\u201d</p> \n<p>Instead, most virologists believe that immunity against Covid-19 will last only a year or two. \u201cThat is in line with other coronaviruses that infect humans,\u201d says Skinner. \u201cThat means that even if most people do eventually become exposed to the virus, it is still likely to become endemic \u2013 which means we would see seasonal peaks of infection of this disease. We will have reached a steady state with regard to Covid-19.\u201d</p> \n<p>The virus will be with us for some time, in short. But could it change its virulence? Some researchers have suggested that it could become less deadly. Others have argued that it could mutate to become more lethal. Skinner is doubtful. \u201cWe have got to consider this pandemic from the virus\u2019s position,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is spreading round the world very nicely. It is doing OK. Change brings it no benefit.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the end, it will be the development and roll-out of an effective vaccine that will free us from the threat of Covid-19, Skinner says.</p> \n<h2>When will we get a vaccine?</h2> \n<p>On 9 April, the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-020-00073-5\">journal </a><em><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-020-00073-5\">Nature</a></em><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-020-00073-5\"> reported that 78 vaccine projects</a> had been launched round the globe \u2013 with a further 37 in development. Among the projects that are under way is a vaccine programme that is now in phase-one trials at Oxford University, two others at US biotechnology corporations and three more at Chinese scientific groups. Many other vaccine developers say they plan to start human testing this year.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71bd74e2bdb349a18119fec7e436bb5e029b72e9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71bd74e2bdb349a18119fec7e436bb5e029b72e9/0_66_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman holds a small bottle labeled with a \u201cVaccine COVID-19\u201d sticker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Around the globe, there are 78 vaccine projects.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dado Ruvi\u0107/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This remarkable response raises <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/lockdowns-cant-end-until-covid-19-vaccine-found-study-says\">hopes that a Covid-19 vaccine could be developed</a> in a fairly short time. However, vaccines require large-scale safety and efficacy studies. Thousands of people would receive either the vaccine itself or a placebo to determine if the former were effective at preventing infection from the virus which they would have encountered naturally. That, inevitably, is a lengthy process.</p> \n<p>As a result, some scientists have proposed a way to speed up the process \u2013 by deliberately exposing volunteers to the virus to determine a vaccine\u2019s efficacy. \u201cThis approach is not without risks but has the potential to expedite candidate vaccine testing by many months,\u201d says Nir Eyal, a professor of bioethics at Rutgers University.</p> \n<p>Volunteers would have to be young and healthy, he stresses: \u201cTheir health would also be closely monitored, and they would have access to intensive care and any available medicines.\u201d The result could be a vaccine that would save millions of lives by being ready for use in a much shorter time than one that went through standard phase three trials.</p> \n<p>But deliberately infecting people \u2013 in particular volunteers who would be given a placebo vaccine as part of the trial \u2013 is controversial. \u201cThis will have to be thought through very carefully,\u201d says Professor Adam Finn of Bristol University. \u201cYoung people might jump at the opportunity to join such a trial but this is a virus that does kill the odd young person. We don\u2019t know why yet. However, phase-three trials are still some way off, so we have time to consider the idea carefully.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 April 2020.

  "<p>Sometimes the story is not so much Donald Trump as the people around him, and not so much what they say but what they don\u2019t.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/trump-coronavirus-america-richard-wolffe\">Trump the commander-in-bleach has been stripped of all feeling | Richard Wolffe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last Thursday Deborah Birx sat in the White House press briefing roomas the US president speculated on whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/donald-trump-coronavirus-disinfectant-sarcastic-tipping-point\">injecting disinfectant</a> might offer a \u201ccleaning\u201d of the lungs.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t do anything he just said!\u201d is what Dr Birx should have exclaimed at that moment, argues <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kurtbardella?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Kurt Bardella,</a> a political columnist and commentator, explaining: \u201cA doctor right there has an obligation to correct that in real time. If the president wants to fire that person, then so be it.\u201d</p> <p>But Birx said no such thing.</p> <p>The cringeworthy remarks about disinfectant and ultraviolet light compounded fears that Birx, the lead advocate of social distancing, has been somewhat less successful at <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/27/politics/donald-trump-deborah-birx-disinfectant-testing-coronavirus/index.html\">critical distancing from the president.</a> Like other White House officials before her, she is said to be sacrificing a hard-won professional reputation at the altar of Trump\u2019s vanity.</p> <p>Critics note that she has repeatedly failed to speak out against the president\u2019s false and potentially dangerous claims when the occasion demands. Worse still, in an apparent attempt to stay in his good graces, the 64-year-old doctor and diplomat has praised Trump and even sided with him in jabbing at the media.</p> <p>Bardella, a former spokesman and senior adviser for the House of Representatives\u2019 oversight committee, said: \u201cA doctor\u2019s responsibility first and foremost is to tell the truth and correct falsehoods that could do people harm. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic or possible to pander to Trump but <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/climate/trump-coronavirus-climate-science.html\">also maintain fidelity to science.\u201d</a></p> <p>Although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-dr-deborah-birx-hiv-aids\">everything in Birx\u2019s career</a> prepared her for a global pandemic, nothing could have prepared her for a mercurial boss with a tendency to parrot bad science.</p> <p>Her professional life began in 1985 with the defence department as a clinician in immunology, specialising in research on a vaccine for HIV/Aids. Birx was promoted to director of the US military HIV research program at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research from 1996 to 2005. She helped lead one of the most influential HIV vaccine trials in the world and was promoted to colonel.</p> <p>Birx went on to lead President George W Bush\u2019s Pepfar programs combating HIV/ Aids around the world, managing an annual budget of more than $1.5bn. She is now one of two women on the White House coronavirus taskforce, where Vice-President Mike Pence has described her as his \u201cright arm\u201d.</p> <p>Another prominent taskforce member, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/19/trump-fauci-relationship-coronavirus-us\">Anthony Fauci,</a> the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is widely regarded as having walked the diplomatic tightrope more successfully. He contradicts and corrects the president\u2019s false claims at times, while holding his tongue or offering gentle praise at others. </p> <p>Birx has been a team player to a fault, careful not to aggravate Trump by tempering his wild medical ruminations and exaggerations about testing capacity. On the contrary, last month <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/3/27/21197074/deborah-birx-praised-trump-scientific-literature-coronavirus\">she told the Christian Broadcasting Network:</a> \u201cHe\u2019s been so attentive to the scientific literature and the details and the data. I think his ability to analyse and integrate data that comes out of his long history in business has really been a real benefit during these discussions about medical issues.\u201d</p> <p>Such remarks have provoked a backlash.</p> <p>Joe Lockhart, a former White House press secretary, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joelockhart/status/1243563311532302336?lang=en\">tweeted:</a> \u201cI, for one, am no longer interested in hearing from Dr. Brix [sic]. Her vouching for Trump\u2019s vast scientific abilities from his business background was the breaking point. Stepford Doc\u201d \u2013 a reference to The Stepford Wives, a 1972 satirical novel about submissive housewives who lack free will.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s cringeworthy and embarrassing, but I\u2019m guessing she thought in Trumpland, this is what\u2019s required</p> <footer> <cite>Charlie Sykes</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The disinfectant debacle inflicted a severe political wound for Trump but also caused collateral damage to Birx. When she was pressed about the issue later on two Sunday politics TV shows, she claimed this is merely the way Trump processes new information and expressed frustration that the media had not moved on. \u201cIt bothers me that this is still in the news cycle,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-birx-trump-disinfectant-remarks\">she told CNN\u2019s State of the Union.</a></p> <p>Emily Nussbaum, a staff writer at the New Yorker magazine,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/emilynussbaum/status/1254505465087692801?s=20\"> tweeted:</a> \u201cDr Birx is going to leave a horrible legacy. It\u2019s one thing to be a cynical paid fixer. It\u2019s worse, in my eyes, to be the expert who props up the mad king. I get that it\u2019s an emergency &amp; I understand the theoretical strategy she may think she\u2019s pursuing, but it\u2019s a moral horror.\u201d</p> <p>Birx is not the first White House official to find themself walking a tightrope. Memoirs of the Trump era are replete with anecdotes about senior staff removing documents from the president\u2019s desk or accidentally-on-purpose forgetting to pass on his orders. </p> <p>Charlie Sykes, founder and editor-at-large of the Bulwark website, explored the moral quandary earlier this month in an article headlined, <a href=\"https://thebulwark.com/the-faucian-bargain/\">\u201cThe Faucian Bargain\u201d, </a>and said this week: \u201cIf Dr Birx and Dr Fauci were not in the room, decisions might have been made that cost tens of thousands of lives, but the price for them is to flatter and fawn.\u201d</p> <p>Of Birx\u2019s silence over disinfectant at the crucial moment when the cameras were rolling, Sykes commented: \u201cIt\u2019s cringeworthy and embarrassing, but I\u2019m guessing she thought in Trumpland, this is what\u2019s required. It\u2019s a trade-off, and I don\u2019t envy her position. If she had said, \u2018This is terrible and the president put people in danger\u2019, she\u2019d be gone and replaced by someone even less willing to speak truth to power.\u201d</p>",

The NRL\u2019s plan is for the Warriors to depart New Zealand on Sunday and, while in self-isolation in Tamworth, join rival teams in preparing for a 28 May restart.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Further complicating matters is the Warriors are yet to receive an official exemption to enter the country, or train together while in quarantine. While a charter flight has been booked, the club also continues to demand certainty around a number of issues before stepping on a plane.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Chief among the concerns are how much players can expect to be paid, as well as the possible accommodation of families during their indefinite stay. The Warriors could spend up to six months in Sydney should international travel restrictions remain until the grand final in late October.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T05:15:37.104Z\">at 6.15am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaa5a208f0882b206dcfbeb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T04:57:43.679Z\">5.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Thank you to everyone who joined me for another week.

from May, depending on when they report their income to Centrelink each fortnight, the Covid-19 Senate committee heard. <br></p> \n  <p>These people will not receive a further payment beyond 24 September, meaning they will receive the supplement for a shorter period than six months. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat that says to me is people will not get the six months if they are still on

  "<p>When John Gianoulidis, owner of the Kafenio Greek Diner, heard the Georgia governor, Brian Kemp, announce restaurants could offer dine-in services once again this week, he feared the worst for his restaurant and coffee shop in Atlanta.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the deal, he typed out on Facebook.</p> <p>\u201cKemp mandates restaurants reopen, whether I reopen dining rooms or not. I file for business interruption insurance, it does not go through since I am \u2018allowed\u2019 to operate full capacity,\u201d he hypothesized, adding further down in the now viral post, \u201cIf things blow up again, they are still on my tab not on the states, since they are no longer employed. Guys, this is about screwing the working class and small business, not about helping us.\u201d</p> <p>Economists are uncertain if Gianoulidis is entirely correct about the exact rationale behind the sudden announcement to reopen Georgia as coronavirus cases continue to rise, with nearly 25,000 confirmed in the state as of Tuesday afternoon. The state\u2019s reopening has been so early that even Donald Trump urged Kemp not to do it.</p> <p>But they can agree the most in danger from Kemp\u2019s actions \u2013 both economically and healthwise \u2013 are those who open their businesses or return to work in Georgia\u2019s new sudden easing of restrictions.</p> <p>The state\u2019s current count of positive virus cases makes it the tenth highest in the country as employees were cleared to serve meals in a restaurant, offer up tattoos or provide hair and nails services and check-in gym goers for Zumba class. In the last month, Georgia\u2019s department of labor processed 1,090,536 claims, more than the last three previous years combined. Nearly a third of the claims came from the food and accommodation industry, many of whom can now \u2013 technically \u2013 go back to work as restaurants open.</p> <p>While that may help ease the burden of claims processed by the state, how it affects the greater economy is unclear, said Elise Gould of the Economic Policy Initiative.</p> <p>\u201cFrom an economic standpoint, it\u2019s just not really clear why you open up one set of businesses, versus another set,\u201d she said, referring to Kemp allowing non-essential business to reopen.</p> <p>Kemp\u2019s office did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment. The state\u2019s department of labor did not have much concrete guidance as to whether the reopening would see jobless claims shifted off the government books.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a way for them to continue to receive some of those same benefits as they gradually come back to work. And then when it\u2019s time to get back to work that employer stops filing for them,\u201d the Georgia department of labor communications director, Kersha Cartwright, said.</p> <p>But it\u2019s unclear when that line between gradual and full time was drawn and by whom it was to be decided \u2013 the state or the employer.</p> <p>Many business owners, like Gianoulidis, will continue to offer carry-out options, but want to wait to hear the risks versus rewards from health officials before opening and seating customers in close quarters, they say.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to figure out what\u2019s going on. I haven\u2019t heard from the US health department,\u201d Gianoulidis said, adding he would rather hear from health officials than politicians.</p> <p>But for those businesses that do open up, while the state continues to follow through on its shelter-in-place order until 30 April , this could leave vulnerable employees on even more uncertain grounds, said Gould. Some might not want to go back to work, feeling unsafe while others may be living with elderly family members or those with pre-existing conditions.</p> <p>Others may return to work, uncertain about the state\u2019s policy on unemployment insurance, Gould added, unsure if they would still qualify now that their place of employment is open.</p> <p>When asked what would happen if employees of non-essential businesses that could reopen under the state\u2019s mandate chose not to return in fear of their safety, Georgia\u2019s department of labor could not clarify if they would still be eligible to file for unemployment.</p> <p>\u201cWork with your employer, try to work something out. If you cannot work it out and you decide to separate yourself from that place of employment then we will base our eligibility upon the facts presented in the case,\u201d Cartwright said.</p> <p>Georgia\u2019s governor might not have felt the pressure to rush his state\u2019s residents back to work if he had <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2020/04/17/483461/coronavirus-recovery-demands-substantial-durable-aid-state-local-governments/\">more financial support</a> to fill in gaps where the Cares Act did not reach, an April report from American Progress said.</p> <p>\u201cI think that if the federal government stepped in and actually provided significantly more state and local aid to help them deal with the pandemic and to help them deal with this relief period and the recovery, that would be good for the economy,\u201d Gould agreed.</p> <p>But the health risks of an early reopening could be even more risky than an economic one.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/ending-coronavirus-lockdowns-in-mississippi-georgia-and-florida-could-doom-thousands?source=articles&amp;via=twitter_page\">new analysis of data</a> released by the Daily Beast in collaboration with MIT and Harvard Universities, that could most likely be the case. If the state had continued its current stay-at-home mandate and kept non-essential businesses closed, coronavirus fatalities by mid-June would have been somewhere between 1,004 and 2,922. Instead, the team\u2019s simulation suggests that number could now be as high as 9,748.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a policy that has not been endorsed by experts in public health \u2026 one concern going forward is whether it would lead to new outbreaks and contribute to a second wave of growth of the pandemic,\u201d Cornell University labor economics professor Francine Blau said.</p> <p>For now, Gianoulidis will keep his dining areas closed, like many other restaurants in Atlanta, with too many financial and health risks at play for him to open them with confidence.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to continue doing what I\u2019m doing until we get a better idea of what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said.</p>",

I was due to fly home that evening, but had been out most of the night, and lost my wallet and phone. No hotel, no cards, no cash. I had my printed flight tickets and my passport, but no way to get to JFK. I sat on a bench outside a bar, low and horribly hungover, to consider my circumstances, and I will always remember hearing <strong>Empire State of Mind</strong> by Jay-Z and Alicia Keys from the bar\u2019s open door. At that point a woman walked up to me and asked what was up. I told her, we sat and smoked a cigarette, then she suggested I probably needed a lift, took me inside and ordered beers. She gave me $20, told me to take care, and left.

Every time someone connected to the aux, they would cue up Girls\u2019 2010 release, Album. <strong>Lust for Life</strong> was the first track, and we never got any further.

Castelnuovo di Garfagnana is in the rarely visited far north of Tuscany, on the edges of the Apennines. This is not Chiantishire; it\u2019s a working-class, staunchly socialist, agricultural region. As I stood in the doorway of the <a href=\"vecchiomulino.info\">Osteria Vecchio Mulino</a>, where you order platters of superb salumi or cheeses accompanied by Tuscan wines at off-licence prices, an old man in a black beret played some opening notes on his guitar.

The music video \u2013 shot in my hometown Lahore, Pakistan \u2013 is quaint, nostalgic and wholesome, a reminder of bygone Basants spent on the rooftops of the old walled city, flying kites to this song. Basant and kite-flying in general were banned in Lahore in 2005 as a precautionary measure to prevent injuries/deaths related to the kite string, which is often covered in chemicals. Every spring brings fruitless talks of regulating manufacturers or easing restrictions, so this song and its memories stand in place.<br><strong>Mahnoor Bari</strong></p> <h2>To north Wales and back with a supergroup</h2> <p>The album of 1989 was <strong>The Travelling Wilburys Vol 1</strong>. We played it on a cassette player all the way from London to North Wales, on every journey we made and all the way home. By the end of the week we knew all of the lyrics and belted them out, often out of key but always joyously. It was my first holiday with my partner and his three children so it was a potentially fraught with problems but we searched rock pools, built sand castles and lost our kite and had a wonderful time. Three decades on we are a close and loving blended family and the album\u2019s penultimate song Tweeter and the Monkeyman still reminds me of the week we began to become that family. <br><strong>Elle</strong></p> <h2>Glory and trumpets, Vend\u00e9e</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78f62b4a22d94d8090064e6deb047c400fcfb436\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78f62b4a22d94d8090064e6deb047c400fcfb436/0_60_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"William Christie and musicians in his garden at Thir\u00e9 in the Vend\u00e9e.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William Christie and musicians in his garden at Thir\u00e9 in the Vend\u00e9e.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julien Gazeau</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tenors Reinoud Van Mechelen and Paul Agnew sang Purcell\u2019s <strong>Sound the Trumpet</strong> in William Christie\u2019s extensive garden in the Vend\u00e9e, north of La Rochelle, on a glorious late-summer day.

  "<p>Health officials in Germany, the UK and the US are looking at antibody testing to figure out when and how their countries could open back up. Some authorities are even considering issuing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/immunity-passports-could-speed-up-return-to-work-after-covid-19\">\u201cimmunity passports\u201d</a> that would help key workers safely and quickly return to their jobs.</p> <p>But some early Covid-19 antibody tests, and the research that hinges on them, have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/unverified-antibody-tests-risk-increasing-coronavirus-infections\">deeply flawed</a>. Infectious disease experts warn that while reliable antibody tests could eventually reveal much about how the disease spreads and how deadly it is, it is too early to draw any definitive conclusions from screening studies.</p> <h2><strong>What is an antibody test?</strong></h2> <p>PCR tests, the diagnostic tests most commonly used to determine whether someone is currently infected with the coronavirus, looks for the virus\u2019s genetic material in samples collected from patients\u2019 throats or noses.</p> <p>Antibody tests, or serology tests, rather than looking for the virus itself, detect antibodies or proteins in the blood that our bodies develop in order to fight it off. \u201cThese tests tell you that you\u2019ve been exposed to the virus,\u201d said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at the Yale school of medicine. \u201cAntibody tests can basically give us a history of the infection.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/22/california-coronavirus-testing-bolinas\">'We hope to be a model': the California town testing every resident for coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>What exactly are these antibodies that we\u2019re testing for?</strong></h2> <p>An antibody is a bespoke weapon that our bodies develop to fight off a pathogen. Our bodies may make several types of antibodies uniquely engineered to fight off the coronavirus over the course of one or two weeks.</p> <p>\u201cThink about those pictures of the coronavirus you\u2019ve mostly commonly seen,\u201d said Diane Griffin, a microbiologist and immunologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \u201cYou know those big, blobby spikes on the surface of the coronavirus? That\u2019s the part of the virus particle that attaches to healthy cells to invade and infect them.\u201d</p> <p>Antibodies to these spikes on the coronavirus glom on to them and coat them \u2013 leaving them unable to hijack our cells. Other types of antibodies may mark infected cells, so other cells can destroy them before the infection spreads further. Some of these antibodies will stick around in our blood long after the virus is gone, protecting us from future infections.</p> <p>We know that antibodies against certain pathogens \u2013 such as smallpox \u2013 can provide protection for a lifetime. Antibodies for other infections tend to fade: Antibody levels in people who had recovered from Sars and Mers declined over the course of one or two years.</p> <p>Scientists are still trying to figure out how much of which antibodies give people immunity to the new coronavirus. Once they do, really good lab tests could tell patients with a certain \u201cantibody level\u201d that they\u2019re safe from infection. The ideal antibody tests would \u201cgive you value \u2013 similar to how people are used to getting a cholesterol value, or a sugar level\u201d, explained Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at the Harvard TH Chan school of public health.</p> <h2><strong>How do the tests work?</strong></h2> <p>There are two main types of antibody tests: rapid tests that take a finger prick of blood and reveal whether a person has antibodies, and tests that use a lab technique called Elisa and indicate the quantity of antibodies present.</p> <h2><strong>And are they accurate?</strong></h2> <p>In a preliminary study published this month, a team of researchers sought to verify the 14 coronavirus antibody tests currently available in the US and found that only three delivered consistently reliable results. Four of the tests produced false positive rates from 11% to 16%. Others produced false positives about 5% of the time.</p> <p>The ideal tests would be highly sensitive \u2013 meaning they can pick up on the presence of antibodies in the blood of those who have infections \u2013 and specific, meaning they detect the right antibodies. Tests that aren\u2019t specific might light up positive after picking up on antibodies to other infections, giving people the false sense that they\u2019re immune.</p> <p>Both types of tests have shown issues. The rapid yes-no tests, which Boris Johnson gushed were \u201cas simple as a pregnancy test\u201d, turned out to be much more complicated, said Alexander Marson, an immunologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who has led the effort to test the tests.</p> <p>The Elisa tests are generally considered to be more reliable, but none of the tests studied by Marson and his team had perfect specificity.</p> <p>\u201cI understand that there\u2019s an urgency during this unprecedented time to move things along, to understand who\u2019s been infected and who is immune,\u201d said Marson. \u201cBut before we race to get information from these tests, we need to actually have evidence that they work.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bcf2b9cf1bbac5c0650dad73808ab3540be4210e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcf2b9cf1bbac5c0650dad73808ab3540be4210e/0_88_5428_3257/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A medical technologist looks over antibody test results.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Last week, the World Health Organization warned that the detection of antibodies alone shouldn\u2019t serve as a basis for an \u2018immunity passport\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David J Phillip/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Why are there so many faulty tests?</strong></h2> <p>In the US, federal agencies were criticized for initially dragging their feet in allowing private and academic labs to develop their own versions of the PCR tests used to diagnose Covid-19. When it came to antibody testing, the government may have swung too far in the other direction, lawmakers and public health experts have said.</p> <p>The US isn\u2019t the only country to have been duped by companies selling faulty test kits. This month, British officials realized they may have jumped the gun by ordering 2m at-home antibody test kits that researchers at the University of Oxford found to be unreliable.</p> <p>The Food and Drug Administration allowed about 90 companies, many based abroad, to sell antibody tests that haven\u2019t been vetted and validated by federal scientists. The FDA has since warned that some of these <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/faqs-diagnostic-testing-sars-cov-2\">tests</a> are inaccurate.</p> <h2><strong>So, when can I get an </strong><strong>\u2018immunity passport</strong><strong>\u2019?</strong></h2> <p>Not for a while, it would appear. Last week, the World Health Organization warned that the detection of antibodies alone shouldn\u2019t serve as a basis for an \u201cimmunity passport\u201d \u2013 because scientists don\u2019t know how much of which antibodies will protect people from reinfection.</p> <p>To get there, we need to collect lots of data over time from lots of people who have had the infection and developed antibodies, explained Yale\u2019s Iwasaki \u2013 and track who gets reinfected, and who remains immune.</p> <h2><strong>Does it still make sense to test everyone for antibodies?</strong></h2> <p>Germany is planning to conduct nationwide antibody testing. In California, researchers have sought to test nearly everyone in the small town of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/22/california-coronavirus-testing-bolinas\">Bolinas, </a>and in the Mission neighborhood<strong> </strong>of San Francisco, administering both PCR and antibody tests.</p> <p>By using blood samples to conduct lab tests, scientists will be able to try more than one antibody test on the blood, verifying and validating their results, Griffin said. Eventually, these large-scale testing efforts could provide more information about how many people within a community have had the coronavirus. Tallying the number of infections and the levels of antibodies and tracking these communities over time could answer critical questions about how widely the virus has spread, who has immunity and how long that immunity lasts.</p> <p>\u201cOnce we know the answers to these key questions, maybe then we can issue immunity passports,\u201d Iwasaki said. \u201cUntil then, we need to be patient.\u201d</p>",

Making it difficult to vote by mail could actually wind up hurting the Republican party.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s become an explosive issue because President Trump and some others at the top of Republican party, including [RNC chair] Ronna McDaniel, have made it an issue,\u201d said Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cThat puts Republicans in somewhat of a bind, because in many places in the country, vote by mail is a successful and safe way that Republicans get the vote out among their supporters.\u201d</p> <p>A Stanford study examining the switch to vote by mail in California, Washington and Utah found that it <a href=\"https://siepr.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/20-015.pdf\">did not</a> benefit Democrats or Republicans, and only modestly increased turnout. Colorado <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/11/the-colorado-gop-mailed-it-inbut-won-112612\">elected</a> a Republican US senator the year after it switched to all vote-by-mail elections. In Florida\u2019s March primary, Republicans were more likely <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/vr21kw9o25qw7i8/Initial%20take%20on%20voting%20methods%20in%20the%20Florida%20primary.pdf?dl=0\">to vote by mail</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe would work really hard on absentee ballots. It was a staple of our strategy,\u201d said Mac Stipanovich, a retired Florida Republican political operative, said of past campaigns. \u201cRepublicans probably ought not to be complaining about it.\u201d</p> <p>Even as Republican operatives are seeking <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/28/2020-vote-by-mail-battle-heats-up-213920\">to scale up</a> their vote-by-mail operations, congressional Republicans have staunchly opposed efforts in coronavirus stimulus bills that would make it easier to vote. They dismissed plans to require states to automatically mail everyone a ballot, expand early voting and implement online voter registration. So far, the parties have agreed on allocating <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/us/coronavirus-voting-stimulus.html\">$400m</a> to states to help them prepare for elections, a fraction of the minimum $4bn <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/estimated-costs-covid-19-election-resiliency-measures\">experts say</a> is needed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really disappointing that our political leaders aren\u2019t all working to ensure that every eligible American is able to cast a ballot that will count,\u201d said Myrna P\u00e9rez, director of the voting rights and elections program at the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cThere used to be a point in time where having free and fair access to the ballot was a bipartisan issue.\u201d</p> <p>Currently, <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/all-mail-elections.aspx\">five US states</a> conduct their elections entirely by mail, while access to mail-in balloting varies widely in others. To run an election that relies heavily on vote by mail would require investing millions of dollars in ballots, staffing, new technology and messaging,<a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/estimated-costs-covid-19-election-resiliency-measures\"> according to</a> the Brennan Center.</p> <p>In Orange county, California, switching to vote by mail took three or four years of planning and cost at least $3m, said Neal Kelley, the county\u2019s registrar of voters. In Washington state, it took five years to transition to an all vote-by-mail system. Most US election offices \u2013 some with just one or two full-time employees \u2013 do not have the resources to make this transition in time for November without support.</p> <p>\u201cThe clock is ticking,\u201d said Amber McReynolds, the chief executive of the National Vote at Home Institute and Coalition, which advocates for vote by mail.</p> <p>In recent weeks, Democrats and voting groups have filed a slew of lawsuits \u2013 taking aim at restrictive state laws that require voters to give an excuse to vote by mail or have an in-person witness for their ballots. Advocates also want states to pick up the cost of postage on mail-in ballots and registration forms, calling it an unconstitutional poll tax.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There used to be a point in time where having free and fair access to the ballot was a bipartisan issue</p> <footer> <cite>Myrna P\u00e9rez</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But Republicans in Texas, Wisconsin, New Mexico and Nevada have opposed these lawsuits. The office of Texas\u2019s attorney general, Ken Paxton, even went so far as to say that anyone who advised a voter they could cast a mail-in ballot because of Covid-19 could be subject to <a href=\"https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/admin/2020/Press/4.14.20%20Letter%20to%20Rep.%20Klick.pdf\">\u201ccriminal sanctions\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The Republican National Committee and Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, meanwhile, had already planned to spend <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/20/michigan-voting-lawsuits-rnc-trump-116142\">$10m</a><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/20/michigan-voting-lawsuits-rnc-trump-116142\"> </a>to fight Democratic voting lawsuits. An RNC spokesman told NPR the committee would probably spend even more <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/04/19/838073187/as-democrats-and-republicans-spar-over-changing-voting-laws-wave-of-lawsuits-exp\">because of Covid-19</a>.</p> <p>If this political stalemate persists, the US might end up with a large-scale version of the chaotic Wisconsin primary, which took place earlier in April.</p> <p>With coronavirus cases rising, Wisconsin severely limited early voting and an unprecedented 1.2 million people requested absentee ballots. Election offices were overwhelmed with absentee ballot requests, and some voters never received ballots at all. Turnout didn\u2019t drop as severely as many projected, but voters in Milwaukee were forced to wait hours in line to vote. At least 52 people<a href=\"https://apnews.com/b1503b5591c682530d1005e58ec8c267\"> have since tested positive for Covid-19.</a></p> <p>Without action, there could be similar consequences in November. There might be a delay in issuing ballots, and voters might get their ballots too late to vote, said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political science professor. A nefarious actor could intentionally slow down the election process by making multiple ballot requests, forcing the election official to investigate (<a href=\"https://www.wbay.com/content/news/Green-Bay-City-Clerk-responds-to-spring-election-concerns--569845391.html\">one clerk</a> in Wisconsin reported a voter requested a ballot 11 times).</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing failure in a low-turnout election. It\u2019s not gonna get any better in a high-turnout election,\u201d McDonald said.</p> <p>More voting by mail will also slow down reporting of election results, since election officials would have to count ballots coming in after election night. This could leave room for a candidate to question the legitimacy of the results.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m concerned not only that a delay in reporting results will leave room for people to claim fraud, but also potentially for a candidate who\u2019s ahead in an early count to claim victory while the votes may shift as additional votes are counted,\u201d Hasen said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-fight-to-vote-us-voters\">'We can\u2019t afford to wait': coronavirus could shut out droves of new US voters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Breaking from Trump, some Republican officials have embraced vote by mail, though modestly. Ohio\u2019s governor and secretary of state <a href=\"https://www.dispatch.com/news/20200413/vote-by-mail-is-safe-says-ohio-secretary-of-state-frank-larose-countering-trump\">encouraged </a>everyone to request an absentee ballot for the state\u2019s primary.

Such a move could force Republican counterparts to follow suit.</p> <p>\u201cThe intransigence of the Republicans to think that anything that might increase turnout might help the Democrats is very shortsighted,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cI think Republicans are making a huge strategic error here if they don\u2019t want to provide resources.\u201d</p>",

Even Judge Steven Colloton, who was appointed by George W Bush and also on Trump\u2019s supreme court shortlist, opposed this ruling, saying it set the stage for women being charged with manslaughter or assault for consuming alcohol while pregnant, if they \u201cuse chemotherapy to treat cancer\u201d, or \u201cnegligently drive an automobile and cause an accident\u201d resulting in harm to their as-yet unborn children.</p> <p>\u201cHis record in advance certainly showed that he was very interested in dismantling the social safety net,\u201d Mincberg said. \u201cHis decisions since coming to the bench are not only in that direction, but also go further to the right than other very conservative Republican judges.\u201d</p> <p>Stras\u2019s ascent to the eighth circuit also marked a significant divergence from decades-long practice on how the Senate confirms presidents\u2019 judicial picks \u2013 showing Republicans\u2019 eagerness to greenlight Trump\u2019s nominees.

In <a href=\"https://www.pfaw.org/blog-posts/trump-judge-claims-states-cant-be-sued-for-voting-rights-act-violations-confirmed-judges-confirmed-fears/\">February</a>, the circuit rejected Alabama\u2019s argument that people and organizations could not file suit against the state for violating the federal Voting Rights Act (VRA). Branch, 52, <a href=\"http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201714443.pdf\">dissented</a>.</p> <p>She contended that people and organizations can\u2019t sue states for VRA violations.</p> <p>She also said that the language used to describe legal action involving VRA violations employs the phrase \u201c<em>in </em>any State or political subdivision,\u201d but \u201cdoes not authorize proceedings \u2018against\u2019 a state or political subdivision\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe bizarre part of that dissent is that she seems to want to bar people from challenging discrimination and voter suppression because she thinks Congress used the wrong preposition in a statute,\u201d said Michael Meltsner, the Matthews distinguished university professor of law at Northeastern University school of law. He later said: \u201cShe\u2019s also taken other votes that suggest pretty much the same highly conservative approach, and that\u2019s pretty much the same situation for the other judges.\u201d</p> <p>The Atlanta-born Branch, who graduated from Davidson College and Emory University school of law, was a law clerk in Chicago federal court and worked in private practice. Her government experience includes the US Department of Homeland Security and the White House management and budget office, in George W Bush\u2019s administration. Before Branch\u2019s federal appellate confirmation, she was a judge on Georgia\u2019s court of appeals, her 11th circuit biography <a href=\"http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/judges/hon-elizabeth-l-branch\">says.</a></p> <h2><strong>John K Bush</strong></h2> <h2><strong>Sixth </strong><strong>circuit </strong><strong>court of </strong><strong>appeals</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Eastern and </strong><strong>western </strong><strong>districts of Kentucky; </strong><strong>eastern and </strong><strong>western </strong><strong>districts of Michigan; </strong><strong>northern and </strong><strong>southern </strong><strong>districts of Ohio; </strong><strong>eastern, </strong><strong>middle</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>western </strong><strong>districts of Tennessee.</strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Since ascending to the appellate bench, Bush\u2019s decisions have indicated a pattern with the potential to undermine oversight and civil rights, progressive court-watchers contend. Bush, 55, and Judge Joan Larsen, who is also a Trump appointee, upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit that involved an airline employee who was terminated after complaining to company higher-ups about safety concerns involving her supervisor.</p> <p>The former employee, a technical writer whose work involved operations and maintenance manuals for pilots, claimed that she was protected from the firing despite being an \u201cat will\u201d worker. She cited an Ohio law that prohibits firing people if doing so is in violation of public policy. She contended that she was protected under this law, arguing that public safety was public policy, says PFAW.</p> <p>In his January opinion, Bush wrote that she \u201cfailed to provide clear notice \u2026 that she was invoking a governmental policy in her complaints\u201d, meaning her \u201cdismissal did not jeopardize any public policy, and the facts of her case do not trigger Ohio\u2019s public-policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine\u201d.</p> <p>In July, Bush voted to affirm the dismissal without trial of a free speech case. In that lawsuit, protesters had claimed that they were wrongfully arrested while trying to protest against the Kentucky Farm Bureau for alleged discriminatory policies.</p> <p>\u201cBush is one of the earliest judges that was put on the court by Trump and therefore he has one of the longest records \u2013 and his record is broad and deep and bad in a wide variety of cases,\u201d Mincberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a single area where Bush hasn\u2019t written a decision, or dissent, that would take the law backwards.\u201d</p> <p>Before Bush\u2019s confirmation, Buzzfeed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zoetillman/one-of-trumps-judicial-nominees-blogged-under-a-pen-name#.yf0mEWZK5\">reported</a> that he had likened abortion to slavery in a pseudonymous blogpost, writing that they were the \u201ctwo greatest tragedies in our country\u201d.

The impact of the coronavirus lockdown has been immediate and severe because it relies on income to pay bills: it lacks reserves and so has no flex. It all goes back to 1995 when the game went open without having the time to prepare for it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/23/european-clubs-collision-course-world-rugby-unacceptable-fixture-plans\">European clubs on collision course with World Rugby over 'unacceptable' plans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bailey was World Rugby\u2019s first director of legal and legislative affairs and authored the global regulatory framework for the sport after the 1995 decision. He has also worked for the Football Association. \u201cThe model 25 years ago should have been based on the fact that the Test game was the commercial driver. That would have allowed a more robust system which, with a more effective salary system and cost control measures, would have allowed reserves to be developed.</p> <p>\u201cInstead, a market economy grew in France and England which has relied on investors prepared to absorb losses year after year rather than revenue generated. The essence of the game is mutual dependency, but it has been undermined over the years by three issues: north versus south, club versus country and the developed versus developing.</p> <p>\u201cThe opportunity to redress these faultlines should not be missed. It is now or never in terms of rebooting.\u201d</p> <p>The new model Bailey envisages would put international rugby first, but would not relegate the club game to obscurity. There would be a pecking order, and as the various strands make plans for resumption, there will be conflict.</p> <p>Last week the chairman of European Professional Club Rugby, Simon Halliday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/23/european-clubs-collision-course-world-rugby-unacceptable-fixture-plans\">said it would be unacceptable</a> if World Rugby moved the July tours, which will almost certainly be called off, to October when clubs hope to stage the final stages of this season\u2019s Champions Cup.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08937d01f607aba1146a820e223d2843ce5c53f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08937d01f607aba1146a820e223d2843ce5c53f6/0_159_4047_2428/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Darren Bailey has suggested expanding All Black tours to feature club sides.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darren Bailey has suggested expanding All Black tours to feature club sides.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Behrouz Mehri/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He called for clubs to be involved in discussions, which needs World Rugby to be given direct access to them by unions. But the income from Test rugby is considerably larger than that generated by club rugby. Part of it is used to nourish the amateur game, which is bound to take a participation hit, rather than feed professional leagues. The rule on player release needs rewriting to accommodate international windows being moved.</p> <p>\u201cRugby needs to become less adversarial in the way it is run,\u201d Bailey says. \u201cIt has to work in the interests of the game nationally and internationally.</p> <p>\u201cRugby has an older demographic and I wonder about the long-term psychology over mass gatherings. I think tech will play an important part in giving people the confidence to attend matches. If people travel less, it presents an opportunity for local initiatives: when a vaccine is found, sport could drive it by saying spectators needed to have one to come in.</p> <p>\u201cRugby needs to get back to what it was all about: incredible standards of behaviour, integrity and respect for match officials and players.

I can see Amazon taking an interest, but in international terms, they would be looking at markets like Japan, the United States and Germany, which is where the Nations League comes in.</p> <p>\u201cEverything is back in play.

All 103 people to have survived the virus in the territory have now recovered. The ACT has recorded three deaths. It is the first jurisdiction in Australia to record no active cases.</p> \n<p>Nationally, just 10 new cases were recorded. Most were in Victoria, where a cluster of seven cases were detected at an aged care home. New South Wales reported two new cases and Tasmania reported one. It\u2019s not clear if the NSW total includes three new residents at Newmarch House aged care home in western Sydney, who tested positive over the past 24 hours.

The outbreak was traced back to two passengers on the Ruby Princess cruise ship, who sadly died. They infected a healthcare worker, and the virus spread through work meetings and other contact. The investigation ruled out an illegal social gathering and said no one was to blame for the outbreak, which has been linked to 11 deaths.</p> \n<h2>Jobseeker recipients top 1.3 million</h2> \n<p>The $550 jobseeker coronavirus supplement, which has effectively doubled the fortnightly rate of the unemployment payment to $1,125, will cease from 24 September.

The Victorian health minister, Jenny Mikakos, says police are continuing to enforce the order, issuing 43 fines in the past 24 hours.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>What you need to know: get the most important information from some of our key explainers</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/australias-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-explained-can-i-still-visit-my-partner-and-other-questions\">Australia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/mar/26/how-many-cases-of-coronavirus-are-there-in-australia-live-covid-19-numbers-and-statistics\">Coronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statistics</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/03/social-distancing-rules-australia-coronavirus-strict-new-laws-legal-illegal-state-physical-restrictions-guidelines-explained-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa-two-person-rule\">Australia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare: what do the Australian government\u2019s coronavirus changes mean for my family?</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/01/jobkeeper-payment-am-i-eligible-for-the-wage-subsidy-how-do-i-register-ato-jobseeker-supplement-support-package-eligibility\">Am I eligible for the jobkeeper payment?

  "<p>You\u2019ve heard of preppers, right? Survivalists? If you\u2019ve watched TV shows like <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com.au/tv/doomsday-preppers/\">Doomsday Preppers</a>, you know about their strange, apocalyptic beliefs: that a disaster could strike at any time, overwhelming first responders and the social safety net; that this crisis could disrupt supply chains, causing scarcity and panic and social breakdown; that authorities might invoke emergency powers and impose police curfews. Crazy theories like that.</p> <p>In fact, many perfectly reputable organizations \u2013 including the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/foodwater/prepare.html\">US</a> <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/f&amp;web.pdf\">federal</a> <a href=\"https://www.ready.gov/food\">government</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/survival-kit-supplies.html\">Red Cross</a> \u2013 recommend Americans maintain extra food and emergency supplies. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) advises keeping a two-week supply of food, as well as water, batteries, medical masks, first-aid supplies and a battery- or hand-powered radio, among other things.</p> <p>In mainstream society, however, interest in prepping usually invites ridicule about bunkers and tin-foil hats. Preppers have spent years as the <a href=\"https://reason.com/2013/02/20/stop-demonizing-preppers-2/\">objects of our collective derision</a>.</p> <p>Until now. Today, we\u2019re all preppers \u2013 or rather, wish we had been.<strong> </strong>Non-preppers have been caught in a rain shower without an umbrella. I don\u2019t know if preppers are laughing right now, but perhaps they\u2019re entitled to <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2020-03-15/not-exactly-gloating-stockpiling-preppers-have-a-moment\">some vindication</a>.</p> <p>Now, I\u2019m not a prepper. I am an effete quasi-intellectual with no practical skills of any kind. My current \u201cemergency supplies\u201d are some Hungry-Man Dinners and a liter of bourbon. If things get really bad I will finish the bourbon, lie down and wait to be eaten by stray cats.</p> <p>But I\u2019ve come to respect the preppers\u2019 ethos of survival and preparedness. One of my friends is one, or at least on the spectrum. When coronavirus hit, he wasn\u2019t one of the millions of people scrambling for surgical masks; he already had them in his survival kit. He kept a few and gave the rest to elderly people.</p> <p>It has become fashionable to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/trump-socialism-and-coronavirus-epidemic/607681/\">argue</a> \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/28/coronavirus-regulations-slow-hiring-of-doctors-and-nurses-staffing-firms-say.html\">not</a> <a href=\"https://www.wpr.org/physician-assistants-want-step-fight-coronavirus-state-regulations-may-be-getting-way\">entirely</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/upshot/hospital-rules-relaxed-coronavirus-fight.html\">accurately</a> \u2013 that there are \u201cno libertarians in a pandemic\u201d. Certainly, this crisis has been a stark reminder of the importance of collective action. We\u2019re all on this ship together; Covid-19 has laid bare the pathetic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/16/profit-over-people-cost-over-care-americas-broken-healthcare-exposed-by-virus\">inadequacy</a> of the US social safety net, our lack of investment in the common good, and our government\u2019s short attention span for preparing for crises that don\u2019t involve terrorism or war.</p> <p>But collective action also requires some level of individual responsibility and preparedness, too, at least for those with the ability and the means. You can\u2019t aid your elderly, immunocompromised or poorer neighbors if you haven\u2019t taken the bare minimum of preparations. There\u2019s a reason that airplane safety demonstrations warn passengers to put on their own air-masks before assisting others.</p> <p>We\u2019re right to be angry at the people stripping supermarkets bare and hoarding desperately needed supplies. Those people aren\u2019t preppers, however. Preppers don\u2019t engage in panic-buying. That\u2019s the whole point. That\u2019s why it is called prepping.</p> <p>\u201cPrepping is a choice that occurs before a panic, not during,\u201d a prepper recently <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/fj07cf/time_for_a_little_gatekeeping/\">complained</a> on Reddit. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t stock up over time, you are a hoarder or, perhaps worse, an opportunist. In times like these we need to come together and support one another. That doesn\u2019t mean giving away your supplies, but it does mean living in a society.\u201d</p> <p>Another added, \u201cWe aren\u2019t the reason that elderly or immunocompromised people can\u2019t find hand sanitizer, masks or toilet paper. We bought things in small increments when it made zero impact on the supply.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, some preppers are individualistic to the point of being antisocial. Rightwing survivalists, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world/la-xpm-2012-feb-08-la-na-american-redoubt-20120209-story.html?mod=article_inline\">in particular</a>, are often motivated by paranoid, apocalyptic, and racist or conspiratorial beliefs. A massive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/10/preppers-survivalists-survivalcon-expo-nuclear-bomb-republicans-mormons\">doomsday industry</a> caters to their fantasies with expensive survival supplies of questionable utility.</p> <p>The preppers we encounter in popular culture are invariably the worst examples - religious or political zealots, eccentrics, middle-aged men suffering crises of masculinity, and, in the case of shows such as Doomsday Preppers, caricatures selected for entertainment value.</p> <p>But not all are gun and gear fetishists with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/02/preppers-survivalist-summit-constitution-americas-midlife-crisis\">delusions of grandeur</a>; many are apolitical or even <a href=\"https://theend.substack.com/\">left</a><a href=\"https://theend.substack.com/\">wing</a>. Global warming, environmental degradation and anxiety about the Trump administration have <a href=\"https://qz.com/973095/the-new-doomsayers-taking-up-arms-and-preparing-for-catastrophe-american-liberals/\">spurred</a> liberals and leftists into the fold. Websites such as <a href=\"https://theprepared.com/\">ThePrepared</a> offer useful, non-alarmist advice on disaster preparedness.</p> <p>The more sophisticated practitioners have always understood that prepping is a matter of both individual and collective wellbeing. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, better known as the Mormon church, operates a massive network of grain silos and food depots. People undergoing hardship receive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/jul/02/salt-lake-city-socialism-mormon-style-utah\">food and household goods</a>, for free or in exchange for volunteer service, at the church\u2019s Costco-style warehouses. The system is vertically integrated, with food supplied by <a href=\"https://www.mormonwiki.com/Bishop%27s_Storehouses\">church-owned farms</a>. All Mormons are also <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/emergency-preparedness?lang=eng\">encouraged</a> to maintain emergency stockpiles in their home \u2013 not only for their own sake, but to assist neighbors when a hurricane or flood strikes.</p> <p><em>When</em> disaster strikes, not if. The problem is that disasters always look like remote possibilities before they occur, and historical abstractions afterward. Even the coronavirus, as insurmountable as it seems, will eventually pass; we will return to normalcy, and then complacency, and maybe even go back to ridiculing preppers.</p> <p>Yet global warming probably means more and more of these kinds of crises \u2013 natural disasters, but also economic instability and possibly more pandemics, as thawing ice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/climate-change-thawing-deadly-diseases-anthrax\">releases long-dormant pathogens</a>.</p> <p>I suspect the real reason many people instinctively recoil from prepping is psychological. Prepping comes across as pessimistic or even cynical. But perhaps it is better to think of it as pragmatism. We should prepare for disasters for the same reason we buy life insurance or back up computer files: hope for the best, plan for the worst.</p> <p>Recently, while doing some quarantine cleaning, I found several books I acquired during younger \u2013 less lazy, and more idealistic \u2013 days: The Boy Scout Fieldbook; The US Army Survival Manual; Living Off the Country. It seems unlikely they\u2019ll prove too relevant here in Brooklyn, New York, but I\u2019ve decided to brush up anyway. I also found a book called Home Brewing Without Failures, by the unimprovably named HE Bravery. The utility of that one should speak for itself.</p>",
  "<p>\u2018It\u2019s life, lad. It might make you laugh at your age, but one day it\u2019ll make you bloody cry.\u201d After 54 years, this British movie from the Boulting brothers flares like a struck match with broad comedy, fierce sentimentality and a strange dark sense of life\u2019s painfulness \u2013 and it\u2019s an amazingly vivid time capsule of Britain in the 1960s. The Family Way, rereleased on digital platforms, is based on a stage play by Bill Naughton, itself developed from his Armchair Playhouse TV script, and directed by Roy Boulting and produced by John Boulting, with a musical score from Paul McCartney, arranged by George Martin.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/aug/04/hywel-bennett-obituary\">Hywel Bennett</a> brings his discontented-cherub presence to the role of Arthur Fitton, a young cinema projectionist in Bolton. (They\u2019re incidentally showing Karel Reisz\u2019s racy Morgan: A Suitable Case for Treatment and also Alfie, starring Michael Caine, based on Naughton\u2019s play.) Arthur is getting married to Jenny Piper, played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/mar/06/hayley-mills-interview\">Hayley Mills</a>. Jenny is a virgin, as nice girls in those days were supposed to be before their big day, and presumably Arthur is also, although this is never explicitly remarked on in the same way, and \u2013 in art as in life \u2013 we are perhaps invited to assume that, whatever his later difficulties, the man involved will have discreetly understood the groom\u2019s responsibility for gaining experience before his wedding night. Arthur\u2019s mother and father are played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/apr/25/2005inreview\">John Mills</a> (father of Hayley) and Marjorie Rhodes; Jenny\u2019s parents by John Comer and Avril Angers.</p> <p>The wedding and raucous reception go off reasonably enough, although Arthur\u2019s loudmouth dad insists on challenging him to a psychologically fraught arm-wrestling contest. But then \u2013 disaster. For an unpleasant prank, one of the boorish guests has sabotaged Arthur and Jenny\u2019s marriage bed in the spare room of his mum and dad\u2019s house (where they\u2019re living for the time being) and, what with the strain of that disaster and the honeymoon getting cancelled because of a crooked travel agent, Arthur develops a nervous problem. He can\u2019t consummate the marriage. The weeks of frustration and unhappiness drag into months, and the local whisperings get louder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dcc4830554e08d835b6462d9a332a40d62931d63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dcc4830554e08d835b6462d9a332a40d62931d63/0_210_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A kitchen-sink realist feel \u2026 from left, John Comer, John Mills and Marjorie Rhodes in The Family Way.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A kitchen-sink realist feel \u2026 from left, John Comer, John Mills and Marjorie Rhodes in The Family Way.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Lion Int Films/Studiocanal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Non-sex after marriage could be a parable for the way most people in Britain were actually experiencing the supposedly swinging 60s, and this is a classic drama of the respectable and aspirational working class, with a kitchen-sink realist feel that feels more conspicuous from our 21st-century viewpoint. It resembles No\u00ebl Coward\u2019s This Happy Breed as well as Billy Liar and The Likely Lads, with flashes of something like Dennis Potter. It is far more complex than it initially appears, with grumpy, boisterous Mr Fitton haunted by his friendship with his old pal, Billy, creating an emotional triangle to be replicated in the next generation with Arthur\u2019s brother Geoffrey (Murray Head) falling in love with Jenny.</p> <p>Marjorie Rhodes won a Tony for playing the part of Arthur\u2019s mother on Broadway, and she has two extraordinary moments here, so extraordinary I had to stop my DVD and play them again in a state of \u201cWait! What?\u201d When she\u2019s talking about a passionate moment in her early life, she is suddenly transfigured in closeup with a kind of quiet ecstasy, and the background behind her face bleaches out into a heavenly white, the kind of stylisation that occurs nowhere else in the film. The second moment comes when she objects to her husband vulgarly talking about a \u201cpublic convenience\u201d. And why? She explains: \u201cWhen I was a girl, I walked into a men\u2019s place by mistake. What a sight. Two lines of them all wearing raincoats, with their stooped backs and their bloomin\u2019 heads sunk forwards, as though they expected to be shot in the back at any moment. If ever I have a nightmare, you can bet your life that comes into it.\u201d That taboo is well described.</p> <p>John Mills is also very good, although there is something psychologically complicated in the casting, as if he is signalling to the public with his very protective presence that there will be nothing untoward happening to Hayley Mills, so recently the face of Walt Disney\u2019s Pollyanna.</p> <p>Losing your virginity on your wedding night (with everyone gigglingly speculating as to the outcome) is something that feels so ancient, although the whole nation went through it with the wedding of Lady Diana Spencer and Prince Charles in 1981. This film finds the tragicomedy as well as the comedy. It is surprisingly potent.</p> <p>\u2022 The Family Way is available on digital platforms from 4 May.</p>",
  "<p>Firms that are failing to give refunds to customers for cancelled weddings or holiday accommodation because of the Covid-19 pandemic could face court action from Britain\u2019s competition watchdog.</p> <p>The Competition and Markets Authority has recorded a rise in customer complaints about cancellations and refunds, which it said it <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-to-investigate-concerns-about-cancellation-policies\">would now investigate</a>. It highlighted concerns that firms are refusing refunds or pressuring people to accept vouchers for holiday accommodation that can only be used during a more expensive period.</p> <p>Complaints about cancellations and refunds account for four out of five complaints received by its Covid-19 taskforce. They relate mainly to three areas: weddings and private events; holiday accommodation; and nurseries and childcare providers. The watchdog will tackle these areas first and then move on to other sectors.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/05/coronavirus-flight-cancellations-refunds-losses-and-insurance\">Thousands of flights have also been cancelled</a> during the pandemic, but this does not fall under the CMA\u2019s investigation. The Civil Aviation Authority, which regulates airlines, has issued advice to travellers and said they should contact it with specific questions.</p> <p>The CMA said that most businesses are \u201cacting reasonably in what are unprecedented circumstances\u201d, but added that consumer rights cannot be ignored.</p> <p>Andrea Coscelli, the chief executive of the CMA, said: \u201cOur Covid-19 taskforce is shining a light on some of the big issues facing consumers in wake of this pandemic. Alongside price-gouging reports, we\u2019re now seeing cancellation issues in their thousands. So far, the CMA has identified weddings, holiday accommodation and childcare as particular areas of concern.</p> <p>\u201cThe current situation is throwing up challenges for everyone, including businesses, but that does not mean that consumer rights can fall by the wayside. If we find evidence that businesses are failing to comply with consumer protection law then we will get tough \u2013 that means launching enforcement cases and moving to court action where there is a strong reason to do so.\u201d</p> <p>For most consumer contracts, the CMA would expect a full refund to be issued where a business has cancelled a contract without providing any of the promised goods or services; no service is provided by a firm; or a consumer cancels or is prevented from receiving the service, for example because of the restrictions imposed by the lockdown.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/882088/Covid_refunds_guidance.pdf\">The watchdog said</a> the rights to a refund will usually apply even where the consumer has paid what the business says is a non-refundable deposit or advance payment. It accepts that it may take businesses longer than normal to process refunds, but urged them to make the timeframes clear to customers. A spokesperson added that it would not expect consumers to have to wait \u201cweeks and weeks or even months\u201d for a refund.</p> <p>Salman Haqqi, personal finance expert at online comparison service Money.co.uk, said: \u201cNow is the time for holiday companies, insurers and airlines to step up and provide better options for holidaymakers at this difficult time and form an industry standard response.</p> <p>\u201cThis will help people understand what they are entitled to if their holiday has been or is likely to be cancelled. Banks also have a role to play here and support where they can.\u201d</p> <p>The CMA also advised that businesses should not be profiting by \u201cdouble recovering\u201d their money from the government and customers.</p> <p>Consumer association Which? meanwhile called on the Civil Aviation Authority to clamp down on airlines which were still not refunding passengers.

  "<p>There\u2019s a satisfying ease to Netflix high school comedy The Half of It, a charming twist on the Cyrano de Bergerac formula that deserves slightly more attention than most of the streamer\u2019s other made-to-order sleepover pics. A teen market that had been underserved by studios has now been exhaustively cornered by the company but often without much care or inventiveness, a conveyor belt of content that prioritises quantity over quality.

Even Netflix has skirted near similar territory before in 2018\u2019s catfish comedy Sierra Burgess is a Loser. So while it makes some of the mechanics of The Half of It feel a little bit, well, mechanic, it\u2019s a difficult escalation not to engage with, especially as writer-director Alice Wu works hard to elevate, avoiding the far-fetched farce and convoluted circumstances we might be expecting given the material. There\u2019s a temptation to overload teen comedies with too much extraneous plot but Wu\u2019s film is mercifully streamlined as she avoids adding in, say, a mean girl adversary or any inconsequential parental subplots, focusing on the triangle and little else.</p> <p>Ever since Love, Simon\u2019s respectable box office numbers showed that, shock, queer teens crave experiences similar to their own to be reflected in the same glossy way as their straight peers, we\u2019ve seen more LGBT representation in high school movies. It\u2019s predictably slow progress but The Half of It is another sensitively crafted step in the right direction, deftly conveying the difficult unsureness that can accompany same-sex attraction at a young age. The characters work their feelings out in ways that are messy and confusing which does leave some of the last act feeling similarly messy and confusing, with Wu wrapping things up a little too abruptly, missing a few emotional beats and leaving a few unanswered questions. Religion hovers over the film (Ellie plays piano at the church but doesn\u2019t believe while Paul and Aster attend and do believe) but Wu can\u2019t seem to find a reason why, with some late in the day attempts to make a connection falling flat, especially with regards to how some of the characters view homosexuality, and the insertion of the church ultimately feels like one of the few elements in the film that could have been easily excised.</p> <p>But what keeps the film mostly on track, even in its scrappier moments, is its central trio of accomplished young actors, who\u2019ll probably see a substantive, and deserved, uptick in both career choices <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/rambling-reporter/how-noah-centineo-lana-condor-found-instagram-success-1148598\">and Instagram followers</a> after this lands. The real find is Lewis, who meters out hidden strength behind a meek demeanour, refusing to turn her character into a stock geek.

I moved home from Beirut just over a week before the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. <br><br>My husband and I hadn\u2019t planned to be apart for long, but within 10 days of my leaving, Lebanon closed its airport. So here I was: gainfully employed in a city that has never looked more beautiful, separated from the person I love most.</p> <p>I looked for the meaning: what exactly was under the trenchcoat? I thought about how, cosmically, I had found myself here as I literally hopped out of an Uber and into the emergency room, and stopped thinking about it a moment later, when the young man at the patient check-in counter saw me and burst into kind laughter.

It was reserved for the kinds of emergencies that strike when there isn\u2019t a pandemic. Many of these happen when people leave their houses.

He asked how much alcohol I consumed in a typical week, and laughed and laughed when I said \u201ca normal amount.\u201d By now, a nurse had arrived to take me for X-rays.

  "<p>Prison officers are allegedly punching compliant inmates who they suspect might misbehave in the future in a practice known as \u201cpreventive strikes\u201d, a European human rights watchdog has said in a damning report on the state of jails in England.</p> <p>A delegation from the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), part of the human rights organisation the Council of Europe, inspected three local male prisons \u2013 Liverpool, Wormwood Scrubs in west London and Doncaster \u2013 in May last year.</p> <p>In its report, the committee highlights a \u201cnew and deeply concerning\u201d finding of unjustified violence by staff on prisoners \u2013 particularly in Liverpool and Wormwood Scrubs \u2013 in the form of preventive strikes, described as \u201cpreventively punching compliant prisoners whom staff perceived might, at some point in the future, become a threat\u201d.</p> <p>The committee has called on UK authorities to ban the \u201creprehensible practice\u201d immediately and undertake an investigation into all allegations of ill-treatment.</p> <p>More broadly, the committee said that despite some progress since its last inspection in 2016, the prison system in England was in \u201cdeep crisis\u201d, finding the jails visited to be \u201cviolent, unsafe and overcrowded\u201d, echoing the repeated findings of the chief inspector of prisons in England and Wales, Peter Clarke.</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice said it was lawful for staff to use reasonable force to defend themselves against imminent threats to their personal safety but any inappropriate use of force would be subject to disciplinary proceedings and potentially criminal investigation.</p> <p>The delegation said use-of-force paperwork at Liverpool prison produced by prison staff could be inaccurate and misleading, and identified multiple cases, in which there could have been instances of unprovoked attacks by prison staff on inmates being qualified as \u201cpreventive / protective strikes\u201d.</p> <p>These included cases in which prisoners had apparently sustained injuries after direct contact with prison officers and had made complaints about ill-treatment, the report said.</p> <p>The committee interviewed the use-of-force coordinator at Liverpool prison who confirmed that, in his view, it was legitimate for staff to use \u201cpreventive\u201d strikes against a compliant prisoner if, based on previous knowledge of the inmate, they anticipated that he might pose a threat.</p> <p>At Liverpool prison, the committee noted a case in which a prison officer was contesting his sacking for launching an unprovoked attack on a prisoner on the grounds that his actions constituted a legitimate \u201cpreventive strike\u201d.</p> <p>It emerged that staff at Liverpool prison were following official 2015 guidance on \u201cpre-emptive strikes\u201d that states: \u201cThere is no rule in law to say that a person must wait to be attacked before they can defend themselves.\u201d</p> <p>However, further inquiries established the guidance was ultimately derived from Crown Prosecution Service general guidance, which leans upon a case decided in 1909.</p> <p>The report said: \u201cIn the view of the CPT, the guidance currently provided to prison officers is inadequate and leaves the impression that an entirely subjective apprehension might provide a justification for making an otherwise entirely unprovoked attack on a prisoner.</p> <p>\u201cThe CPT notes that the 2015 guidance is due to expire in early November 2019 and recommends that it be replaced with new guidance that makes clear to prison officers that engaging in so-called \u2018preventive strikes\u2019 on prisoners is unlawful and that any officer who is found to have engaged in this practice will be subject to appropriate disciplinary and/or criminal sanctions.\u201d</p> <p>Across the prisons, the committee found that prisoner-on-prisoner violence, prisoner-on-staff assaults and staff-on-prisoner violence had reached \u201crecord highs\u201d and found that none of the establishments could be considered safe.</p> <p>The report raised concerns over \u201calarmingly high levels\u201d of drug use in the prisons, as well as high numbers of prisoners suffering from mental health disorders.</p> <p>A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: \u201cThis government has made its commitment to safe, secure and decent prisons very clear.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we are creating 10,000 new places and investing in new security measures to tackle the drugs and contraband that undermine safety.</p> <p>\u201cOur hard-working staff receive world-class training and are held to high professional standards of behaviour, including the need to justify any use of physical force.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Mark Lanegan was born to an abusive mother and a hard-drinking father, his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck. Things went downhill from there. By 12, as he recounts in his new memoir, <a href=\"https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/mark-lanegan/sing-backwards-and-weep\">Sing Backwards and Weep</a>, he was a \u201ccompulsive gambler, a fledgling alcoholic, a thief, a porno fiend\u201d. By 18, his criminal record included breaking and entering, shoplifting, drug possession, vandalism, insurance fraud and 26 counts of underage drinking.</p> <p>By 21, he was in proto-grungers <a href=\"https://www.loudersound.com/features/screaming-trees-grunge-s-nearly-men\">Screaming Trees</a>. Not that he wanted to be: it was his only route out of the \u201cdusty cow town\u201d of Ellensburg, Washington, which he left on the trail of \u201cdecadence, depravity, anything, everything\u201d. At 29, eight albums later, he was living in Seattle, chain-smoking in dirty boxers and a stained bathrobe, and watching soap operas when one of his best friends kept phoning.</p> <p>He decided not to pick up. It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kurt-cobain\">Kurt Cobain</a>, who killed himself later that day. There would be many more deaths in the life of Mark Lanegan, a life that is amazingly still going. Now a long-sober 55-year-old, who\u2019s had a second career making solo records as well as ones with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93lkxzoeRcU\">Queens of the Stone Age</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/28/isobel-campbell-mark-lanegan-interview\">Isobel Campbell</a> and Greg Dulli (as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/dec/08/popandrock2\">Gutter Twins</a>), Lanegan speaks to me twice for this interview: the first time at London\u2019s Roundhouse in December, before playing a gig to support his electronic pop-heavy album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/18/mark-lanegan-band-somebodys-knocking-review\">Somebody\u2019s Knocking</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e1a448769b8f79d6445f29a9e3f3e05d070360fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1a448769b8f79d6445f29a9e3f3e05d070360fa/0_0_640_793/404.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018He was touched by greatness\u2019 ...

Kurt Cobain, right, with Lanegan, front, and Dylan Carlson in 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kurt Cobain Memorial Foundation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That first encounter is painful: Lanegan doesn\u2019t want to talk about his memoir at all. He\u2019s in front of a chintzy mirror backstage, signing books, peering at the pages through thick glasses. Eye contact is practically nil. The atmosphere thaws briefly when he goes outside to smoke three cigarettes, which he twists in his star-tattooed fingers. \u201cSo many times I wanted to stop writing the book, but I had an obligation,\u201d he says. His speaking voice, like his singing voice, is magnificent, heavy and gnarly.</p> <p>Lanegan had promised a friend, Kitchen Confidential writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/09/anthony-bourdain-obituary\">Anthony Bourdain</a>, that he would write his memoirs. Bourdain had encouraged him to do a preface to his 2017 lyric collection, <a href=\"https://www.echoesanddust.com/2017/09/mark-lanegan-i-am-the-wolf-lyrics-and-writings/\">I Am the Wolf</a>, loved his writing, and pressed him to do more. \u201cAnthony said, \u2018There needs be a level of honesty beyond what you\u2019ll be comfortable with for it not to be some crappy rock autobiography.\u2019 That was the last thing I wanted to do, ever. This might sound ridiculous, but if it\u2019s not literature, I didn\u2019t want to do it.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2018/jun/08/anthony-bourdain-a-life-in-pictures\">Bourdain killed himself in 2018</a> when Lanegan was only four chapters in. \u201cI had to finish it for him.\u201d He offers a brief flicker of humour. \u201cI had also taken the first third of the advance and couldn\u2019t pay it back.\u201d</p> <p>Sing Backwards and Weep documents Lanegan\u2019s life up to the late 90s. He didn\u2019t want to include his childhood at all. \u201cBut I was told you didn\u2019t just create your musical life in a vacuum. There\u2019s got to be some backstory.\u201d His parents were \u201cproducts of extreme poverty and cruel deprivation\u201d who became schoolteachers. His mother, Floy, saw her father murdered on her front lawn as a child. She treated her son abysmally. When he broke his femur at eight and was in a full body cast, she dropped a box of hardback textbooks on his head in a fit of rage. Lanegan was more fond of his father, Dale, \u201ca good-hearted, caring man who meant well but could not control me\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9dc707f36e89b2a7aee2eae9e056b89c46ae6ca7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dc707f36e89b2a7aee2eae9e056b89c46ae6ca7/0_0_5582_8274/675.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018So many times I wanted to stop writing the book, but I had an obligation\u2019 \u2026 Lanegan at the Roundhouse, London.\" width=\"675\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018So many times I wanted to stop writing the book, but I had an obligation\u2019 \u2026 Lanegan at the Roundhouse, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A picture of Iggy Pop in Creem magazine changed Lanegan\u2019s life in high school, opening his eyes and ears to punk. Becoming a musician wasn\u2019t thrilling for him initially, as he never got on with his Screaming Tree bandmates. \u201cI often found myself counting the seconds before I strangled [Gary] Lee [Conner] to death,\u201d he writes of the band\u2019s guitarist and founder. They were signed to Epic Records before the grunge boom, and had a minor hit with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkJ6WBOA5M\">Nearly Lost You</a> in 1992, by which point Lanegan had wrested control of the band. But all was not well. \u201cI basically had to stay in a band I didn\u2019t like in order to make money to support my drug habit.\u201d</p> <p>The drug stories in the memoir are relentless and grim. The heroin that \u201ckept me from dying from the horrors of my severe alcoholism\u201d is mentioned 102 times. During a 1992 Screaming Trees tour, he\u2019s in hospital with an arm infected so badly doctors are considering amputating it. The many stories about sex usually revolve around drugs, too. During this stint in hospital, his drum tech tries and fails to get him his \u201cfinal blowjob as a two-armed person\u201d in a stairwell from a sex worker, even though Lanegan is on an intravenous drip. He\u2019s mortified by this behaviour now, he says.</p> <p>Lanegan documents his friendship with Cobain with tenderness. He first sees Nirvana at a community centre gig in 1988 with his friend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/05/earth-dylan-carlson-interview\">Dylan Carson</a>, who soon forms the doom metal band Earth. \u201cI walked back to my depressing hovel with an electricity in my step and a newfound buoyancy of spirit,\u201d Lanegan writes. \u201cI had just experienced something touched by greatness.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40d06eef13da40d725ff31a3e63cfa8fa32b8fe9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40d06eef13da40d725ff31a3e63cfa8fa32b8fe9/0_98_3680_2208/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I had to stay in a band I didn\u2019t like to make money to support my drug habit\u2019 \u2026 Screaming Trees on the BBC\u2019s Later With Jools in 1996.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I had to stay in a band I didn\u2019t like to make money to support my drug habit\u2019 \u2026 Screaming Trees on the BBC\u2019s Later With Jools in 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andre Csillag/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cobain and Lanegan become good friends, beginning a project covering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/19/lead-belly-smithsonian-folkways-collection-review\">Lead Belly</a> songs that runs out of steam. Lanegan repurposes their version of Where Did You Sleep Last Night? for his 1990 debut album, <a href=\"https://consequenceofsound.net/2012/02/dusting-em-off-mark-lanegan-the-winding-sheet/\">The Winding Sheet</a>. (Nirvana replicated it on their 1993 Unplugged in New York show for MTV.)</p> <p>He finds it hard talking about Cobain. He hadn\u2019t picked up the phone because he hadn\u2019t wanted to buy his friend drugs, and Cobain was also frequently arguing with his wife, Courtney Love. \u201cI knew him for a long time before he was a superstar. I considered him a cherished little brother. That\u2019s a guilt I\u2019ll always have.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Liam Gallagher stood there trying to look menacing, like a Z-grade Seven Seagal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a deeply sensitive book, too. There\u2019s a touching scene in which one of Lanegan\u2019s many ex-girlfriends, musician Selene Vigil, asks him, \u201cWhat happened to you to make you so sad?\u201d and his \u201cgrief pours out in torrents\u201d. He writes beautifully about getting into Nick Drake, Leonard Cohen and Tim Hardin, and how moved he was seeing Neil Young play live in 1996, while Screaming Trees were touring with Oasis.</p> <p>This chapter also involves a hilarious face-off between Lanegan and \u201cbothersome mosquito\u201d Liam Gallagher, who he says was desperate to have a scrap: \u201cLiam continued to stand there like a petulant child trying to look menacing \u2026 with all the scare factor of a Z-grade Steven Seagal.\u201d</p> <p>The book ends in 1997, after the year-long stint of rehab that Courtney Love paid for. \u201cShe had a direct impact on my life \u2013 I have nothing but love for her.\u201d Would he write about the subsequent years? \u201cNo. No way,\u201d he says, remembering the pain of getting it all down. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put myself through that again.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6891023452a347315356c47ca89d312933bc8a13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6891023452a347315356c47ca89d312933bc8a13/0_465_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I won\u2019t have to answer any questions any more\u2019 \u2026 one of Lanegan\u2019s motivations for penning his memoir.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I won\u2019t have to answer any questions any more\u2019 \u2026 one of Lanegan\u2019s motivations for penning his memoir.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He\u2019s spent his life trying to distance himself from the days before he got clean, to have some sort of career in music. \u201cI know so many people from that timeframe who don\u2019t make music any more \u2013 and I didn\u2019t want to be one.\u201d Why write about those years at all? \u201cBecause it means I won\u2019t have to answer any questions any more. If anyone wants to know what this experience was like \u2026\u201d He gestures to the signed pages in front of him, then gives me his one smile of the day. \u201cIt\u2019s all there.\u201d</p> <p>We speak again in early March, Lanegan in his home studio in Burbank, Los Angeles. (He\u2019s lived in California since he got clean.) He\u2019s much warmer and brighter, apologising profusely for our previous meeting: his wife, musician <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shelleybrien?lang=en\">Shelley Brien</a>, was in hospital when we met (she\u2019s better, but he didn\u2019t want to mention it), he was jet-lagged, he hadn\u2019t known I was coming until that day, and he was anxious about the gig, which he considered the biggest of his life: \u201cPlaying music in the Roundhouse, to so many people, that had nothing to do with that time period of my book. It meant something. It meant I\u2019d transcended things.\u201d</p> <p>Released to accompany the memoir, Lanegan\u2019s forthcoming album, Straight Songs of Sorrow, sees him in much more comfortable territory. \u201cSongs usually aren\u2019t about real life for me \u2013 they start in some sort of reality, or mood, but then they just come out in another way. But these songs were related to memories because of where I\u2019d just been, looking back, which is something I rarely do. And, for me, writing music is a joyful experience no matter what the content.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/dec/16/observer-obituaries-2018-anthony-bourdain-remembered-by-mark-lanegan\">Anthony Bourdain remembered by Mark Lanegan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Black humour crackles through the album, as Lanegan describes himself as a wounded Atlas and aged hustler. \u201cOh, I\u2019m glad you hear that humour.

I wish people would hear that more often.\u201d He still writes songs such as I Wouldn\u2019t Want to Say, about how pleased he is to have \u201cno heirs to my disease / No one else to curse with this gene\u201d. But he also talks warmly about the next generation of his wider family. \u201cI have three beautiful nephews from my older sister \u2013 one is 14, and already better making music than I was at 33. It\u2019s been the blessing of my life watching them grow.\u201d</p> <p>Does he like getting older? \u201cAll the meaningless, stressful bullshit that seems so important when you\u2019re young has ceased to matter. Somebody said to me once, \u2018You either get old or you don\u2019t.\u2019 Turns out, I\u2019m quite happy to be getting old.\u201d I wonder whether writing the book and the album has also underlined how much he\u2019s changed for the better. \u201cI wish I could say I\u2019m a perfect example of transformation, and transcendence, but I\u2019m basically still a guy who considers himself a breakfast cook who\u2019s been singing for a while.\u201d</p> <p>He laughs darkly. \u201cI\u2019m still a deeply flawed person.

  "<p>Hop into something comfy and let\u2019s get started!\u201d This is how Adriene Mishler, YouTube\u2019s biggest yoga guru, begins many of her videos. For those of us who are not spending our quarantine days writing an update of King Lear or attempting to follow along with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/apr/01/shape-of-the-future-how-barrys-bootcamp-changed-the-way-we-work-out\" title=\"\">Barry\u2019s Bootcamp</a> on Instagram, Mishler\u2019s just-show-up approach to yoga is a comfort and a welcome distraction. In recent months, she has been described as \u201cthe patron saint of quarantine\u201d (Paper magazine), \u201cthe most influential yoga teacher on the planet\u201d (Refinery29), and \u201cOur saviour\u201d (a fan on Twitter).</p> <p>Mishler was already huge before the pandemic \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene\" title=\"\">her channel</a>, which has more than 7 million subscribers, is the first to pop up when you search for \u201cyoga\u201d on YouTube \u2013 but the lockdown has catapulted her to a new level of fame. Fans on social media recommend their favourite videos, post charcoal drawings of her and express their undying devotion to her for keeping them sane. One devotee even built <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benagain/status/1250357935601004550\" title=\"\">a digital replica</a> of her home studio in the video game Animal Crossing. There are countless memes about her, as well as ones about her dog, a blue heeler, or Australian cattle dog, named Benji, who frequently makes cameo appearances lounging beside the mat, or wandering into shot.</p> <p>Working out at home in the time of coronavirus is fraught. Most of us don\u2019t have much space to spare, let alone weights or props to replicate the gym (or a steam room or a woman arguing on her phone while jogging on a treadmill next to you). But even for those of us committed to being deeply unambitious during this period, exercise does eventually seem like a good idea, if not just to make up for all the pasta dinners and handfuls of milk chocolate \u2013 also to alleviate boredom, or sore backs from sitting cross-legged on the couch all day, or to introduce some movement beyond padding in slippers a few feet from the bedroom to a makeshift standing desk (a laptop propped up on a cupboard), or to give the illusion of some form of routine.</p> <p>Even though every form of exercise, from pilates to ecstatic dance, is being offered in online workouts, and in many cases for free, yoga seems to have risen to the top. It doesn\u2019t require any fancy accessories \u2013 you don\u2019t even need a mat \u2013 and there\u2019s a meditative aspect that helps with all of our extremely warranted anxiety.</p> <p>Mishler has pitched herself as the perfect first step for yoga novices. Whatever ails you, Mishler seems to have a class for it. She has videos for back pain, vulnerability (an entirely seated practice with a lot of lying in the foetal position), anger (a lot of breathing exercises and child\u2019s pose to calm down) and self-care (literally hugging yourself). There is yoga for runners (a seven-minute full body stretch for before or after a jog) and for those in the service industry (relief from being on one\u2019s feet all day), and even yoga for writers (\u201cfocus the brain and body inward so you can perform, create and be your best\u201d). Some of the classes can be done in bed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5604b49f436bc792b2d0cb346dee06de2a366282\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5604b49f436bc792b2d0cb346dee06de2a366282/0_0_2483_1928/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two women practising yoga while on lockdown at home in Santiago, Chile.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"776\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two women practising yoga while on lockdown at home in Santiago, Chile.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Bernetti/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maybe what attracts so many people to Mishler is what she\u2019s not: she isn\u2019t threatening, has none of the holier-than-thou quality of someone who just came back from rigorous spiritual training, and nor is she stone-faced or humourless. On screen, Mishler, who is 35, comes across as sweet and wholesome, like the one popular girl in school who was actually kind. Her classes tend to be slow-placed, with clear instructions for absolute beginners and insight for more experienced students. She\u2019s good at telling you how to avoid injury, which is important when there\u2019s no teacher in the room to correct or guide you deeper into a pose. She can occasionally seem a little homespun \u2013 with her Texan \u201chowdy\u201d \u2013 or get a little spiritual and write on her website that \u201cYoga is really the art of waking up\u201d.</p> <p>Right now, while we are stuck \u2013 in our cramped apartments, our crowded living rooms, our sunless basement flats, our solitary terraces \u2013 yoga offers us a solution, an escape, a way to unwind. It doesn\u2019t come larded with the kind of ambition that drives people to train for marathons or visit the gym several times a week to lose weight. Yoga is only interested in the present, an apt philosophy at a moment when the future is so uncertain. As a teacher, Mishler is not doing anything revolutionary, but she has struck a chord in these anxious times. By not doing too much, and not asking us to do too much, she\u2019s become the woman of the hour.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>These days Mishler receives so many requests that her press office sends automated emails apologising in advance if it takes a while to respond. But after I got through to her voicemail \u2013 which features her singing a song about leaving a message to the tune of the Chili\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ypx4dy/the-inventor-of-the-chilis-baby-back-ribs-song-has-never-eaten-their-ribs\" title=\"\">\u201cbaby back ribs\u201d jingle</a> \u2013 Mishler called me back about a minute later, apologising for missing the call.</p> <p>On the phone from her home in Austin, Texas, Mishler sounded exactly like she does in her videos: extremely friendly, sincere and polite. She thanked me for asking how her quarantine is going. \u201cIt\u2019s best-case scenario,\u201d she said. \u201cMy boyfriend lives eight minutes away. He\u2019s the only person that I see, and he can work at his home and I can work here. A lot of people assume I must be golden \u2026 Oh come on, buddy!\u201d \u2013 she broke off to yell at Benji the dog, who was barking in the background. Others are having a much harder time of it, she said, such as her friends who have kids, but she admitted to having occasional wobbles. \u201cYou have your own discombobulated moment each day where you feel like you\u2019re in the Groundhog Day movie.\u201d</p> <p>Mishler grew up in an arty family in Austin. As a teenager, she took acting classes, in which she learned about mind-body practices such as yoga. Later, while trying to make it as a professional actor \u2013 among her early roles was a cameo as \u201ccute female student\u201d in an episode of the TV show Friday Night Lights \u2013 she qualified as a yoga teacher and taught some classes. Her main frame of reference for exercising at home was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/13/fitness-retro-workouts\" title=\"\">Jane Fonda\u2019s</a> classic 1980s do-it-for-the-burn aerobics videos, along with Rodney Yee\u2019s yoga DVDs, which featured a lot of instruction but not much fun.</p> <p>The origins of Yoga With Adriene go back to the set of a horror movie, where she met an independent film-maker called Christopher Sharpe, who had helped create a popular YouTube channel starring his wife, the chef Hilah Johnson. Afterwards, Sharpe and Mishler stayed in touch, and in 2012, when Sharpe was looking for new YouTube projects, he asked Mishler if she wanted to start a yoga channel. In September that year, they began uploading videos.</p> <p>\u201cI had this inkling, if we all had an at-home yoga practice, it would change everything \u2013 it could become like a normal hygiene practice, or saying a prayer if you\u2019re a spiritual person,\u201d Mishler told me. \u201cA daily practice that can be medicinal \u2013 you could roll out the mat if you\u2019re stressed. That was a huge stretch in 2012, but I was so broke that I thought it was worth a try.\u201d</p> <p>Yoga studios and, really, gyms in general, can be intimidating places. There\u2019s the fear of looking as if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s easy to stand out by being the largest person in the room, or the only man in the yoga class, or the only woman lifting free weights, or the only person of colour, full stop. Plus, they\u2019re expensive and they require commitment.</p> <p>Mishler\u2019s channel aimed to remove these stresses. One thing that made her videos appealing was that they weren\u2019t filmed in a professional studio or in a fancy home, settings that were popular in older workout videos. By filming in a private space \u2013 Mishler did her workout in a living room \u2013 the videos felt more intimate and personal, tapping into the same qualities that were becoming popular in other YouTube genres, from singing covers of a song in a bedroom to cooking in regular home kitchens.</p> <p>While the setting was clean and bright, it wasn\u2019t aspirational, unlike the Rodney Yee videos, filmed on beaches with spectacular views or at the foot of snow-capped mountains. Mishler was just a nice-looking woman in a nice-enough room wearing a tank top and leggings that didn\u2019t even match. It suited her, but it was also a deliberate decision \u2013 a strategy, even though she hates that word \u2013 to make her the yoga girl next door.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8ba20dfbbb188994dff84e8fcbd3ac716d1c557c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ba20dfbbb188994dff84e8fcbd3ac716d1c557c/0_157_816_367/500.jpg\" alt=\"yoga with adriene - posing with benji the dog - from official website\" width=\"500\" height=\"225\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yoga teacher Adriene Mishler with her dog, Benji.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yoga With Adriene/Find What Feels Good</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In this, Benji is a useful ally. He serves not just as a beloved pet, but as a muse and a beacon of calm as he sleeps on the sidelines. \u201cHe is a great tool for the storytelling. His presence just lends itself so well to not feeling like it\u2019s a super-produced video,\u201d she said, and as if he knew he was being referenced, Benji barked several times in the background. \u201cBenji is a way to tear down the fourth wall without being pretentious. Maybe that\u2019s too heavy of a word. We\u2019re here together and he helps set the tone.\u201d</p> <p>As Mishler was crafting the channel\u2019s tone, Sharpe was carefully studying how YouTube users search for yoga and other workouts, compiling lists of key terms and optimising the titles of the videos. Instead of just creating classes that might suit potential needs, they looked at Sharpe\u2019s studies and tailored classes according to what people were searching for. This is why Mishler\u2019s classes include Yoga for Back Pain, Yoga for Lower Back Pain, Yoga for Upper Back Pain, as well as Upper Back Love, and, of course, Lower Back Love.</p> <p>The YouTube channel wasn\u2019t an overnight hit. It took about two years of posting a new video each week to reach 200,000 subscribers, and that was the point at which it started to become commercially successful. Mishler\u2019s videos aren\u2019t heavily branded, but the website Social Blade, which tracks growth on YouTube, estimates that the channel could make as much as $188,500 per month on advertising revenue alone.</p> <p>For hardcore fans looking to venture further into the Mishler universe, there is also a subscription service ($9.99 per month) called Find What Feels Good, in which the best-friend vibe is amped up even more, via exclusive classes, vlogs, meditations and blog posts. She also leads retreats, and holds large events for International Yoga Day each June. But this year, a retreat in Mexico City combining Spanish lessons and yoga \u2013 Mishler\u2019s mother is Mexican \u2013 scheduled for May had to be cancelled, as did an upcoming event at the United Nations.</p> <p>On 12 April, Mishler began her email newsletter with the following: \u201cI am sending you some loving energy from my humble abode. It is Sunday. Just in case you need a reminder.\u201d And then she included a poem, which, depending on your perspective, will be either painfully twee or gently comforting:</p> <p><em>Today is another day in which we are blessed with the opportunity to rise,</em><br><em>To continue, and awaken.</em><br><em>To slowly nod with forgiveness,</em><br><em>Squint the eyes \u2013</em><br><em>Just a bit,</em><br><em>And whisper,</em><br><em>I got this.</em></p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>I attended a Californian high school that offered yoga as part of its physical education programme. At 16 I signed up for it \u2013 along with all the other misfits who weren\u2019t enrolled in typical private-school sports such as lacrosse or field hockey \u2013 and learned crow pose and breathing techniques from a long-haired ageing hippie with a gentle demeanour. I liked it enough, but didn\u2019t take yoga classes again until after university, when I found myself living down the street from a yoga studio.</p> <p>In 2015, after I joined a studio in Manhattan, I would go to a yoga class every couple of days. This year I took the plunge, going from being a yoga student who attended class a few times a week to teaching a restorative yoga class once a week at a downtown studio called Sky Ting. I have never thought of myself as a natural teacher, but I loved it. Teaching was, frankly, kind of a power trip. I like being in charge, putting together a playlist, watching students tumble out of class in a relaxed afterglow. My classes were in the late afternoon on Thursdays. Friends came by, but so did people I didn\u2019t know, and they started to come every week, which was thrilling: I knew what I was doing enough that people wanted more. I started in the second week of January, but was only able to teach for two months before business was suspended.</p> <p>On a recent Sunday evening, I taught one class via Instagram from my sitting room. My yoga studio provided its teachers with notes on setting up, from how to best position our phones to tips on creating as inviting a space as possible in a tiny New York apartment (plants and natural light are good, dirty floors and clutter are best avoided). I tend not to speak a lot during my classes. It\u2019s a conscious choice based on years of wishing that I could zone out and not have to hear a teacher chattering along. But a lot of silence while demonstrating poses alone in front of a screen just translates to dead air, which feels awkward, so I found myself making commentary to fill up the silence. My class, like Mishler\u2019s, was treated to a spontaneous appearance by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/12/doctors-note-dog-on-plane-emotional-support-animals\" title=\"\">my bulldog, Joan</a>, when she wandered over to investigate what I was doing. I missed touching my students, running a hand down their spine to encourage deeper relaxation or massaging their foreheads to relieve tension. But I also loved that anyone could join, and students could say hello or send a comment through the app. (That said, I could have done without the person who kept messaging me to say I should change my music.)</p> <p>Because so many studios have taken their classes online, I\u2019ve also got to tune into some of my favourite far-flung teachers and friends, from Portugal to Los Angeles. When I spoke to one of these teachers, Kyle Miller, about her experience of teaching on Zoom, she was near-rapturous. \u201cGetting to see everyone, talk and hang out in the moments before and after class, getting to watch the students as they practise and teach right to them, it\u2019s been incredible and unexpected,\u201d she said. \u201cIt honestly feels like I\u2019ve socialised. I ride a high after my streams!\u201d Yoga teachers, it seems, are perhaps the world\u2019s most gifted people when it comes to putting a positive spin on things.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Mishler is not really a superstar teacher like the types who headline Wanderlust \u2013 the global travelling yoga festival that is sort of like Coachella for the spiritually inclined, at which fans shell out around $200 to take massive yoga classes led by teachers talking rapturously about the need to be humble. Nor is Mishler <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/apr/05/its-genuine-you-know-why-the-online-influencer-industry-is-going-authentic\" title=\"\">an influencer</a> in the current sense, posing for highly branded and sponsored photos with perfect hair. Her own Instagram is simple and relatively unflashy, featuring photos of the sky, grocery store flowers and, of course, Benji. She is careful not to sound too out-there or new age, and will often poke fun at something she says by using an exaggeratedly calm, smug-yoga-lady voice. Her online persona recalls a time when normal people could become famous on the internet for being good at being themselves \u2013 Justin Bieber before he became Justin Bieber.</p> <p>Mishler acknowledges that she has made compromises to broaden her reach. She understands that she grew her audience based on a canny understanding of how to target her videos, but there is an awkward disconnect between the kind of yoga she wants to teach and what is most sought after on YouTube. Her most popular videos are, she said, \u201ca tight race between anything that has \u2018anxiety\u2019 in the title and also the yoga for weight loss\u201d. She feels weird about that, she says. \u201cI do not teach yoga for weight loss, that\u2019s not my end goal, but, you know, when that is in the title in the SEO, it attracts a lot more people than it would have otherwise,\u201d she said, sounding a little defensive. \u201cI know there is integrity in the content,\u201d she said.</p> <p>While the coronavirus pandemic has brought legions of new fans, it might also mean that, for the first time, Yoga With Adriene could have some real competition. Every yoga brand is trying to ride out this wave of isolation and come out with more followers at the other end. Local studios from all over the world are live-streaming from home so students can take classes with their favourite teachers, not just what\u2019s free on YouTube. Big brands are also pushing their online classes, including Nike, Alo, Gaia, Sweaty Betty, CorePower, Lululemon and Yoga Journal. Meanwhile, on YouTube, there are now numerous videos that seem to borrow heavily from Yoga With Adriene\u2019s formula: accessible classes performed in homey environments. New competitors include Yoga By Candace and Yoga With Tim. They both include their dogs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/what-coronavirus-can-teach-us-about-hope-rebecca-solnit\">'The impossible has already happened': what coronavirus can teach us about hope</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whenever we are let out of our homes, my guess would be that yoga studios will have waiting lists. They\u2019ll likely be different from before, operating at no more than a quarter of their usual capacity allowing students (who\u2019ll bring their own mats) to keep two metres apart. But even with those compromises, it will probably feel better than practising one more day in front of a screen.</p> <p>What seemed reassuring in quarantine might feel claustrophobic when we\u2019re let out, and for Mishler, it\u2019s possible that there might be a downside to being so closely associated with a strange and miserable time. While we all troop gratefully back to class, Mishler will still be taping herself at home, doing yoga to a camera in her sitting room, Benji by her side. But worrying too much about the future is not quite in the spirit of Yoga With Adriene, which is all about the here and now. As she writes on her website: \u201cThe process is the candy.

The imperial palace sitting across Tiananmen Square was shut down on 25 January as authorities closed tourist attractions and took other extraordinary measures to contain the virus, including locking down an entire province.</p> <h2><strong>Japan expected to extend state of emergency by a month</strong></h2> <p>Japan\u2019s government is expected to extend a nationwide state of emergency for another month, after the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, described the coronavirus outbreak as \u201csevere\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>US drug trial shows \u2018clear cut\u2019 effect, says top medic</strong></h2> <p>While a Chinese trial demonstrated no \u201csignificant clinical benefits\u201d to administering the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/remdesivir-coronavirus-drug-experimental?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">antiviral drug remdesivir</a> to Covid-19 patients, a separate trial in the US shows a \u201cclear-cut\u201d effect, according to the head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr Anthony Fauci.</p> <h2><strong>Police called after New York funeral home stores bodies in trucks</strong></h2> <p>Police were called to a Brooklyn neighbourhood Wednesday after a funeral home overwhelmed by the coronavirus resorted to storing dozens of bodies on ice in rented trucks, and a passerby complained about the smell, officials said. Investigators who responded to a 911 call found that the home had rented four trucks to hold about 50 corpses, according to a law enforcement official.</p> <h2><strong>More cases of rare syndrome in children</strong></h2> <p>Doctors around the world have reported more cases of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/29/more-cases-of-rare-syndrome-in-children-reported-globally\">rare but potentially lethal inflammatory syndrome in children</a> that appears to be linked to coronavirus infections. Nearly 100 cases of the unusual illness have emerged in at least six countries, with doctors in Britain, the US, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland now reported to be investigating the condition.</p> <h2><strong>South Africa\u2019s virus cases jump past 5,000 after highest daily rise</strong></h2> <p>The number of coronavirus cases in South Africa surged past the 5,000 mark on Thursday after it saw the largest single-day jump to date, health ministry figures showed.

Prince of Orange is another name for the orange tip, <em>Anthocharis cardamines</em><em>,</em> a white butterfly of country lanes and woodland rides; the males have foxy-dabbed forewings, a spring-bringer.

Lady Hale, the president of the British supreme court, favours brooches. She famously wore a giant jewelled spider the day she ruled that UK prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/28/lady-hale-spider-brooch-launches-global-trend\">\u201cvoid and of no effect\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court Ruth Bader-Ginsberg has her dissent collar. <br><br>Her Majesty the queen, may once have used a brooch to express one\u2019s distaste for Donald Trump, her love of Obama and her approval of Canada. She may even have worn a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/jun/21/queens-hat-alludes-to-brexit\">pro-European Union hat</a>.<br><br>Strangely, Dr Birx has not had much time to comment on the meaning behind her scarves. We know that one, an Afework Tekle art silk scarf from Ethiopia, was a gift from a colleague. Another, also Herm\u00e8s, costs around US$700. Some, like one called Eagle and another called Daughters of the American Revolution, are patriotic.</p> \n<p>Then there\u2019s the scarf featuring a cherry blossom motif, which may or may not be a reference to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/aug/26/braindead-the-absurd-new-thriller-that-will-make-your-head-explode\">BrainDead</a>, a TV show in which aliens living in Washington\u2019s cherry trees take over the minds of politicians. It seems likelier that Dr Birx had the Northern Hemisphere spring on her mind \u2013 but who knows?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-0XWcOpZa_/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

  "<p>Bank bashing is always popular in Australia and it\u2019s by no means confined to one side of politics. It was the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull who introduced the big bank levy and gave us the royal commission into misconduct in the financial services industry. And, just last week, Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg reportedly \u201cslammed\u201d the big banks for being slow to process loan applications from small businesses waiting to receive their share of the promised $130bn jobkeeper wage subsidy payment.</p> <p>But no matter how hard governments bash, it doesn\u2019t put a dent in the banks\u2019 profits. Last year the big-four banks, which between them control 78% of the home loan lending market, made more than $41bn in profit. To put that in perspective, of every $100 of income in Australia, $2.10 goes to the big-four banks.</p> <p>While Morrison might be frustrated with the banks over their response to his jobkeeper package, the chief executives of the big banks are counting their lucky stars \u2013 and the new cash that the prime minister has sent their way \u2013 thanks to the design of that same policy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/26/the-130bn-wage-subsidy-that-united-unions-and-coalition-but-left-millions-in-the-cold\">Shine wears off the $130bn jobkeeper subsidy as millions are left in the cold</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The jobkeeper payment of $1,500 a fortnight is expected to cost around $130bn over the next six months. For comparison, the total commonwealth budget for health and education is only $119bn, and that\u2019s for 12 months\u2019 worth of the most essential services. Jobkeeper is, by far, the most expensive social policy in Australian history. But despite its enormous cost the policy cannot help employers unless the banks help them first.</p> <p>When the Morrison government announced the program on 30 March it was seen as a lifeline for millions of employees and hundreds of thousands of employers who knew that with no customers in the stores there would be no money for wages. But, unlike most lifelines, jobkeeper comes with strings attached.</p> <p>While it\u2019s more than four weeks since Morrison announced the wage subsidy, no employers have yet received it. The payment is made \u201cin arrears\u201d, which means that eligible businesses that have lost their customers have to find the cash to pay the $750-a-week subsidy to employees for six to eight weeks.</p> <p>Luckily, the banks are there to help.</p> <p>A small business with 20 staff eligible for the $750 jobkeeper payment, who had to wait six weeks for the government\u2019s cheque to arrive, would need to find $90,000 to pay their staff. And if it doesn\u2019t have such an amount stuffed under the mattress, under the design principles of the most expensive policy in Australian history, the government expects it to go to the banks and ask for a loan.</p> <p>The banks charge up to 10% interest on unsecured loans to business. With hundreds of thousands of businesses needing a private lender before they can access public funding, that\u2019s not a bad source of profit for the banks in otherwise tough times. I know, I know, the banks are taking some risk of non-repayment but, as luck would have it, the government has also promised to underwrite the risks of loans to small business.</p> <p>You would think that when a government decides to spend $130bn to help workers, it would be able to do so in a way that doesn\u2019t require the businesses employing those workers to pay the banks while they wait for it. However, Australia\u2019s \u201cbusiness-led\u201d but government-funded approach to wage subsidies isn\u2019t quick, cheap or efficient.</p> <p>While governments like to bash the banks rhetorically, they do nothing to challenge them financially. Rather than force small business to borrow money from private banks to access the publicly funded jobkeeper, the government could have provided the cash more quickly or it could have lent the money directly to small business.</p> <p>While it may seem unprecedented for governments to lend directly to individuals, the reality is that successive Labor and Coalition governments have been making tens of billions of dollars worth of loans to hundreds of thousands of Australians for decades.</p> <p>The most visible form of government lending in Australia is the $60bn worth of loans we have made to our university students. On the loans formerly known as Hecs the government charges interest, collects the debts through the tax system and is, in every meaningful sense, acting as a bank. In the US, privately funded student loans are both a major barrier to low-income earners going to college and a major source of financial hardship for those who do but, in Australia, publicly funded student loans make university more accessible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/25/fixing-jobkeeper-why-the-banks-are-not-to-blame-for-flaws-in-the-wage-scheme\">Fixing jobkeeper: why the banks are not to blame for flaws in the wage scheme</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While only a small percentage of the millions of Centrelink customers realise it, the commonwealth government will lend any benefit recipients who ask for it up to $1,000 as an advance on their future welfare payments. It is interest-free, and a much better deal than credit cards or payday lenders but the government that offers the product rarely mentions it.</p> <p>And then there is the pension loan scheme. If you are over 65 and own your own home then the government will lend you up to $860 a fortnight, secured against your house and repayable on sale of your house on death. It\u2019s a reverse mortgage. No need for the banks to operate as an expensive middleman.</p> <p>Bashing the banks for ripping off customers and being slow to lend to small business is easy, and popular, but it does nothing to dent the banks\u2019 excessive profits or help their customers. Most Australians will need to borrow money at some point in their life, and in the coming 12 months far more Australians than usual will need access to borrowed money \u2013 from small businesses paying their staff, to unemployed workers paying their car rego. While private banks play an important role in our economy, for simple loans the government can step in and provide a cheap alternative. Morrison has said that there is no role for ideology when it comes to solving a crisis. In that case, let\u2019s see government loans on the table.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Denniss is chief economist at the independent thinktank the Australia Institute</p>",

Karofsky\u2019s 10-year term begins on 1 August, and she will narrow the conservative majority on the court from 5-2 to 4-3.</p> \n  <p>Stephen Gillers, a law professor at NYU and an expert on judicial ethics, said he did not see anything improper in Kelly\u2019s decision. \u201cIt is rare but not unheard of for a judge who recuses to unrecuse,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cJudge Kelly is still a judge and the matter is before his court. The reason for the prior recusal, which was correct at the time, is no longer present.

Before it was blocked by a lower court in 2016, it prevented around 30,000 people from registering to vote. </p> \n  <p><strong>Kris Kobach</strong>, the former Kansas secretary of state nationally known for his anti-immigrant views and support of voting restrictions, championed the measure, saying it was necessary to prevent non-citizens from registering to vote in his state.

The court noted that \u201cat most\u201d 39 non-citizens had registered to vote in Kansas over the last 19 years.

href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/28/us/coronavirus-death-toll-total.html\">reports</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> Total deaths in seven states that have been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic are nearly 50 percent higher than normal for the five weeks from March 8 through April 11, according to new death statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That is 9,000 more deaths than were reported as of April 11 in official counts of deaths from the coronavirus.</p> \n   <p>The new data is partial and most likely undercounts the recent death toll significantly. But it still illustrates how the coronavirus is causing a surge in deaths in the places it has struck, probably killing more people than the reported statistics capture. These increases belie arguments that the virus is only killing people who would have died anyway from other causes. Instead, the virus has brought a pattern of deaths unlike anything seen in recent years.</p> \n   <p>If you look at the provisional deaths from all causes, death counts in New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois, Maryland and Colorado have spiked far above their normal levels for the period. In New York City, the home of the biggest outbreak, the number of deaths over this period is more than three times the normal number. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>New York officials have already said the state\u2019s reported death toll, which is the highest in the country, is likely an undercount because many coronavirus victims died at home without being officially tested for the virus.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea996778f08745586317e8b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-29T15:04:35.737Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Trump mocked Justin Amash after the independent congressman announced the formation of an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian party\u2019s presidential nomination. </strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1255510996623527936\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">No, I think Amash would make a wonderful candidate, especially since he is way behind in his district and has no chance of maintaining his Congressional seat.
