  "<p>Until just five years ago South Koreans faced up to two years in prison for cheating on their spouse. Today extramarital affairs are no longer a crime but husbands and wives who commit adultery can still expect criticism \u2013 and cheating remains a subject of some fascination.</p> <p>That fascination has been credited with turning the South Korean remake of the British TV drama Doctor Foster \u2013 which tells the story of a GP whose life unravels after she discovers her husband is having an affair \u2013 into an unexpected hit.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZfayFkXEDQ\">The World of the Married</a> has racked up huge audiences since it was first broadcast at the end of March, with viewers gripped by the intense storyline and cliffhanger endings, and by what it says about the battle of the sexes in South Korean society.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/23/south-korea-female-writers-rise-up-cho-nam-joo\">'A coldness that masks a burning rage': South Korea's female writers rise up</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last weekend it became the <a href=\"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/art/2020/05/688_288885.html\">highest-rated South Korean drama in cable TV history</a>, securing a nationwide viewer share of 24.3%, having attracted just over 6% of viewers when it first aired.</p> <p>\u201cI used to catch up on sleep during the little free time I had,\u201d says Choi Young-hoon, a 28-year-old bar owner in Seoul. \u201cBut I find myself arranging my schedule around this drama.

You have to find a potential partner from the same pool, otherwise you\u2019re considered greedy and overstepping your bounds.\u201d</p> <p>But the drama has also drawn criticism. Some viewers thought that presenting an attack on Dr Ji by a home intruder in the style of a video game trivialised violence against women. And parents whose young children have been forced to stay home by the coronavirus outbreak were unimpressed by sex scenes broadcast on daytime TV.</p> <p>Kwon Bong-seon, a 45-year-old Seoul resident, believes the series offers a one-dimensional view of divorce. \u201cIt gives the impression that getting divorced will leave you traumatised for life \u2026 that\u2019s so old-fashioned,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of South Koreans get divorced these days and it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p> <p>Other viewers can\u2019t wait for the series to reach its climax later this month, after which they plan to watch the British original. \u201cIt pushes everything to the limit,\u201d says Choi, the bar owner. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be married, but everyone has experienced betrayal and wanted to get their revenge.

But the clash between the two reopening orders highlights the struggles that come with governing a state as large and as diverse as California, especially in a pandemic. Last week, officials from six rural northern California counties<a href=\"https://ad03.asmrc.org/sites/default/files/files-uploaded/Local%20Control%20COVID19.pdf\"> wrote to Newsom</a>, asking him to allow their localities to take charge of their own reopening.</p> <p>Many in these counties argue that a one-size-fits-all approach from Sacramento too often ignores the needs of rural communities in favor of<strong> </strong>population centers like Los Angeles and San Francisco.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t paint us with the same paintbrush that you\u2019re going to paint San Francisco and San Diego and Sacramento with,\u201d said the Sutter county lawmaker Mike Ziegenmeyer. \u201cThat\u2019s just not fair.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We cannot wait for a vaccine\u2019</h2> <p>Yuba and Sutter are located just north of Sacramento, but a few minutes\u2019 drive from the state capital, the region\u2019s agriculture overtakes the scenery. Miles of orchards, plowed fields, flooded rice paddies and cow pastures separate Sacramento and Yuba City, the county seat of Sutter, and Marysville, the county seat of Yuba, located just over the Feather River from Yuba City.</p> <p>Just more than 78,000 live in Yuba while almost 97,000 live in Sutter, with more than two-thirds of the county population residing in Yuba City. Since the pandemic reached California, the two counties have reported 50 cases and three deaths. California in total has seen 58,815 cases, with 2,412 deaths as of Thursday. The six Bay Area counties that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/california-coronavirus-shelter-in-place-bay-area\">were the first</a> in the country to issue a stay-at-home order have had more than 8,100 cases, while Los Angeles county\u2019s more than 28,000 cases have led to more than half of the state\u2019s deaths.</p> <p>For three weeks before Luu issued her reopening order, the rate of new cases in Yuba and Sutter plateaued, she said. In the more populated counties around Yuba and Sutter, the rate has plateaued for almost two weeks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2a00d4b993abfe106881dcf54ec48abde9c19e37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a00d4b993abfe106881dcf54ec48abde9c19e37/0_169_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zhen Wan of YW Massage wears gloves and face masks as he massages a customer in Yuba City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zhen Wan of YW Massage wears gloves and face masks as he massages a customer in Yuba City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Kitagaki Jr/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many in the county have attributed the low rate of infection to rural living \u2013 with fewer people who live further away from one another, the chances of spreading the virus are lowered. But with rural living comes a different set of needs. There\u2019s more of a sense of isolation when sheltering in place. With fewer businesses open, fewer supplies are available. And perhaps most daunting in counties like Yuba and Sutter is the question of the economy.</p> <p>More than a third of the civilian labor force work farm jobs, according to the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/regions/west/ca_yubacity_msa.htm#eag_ca_yubacity_msa.f.2\">US Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. Of the remaining workforce, only about 3,600 work the information or professional and business services jobs that allow for telecommuting.</p> <p>Luu said as a public health official, she had to consider \u201cthe totality of health for the entire community\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cCovid-19 is dangerous and scary but it is not the only health issue,\u201d Luu said in a statement. \u201cWe cannot wait for a vaccine without seeing extreme economic damage done to our community. The consequences of waiting will be additional health concerns brought on by stress and the very real dilemma for those with limited resources whether to buy life-saving food or life-saving medicines.\u201d</p> <p>By Wednesday, Luu was<a href=\"https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15909776/2020/05/2020-05-06_Luu_Business_Letter.pdf\"> issuing a warning</a> to the Yuba and Sutter business community, warning them about not following the social distancing and protective gear guidelines she had put in place for the counties\u2019 reopening. \u201cIt has become clear a number of businesses are not enacting required protocols to ensure the safety of the community,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI understand that some of your customers may strongly object to a facial covering requirement, but the long-term safety of our community is at stake.

They burned through their savings and had to let go of 39 of their 47 employees.</p> <p>She rehired all of them this week.</p> <p>At the Training Zone in Marysville, staff stood at the front to remind entering gym members that they had wear face masks while working out. In addition to spacing out all the equipment and limiting capacity to 75 members at a time, the owner, Chris Gill, hired more cleaning staff and cut hours to fit in extra cleaning.</p> <p>\u201cWe really respect what the county did and kind of going out on a limb for us,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re taking the precautions and following the guidelines really, really strictly.\u201d</p> <p>In the past few days, his staff has taken a number of calls from prospective members wanting to sign up because their gym still wasn\u2019t open, Gill said. They have also taken a number from members who wanted to freeze their accounts because they were not comfortable returning just yet.</p> <p>Melissa Poma, owner of Melissa Poma Hair Salon in Yuba City, has been contacted nonstop by new clientele. On Monday, the first day of the reopening, she said it was like a scene out of a zombie movie, people coming up to her window just in shock to see someone cutting hair again. She received an inquiry from a woman who lived a few hours away but was so desperate for a haircut that she was willing to drive in.</p> <p>The problem is, Poma said, she needs to be careful. Even though she burned through her savings during the closure and could use the extra income, she is only taking clients that she knows and can be honest with when it comes to their health. \u201cI have a child,\u201d she said. \u201cIf my child is in the hospital, I\u2019m not going to be there with him. I have a mother, I have a grandmother. I\u2019m taking it very seriously.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We recognize one size does not fit all\u2019</h2> <p>Though she\u2019s getting in what work that she can, Poma doesn\u2019t think the counties\u2019 reopening will be long-term. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we can go by the health regulations in this industry,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do a six-foot-away haircut.\u201d Like others, Poma is conflicted.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s rough,\u201d she said. \u201cOur country worships the money god so much that we will put our health on the back burner. But livelihoods, people are closing down. I can\u2019t imagine if you don\u2019t have any sort of anything to fall back on.\u201d</p> <p>She knows too that by operating while the state\u2019s order is still in effect, she risks the state taking away her license. Already this week, the state regulatory boards have begun flexing in the rural communities that reopened early. On Tuesday, state alcoholic beverage control officials were in Yuba and Sutter, asking licensed locations to shift to takeout dining, and to close in-house dining voluntarily. John Carr, a spokesman for the state agency, said while agents could discipline and file administrative action against businesses that do not comply with their requests, \u201cwe hope for voluntary compliance.\u201d</p> <p>Newsom could choose to enforce the state order more stringently in the coming days. Previously, he\u2019s leaned toward education rather than enforcement, but when photos of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/27/california-beaches-coronavirus-orange-county\">packed beaches in southern California</a> made headlines around the country, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/california-beaches-closed-coronavirus-risks-experts\">ordered</a> all beaches in Orange county closed for a weekend.

State health officials have repeatedly pleaded with Californians,<strong> </strong>however, not to become complacent with their efforts, and to recognize that it is because of their actions that the numbers are where they are.</p> <p>For some in communities like Yuba and Sutter, however, the state is taking it too far. \u201cI feel like the state\u2019s a little overdramatic,\u201d said Steve Lewis, a tattoo artist at Artistic Temple Social Club in Marysville. After weeks of no work, Lewis is just happy he can pay his bills again.</p> <p>\u201cI have a lot of friends in this industry in other parts of the state who are in the same boat I was in just last week, and they\u2019re just trying to get through, selling art, trying to do gift cards, doing GoFundMes,\u201d he said. \u201cI can work again.

The government moved to manage expectations about how far restrictions would be loosened next week, stressing it would exercise \u201cmaximum caution\u201d with easing any measures. There is rising tension between the UK and devolved governments, with the prime minister yet to share details of his lockdown plan with the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, prompting devolved leaders to make pre-emptive announcements of their own (more below). The government also, unusually, did not formally extend the lockdown as required by law today.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Black men and women are four times more likely to die after contracting Covid-19 than white people,</strong> research from the ONS revealed. After taking into account age, measures of self-reported health and disability and other socio-demographic characteristics, black people were still 1.9 times more likely to die with coronavirus than their white counterparts. People of Bangladeshi and Pakistani, Indian, and mixed ethnicities are also significantly more likely to die. Social factors including living in overcrowded, multifamily or intergenerational households, relative deprivation, and working in public-facing occupations may help explain why this is the case for BAME people, but there is much to still be explained, the ONS report said.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Unemployment could double and the economy could shrink by 14%</strong> as the coronavirus causes the deepest recession in modern history, the Bank of England forecast. In a warning over the mounting damage to the economy since the onset of the pandemic and the lockdown measures to contain it, the Bank said GDP could plunge by 25% in the second quarter. It could take a year for the economy to return to normal and there were risks of long-term damage, it added.</li> \n   <li><strong>Scotland\u2019s strict lockdown regulations \u201cmust be extended\u201d but Nicola Sturgeon will consider allowing outdoor exercise more than once a day </strong>if the scientific evidence permits, the Scottish government said. The first minister said she saw no case for relaxing the lockdown because the transmission rate was still too high.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>The Welsh government said schools in Wales would not reopen on 1 June</strong>, regardless of what happens in England.</li> \n   <li><strong>Airports owned by MAG are to require passengers to cover faces and wear gloves and temperature screening trials are to begin in the coming weeks</strong>. The firm, which owns Manchester, Stansted and East Midlands airports, said people needed to be able to travel safely when the time is right.

But he said Boris Johnson would set out a \u201croadmap\u201d for the way forward on Sunday, containing \u201cappropriate measures to be taken at appropriate milestones, subject to very clear conditions\u201d. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There will be detailed guidance to help inform, advise and reassure the public, businesses and other organisations. To get this right, we have set milestones. Some changes can confidently be introduced more quickly than others and some of those other ones will take longer to introduce.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Raab downplayed suggestions any early changes would be far-reaching. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Any changes in the short term will be modest, small, incremental and very carefully monitored.</p> \n   <p>If we find in the future the R level goes back up or that people aren\u2019t following the rules, we must have the ability then to put back measures in place.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Raab conceded that Scotland and Wales might not proceed at exactly the same pace as England.</strong> He said the four nations of the UK were cooperating closely. But he went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Even if different parts may move at slightly different speeds, the key thing is those decisions are made based on the science and the circumstances for each nation.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that 30,615 people in the UK have now died from coronavirus, up 539 from yesterday\u2019s figure.</strong> This is the number of people who have tested positive for coronavirus and died. There will be thousands more who will have died from coronavirus without testing positive.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the reproduction number, R, was now between 0.5 and 0.9. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said Public Health England was looking at what interventions could \u201csensibly be made\u201d to protect frontline workers from BAME backgrounds.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He sidestepped a question about whether people told to quarantine because they have been notified by the government\u2019s contract-tracing app that they have been in contract with an infected person would be eligible for sick pay or other compensation.</strong> In response to the question, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think you\u2019re jumping the gun a little bit on the guidance.</p> \n   <p>They key thing is, I think, it\u2019ll be a liberating thing for people and the country as a whole, as it\u2019ll allow people who might have the symptoms to be clear that they don\u2019t have coronavirus and therefore not be subject to all of those restrictions.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019ll allow people to get out of the isolation measures earlier than otherwise would be the case.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He played down the prospects of passengers arriving in the UK being subject to temperature tests.</strong> \u201cThe evidence so far has always been that temperature tests are not a particularly effective way of proceeding,\u201d he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England, said up to a third of people with coronavirus do not have a temperature when the illness first hits.</strong> She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A sizeable proportion, up to about a third of people, do not have a temperature at presentation.

shows.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Your probability of dying with Covid is made up of two things, firstly your probability of actually being infected in the first place and then secondly, your probability of dying once you have been infected.</p> \n   <p>Now those two things are influenced by your personal circumstances to a large degree, so the first thing we did is, we looked at adjusting for age, what the difference was of dying to these ethnic groups and that brought out some quite stark differences.</p> \n   <p>So just adjusting for age, we saw that the black ethnic grouping was just over four times more likely to die of Covid-related issues than the white group, the Bangladeshi and Pakistani grouping was about 3.5 times more likely and the Indian grouping about 2.5 times more likely.</p> \n   <p>Those figures are just when we adjust for age, but we know other circumstances matter, so we want to try and introduce those other circumstances, which we can do, because we have geographical location from the death certificate and the death registration.</p> \n   <p>So we know for example, big cities like London, Birmingham and Manchester have been more affected, we know from figures that we released last Friday that whether you\u2019re in an urban or rural area matters, your area\u2019s relative level of deprivation matters, so there\u2019s really a strong social gradient to mortality rates generally, and even more for Covid.</p> \n   <p>So we needed to adjust for those other factors as well, so geography is a key one and then other socio-economic factors, we could get data from the census records that we\u2019ve linked the deaths to, so things like people\u2019s qualifications, people\u2019s housing circumstances, what type of jobs or occupations they had and their self-reported health.</p> \n   <p>When we adjust for all those other things, then actually those rates come down significantly, a lot of the difference can be explained by these geographical and socio-economic factors.</p> \n   <p>Once we\u2019ve adjusted for that, the black ethnic group is now about 90% or 1.9 times more likely to die from Covid-related issues, Bangladeshi and Pakistani males are about 80% more likely, females about 60% more likely and Indian females are about 40% more likely and males about 30% more likely.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n

Therefore, the fully adjusted results show differences in risk between ethnic groups that are specific to those ethnic groups and are not caused by any of the factors listed on which members of the groups might differ.</p> \n   <p>Adjusting for these factors substantially reduces the odds of a death involving Covid-19 relative to those of white ethnicity for all ethnic groups.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But, even making allowance for all these factors, black people are still almost twice as likely to die from coronavirus as white people.

  "<p>The UK should be denied access to an EU crime-fighting system until it agrees to share more fingerprint data with member states, a European parliamentary committee has said.</p> <p>The vote, in the European parliament\u2019s justice and home affairs committee on Thursday, is not binding on EU decision-makers, but could prove influential as the UK seeks to negotiate a permanent deal on the exchange of fingerprint, DNA and other data as part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/01/brexit-what-are-the-key-flashpoints-as-eu-uk-trade-talks-begin\">a long-term security relationship with the EU.</a></p> <p>Spanish socialist MEP, Juan-Fernando L\u00f3pez-Aguilar, who chairs the committee, told the Guardian after the vote that the main problem was the UK government\u2019s refusal to share some fingerprint data collected by British police, despite EU counterparts giving full access. The EU\u2019s data-sharing should be based on \u201cthe goodwill of reciprocity\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe would like the UK to move our way \u2026 to move forward to European Union standards for the sake of building up a future relationship that is mutually beneficial and thus not giving any space for the advantage of not being a member of the European Union and yet enjoying all the information tools.\u201d</p> <p>British government officials say the UK makes huge volumes of data available in comparison with other member states.</p> <p>Amid the turmoil of Brexit, the British government quietly agreed in June 2019 to begin exchanging DNA records with other EU member states, following a 2015 decision by Theresa May when she was home secretary to opt into a key plank of the EU\u2019s crime-fighting system.</p> <p>The DNA exchange system enables British police to check the genetic code of EU criminals and criminal suspects in 15 minutes, compared with 143 days through the Interpol process.</p> <p>But the British government does not fully comply with EU rules: British authorities are sharing DNA data from British-based criminals, but not criminal suspects, although it gets full access to equivalent data on suspects from other EU countries.</p> <p>The government is required to submit a report to the EU by 15 June, setting out whether it intends to comply with EU requirements on sharing fingerprints and DNA of suspects.</p> <p>While the DNA exchange is up and running, the fingerprint exchange is pending a final decision by EU member states. The question will go to a full vote of the European parliament next week.</p> <p>The data-sharing policies stem from the Pr\u00fcm convention, a 2005 agreement named after the small German town where seven EU member states first agreed to exchange fingerprints, DNA and car-number plates of criminals and suspects. The agreement has since become EU-wide policy, spawning numerous bilateral exchanges of data. But the system has also come under fire from civil liberties campaigners, who say there is a lack of democratic oversight.</p> <p>The latest European parliament vote reflects growing discontent at the perceived unequal exchange of information between the UK and EU27. In recent months MEPs have condemned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/14/revealed-uk-concealed-failure-to-alert-eu-over-75000-criminal-convictions\">British authorities for failing to pass on details of 75,000 convictions of foreign criminals to their home countries</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/09/uk-accused-of-behaving-like-cowboys-over-eu-database-copying\">accusing the government of \u201cdeliberate violations and abuse\u201d </a>of a vast EU database used by police and border guards across Europe.</p> <p>The European commission \u2013 in charge of running Brexit negotiations \u2013 also opposed British attempts to join EU crime-fighting systems without full reciprocity, ie without sharing suspects\u2019 data. But EU member states overruled these objections when they decided in June 2019 to approve the British request to be part of the DNA system without guarantees of reciprocity.</p> <p>That decision could be overturned in the coming months. \u201cThe lack of data on suspects has been recognised by all member states as a remaining obstacle, [to continuing the agreement]\u201d an EU source said.</p> <p>But any decision to cut the UK out of the existing DNA sharing agreement would see EU law enforcement lose access to the UK\u2019s DNA database, which holds profiles of more than 5 million people and 500,000 samples from crime scenes. </p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe safety and security of our citizens is the government\u2019s top priority. It is in everyone\u2019s interest that we reach an agreement with the European Union that equips operational partners on both sides with the capabilities that help protect citizens and bring criminals to justice.\u201d</p>",

Watching the whole two hours and 40 minutes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jul/10/worldcup2006.match1\" title=\"\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jul/10/worldcup2006.match1\" title=\"\">2006 final</a> back on Fifa\u2019s media channel, with the added certainty of knowing not just how this ends, but how it feels 14 years later, it is still hard to see any clarity. A bad decision. A moment of violence in the glare of lights and noise. A mute exit.</p> <p>It was always part of Zidane\u2019s appeal that he remained to some degree an outsider superstar even in his pomp years. Zidane turned 24 while playing (unremarkably) for France at Euro 96. He\u2019d spent six seasons in Ligue 1, brilliant but brittle, by the time Juventus took a gamble on this silhouette of a football genius.</p> <p>Italy made Zidane. The fitness, the tactical discipline and the influence of Marcello Lippi pushed him right out into the far reaches of his own talent. Sport loves an easy narrative arc. In Berlin it seemed fitting that his final game as a footballer should come with Lippi on the touchline, on a night when Zidane\u2019s expressive, balletic brilliance was matched against a team of definitive Italian defensive resilience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73f11507277df0bef0c4bde6b2356fd766cc9eb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73f11507277df0bef0c4bde6b2356fd766cc9eb7/0_0_3245_2196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Italy coach, Marcello Lippi, looks on as the French players celebrate Zidane\u2019s goal in the final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"677\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Italy coach, Marcello Lippi, looks on as the French players celebrate Zidane\u2019s goal in the final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Was this a moment of hubris? Of downfall and fatal flaws? Was Zidane exposed in Berlin? Or ennobled? At times in sport there is a feeling the drive for meaning comes from a kind of desperation. Let\u2019s face it, there really are a lot of people watching here. This has to mean something.</p> <p>Two things stand out now. First, Italy always seemed to be winning this World Cup final from about 20 minutes into the game. France played like a team with an air of destiny around it; without actually, it turns out, having an air of destiny. Zidane\u2019s sending off was not material to the drift of this game, to its sense of natural justice. The red card deprived France of a first-choice penalty taker \u2013 but correctly so. It also deprived Italy of the chance to win the World Cup final without an asterisk.</p> <p>And secondly Zidane looks wired from the start. The Fifa film is a high-resolution number. As the teams walk out the camera pans to show the wonderful sweep of the stadium, crammed with conflicting shades of blue. These are two of the great national anthems, accompanied by a camera-pan down a thrilling row of row faces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b37f92f36bd7fb105e3736c1e97057eed5578f29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b37f92f36bd7fb105e3736c1e97057eed5578f29/0_0_2688_1898/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Vieira, Thierry Henry and Franck Rib\u00e9ry listen to the national anthems before the final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patrick Vieira, Thierry Henry and Franck Rib\u00e9ry listen to the national anthems before the final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Platiau/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What a team France had. Patrick Vieira stands with eyes closed, an arm around Thierry Henry, who has an arm around a 23-year-old Franck Rib\u00e9ry. Zidane is at the end of the line, the star of this show already. He was brilliant in the quarter-final against Brazil. In closeup he even looks like the World Cup, that huge sleek rounded skull filling the screen. Even when you know the end note here, the empty clang of forehead into chest, the sense of glory in waiting feels inevitable. <em>Marchons, marchons</em>.</p> <p>The pitch is cut in beautiful wide green stripes. Even the people in the stands seem to gleam with youth and wealth. This really was the most prosperous of modern-day World Cups, a World Cup drenched in Euro boom times, in Germany\u2019s success, in the age of Wags and headline-grabbing haircuts, a cult of celebrity that still felt oddly innocent.</p> <p>Zidane\u2019s first touch is a dinked outside-of-the-foot pass to the left. Seconds later Henry is knocked almost out cold in a collision with Fabio Cannavaro\u2019s shoulder. Smelling salts are produced. With four minutes gone Gianluca Zambrotta is booked for hacking down Vieira as he glides away with the ball. Italy aren\u2019t mucking about.</p> <p>But they\u2019re soon behind. Henry heads the ball inside from the touchline and suddenly Florent Malouda is haring in on goal. Materazzi goes to tackle, then pulls his leg away. Cannavaro stays close but resists making contact. Malouda falls over. It\u2019s a pretty soft penalty kick.</p> <p>Zidane takes the kick. And of course it\u2019s ridiculous. A Panenka penalty in the seventh minute of the World Cup final against one of the best goalkeepers ever to play the game. Who does this?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"30470526e1e8fbc6fae9967fd752029be98374f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30470526e1e8fbc6fae9967fd752029be98374f4/0_0_2055_1405/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zidane scores with a Panenka penalty.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"684\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zidane scores with a Panenka penalty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Potts/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s also a poor Panenka, floating on to the bar then bouncing down and just over the line. It\u2019s a goal. But it feels like an embarrassment to the occasion, the act of someone not entirely in control.</p> <p>In the stands Jacques Chirac bounces and yelps. France have held on to a 1-0 lead in their last two games. Italy have now conceded their first goal scored by an actual opponent in this tournament \u2013 the only other was Cristian Zaccardo\u2019s own-goal in the group-stage draw against the USA. But they soon start to press back.</p> <p>What have Italy got here? For a start they have Mauro Camoranesi, who wouldn\u2019t get anywhere near the French team, who is a stubby little scuttling pest of a midfielder, but who doesn\u2019t give a damn about any of this, or about the occasion, and just keeps on snapping around Zidane.</p> <p>They have Andrea Pirlo, a sublime talent too, and seemingly always able to execute those skills in these huge games. Pirlo looks calm, buzzing up and down the left, twisting about chipping intricate little passes, asserting his own rhythms. It\u2019s his corner that makes the equaliser, a precise delivery on to the head of Materazzi, who leaps above Vieira and batters the ball past Fabien Barthez, his forehead striking the leather like a fist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"229a8b1866625a53618ad311f748da688c9808f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/229a8b1866625a53618ad311f748da688c9808f7/0_0_3000_1966/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marco Materazzi heads the ball past Fabien Barthez for the equaliser.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marco Materazzi heads the ball past Fabien Barthez for the equaliser.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The score is 1-1. Italy are just about in charge now. Fabio Grosso gallops down the left and punts a cross over the bar. Grosso isn\u2019t a great left-back. But he had a great World Cup. This is what Italy do, a way of playing that ennobles and vindicates every other team\u2019s victories. You want this? You want your moment in time? Fine. But you\u2019ve got to come through us to get there.</p> <p>Henry has recovered by now. He runs past Francesco Totti and slides Rib\u00e9ry in on the right. He fends off Gennaro Gattuso with a regal dip of the shoulder. Mention is sometimes made of the fact Henry played in nine cup finals and scored zero goals. A few months earlier he left the pitch raging in Paris <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/may/18/match.championsleague\" title=\"\">after defeat by Barcelona in the Champions League final</a>. There is no significance to this. Henry is an extraordinary footballer and a leader too, driving to the left and setting up the pattern of France\u2019s attacks, with the wide players surging inside and Zidane playing very high at times as a genuine No 10.</p> <p>Italy\u2019s success in this game lies in the way they interrupt this flow. Every time Zidane gets the ball within 40 metres of goal Gattuso charges into his space. Zidane can have the ball in the centre circle. Anywhere else: compress, bite, bring him down. When they have the ball Italy play diagonal long passes to Luca Toni. The plan is clear. Shut Zidane down. Keep possession. Get behind the French full-backs.</p> <p>With 35 minutes gone Toni heads Pirlo\u2019s cross against the bar. Moments later Zidane turns and starts to dribble but Materazzi comes sprinting out and performs an astonishing tackle, taking he ball at full stretch with a deep booming thunk. Zidane gets up. No complaints. But Italy are dominating as half-time arrives.</p> <p>The second half is gripping. Malouda should have another penalty in the 53rd minute after he\u2019s bundled down by Zambrotta. Vieira goes off injured. Toni heads a deep free-kick past Barthez from the edge of the box with thrilling power, but he\u2019s offside.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6e2e8c943defa5283bf7c7991fabd73e117f7a57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e2e8c943defa5283bf7c7991fabd73e117f7a57/0_0_1884_2200/856.jpg\" alt=\"Zidane reacts after his header was saved by Gianluigi Buffon.\" width=\"856\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zidane reacts after his header was saved by Gianluigi Buffon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Gentile/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the game enters the final 10 minutes of normal time Italy are playing through a kind of triumphant rage, defending furiously, keeping the ball, passing it backwards to cheers from their support. Zidane has injured his shoulder. He has it sprayed and wanders back on. He\u2019s still running hard, even if by now his goal feels like it happened in another life.</p> <p>Even the break before extra time seems telling. Lippi is pointing and yelling and bollocking his players. Raymond Domenech takes Zidane to one side and speaks to him quietly. Zidane listens then walks away. Fair enough. What exactly, are you going to tell him here anyway?</p> <p>Rib\u00e9ry finds space and has a shot at goal. David Trezeguet, scorer of the winner against Italy in the final of Euro 2000, replaces him. Zidane does something brilliant, jinking away from the blue press, then haring into the middle to head Willy Sagnol\u2019s cross. Buffon palms it over. Zidane screams. And then it happens.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/13/world-cup-questions-why-didnt-the-great-dutch-teams-of-the-1990s-win-it\">World Cup questions: Why didn\u2019t the great Dutch teams of the 1990s win it? | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are 12 minutes left of extra time. Italy have cleared the ball upfield. Materazzi touches Zidane\u2019s back. It seems like nothing much. Words are spoken. Play continues. Zidane and Materazzi are a few metres apart. Zidane turns, thinks about it. The incident is passing. It\u2019s almost gone. But not quite. Zidane comes closer.</p> <p>It looks like an excellent butt from a technical point of view: shoulders swivelling, neck wrenched, forehead rammed into the breast bone. It\u2019s not exactly \u201cshockingly violent\u201d, as the commentator suggests (Materazzi just gets up); more shockingly weird and out of place.</p> <p>Play continues. But this is too big to pass. It\u2019s a footballing Chernobyl. It can\u2019t be glossed or hushed. The reactor core is open. And the fallout is already starting. Italian players are pointing and haranguing the referee. There are animated conversations, figures scuttling across the pitch.</p> <p>It takes two minutes of earpiece-clutching for a response to come. Zidane is sent off. He puts a hand on the referee\u2019s shoulder, says something, then walks away. On the touchline Domenech performs furious sarcastic applause. Zidane ambles past the trophy. And that is pretty much that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cee88dbfcc752316bcef82e08a708e07da26c734\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cee88dbfcc752316bcef82e08a708e07da26c734/0_0_2800_2661/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zidane removes the captain\u2019s armband after receiving the red card from the referee, Horacio Elizondo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"950\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zidane removes the captain\u2019s armband after receiving the red card from the referee, Horacio Elizondo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Val\u00e9ry Hache/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are still two main mysteries here. First, why did he do it? Zidane suggested afterwards that his mother had been insulted. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/feb/06/marco-materazzi-zinedine-zidane-the-sun-libel\" title=\"\">Some English newspapers</a> even ran a story that Materazzi had called his mother \u201ca terrorist whore\u201d, apparently based on lip reading experts, but then had to apologise, retract and pay libel damages when Materazzi denied it.</p> <p>\u201cMy mother died when I was 15. I would never have insulted his,\u201d Materazzi has said. \u201cI spoke about his sister instead.\u201d Ah. That\u2019s OK then. Endless Warren Report-style analysis seems to have concluded Materazzi said: \u201cYou can give it [his shirt] to your sister\u201d or something close.</p> <p>Is it enough? Does any part of this add up? There has been so much noise, so much temptation to portray Zidane as either a fatally-flawed hero, a defender of personal rights, a human agent in a world of athletic units. Really, though, the main feeling is one of crushing mundanity, of mild absurdity even. Is this really it?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2014/may/26/zidane-headbutt-materazzi-brick-by-brick-world-cup\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/3pfvd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2097346\"            data-video-name=\"Zinedine Zidane headbutts Marco Materazzi: brick-by-brick World Cup reconstruction \u2013 video animation\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/5/22/1400770255324/Brick-by-Brick-reconstruc-010.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-437559330\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/5/22/1400770255324/Brick-by-Brick-reconstruc-010.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/05/22/140526BbBzidane2006-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/05/22/140526BbBzidane2006/140526BbBzidane2006.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/05/22/140526BbBzidane2006.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/05/22/140526BbBzidane2006_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/05/22/140526BbBzidane2006_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2014/may/26/zidane-headbutt-materazzi-brick-by-brick-world-cup\">Zinedine Zidane head-butts Marco Materazzi: brick-by-brick World Cup reconstruction</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The second mystery surrounds the call to send him off. Lippi suggested initially help had come from a Fifa official with a TV monitor. This would have been a breach of protocol. The Fifa line is that the fourth official, Luis Medina Cantalejo of Spain, saw the butt in real time and told referee Horacio Elizondo through his head set.</p> <p>The referee has even given <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaZUyGN3vGk\" title=\"\">a TED talk</a> on this subject. Apparently Cantalejo told him: \u201cDreadful, Zidane\u2019s head-butt on Materazzi was dreadful \u2026 Fuck! Zidane head-butted Materazzi. When you see the video you will not believe me.\u201d Cantalejo mentions video here, unnecessarily. Conspiracy fans will perhaps wonder why.</p> <p>Does it matter? This was entirely the right decision. Although, it also feels a little odd even now. Football changed in that instant: a moment of progress, but also of intrusion, a moment when professional sport edged closer to becoming an arm of our shared 24-hour digital surveillance.</p> <p>To follow high-level football now is to experience an endless loop, an endless argument about details. Some see this as a triumph, progress towards the elimination of error and perfectibility. This is perhaps the case. But it also forgets the elements of play, of muddle, of intrigue that distinguish \u201csport\u201d (look up that word) from data, from a line of numbers, from a courtroom transcript, from drudgery, from an absence of human mess and human muddle.</p> <p>So to penalties. Pirlo hoists the opening kick in the roof of the net, a kick so decisive you know at this moment Italy are going to win. Materazzi takes one, of course, and scores easily. In fact everyone scores except Trezeguet, who smashes his with pointless power against the crossbar. The ball bounces down and out, a mocking echo of that Panenka. \u201cThe BIGGEST SIX INCHES in French football HISTORY,\u201d the Fifa commentator says, admiringly.</p> <p>Italy just keep slotting them. Alessandro Del Piero never looks like missing through every one of the 50 steps it takes to get to the spot. Grosso puts one in the corner. And that is it. The blue shirts come haring on, leaping and jumping, eyes wide, spooked by their own moment of history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"433da516fa60767a149f10a3574670669394c42c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/433da516fa60767a149f10a3574670669394c42c/0_0_2987_2047/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Italy\u2019s Fabio Grosso celebrates after scoring the match-winning penalty.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Italy\u2019s Fabio Grosso celebrates after scoring the match-winning penalty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Platiau/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In France there was an instant urge to find some kind of meaning in Zidane\u2019s headbutt, not just as a reason for defeat, but as some wider cultural force. \u201cZizou On T\u2019aime\u201d was scrawled across the Arc de Triomphe. Chirac would announce his love and admiration for Zidane (who lost his temper and butted someone) in a speech on the team\u2019s return. The butt was made into a sculpture (\u201cCoup De Tete\u201d) and displayed at the Centre Pompidou.</p> <p>Some of his teammates were less than pleased. Sagnol didn\u2019t speak to Zidane for two years. And for that team this was a moment when something passed. A World Cup win would have been France\u2019s third major trophy in eight years, a run to enshrine that team with the true greats.</p> <p>Half of the class in 2006 had been there for the whole span. In the event that brilliant generation is left with a home World Cup, a Euros in the country next door, the implosion in South Korea and defeat to Greece at Euro 2004: a fine champion team but not quite an all-time great one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Zidane\u2019s sending off brought a feeling of entropy, but also of absurdity, an act pulled out from all that heat and light that seems to mean less the more you look at it.</p> <p>It seems significant that Zidane himself has never appeared to be tortured, or aggrieved, or even that bothered by his final moment as a footballer. What does seem certain is that Italy\u2019s win reasserted in its own way the value of the team in an age in individualism. And that they were, all white noise aside, entirely deserved winners.</p>",

Devised by the campaign-winning brains behind \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d and \u201cTake Back Control\u201d, it was a signal that the prime minister was serious about a lockdown after weeks of insisting that only handwashing was necessary to combat coronavirus.</p> <p>At first it seemed to be working, emblazoned across three physically distanced podiums every day for Downing Street\u2019s press conference. Additional hard-hitting social media adverts stressed that \u201cpeople will die\u201d if the advice was not followed.</p> <p>And the figures showed that people were indeed staying at home for the most part, with traffic and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/rail-journeys-at-5-of-normal-levels-as-uk-stays-home-due-to-coronavirus\">public transport usage down hugely</a> for weeks.</p> <p>However, the purity of the message began to fray as cabinet splits emerged on how to begin to ease the lockdown, and the pace it should be done. While Johnson was recovering from coronavirus in hospital and then at his Chequers country retreat, the first rumblings started to appear in the media from anonymous ministers pressing for schools to be reopened, less than three weeks after the lockdown was first imposed.</p> <p>Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and Liz Truss, the trade secretary, have emerged as the most hawkish about a swift end to restrictions because of worries about the economy and its wider public health impacts on mental health, domestic violence and deaths from other missed illnesses.</p> <p>This reflects the wider mood of the party, according to one Conservative MP. \u201cI think it\u2019s an incredibly dangerous moment for No 10, because of the risk of getting it wrong. There is some real worry about this in party, about not having a decision and a clear message. We will fight for anything but this is not the way to do it. And there is widespread concern among backbenchers that without an end to the lockdown soon we\u2019ll destroy the economy further and not really save any extra lives,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Tory insiders say the tensions inside the cabinet and wider party have led to a battle over the right strategy, and hence some of the confusion.</p> <p>Alastair Campbell, the former director of communications in Downing Street under Tony Blair, who has been a <a href=\"https://members.tortoisemedia.com/2020/05/06/alastair-campbell-we-are-witnessing-a-national-catastrophe/content.html?sig=1IaM3HYQEvzm74zpF3f1flO-claAr-DkWAUtzfsjeuU&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=national-catastrophe&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=national_catastrophe\">consistent critic</a> of the government\u2019s messaging, said: \u201cI just think they are completely out of their depth and because most of the press is so slavish it makes them totally complacent.</p> <p>\u201cThey just don\u2019t think things through. I\u2019m afraid I think it\u2019s all of a pattern. The reason all this matters is that at some stage they are going to have to reset their strategy in a pretty big way and how they communicate with the public... they\u2019re not going to be able to do that until they admit they have made a lot of mistakes.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cAll they need to do is say these are the facts, these are the problems and this is how we will deal with them. They\u2019ve turned everything into: \u2018We\u2019re right, everybody\u2019s wrong, aren\u2019t we doing well?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c561db998061a124233fb88421f9cdf7ba93a749\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c561db998061a124233fb88421f9cdf7ba93a749/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Front pages on Thursday declare the end of the lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Front pages on Thursday declare the end of the lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Criticism of the government\u2019s approach is also coming from members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), with scientists increasingly frustrated about information being given out piecemeal in political briefings, rather than communicated factually at the right time.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really unhelpful to have bits and pieces of information leaked,\u201d one Sage adviser said. \u201cThey are going to have to undo, now, a lot of damage. The government needs to come out before Sunday. The sooner there is some damage limitation, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about, the better.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly damaging. If people are primed to look at things in a certain way, it will shape how they receive the information. So on Sunday they will be looking for the green lights and they won\u2019t notice the red lights. It\u2019s a really powerful way of influencing people.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking at a three-day sunny bank holiday weekend, and sections of society may take this as \u2018we\u2019ll do what we want\u2019 because it\u2019s all changing Sunday anyway. Once the lid is taken off and people break some rules, they will be much more likely to carry on breaking them.\u201d</p> <p>The scientist stressed that there was an urgent need for more focus on social distancing, hand hygiene, the use of tissues, and the nose, mouth and eyes messaging again. \u201cThis is an example of the dangers of trailing, rather than getting the whole message all in one go,\u201d they added.</p> <p>Speaking in a personal capacity, John Drury, professor of social psychology at the University of Sussex, expressed similar concerns. He is a member of an expert sub-group \u2013 the Scientific Pandemic Influenza group on Behaviour (<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/873732/07-role-of-behavioural-science-in-the-coronavirus-outbreak.pdf\">SPI-B</a>) \u2013 that feeds in to Sage.</p> <p>\u201cThe rightwing media\u2019s language and premature celebration of the supposed end of lockdown is dangerous and irresponsible framing of what might be about to happen,\u201d he said, warning that the messaging was at odds with the continued need to maintain the handwashing and physical distancing that will still be needed.</p> <p>\u201cThese headlines risk creating a normative climate where people think that we can all go straight back to the old \u2018normal\u2019,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 May 2020.

A sudden wind, and sand becomes stuck to all your surfaces. You are coated, like a lamington.</p> <p>It\u2019s still not over. You trail sand through the car and the house when you get home. It gets up your nose and in your hair.

The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, told MPs that 200,000 laptops would be distributed at a cost of \u00a385m. Internet access will be provided only to year 10 pupils.</p> <p>But most of the devices will not be delivered until June, while an <a href=\"https://schoolsweek.co.uk/coronavirus-85m-free-laptops-scheme-falls-short/\">investigation by Schools Week</a> found that schools were being allocated only a fraction of the devices for which they were eligible.</p> <p>One school, Longdean school in Hertfordshire, said it had applied to the DfE for 66 devices for its year 10 pupils on free school meals but was told it would only get 21.</p> <p>Jennings said the families had sent a \u201cletter of claim\u201d to the DfE to start proceedings, but she hoped the department would instead \u201crespond positively\u201d and provide extra resources to allow all children to learn online.</p> <p><a href=\"http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/cepcovid-19-001.pdf\">Researchers at the London School of Economics</a> have said the schools closures could open a \u201cchasm\u201d between the education of low-income children and those from better-off families.</p> <p>The work by the LSE\u2019s Centre for Economic Performance found that previous unexpected shutdowns had a large impact on children\u2019s education.

  "<h2><strong>What was Exercise Cygnus?</strong></h2> <p>Exercise Cygnus was a 2016 government simulation of a flu outbreak, carried out to war-game the UK\u2019s pandemic readiness. It involved 950 officials from central and local government, NHS organisations, prisons and local emergency response planners. A report on the exercise was compiled the following year and distributed among its participants.</p> <p>The simulation took place over three days in October 2016 and asked participants to imagine they were fighting a fictitious \u201cworst-case-scenario\u201d flu pandemic affecting up to 50% of the population and causing up to 400,000 excess deaths.</p> <h2><strong>What did it involve?</strong></h2> <p>The scenario imagined that a new virus had emerged in Thailand in June, later identified as a strain of H2N2. Within a month the World Health Organization had declared a public emergency, triggering the UK\u2019s response plans as the world mobilised to tackle an outbreak of \u201cswan flu\u201d.</p> <p>For the three days of the exercise, officials were told to imagine they were managing the seventh week of the pandemic, facing a peak in demand for hospital and social care. The purpose of such simulations is generally not only to test how emergency plans would hold up under strain but also to acclimatise ministers and officials to the sorts of decisions they would be forced to make.</p> <p>Mock Cobra meetings were held where ministers and officials were presented with situation reports from the ground, while reporters from a fictitious news organisation called WNN published news articles, and government social media campaigns were released on \u201cTwister\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>What were its findings?</strong></h2> <p>The Cygnus report was frank about the state of the UK\u2019s readiness. \u201cThe UK\u2019s preparedness and response, in terms of its plans, policies and capability, is currently not sufficient to cope with the extreme demands of a severe pandemic that will have a nationwide impact across all sectors,\u201d it found.</p> <p>One problem was that while each government body participating in the exercise had its own bespoke plans, enabling a flexible and decentralised response, nobody in the centre had oversight over everyone else.</p> <p>In the absence of any \u201coverview of pandemic response plans and procedures\u201d, participants found it much harder to shift resources between one another so as react to unexpected rises and falls in demand for services such social care beds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Scribd\">  <iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" title=\"Cygnus Redacted Annex 01scribd Redactedv3\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/460161101/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-mOIwokYnykuy5ezDYrzq\" data-auto-height=\"true\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7068965517241379\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In the language of the report: \u201cThe lack of joint tactical level plans was evidenced when the scenario demand for services outstripped the capacity of local responders, in the areas of excess deaths, social care and the NHS.\u201d</p> <p>Some organisations\u2019 plans were severely out of date and sometimes referred to coordinating their response with bodies that no longer existed. Others were relying on an institutional memory of fighting the 2009 swine flu pandemic that was slowly fading.</p> <h2><strong>What about social care?</strong></h2> <p>Social care appears to have been of particular concern. Participants discovered it was extremely difficult to locate capacity in the care homes sector, partly because care homes are almost entirely privately run, making it difficult to clear hospital beds by moving patients into care homes.</p> <p>\u201cLocal responders also raised concerns about the expectation that the social care system would be able to provide the level of support needed if the NHS implemented its proposed reverse triage plans, which would entail the movement of patients from hospitals into social care facilities,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>Cygnus found that the social care sector was \u201ccurrently under significant pressure during business as usual,\u201d and that in the event of a pandemic staff absenteeism through illness combined with widespread infection of the vulnerable \u201ccould be very challenging\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>What did Cygnus recommend?</strong></h2> <p>The report listed four areas of \u201ckey learning\u201d and 22 further \u201clessons identified\u201d from the exercise, couched as recommendations to government. While some, such as those concerning the distribution of antivirals, are not relevant to a coronavirus pandemic, others are.</p> <p>The recommendations included further modelling to understand the capacity of the care sector, further work to understand how the public would react to the crisis, and the creation of a \u201cjoint-level tactical plan\u201d to help different organisations cooperate more effectively.</p> <p>Some of the Cygnus recommendations, such as preparing legislation to relax certain laws and regulations, can be clearly seen in the government\u2019s handling of Covid-19. A Department of Health spokesperson also mentioned excess deaths as an area where additional planning had been carried out.</p> <p>There are questions as to whether other recommendations were followed in full. Care sector executives told the Guardian that they were unaware of having been asked to contribute to any methodology for assessing care home capacity.</p> <h2><strong>Why hasn\u2019t the report been published before now?</strong></h2> <p>Though discussed at an NHS board meeting and mentioned in a speech by the former chief medical officer, the report on Cygnus has never been published, for reasons that are not entirely clear. The health secretary at the time of the exercise, Jeremy Hunt, has said he would be <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/04/24/jeremy-hunt-says-has-no-problem-governments-2016-pandemic-report/\">relaxed</a> about the report being published.</p> <p>In a response to a freedom of information request, the Department of Health claimed that the report needed to be kept secret so as to inform policy development.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Covid-19%3A%20help%20us%20investigate&amp;description=The%20Guardian%20is%20investigating%20how%20the%20UK%20government%20prepared%20for%20%E2%80%93%20and%20is%20responding%20to%20%E2%80%93%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic.%20We%20want%20to%20learn%20more%20about%20recent%20decisions%20taken%20at%20the%20heart%20of%20government.%20If%20you%E2%80%99re%20a%20whistleblower%20or%20source%20and%20with%20new%20information%2C%20you%20can%20email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Acovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Ecovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20Signal%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447584640566%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566.%20(The%20number%20does%20not%20take%20calls.)%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E.%20For%20general%20advice%20on%20confidentially%20contacting%20the%20Guardian%2C%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%20&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"The Guardian is investigating how the UK government prepared for \u2013 and is responding to \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic.

Codemasters presented its racer DiRT 5 complete with impressive lighting and mud splatter effects, and an option to run it in 4K at 60 frames-per-second or in a lower resolution at 120fps. Namco Bandai showed a new anime-style sci-fi thriller named Scarlet Nexus, about a group of psychic law enforcers.</p> <p>The rest of the games were from independent studios: futuristic first-person action shooter called Bright Memory Infinite, which is already coming to PC; supernatural horror game <a href=\"https://themediumgame.com/\">The Medium</a> from Blair Witch creator Bloober Team (with music by Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka); a 1930s puzzle adventure named <a href=\"https://www.calloftheseagame.com/\">Call of the Sea</a> from Swedish indie publisher Raw Fury; space combat shooter Chorus from Deep Silver; cyberpunk action-RPG The Ascent from Curve Digital; Second Extinction, a three-player co-op dinosaur shooter from Systemic Reaction; and finally, <a href=\"https://scorn-game.com/\">Scorn</a>, a first-person horror adventure set in a sinister Giger-esque dream world developed by Serbian team, Ebb.</p> <p>The games will support the key technical features of the Xbox Series X such as 120-frames-per-second animation, real-time ray tracing and super-fast loading times. Nine of the titles, including Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, will support Microsoft\u2019s new Smart Delivery technology, which will allow players to buy one version of the game that will then run on either Xbox One or in an optimised format on Xbox Series X.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ach9vZJyF24\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ach9vZJyF24?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Speaking during the livestream, Ashraf Ismail, creative director on Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla said, \u201cAssassin\u2019s Creed has always been committed to new technologies to push the experiences.

  "<p>More people have died of coronavirus in the UK than in any other country in Europe, and details about the true scale of the pandemic continue to emerge as the extreme pressure on the NHS begins to ease.</p> <p>We have been speaking to frontline workers since the crisis began about how they are coping. They have told us how they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/we-are-all-resigned-to-getting-it-nhs-staff-reveal-fears-from-the-frontlines-of-covid-19\">resigned to contracting Covid-19</a> because of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/nhs-under-pressure-voices-from-the-frontline-of-the-coronavirus-crisis\"> shortages of protective equipment</a> and a lack of testing as hospitals were inundated with coronavirus patients. Here, they recall the pandemic reaching its peak and begin to make plans for where the health service will go from here.</p> <h2>Intensive care nurse, London</h2> <p> I\u2019m only starting to grasp what happened now. It was so intense up until about a fortnight ago, complete anarchy. Operations were cancelled and patients came flowing in, filling up theatres, all intubated with a tube down their windpipe connected to a ventilator and trying to cling on to their lives. It was heartbreaking. I saw so many people \u2013 generally older than younger, overweight rather than underweight, and in poor health as opposed to being in great health \u2013 die a lonely death without being allowed to have any visitors.</p> <p>We did as much as we could, but now the situation is getting much better and there is a feeling it is under control. Lots of results for patients\u2019 coronavirus tests came through earlier and they were negative. You need several tests to be certain, but it seems like the virus has passed here. Instead of pumping on people\u2019s chests I\u2019m helping physiotherapists get people back on their feet. One patient has been in intensive care for 43 days and, amazingly, just stood up for the first time.</p> <h2>Junior doctor, east Midlands</h2> <p>We have fewer Covid patients than before, but we\u2019re still admitting new people and some coronavirus patients have been with us for a long time. It\u2019s still very difficult, when you have extremely sick patients and they sadly can\u2019t survive, but that uncertainty isn\u2019t there as much anymore. We understand more what we need to do to help them and ourselves, but we remain concerned that doctors and nurses are not getting enough PPE and colleagues have died in the east Midlands.</p> <p>We have had to weigh up not bringing people into hospital for cancer treatments against making sure we have enough beds for Covid patients. I don\u2019t envy the people having to make those decisions. What we really need to see is a sensible approach to coming out of the lockdown, because we\u2019re afraid of a second wave. It could be more fatal than the first if we bring everyone out too quickly and it would risk a second wave among the more vulnerable. That could overwhelm us and cause severe devastation.</p> <h2>A&amp;E consultant, south-west</h2> <p>We\u2019re still seeing Covid-19 patients and dozens have died during the past six weeks, but it\u2019s manageable now and we\u2019re now planning to open up the hospital. We\u2019re definitely seeing that some people are too scared to come to us, while others do not want to put any pressure on the NHS and are staying away until they have advanced symptoms. Staff here are frustrated, many still don\u2019t know whether they\u2019ve tested positive or not. We\u2019re definitely getting some false negatives. People we know have it are only testing positive by the second or third test. Still, there\u2019s definitely evidence that if we had been able to test our colleagues, it would have helped stop the spread of it in hospitals.</p> <p>We have a sense of deep loss for our colleagues who have tragically died. It could have been any one of us. It\u2019s unforgivable that we saw what happened in China, Italy and Spain, and knew it was coming. We knew that they had lost healthcare workers, but did not adequately prepare. We\u2019re going to be in this for the long haul until we get a vaccine. Covid-19 isn\u2019t going away. Its prevalence is lower in the community but it will remain with us.</p> <h2><strong>GP, rural south-west</strong></h2> <p>We\u2019re in isolation again. One of my kids has a temperature. If she did get it, the only person she could have got it from was me. But I can\u2019t get tested because I don\u2019t have symptoms, even though one in four of those with coronavirus may be an asymptomatic carrier. My boss just said it would be better for me to isolate for two weeks anyway, even if I got tested, as we just don\u2019t have confidence in them. My daughter is a lot better, but I will continue to worry every time I go into work and could later be giving it to my family. A GP in a nearby village came out of retirement to work and died of Covid.</p> <p>In terms of PPE, we were given less than a day\u2019s worth. We were given aprons, but borrowed our own goggles from dentists and brought other stuff ourselves. Things had settled down until this weekend when it was a lot busier in the town. I don\u2019t know for sure if having it gives you immunity, but I\u2019ll still be doing telephone triage from home for another few days before going back to the surgery. The next thing will be the second homers starting to make trips up to London and back again.</p> <h2>Pharmacist, Greater Manchester</h2> <p>People are not coming in with Covid symptoms any more, it\u2019s mainly seasonal allergies. You can tell people are already anticipating being told they can come out [of lockdown], but they now know how to physically distance and abide by the one-way system. At first it was alien to them and people were still coming in saying family members have coronavirus and asking if we have anything for a dry cough and fever. It was alarming.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-key-workers\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>At its peak we were at breaking point, along with many other pharmacies. I worked for 15 consecutive days because colleagues were off with symptoms. The pressure was not unique to us, I would wait for an hour to get through to the wholesaler on the phone and we were making orders three times the usual size. Now there\u2019s not even a chance to listen to the automated message before they pick up. I\u2019m ordering more allergy tablets, sprays and eye drops than paracetamol and inhalers.</p> <h2>Trust deputy director of finance, the Midlands</h2> <p>The trust is working out how to implement the recovery phase where they split the hospital into different coloured zones: those with Covid, suspected coronavirus and so-called clean areas. It\u2019s a difficult transition and we will struggle to catch up with the cancelled elective treatments. Meanwhile, the NHS is now asking hospitals to lead on purchasing equipment they are struggling to get, the central process failed and many have not been able to keep up with the unprecedented demand.</p> <p>In NHS administration departments across the country, there\u2019s going to have to be investment because it feels like physical distancing will continue for a while. We sent people home with old desktop computers but we need to give them laptops, and we might need to convert our old-fashioned individual offices into more generic hotdesks to support more flexible working. We\u2019re going to have to change the way we think. We are trying to work out what our plan is for the new normal.</p>",

As his health minister discussed regional payouts on Wednesday, the president distractedly rolled a pen back and forth across his desk, lost in a moment of reverie broadcast nationwide.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/painful-to-see-rise-in-russian-medics-falling-prey-to-covid-19-as-death-toll-questioned\">'Painful to see': rise in Russian medics falling prey to Covid-19 as death toll questioned</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cPutin not only doesn\u2019t control the situation but he cannot even plan how to change the agenda,\u201d said Nikolay Petrov, a senior research fellow at the British thinktank Chatham House. \u201cHe cannot adjust \u2026 I think partly Putin\u2019s lack of activism is connected to the fact that he is out of his normal position.\u201d</p> <p>He has sought to regain the initiative by holding televised briefings and promising economic stimulus to Russians hit by the economic downturn, while soliciting timetables for business to reopen. But the measures have been underwhelming and the virus\u2019s long horizon has meant Putin takes a back seat while local officials \u2013 such as Moscow\u2019s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin \u2013 lead the fight against the virus.</p> <p>\u201cPutin wants to become a ladder out of the crisis: Sobyanin makes rules and Putin will cancel them; that\u2019s a positive role,\u201d noted Pavlovsky. \u201cBut there\u2019s no way out of this crisis, this pandemic, yet. Things are still getting worse and more dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>The Kremlin\u2019s desire to carry out its political programme has appeared at odds with its response to the epidemic. Putin held off on cancelling the symbolic vote until late March and the Victory Day parade until mid-April, with thousands of soldiers being sent into quarantine as a preventive measure.</p> <p>\u201cIt appears the Kremlin was too focused on the constitutional and political reforms and not the epidemic,\u201d said Petrov. \u201cThe epidemic came later to Russia and it was possible to be better prepared.\u201d</p> <p>One thing is clear: this is not the time to hold a public vote that could backfire over the Kremlin\u2019s response to the epidemic. Analysts have suggested that it could be cancelled entirely, or delayed until the autumn when political conditions are more favourable.</p> <p>State television serves as a window on what could have been. On Sunday the <a href=\"https://www.1tv.ru/news/2020-05-03/385157-7_maya_ispolnitsya_20_let_so_dnya_pervoy_inauguratsii_vladimira_putina_na_post_prezidenta\">lead segment</a> on Channel One\u2019s flagship news programme, Vremya, was not an update on the country\u2019s battle with the virus but a 13-minute report marking 20 years since Putin\u2019s first inauguration on 7 May 2000. It felt like a time capsule from before the epidemic.</p> <p>\u201cThe very existence of the country was under threat,\u201d read Yekaterina Andreyeva, the well-known anchor. \u201cOver two decades, Russia has once again become a strong country that is once again reckoned with in the world and which is able to solve the hardest problems and overcome any obstacles.\u201d</p> <p>The political risk to the Kremlin is limited. Putin\u2019s approval ratings remain high, at 59%, and he has no true political rivals to present an alternative. The regional officials taking the lead in the fight against coronavirus owe their positions to him.</p> <p>But the Kremlin does closely follow its polling numbers, which have shown two years of sliding approval for Putin, mainly due to the economy. And the loss of this spring\u2019s political calendar has robbed the Kremlin of a chance to recharge his image as he begins a third decade in power.</p> <p>\u201cPeople aren\u2019t so scared of coronavirus as its economic consequences, salaries, redundancies,\u201d said Denis Volkov, the deputy director of the Levada Centre. \u201cAnd secondly, it is exhaustion with Putin himself \u2026 there are no expectations of anything new from him.\u201d</p> <p>The next stage of the crisis will take place as the scale of the epidemic becomes clear in Russia\u2019s regions, indicating whether Russia may be looking at an extended health crisis and how much longer the economy will remain shuttered. Already, a number of coronavirus hotspots have appeared at far-flung oil and gas fields and at regional hospitals.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole management system looks inefficient,\u201d said Petrov. \u201cThe regions are far less prepared in general to face the crisis than Moscow \u2026 I am afraid that they will suffer more.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Black people are more than four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than white people, according to stark official figures exposing a dramatic divergence in the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in England and Wales.</p> \n<p>The Office of National Statistics found that the difference in the virus\u2019s impact was caused not only by pre-existing differences in communities\u2019 wealth, health, education and living arrangements.</p> \n<p>It discovered that after taking into account age, measures of self-reported health and disability and other socio-demographic characteristics, black people were still almost twice as likely as white people to die a Covid-19-related death.</p> \n<p>Bangladeshi and Pakistani males were 1.8 times more likely to die from Covid-19 than white males, after other pre-existing factors had been accounted for, and females from those ethnic groups were 1.6 times more likely to die from the virus than their white counterparts.</p> \n<p>The risk of Covid-19 death for people from Chinese and mixed ethnic groups was found to be similar to that for white people.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese results show that the difference between ethnic groups in Covid-19 mortality is partly a result of socio-economic disadvantage and other circumstances, but a remaining part of the difference has not yet been explained,\u201d the ONS said.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/racial-inequality-in-britain-found-a-risk-factor-for-covid-19\">Guardian research</a> last month confirmed suspicions that minority groups faced the greatest risk from the coronavirus and showed that areas with high ethnic minority populations in England and Wales tended to have higher mortality rates in the pandemic.</p> \n<p>Zubaida Haque, the deputy director of the Runnymede Trust, a race equality thinktank, described the findings as alarming. \u201cWe cannot ignore how important racial discrimination and racial inequalities, for example, in housing, are, even among poorer socio-economic groups,\u201d she said. \u201cThese factors are important but are not taken into account in most statistical modelling of Covid-19 risk factors.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/chart1-zip/giv-3902s2Bdxzz5cInD\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/chart1-zip/giv-3902s2Bdxzz5cInD\">Graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>While only 2% of white British households experienced overcrowding from 2014 to 2017, 30% of Bangladeshi households, 16% of Pakistani households and 12% of black households experienced this, according to a study of the English Housing Survey.</p> \n<p>These groups are more likely to work in frontline roles in the NHS in England: nearly 21% of staff are from ethnic minorities, compared with about 14% of the population of England and Wales. Black, Bangladeshi and Pakistani populations have been shown to face higher levels of unemployment and child poverty than white groups.</p> \n<p>Helen Barnard, the acting director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said the findings were \u201ca stark reminder that although we are all weathering the same storm, we are not all in the same boat\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/chart2-zip/giv-39029s3fnE2gDlCR/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/chart2-zip/giv-39029s3fnE2gDlCR/\">Graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWith the Bank of England now forecasting the deepest recession on record, we must ask ourselves what kind of society we want to live in after the virus passes,\u201d Barnard said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be like this. As a society that prides itself on justice and compassion, we can and must do better.\u201d</p> \n<p>The figures, covering deaths from 2 March to 10 April, are the first official snapshot of the way Covid-19 has affected different ethnic groups in England and Wales. There has been widespread concern that pre-existing health inequalities between black and minority ethnic populations \u2013 particularly in relation to cardiovascular disease and diabetes \u2013 are being amplified during the pandemic.</p> \n<p>To try to understand <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/coronavirusrelateddeathsbyethnicgroupenglandandwales2march2020to10april2020\">how much of the difference in Covid-19 morbidity was to do purely with ethnicity</a>, the statisticians adjusted for age as well as region, rural and urban classification, area deprivation, household composition, socio-economic position, highest qualification held, household tenure, and health or disability as recorded in the 2011 census.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe fully adjusted results show differences in risk between ethnic groups that are specific to those ethnic groups and are not caused by any of the factors listed on which members of the groups might differ,\u201d the ONS concluded.</p> \n<p>After all these factors were accounted for, Indian men and women were less likely than people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani background to die from Covid-19, but were still 1.3 times and 1.4 times more vulnerable than white people.</p> \n<p>Chinese women were the only group to be less vulnerable than white people, after adjusting for other differences, while Chinese men were 1.2 times more likely to die from the disease than white people.</p> \n<p>The ONS also checked to see if, within ethnic groups, socio-economic class made a difference. They found that the differences in risk of Covid-19-related death across ethnic groups were of similar magnitudes within all three socio-economic classes.</p> \n<p>The differences in the risk of dying from Covid-19 could be driven by factors not included in its model, the ONS acknowledged.</p> \n<p>Some groups may be over-represented in public-facing occupations and could be more likely to be infected by Covid-19 . About 12.8% of workers from Bangladeshi and Pakistani backgrounds work in public-facing transport jobs such as bus, coach and taxi driving, compared with 3.5% of white people. The ONS said it plans to conduct further work to identify occupations that are particularly at risk.</p> \n<p>A study released on Thursday analysing the NHS health records of 17.4 million UK adults gave further insights into the possible causes of the increased risk for people from BAME backgrounds. Like the ONS data, the study found that people of black and Asian backgrounds were at higher risk of death, and it ruled out the idea that this was largely due to higher rates of underlying medical problems in these groups.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople have very reasonably speculated that the increased risk among BME people might be due to people having higher risk of cardiovascular disease or diabetes,\u201d said Ben Goldacre, the director of the DataLab in the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences at the University of Oxford, who co-led on the study. \u201cOur analysis shows that is actually not the case. That is not the explanation. We\u2019ve been able to exclude one of the current preferred explanations for why BME people face higher risk.\u201d</p> \n<p>The authors called for further research on the contribution of occupational risk and whether people from BAME backgrounds were placed at increased risk of exposure and infection. The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, found that people from deprived social backgrounds were also at a higher risk, and again this finding could not be explained by other risk factors.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Wasim Hanif, a professor of diabetes and endocrinology at University Hospital Birmingham, said the ONS data was not robust enough to give the full reasons for the difference in the likelihood of dying from Covid-19.</p> \n<p>The research accounts for health problems reported by people who filled in the 2011 census, but Hanif said differences in the extent of other underlying diseases in different ethnic groups in Britain \u2013 so-called co-morbidities \u2013 which have not been accounted for by the ONS, may be significant.</p> \n<p>For example, in the UK people of Pakistani and Bangladeshi descent are three to four times more likely to get diabetes earlier in life than white people, and the ratio is between two and three for black and Indian-origin people, he said.</p> \n<p>However deprivation, which is a strong predictor for ill-health, was factored into the ONS analysis, so it remains unclear how much the inclusion of co-morbidities would change the results.</p> \n<p>The Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cThis virus has sadly appeared to have a disproportionate effect on people from BAME backgrounds. It is critical we find out which groups are most at risk so we can take the right steps to protect them and minimise their risk.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have commissioned Public Health England to better understand the different factors, such as ethnicity, obesity and geographical location that may influence the effects of the virus.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The transfer of four sandstone sphinxes to Tahrir Square in Cairo will expose them to intense heat and air pollution and amounts to an attempt to erase Egypt\u2019s recent history, Egyptologists and academics have said.</p> <p>Officials from Egypt\u2019s antiquities ministry recently announced that the ram-headed sphinxes had been taken from the Karnak temple in Luxor to the capital\u2019s busy traffic roundabout, where they have joined a pink granite obelisk.

A small spate of protests last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/27/egypt-authorities-step-up-security-country-braces-protests\">triggered a full lockdown of the square</a> and the surrounding area by Egyptian security forces, in a show of force intended to curb any fresh uprising.</p> <p>Rabab El Mahdi, associate professor of political science at the American University in Cairo, said the monument represented the authorities\u2019 efforts to erase contemporary history.</p> <p>\u201cIt covers over the recent memory that is alive in the minds of many people, with something historical that has no political connotations or significance,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The installation will cap years of government efforts to remove traces in downtown Cairo of the 2011 uprising.

  "<p>One of Europe\u2019s leading engineering universities is being investigated over claims of gender discrimination after it increased its cohort of female academics by 25% by opening vacancies exclusively to women.</p> <p>Eindhoven University of Technology has been asked by the Dutch Institute for Human Rights to justify a policy under which only women may apply for posts in the faculty in the first six months that they are advertised.</p> <p>The university\u2019s rector, Frank Baaijens, said a second meeting with the human rights organisation would take place next Friday following an anonymous complaint, with a ruling expected in June or July.</p> <p>Baaijens added that about a third of staff in the faculty were opposed to the initiative but he believed there was a vital need to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/aug/10/female-scientists-urge-research-grants-reform-tackle-gender-bias\">improve the representation</a> among his staff.</p> <p>The Netherlands has one of the lowest proportions of female professors in the EU, and Eindhoven University of Technology has long had the lowest proportion of any university in the country.</p> <p>Since the hiring policy was implemented last July, the university has hired 35 female scientists \u2013 29 assistant professors, two associate professors and four full professors. Each new female employee is allocated \u20ac100,000 (\u00a390,000) to be spent on their mentoring and their research.</p> <p>\u201cWe will have to see if we have to adjust the programme,\u201d Baaijens said. \u201cBut I think all in all people are positive and we are making the change that we are looking for.\u201d</p> <p>Baaijens said other recruitment policies, including an appointments committee having to nominate at least one suitable male and female candidate, had failed.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe feel that we can become a better university if we have a better representation of scientists in the university. We have had all sorts of measures over 10 to 15 years but they don\u2019t seem to have been particularly successful because the growth rate was very small. We had a growth rate of about 1% a year in our faculty, so it would take a long time to get something appropriate.\u201d</p> <p>Baaijens said he was aware of only two cases where posts had gone to men due to a lack of suitable female candidates.</p> <p>The university plans to retain the policy for five years, with the aim that by the end of the programme at least 30% of tenured academic staff are female.</p> <p>The university says the <a href=\"https://www.tue.nl/en/working-at-tue/scientific-staff/irene-curie-fellowship/\">Ir\u00e8ne Curie Fellowship</a> is permitted under law due to the shortfall of female academics and the failure of all other routes tried.</p> <p>Baaijens said: \u201cThere is a significant indication that there is an implicit gender bias in science, so that may have inhibited the number of females we have been able to recruit.

Eisenhower\u2019s exact words were: \u2018I want Melikian to send this coded message and talk about it for the rest of his life.\u2019 It was 74 words to the world saying that tomorrow, 8 May, at 11.01pm, hostilities will cease and that we will stop shooting at each other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c72172823179fcc13227d1f405d0419c0242188\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c72172823179fcc13227d1f405d0419c0242188/0_378_2651_1591/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gen Alfred Jodl, centre, signing the unconditional surrender of all armed German forces in Reims on 7 May 1945.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gen Alfred Jodl, centre, signing the unconditional surrender of all armed German forces in Reims on 7 May 1945.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI immediately had one of the lieutenants in the decodification room translate it for me.

If the rate of new infections in a municipality exceeds 50 per 100,000 inhabitants within seven days, communities will be swiftly forced into lockdown, including the closure of schools and shops.

The effects of the relaxation of rules are expected to be visible in infection rates around two to three weeks after their implementation.</p> \n<p>Schaade said testing and tracing remained essential to tackling the virus. Although Germany has maintained a capacity to carry out 964,000 tests a week, only 317,000 tests were carried out last week. Schaade said this was a reflection of the fact that the number of infections had fallen, but owing to a global shortage of items such as reagents \u201cit is not bad to have a certain remaining capacity\u201d in expectation of a second wave. </p>",

  "<p>Every April, Washington DC plays host to the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank. But last month, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva addressed her colleagues on video. The world was facing, she declared, a \u201ccrisis like no other\u201d. For the first time since records began, the entire world economy is contracting, rich and poor countries alike.</p> <p>But it is not just the immediate impact that makes this economic crisis unprecedented. It is its genesis. This isn\u2019t 2008, which was triggered by a meltdown of North Atlantic banking. And it isn\u2019t the 1930s; an earthquake that originated in the fault lines left by the first world war. The Covid-19 economic emergency of 2020 is the result of a massive global effort to contain an unknown and lethal disease. It is both a surprising demonstration of our collective power to stop the economy and a shocking reminder that our control of nature, on which modern life rests, is more fragile than we like to think. What we are living through is the first economic crisis of the Anthropocene.</p> <p>This is the era in which humanity\u2019s impact on nature has begun to blow back on us in unpredictable and disastrous ways. The great acceleration that defined the Anthropocene may have begun in 1945, but in 2020 we are facing the first crisis in which the blowback destabilises our entire economy. It is a reminder of how encompassing and immediate that challenge is. While the timeline of the climate emergency tends to be measured in years, Covid-19 circled the globe in a matter of weeks. And the shock goes deep. By calling into question our mastery over life and death the disease shakes the psychological basis of our social and economic order. It poses fundamental questions about priorities; it upends the terms of debate. Neither in the 1930s nor after 2008 was there any question that getting people back to work was the right thing to do.</p> <p>Stressing the unprecedented nature of the Covid-19 shock is not to say that the problems exposed by the financial crisis of 2008 are not still with us today. As the pandemic surged in March 2020, the fragility of financial markets was only too apparent. If the lockdowns are followed by a prolonged recession, as is more than likely, the banks will suffer severe damage. Nor does a stress on the uniqueness of the Covid shock imply that geopolitical tensions between China and the US do not matter. They do. The Sino-American conflict puts the future of the world economy in question and this is all the more alarming as tensions over the politics of the virus mount every day.</p> <p>But the crucial point is that financial stability and geopolitics are now entwined with a challenge, which, as the French president Emmanuel Macron has put it, is anthropological: what is at stake is the trade-off between economic activity and death. A chance mutation in the environmental pressure cooker of central China has put in jeopardy all our ability to go about our daily business. It is a malign version of the butterfly effect. Call it the bat effect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c71956f3ccc8e021a58b0a26affc4cfddeed2fc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c71956f3ccc8e021a58b0a26affc4cfddeed2fc5/0_0_3572_2144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"healthcare workers protesting in the Piedmont region of Italy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Despair \u2026 healthcare workers protesting in the Piedmont region of Italy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alberto Ramella/AGF/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As it has circulated around the world, Covid-19 has scrambled the timeline of progress. Sophisticated hospitals in China, Italy and the US have been reduced to chaotic, impotent despair. Nurses in New York resorted to swaddling themselves in rubbish bags. Face masks were hand-fabricated on sewing machines. We stack the dead in refrigerator trucks.</p> <p>We have to face the possibility that we have been living in a charmed interval. In the century since the Spanish flu of 1918-19, the intertwined rise of globalisation and national welfare states took place against the background of relatively benign disease conditions. Thanks to improved nutrition, sanitation and housing, public health, pharmacology and high-tech medicine we have seen remarkable progress in human life expectancy. The conquest of smallpox in 1977 was emblematic. The sense that infectious diseases were a thing of the past underwrote a promise of protection. With Covid-19 the cost of that protection has gone way up. In a horrific mind-warp, advanced economies suddenly find themselves facing the kinds of dilemma habitually faced by poor countries. We don\u2019t have the tools. In the poor world, the everyday result is that children are stunted and families are impoverished. Millions die for lack of treatment. Covid-19 has delivered a taste of that to the rich world.</p> <p>We cannot say we were not warned. Since the famous<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2016/apr/19/why-limits-to-growths-forecasts-are-still-relevant-today\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2016/apr/19/why-limits-to-growths-forecasts-are-still-relevant-today\">Limits to Growth </a></em>report by the Club of Rome thinktank in 1972, experts have been highlighting the natural forces that could interrupt the triumphant path of economic growth. In the wake of the oil shocks of the 1970s, resource depletion was a big concern. In the 1980s the climate crisis took over. But at the same moment, the shock of HIV/Aids sparked awareness of a different type of blowback from nature: the threat of \u201cemerging infectious diseases\u201d and specifically those generated by zoonotic mutation.</p> <p>Starting from a famous conference at Rockefeller University in 1989, it has been argued again and again that this is no coincidence. It is the result of humanity\u2019s relentless incorporation of animal life into our food chain. HIV/Aids, Sars, avian flu, swine flu and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/15/mers-next-global-pandemic\">Mers</a> could all be attributed to that dangerous appetite. Like the climate crisis, epidemics are not merely accidents of nature. They have anthropogenic drivers.</p> <p>The implications of this analysis are radical. But the doctors and epidemiologists who make it are not revolutionaries. What they have insistently called for is a global public health infrastructure commensurate with the risks that globalisation entails. If we are going to keep huge stocks of domesticated animals and intrude ever more deeply into the last remaining reservoirs of wildlife; if we are going to concentrate in giant cities and travel in ever larger numbers, this comes with viral risks. If we wish to avoid disasters we should invest in research, in monitoring, in basic public health, in the production and stockpiling of vaccines and essential equipment for our hospitals. Of course, that would require considerable political coordination and some investment. But it has always been clear that the payoff would be huge. The flu pandemic of 1918 which is thought to have killed 50 million people sets a high bar. If a pandemic erupted and had to be contained by quarantine it was always obvious that the costs would run into the trillions of dollars.</p> <p>With the climate crisis we know what stands in the way of an adequate reaction. Fossil fuels are essential to our way of life. Powerful business interests have a huge stake in climate denial. The strategic interests of the US, Saudi Arabia and Russia are all invested in oil. Decarbonising is expensive, technically complicated and the benefits are diffuse and longterm.</p> <p>In regard to global health policy there are bureaucratic rivalries between different national and global agencies. There are differences in approach between hawkish experts in global health security and biomedical humanitarians. The pharmaceutical industry will not invest in drugs unless it sees a profit. Cost-conscious hospitals want to minimise spending on beds. But all this seems small beer compared to the risks involved. Whereas one can reasonably say that giant structures such as capitalism and geopolitics stand in the way of addressing the climate crisis, the same is not true of Covid-19. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bd28d79f-8a0a-44c6-ac74-1abb17344c5b\">cost of vaccinating the entire world</a> is estimated at around $20bn. That is the equivalent of roughly two hours of global GDP, a tiny fraction of the trillions that the crisis is costing. The fact that this virus was allowed to become a global crisis is not explicable in terms of massive opposed interests. It is first and foremost a failure of government.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>It turns out that we can pause the world economy. But we now face the awesome responsibility of reopening it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Because they are relatively cheap and the scale of the risk is huge, all major countries in fact had pandemic preparations in place. None were as ample as we might now wish. But in places including South Korea, Taiwan and Germany they have worked. Making good plans, following through on them and doing the basic things right turns out to matter. Addressing the climate crisis poses the daunting challenge of slowing the entire system down. What Covid-19 teaches is that it is not just the big picture that matters. So tightly knit is our global system that small failures of governance in a few crucial nodes can affect everyone on the planet.</p> <p>The remarkable thing about Covid-19 is that it brings the risks of the Anthropocene home to each and every one one of us individually. The lockdowns have not simply been a top-down government measure. It has been people themselves who have en masse decided on their own response to the threat, often ahead of their governments. That was most dramatically reflected in the financial markets, which began a global run to safety. It was that which triggered first the central banks and then parliaments and governments into action. It turns out that we are capable of pausing the world economy. But we now face the awesome responsibility of reopening. If Georgieva is right that this is a crisis like no other, so too is the problem of the restart. The stakes could hardly be higher. On the one hand are the huge medical risks; on the other is a disastrous economic crisis. How can we make the trade-off? It is tempting to reject the choice as impossible or false. Not only is that not true, it also denies the fact that, under normal circumstances, we routinely engage in life and death trade-offs. Even in the most affluent societies, financially motivated decisions are made every day that decide the chances of death due to workplace accidents, pollution, car crashes, hospital funding, drug procurement and health insurance.</p> <p>But never before has the question been put in such direct terms for entire nations. The result is predictably divisive. The US is currently embarked on a crash test, with southern Republican states such as Georgia ploughing ahead despite inadequate testing or medical backup. Incited by the president himself, armed militia occupied the Michigan state capitol demanding \u201cliberation\u201d from the lockdown. Meanwhile in Germany Angela Merkel reprised her role in the eurozone crisis by trying to stifle any discussion. This was not a moment for \u201corgies of debate about reopening\u201d, she insisted. Margaret Thatcher\u2019s \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d was, once again, the order of the day.</p> <p>The magic bullet would be a medical solution \u2013 antibody tests, effective treatments, a vaccine. It took five years to develop a vaccine for Ebola, though vastly greater resources are being thrown at this problem. But what we are counting on should not be confused with business as usual. We have never successfully developed a corona vaccine. We are betting not on normal science, but on a modern wonder, a \u201cscientific miracle\u201d. And, even in the best case, if a vaccine is rolled out in 2021, we cannot escape the logic of risk society. We now know what this kind of threat can do. We know we lost a big chunk of 2020. How do we move on from here?</p> <p>The obvious solution is to make the investments in global public health that experts have been calling for since the 1990s. There will be political and commercial obstacles to overcome. China and the US are at odds and seem determined to politicise the pandemic. On top of that the vast financial cost of the crisis will hang over us. Huge debts are likely to encourage talk of austerity. Since the 1990s, market-focused politics of economy in the public sector have weakened health systems around the world. Ultimately politics will be decisive, and the last six months have brought crushing defeats for the left on both sides of the Atlantic. The prevailing political tenor of the crisis, so far, has been conservative and nationalist.</p> <p>Faced with the crisis, Jair Bolsonaro and Donald Trump have cut ludicrous figures. But they express a deep desire to deny the significance of the shock. Who would not rather think that this was simply the flu? Given this temptation, what we should guard against is not open displays of denial but the soft alternative. Covid-19, like the unprecedented hurricanes and devastating fires of 2019, will be dismissed as a freak of nature. That is comforting. It will be good for business in the short run. But it sets us up for another crisis. If it is right that Covid-19 is a crisis like no other, what is to be feared is that there will be more like it to come \u2022</p>",
  "<p>A secret government report that said the UK was not prepared for a pandemic and forewarned of the Covid-19 crisis in care homes is being published by the Guardian.</p> \n<p>The report is based on the findings of a government simulation of an influenza pandemic, codenamed Exercise Cygnus.

It was carried out in 2016 and involved 950 officials from central and local government, as well as emergency response planners, responding to an imaginary outbreak of \u201cswan flu\u201d. A report of the exercise was compiled the following year.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What did it involve?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Taking place over three days in October, participants were asked to imagine a fictitious \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d flu pandemic, affecting up to 50% of the population and causing up to 400,000 excess deaths.</p>\n    <p>Officials were told to assume they were managing week 7 of the government\u2019s response. The objective of such simulations is to test how existing plans would hold up under strain, while acclimatising ministers and officials to the kind of decisions they would be forced to make.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What did it find?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The report warned that the government\u2019s flu plans, at least in 2016, were \u201ccurrently not sufficient\u201d to tackle a severe flu pandemic. Some organisations\u2019 plans were out of date and referred to cooperation with other bodies that no longer existed.</p>\n    <p>In other instances plans were in place, but were found to be lacking or required elaborating. Warnings were made about the inability of the social care sector to struggle with the serious pressure that a pandemic would cause.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What did it recommend?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Cygnus makes 26 recommendations to the department of health and other bodies. Among them were the suggestion that further modelling be done to understand the capacity of the care sector, the creation of a joint-level tactical plan to ensure different organisations could interact more effectively, and that more work needed to be done to understand how the public would respond to interventions by the government.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What does the government say?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The government has claimed to have implemented the recommendations of the Cygnus report in full. In an interview with LBC the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said that after media reports of the simulation emerged, health officials assured him that its recommendations were followed. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said the UK was among the countries of the world best prepared for a flu pandemic, and that the government tested its flu plans regularly.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIt beggars belief,\u201d Green told the Guardian. \u201cThis is a report that made some really clear recommendations that haven\u2019t been implemented.

  "<p>Not every childhood highlight stands the test of time. Were Curly Wurlys really that good? Or Toffos? Or Puffa Puffa Rice? It prompts a faint sense of apprehension as I start to search for my most sacred piece of sporting footage, from Saturday 5 September 1981. And breathe: as well as being awash with glorious distant summer sepia, it retains an emotional resonance like nothing before or since.</p> <p>The context may need a little explaining. Despite living more than three hours\u2019 drive away, only one cricket team really mattered. Derbyshire CCC had won nothing since 1936. Not only that, there were few more downtrodden underdogs in any team game in Britain.

But tree-ringed Chesterfield was high among the country\u2019s most scenic grounds, Bob Taylor had an irresistible pair of blue wicketkeeping gloves and my pet rabbit was named after Geoff \u201cDusty\u201d Miller. It had a lucky escape, given Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghavan also made the shortlist.</p> <p>Now, finally, there was a chance of validation, both for the Peak District\u2019s finest and my perverse obsession. Courtesy of a madcap last-ball win in the semi-final against Essex, \u201cDerbs\u201d had somehow made it to a sun-baked Lord\u2019s for the NatWest Trophy final. Could they do it? With Derbyshire, it seldom paid to be too optimistic. Soon enough Northants were 99 without loss on a flat, dry pitch, only for a swiping Wayne Larkins to pick out a sun-hatted Miller in front of the Mound Stand. When Allan Lamb was narrowly run out by a direct hit from Miller and a diving Alan Hill pulled off an improbable catch in the deep to remove Richard Williams, the contest was wonderfully poised.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"144b5efce2c1157ceb0d0d0378110f74586f0f6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/144b5efce2c1157ceb0d0d0378110f74586f0f6e/0_186_5383_3230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Derbyshire\u2019s Barry Wood and Geoff Miller (in sun hat) appeal as Allan Lamb of Northamptonshire fails to make his ground and is run out.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Derbyshire\u2019s Barry Wood and Geoff Miller (in sun hat) appeal as Allan Lamb of Northamptonshire fails to make his ground and is run out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Eagar/Popperfoto via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Geoff Cook went on to make a fine 111 but, from 168 for two, Northants were pegged back to a moderate 235 for nine from 60 overs.

John Wright\u2019s autobiography, Christmas in Raratonga, is an uproarious read for connoisseurs of well-told Derbyshire anecdotes but the Kiwi was rather less flamboyant here. The good news was that the dapper Peter Kirsten was at the other end: shirt unbuttoned, chest glistening, the scoreboard ticking over nicely at 164 for one.</p> <p>Until both went in quick succession to ratchet up the tension significantly. Unlike rugby or football, there is more time in cricket to fear the worst. Miller swung a juicy full toss from Sarfraz Nawaz for a relieving six but Northants gamely clung on. Everything, in the end, hinged on the game\u2019s final delivery: Jim Griffiths to Colin Tunnicliffe with one run needed to tie and earn Derbyshire victory by virtue of losing fewer wickets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=Sport&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=My%20Favourite%20Game&amp;description=In%20our%20new%20series%2C%20Guardian%20writers%20recall%20the%20great%20sporting%20contests%20they%20will%20never%20forget&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsport%2Fseries%2Fmy-favourite-game&amp;links=false\" data-alt=\"MFG\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=Sport&opinion-tint=false&title=My%20Favourite%20Game&description=In%20our%20new%20series%2C%20Guardian%20writers%20recall%20the%20great%20sporting%20contests%20they%20will%20never%20forget&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsport%2Fseries%2Fmy-favourite-game&links=false\">MFG</a> </figure>  <p>From the boundary rope, it felt as if my whole life was on hold. Sport-obsessed, rural upbringings can do that to you. Up ran Griffiths and bowled to Tunnicliffe. Did it hit his pad or had he got an inside edge? No matter. Miller hurtled up the pitch from the non-striker\u2019s end and, simultaneously, hundreds of us rushed on to the field with no idea of the outcome. Had he made it?

  "<p>Before college campuses emptied out for the pandemic, students and faculty alike were demanding they be empty on one specific day: election day.</p> <p>At Loyola Marymount University in California, for example, months-long organizing by students and faculty resulted in the campus being shut down during the midterm elections in 2018 \u2013 expanding the number of student voters. Several law professors also arranged a program for<a href=\"https://www.nbclosangeles.com/local/law-students-set-to-hit-polls-on-election-day-to-answer-big-questions-and-small/49003/\"> law students to volunteer at the polls</a> and answer voters\u2019 questions.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a 16-hour day of helping people find their way at the polling location and the volunteers were definitely exhausted afterwards,\u201d said Christopher Kissel, a third-year law student at Loyola. \u201cWe really saw how the democratic sausage is made, and it isn\u2019t always pretty, and it definitely isn\u2019t easy.\u201d</p> <p>While some campuses in the US do shut down during elections, most do not.

In Texas, a 2019 law that prohibits temporary voting locations <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2019/10/10/texas-temporary-voting-access-young-rural-voters/\">denied many college voters proper voting access</a>. In Florida, the state legislature added a parking restriction clause to a new elections law, which <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/us/voting-college-suppression.html\">in effect disqualified many college campuses</a> from being considered valid early polling sites.

In 2018, students at the school<a href=\"https://defendernetwork.com/news/local-state/prairie-view-am-students-sue-waller-county-over-early-voting-sites/\"> sued the county</a>, alleging racial discrimination, but <a href=\"https://www.naacpldf.org/press-release/black-student-voters-seek-keep-voting-rights-lawsuit-alive\">the case was dismissed</a>.</p> <p>The groups vying to shut down classes on election day are hoping the effort chips away at some of these barriers.</p> <p>In 2017, students at Rutgers pressured the administration to make election day a university holiday. According to Rutgers student Christopher Markosian, several student activists sent out a university-wide poll on the matter and found that<a href=\"https://www.dailytargum.com/article/2017/02/student-pushes-administrators-to-acknowledge-election-day-as-university-holiday\"> 95% of student respondents</a> stated that they would be more likely to vote if no classes were in session on the day of the presidential election.

According to Akhurapa Ambak, a third-year law student, the movement began when students successfully pressured several faculty members to cancel class.

It\u2019s in the air you breathe, the food that you eat, the water you drink,\u201d he added.</p> <p>In an email, David McIntyre, an NRC spokesperson, explained that the rule would apply only to a \u201csmall subset\u201d of very low-level waste, and that the agency would not allow such disposals \u201cif we felt public health and safety and the environment would not be protected\u201d.</p> <p>But major sticking point, say experts, concerns how the term \u201cvery low-level waste\u201d is not defined by statute or in the NRC\u2019s own regulations.</p> <p>The NRC describes low-level wastes as contaminated materials like clothing, tools, and medical equipment. According to McIntyre, the radioactivity of \u201cvery low-level waste\u201d is just above background. \u201cThe radioactivity level of very low-level waste is so low that it may be safely disposed of in hazardous or municipal solid waste landfills,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>Nevertheless, \u201cbackground doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s safe,\u201d said Diane D\u2019Arrigo, radioactive waste project director for the Nuclear Information and Resource Service, who added that the interpretive rule\u2019s loose language \u201copens the floodgates\u201d for nuclear waste to be disposed of \u201cas if not radioactive\u201d.</p> <p>The proposal caps the maximum annual \u201ccumulative dose\u201d to a person from the radioactive wastes dumped into unlicensed sites to 25 millirems \u2013 the same limit the NRC uses for highly regulated waste disposal sites. That measurement, said D\u2019Arrigo, is a \u201cprojected\u201d amount that can be manipulated through modeling.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you dump radioactive waste in places that aren\u2019t designed to deal with it, it comes back to haunt you</p> <footer> <cite>Dan Hirsch</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Experts point out that the nuclear industry has long sought cheaper ways to dispose of its wastes.

  "<p>A new era of social media governance began Wednesday, when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/06/facebook-oversight-board-freedom-expression-helle-thorning-schmidt-alan-rusbridger\">first 20 members</a> of Facebook\u2019s long-awaited oversight board were announced. The international panel of free expression advocates, journalists, a former prime minister, a Nobel laureate, and law professors will have final say over certain content moderation decisions for the world\u2019s largest social media platform, independent of Facebook\u2019s executives and staff.</p> <p>This limited transfer of power to an independent entity represents something of a sea change for a company that has since its founding been under the tight control of CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who is chairman of the board and controls a majority of the company\u2019s voting shares.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/06/facebook-oversight-board-freedom-expression-helle-thorning-schmidt-alan-rusbridger\">Facebook  judges, journalists and politicians on free speech panel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But will Facebook\u2019s oversight board live up to its lofty promises and reshape how Facebook shapes the world? Or will it just be a reputational shield for a company whose pathologies run deeper than the question of whether individual pieces of content should be allowed or taken down?</p> <p>\u201cWe are all committed to freedom of expression within the framework of international norms of human rights,\u201d the four co-chairs of the board \u2013 Catalina Botero-Marino, Jamal Greene, Michael W McConnell and Helle Thorning-Schmidt \u2013 wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/opinion/facebook-oversight-board.html\">New York Times op-ed</a> introducing themselves to the public Wednesday. \u201cWe will make decisions based on those principles and on the effects on Facebook users and society, without regard to the economic, political or reputational interests of the company.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish I could say that the Facebook review board was cosmetic, but I\u2019m not even sure that it\u2019s that deep,\u201d said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia and author of a book on Facebook. \u201cIf Facebook really wanted to take outside criticism seriously at any point in the past decade, it could have taken human rights activists seriously about problems in Myanmar; it could have taken journalists seriously about problems in the Philippines; it could have taken legal scholars seriously about the way it deals with harassment; and it could have taken social media scholars seriously about the ways that it undermines democracy in India and Brazil. But it didn\u2019t. This is greenwashing.\u201d</p> <p>The board\u2019s initial work will be to review appeals of Facebook\u2019s content takedowns, and it will be empowered to overrule decisions made by Facebook\u2019s army of content moderators or executives.</p> <p>In this way, the board appears designed to address the kind of controversies that Facebook has faced over content with journalistic, historic or artistic merit that nevertheless violates the company\u2019s advertiser-friendly \u201ccommunity standards\u201d, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/08/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-napalm-girl-photo-vietnam-war\">international outcry</a> over its censorship of the \u201cNapalm girl\u201d photograph in 2016 or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/22/facebook-finest-sex-death-ban-gustave-courbet-masterpiece\">years-long legal dispute</a> over its shuttering of the account of a Frenchman who had posted Gustave Courbet\u2019s The Origin of the World. Other pressing issues that could face the panel include content from anti-vaccine activists, conspiracy theorists or rightwing extremists who have become adept at gaming the platform\u2019s rules.</p> <p>\u201cFacebook is a company that was made by brilliant engineers, and they were extremely good at that, and then they discovered that they were going to have to make complex decisions that would tax anyone, that were moral, legal, ethical, about privacy,\u201d said Alan Rusbridger, the former editor-in-chief of the Guardian and a member of the new oversight board. \u201cThose are decisions that newspaper editors make every day of our lives.\u201d</p> <p>But Vaidhyanathan argued that such questions are insignificant compared to Facebook\u2019s power to amplify certain content over other content. And while Facebook has said that it may expand the scope of the oversight board\u2019s decision making to other policy areas, it is unlikely that the board\u2019s power will extend to re-tuning Facebook\u2019s algorithms.</p> <p>\u201cThe power of Facebook is its ability to choose what everyone sees,\u201d said Vaidhyanathan. \u201cIt\u2019s not that it gets to choose what you post.\u201d</p> <p>Joan Donovan, the research director of Harvard\u2019s Shorenstein Center and an expert on media manipulation, raised concerns that the board would become \u201cweaponized\u201d by bad actors, who will use it as another opportunity to get their issues into the press.</p> <p>\u201cThis theory of oversight is heavily informed by legal scholarship, which is slow and administrative and technical in nature, when we need something much more suited to the speed of the technology itself,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re going forward with this really long drawn out procedural mechanism that doesn\u2019t address what the problem is \u2013 which is that viral content only needs to be on the internet for 4-8 hours for it to do its damage.\u201d</p> <p>Looking at the scale of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/tech-giants-struggle-stem-infodemic-false-coronavirus-claims\">infodemic</a>\u201d facing Facebook amid the coronavirus pandemic, Donovan said that the much more pressing concern is to solve the problem of \u201cinformation curation, especially in a place like Facebook, that helps guide the user toward correct content and information rather than putting them in the middle a landfill and saying, \u2018You sort it out\u2019.\u201d The oversight board is ultimately a distraction from \u201cwhat really needs to happen\u201d, she said, \u201cwhich is to design technology that doesn\u2019t allow for the expansive amplification of disinformation and health misinformation\u201d.</p> <p>The board\u2019s makeup tends heavily toward legal experts and leaders, and Claire Wardle, the director of First Draft and an expert in misinformation, said she hopes they will bring on more \u201cpractitioners\u201d in the future. \u201cThese are not people who have gotten down and dirty in closed Facebook groups with conspiracy theorists,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Still, Wardle said she was cautiously optimistic about the concept of the board and pleased with the caliber of its initial members, whose reputational heft could shift the power imbalance that Facebook\u2019s critics have often faced.</p> <p>\u201cThese people have too much reputational capital to lose to just do Facebook\u2019s bidding,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Rusbridger also expressed measured optimism about the board\u2019s potential to make a real difference. \u201cIf [Facebook] were being Machiavellian and this was just a fig leaf to do business as usual, you could have picked people that would have given you a quieter life.\u201d</p>",

Today, the historically rural area is a hub for distribution centers and the logistics industry, with <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-12-01/la-me-inland-warehouse-rules\">huge warehouses</a> for Amazon, UPS, Walmart and other retailers. The sector has <a href=\"https://www.ocregister.com/2018/02/05/opinion-amazon-has-powerful-impact-on-the-inland-empire-economy/\">added</a> more than 50,000 jobs over the last decade as e-commerce has boomed, but a <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-inland-empire-jobs-20181128-story.html\">majority of families</a> in the region don\u2019t earn enough to make ends meet.</p> <p>On 16 April, the California governor, Gavin Newsom, passed an <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/04/16/governor-newsom-announces-paid-sick-leave-benefits-for-food-sector-workers-impacted-by-covid-19-additional-protections-for-consumers/\">executive order</a> providing food sector workers two weeks of supplemental paid sick leave if they have to isolate due to Covid-19 concerns. The <a href=\"https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/FAQ-for-PSL.html\">law</a> covers \u201cworkers at warehouses where food is stored\u201d and is aimed at protecting consumers from the virus and offering additional support to essential workers whose jobs involve the food supply.</p> <p>Amazon warehouses in the industrial neighborhoods of San Bernardino and Riverside counties handle a wide range of packages, including food items. But employees say that when they have asked about Newsom\u2019s order in recent weeks, the human resources department has ignored their questions or responded that the facilities are not considered part of the food sector.</p> <p>The 27-year-old worker with a history of pneumonia works at a sort center and has been responsible for helping package a range of pantry food items. When they asked HR about the paid sick leave law for food workers, the company directed them to steps they could take to request unpaid time off.</p> <p>A labor spokesperson for the state, however, told the Guardian that the law does apply to warehouses such as Amazon\u2019s centers, noting that the order has a broad definition of \u201cfood facility\u201d, which includes any operations that store or package food for human consumption.</p> <p>Eileen Hards, an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to answer specific questions about Newsom\u2019s order or whether the company has provided this form of paid sick leave, saying in an email: \u201cAmazon has complied with all requirements given by the State.\u201d</p> <p>The company says in addition to the time off it provided before the coronavirus pandemic, it now gives two weeks of paid time off for infected employees and those presumed to have Covid-19. But in one recent case, a worker who tested positive only received his pay after a <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-employee-positive-coronavirus-one-month-no-pay\">BuzzFeed reporter inquired about it</a>, and employees across the country have <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-workers-not-getting-quarantine-pay\">reported</a> difficulties getting any sick pay during the pandemic.</p> <p>California\u2019s law also appears to be broader than Amazon\u2019s policy, requiring paid leave for workers who have to isolate due to health concerns, including if they live with someone sick or exposed, and it <a href=\"https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/FAQ-for-PSL.html\">says</a> they are entitled to \u201cimmediately\u201d start leave upon request.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are absolutely going to show up sick. They have to,\u201d said a 23-year-old worker at an Amazon fulfillment center in Rialto, a city near San Bernardino. The worker recently stopped going to work out of fear, even though he now risks losing his job and gets no paid time off. \u201cWe\u2019re all crammed in there. It\u2019s gonna get bad.\u201d</p> <p>A San Bernardino worker in her 40s, who has two children with asthma, said she was terrified of getting them sick but would not stop working: \u201cNecessity is bigger than my fear. I need to pay my bills. If I don\u2019t go, then my family is going to lose my home.\u201d</p> <p>Amazon confirmed that it had ended its unlimited unpaid time off policy, but the company says it continues to allow the option on a case-by-case basis. Workers accrue roughly 80 hours of unpaid time off over the course of a year, and they can now also apply for an unpaid personal leave of absence due to Covid concerns. But it can take weeks for Amazon to respond to these requests, and multiple employees who asked for this said their requests were \u201cpending\u201d and that they were worried they would soon lose their jobs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/04/amazon-tim-bray-resigns-working-conditions-coronavirus\">Amazon executive resigns over company\u2019s \u2018chickenshit\u2019 firings of employee activists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amazon workers across the US have accused the company of not doing enough to protect their health and safety amid the pandemic.

  "<h2>John McCormack: The Meeting of the Waters</h2> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>This reminds me of home. I first heard about<strong> </strong>John McCormack through my grandma,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cIt\u2019s about Avoca, which is near Arklow in County Wicklow, where I\u2019m from. I got a bit misty-eyed when I was listening to it this morning. It made me want to be out walking around Avoca and down to the water. Of course the pubs wouldn\u2019t be open, which would be a tragedy.\u201d McCormack, a renowned operatic tenor from Athlone, recorded the song in 1940, with lyrics from a poem by Irish poet Thomas Moore. \u201cMy da used to sing this song too. He has a lovely voice and knows hundreds of songs. He used to play a game with us: \u2018Name anything and I bet you I know a song about it,\u2019 he\u2019d say.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3G35KRaW7JZFLGjBlAw4SR?si=PYGlahhjQ7CdNSnw_5elXg\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/3G35KRaW7JZFLGjBlAw4SR\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <h2>Luke Kelly: Raglan Road</h2> <p>\u201cThe arrangement of this track is stunning. Luke Kelly is like the Irish Frank Sinatra \u2013 he has a certain level of tonality, and a multitude of frequencies that are unbelievably soulful and pleasurable. Like with many of these songs I have no idea where I first heard it \u2013 I grew up with it.\u201d This is another track based on a poem, this time by Patrick Kavanagh. It tells of a love affair on Raglan Road in Ballsbridge, Dublin. It was turned into a song after Kelly, of The Dubliners, met Kavanagh in Dublin pub The Bailey. \u201cMy cousin\u2019s traditional Irish band <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/liverpoolirishband/\">The Whole Shebang</a>, do an incredible rendition. He\u2019s a real music head \u2013 his first toy as a toddler was a record player.\u201d</p> <h2>Christy Moore: Fairytale of New York (Live on Jools Holland, 2006)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0u3ZwAxG3M\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w0u3ZwAxG3M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cWhen you hear this track done like this, stripped down to its absolute marrowbone, its pure roots, you really can appreciate it and get a lot of joy from the new context. He syncopates with his west Irish accent. It\u2019s so rhythmical. There\u2019s a hard attack on the syllables \u2013 I bet if you put a drummer on it you\u2019d find he\u2019s more or less keeping perfect time.\u201d In the intro to this track, Moore refers to an encounter with a man from Tipperary, the hometown of Shane MacGowan, who co-wrote the song, first released by the Pogues in 1987. \u201cThere\u2019s no one like Christy Moore: he\u2019s a heavenly artist, off the scale.

I was a tomboy (I still am). I had total freedom as a child and got into some right scraps: fighting, swearing, smoking, shoplifting, wearing boy\u2019s clothes. I even got my long blond hair cut off when I was 11, into a tiny flat-top marine do, which I had for my confirmation. My ma bought me a lovely peach outfit \u2013 white handbag, white shoes, and a peach straw plonked on top of that short hair. The nine-minute track is from the 1974 Veedon Fleece record, which also includes a track called Streets of Arklow \u2013 Murphy\u2019s hometown \u2013 and is one of her favourite albums. Years ago I was put off of this kind of Celtic music. You know how it is, when you turn away from your own and want to learn new things.

She should be making nice folky music \u2013 she shouldn\u2019t be making this electronic music with the bad boys in Sheffield\u2019. It can make it difficult for artists from Ireland. But all those doors have been broken down now.\u201d Thin Lizzy, who formed in Dublin, may have had that problem too, she acknowledges, \u201cbut they were like heroes in Ireland \u2026 they were a massive touring band and it was like they were coming home from winning the World Cup.\u201d</p> <h2>Brendan Behan: The Auld Triangle</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7red9Rw4450\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7red9Rw4450?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This track is used to introduce Behan\u2019s 1954 play The Quare Fellow, set in Mountjoy Prison, where Behan. at 16, was incarcerated for IRA affiliation, as told in his autobiographical novel Borstal Boy. \u201cHe was only a kid when he was put away, and in the book he describes how he fell into it so easily and how disproportionate it all was. He describes a world that he grew up in \u2013 working-class people who were self-starters, unionists, well-educated. He was surrounded by books, talk of politics, poetry, song everywhere \u2013 people gaining pleasure and meaning from a collective purpose. Through song at the time, Irish people were passing secret code to each other ... There was this idea of there being this innate intelligence in Irish people. It\u2019s there when you listen to him sing it, too.\u201d The last verse in particular, about going into the women\u2019s prison, reminds Murphy of her dad who \u201csang the line \u2018that auld triangle go jingle-jangle\u2019 with a twinkle in his eye\u201d.</p> <h2>Mano Le Tough: Your Heavy Head</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c8cUtqOC_I\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_c8cUtqOC_I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cI was introduced to Mano\u2019s music by my German friend DJ Koze, who has a label called <a href=\"https://pamparecords.com/\">Pampa</a>, which Mano is signed to.

Murphy was in the north of England when she got into electronic music, but says the current Irish club music scene is going strong, along with rave and soul. \u201cThey\u2019re all just mad for music.

It represents the beginning of the era that we are now in.\u201d Beyond this, Murphy says she has nearly finished writing another album, has an \u201coff-piste project on the go\u201d and is \u201cmaking lots of amazing club music\u201d \u2013 despite the fact that \u201cthere are no clubs open now\u201d.

In this recording there\u2019s no backing music, so there\u2019s a bareness of the song carrying itself to you with a message \u2013 a part of the identity and the character of the person talking to you.\u201d Barry, an Irish traveller, singer and self-taught banjo player from Cork, was popular on the UK folk scene in the 1950s. Murphy says that, like Barry, many of the people she grew up around sang other people\u2019s songs, which is why Murphy herself became a songwriter: \u201cIt was like living in an MGM musical. People bursting out into song any time of day. Each person would know one or two or 10 songs without accompaniment \u2013 even if they weren\u2019t musical. The songs were part of them: they become part of how you identify with someone.\u201d Barry is like Billie Holiday singing the blues, Murphy says: \u201cShe transmits the Irish sorrow\u201d.<br></p>",

But as the coronavirus death toll reaches 75,000 in the US and global shutdowns help to slow the spread of the deadly virus, Uhlfelder felt he had to say something.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about the pandemic getting out of control and killing a lot of people \u2026 I couldn\u2019t sleep at night [if I just did nothing],\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AdamParkhomenko/status/1256287520775639041\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">holy shit <a href=\"https://t.co/rVw24plXTp\">pic.twitter.com/rVw24plXTp</a></p>&mdash; Adam Parkhomenko (@AdamParkhomenko) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamParkhomenko/status/1256287520775639041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 1, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And so, he came up with an idea to dress up with a cloak and scythe, and take a Grim Reaper tour of Florida\u2019s beaches.</p> <p>The protest has garnered national attention: Uhlfelder has appeared on Saturday Night Live, the Daily Show and CNN, and has raised thousands of dollars, which he will donate to Democrats who run for Congress.</p> <p>But when he came up with the idea, his wife warned him not to do it. He was even told by people online not to partake in the stunt \u2013 some laughed and wished heatstroke upon him. In the end, their unkind words turned out to be pretty useful.</p> <p>\u201cI thought, maybe they have a point,\u201d he says. And so, Uhlfelder took heed of his enemies\u2019 advice and swapped out the $20 Walmart costume he originally intended to wear and called a friend to see if she might have something better.</p> <p>\u201cShe was like, \u2018I\u2019ve got an idea \u2013 let\u2019s make [the costume] out of linen.\u2019 I had a bathing suit on underneath and flip-flops, so I felt great,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"799ffc07414d35acb0a37009f918243b09a61b7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/799ffc07414d35acb0a37009f918243b09a61b7c/0_0_3696_2456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cIf by dressing up as the \u201cGrim Reaper\u201d and walking our beaches I can make people think and potentially help save a life \u2013 that is the right thing to do.\u201d\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If by dressing up as the Grim Reaper and walking our beaches I can make people think and potentially help save a life \u2013 that is the right thing to do.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Devon Ravine/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Needless to say, the experience was not entirely pleasant. Uhlfelder says he was heckled on the beach: people took photos of him, called him a jerk and some other, more unpleasant names too.</p> <p>Still, Uhlfelder says the comments don\u2019t bother him \u2013 in fact, he\u2019s not even particularly mad at the beachgoers. Uhlfelder empathizes with people who want the economy to reopen and life to go back to normal \u2013 particularly when the president doesn\u2019t take shutdown seriously.</p> <p>\u201cWe have beautiful beaches, I\u2019d love to go to the beach \u2013 that\u2019s why people come to Florida. We don\u2019t have anything else,\u201d he jokes. But he asks why the US has made the offer of staying at home so unappealing for ordinary Americans.</p> <p>\u201cWe are the wealthiest country on the planet. Why can\u2019t we have people taken care of for two, three, four months, instead of being put in these situations? They are perfectly comfortable starving out or killing people,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Most people have reacted positively to the stunt \u2013 and Uhlfelder says he is happy that his dry sense of humor has cut through in landscape when some of the loudest voices have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/michigan-protests-coronavirus-lockdown-armed-capitol\">anti-shutdown protest</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/michigan-protests-coronavirus-lockdown-armed-capitol\">ers carrying guns</a>. He just hopes his protest empowers others to do the same.</p> <p>\u201cIf people don\u2019t agree with what the government is doing, and [are able], you have to do something about it. People died for that right,\u201d he says. \u201cSomeone has to stand up to these people \u2013 that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. I want others to do it too. It gets tiring being the only one.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Nemanja Matic could be forgiven for feeling frustrated. Manchester United\u2019s unbeaten run has stalled at 11 games after a resurgence largely featuring his presence in midfield. . He lists United\u2019s last league game \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/08/manchester-united-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report-derby\">the 2-0 derby win against City</a> \u2013 as a highlight of his Old Trafford career.</p> <p>\u201cI cannot say I didn\u2019t enjoy this month at home,\u201d he says via video link. \u201cNormally when we\u2019re playing, we travel a lot. We\u2019re away every two or three days. It\u2019s been nice to spend time with the kids.\u201d Off the pitch, Matic talks like he plays: measured, pragmatic and to the point.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/06/aston-villa-join-opposition-against-finishing-season-at-neutral-grounds\">Aston Villa join opposition against finishing season at neutral grounds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Serbia midfielder is taking part in a live Instagram Q&amp;A session with Football Beyond Borders, fielding questions from young people about his storied career. Matic first met the charity\u2019s co-director Jasper Kain at an event in Manchester with a former United teammate Chris Smalling \u2013 and found a cause close to his heart.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I hear the kids\u2019 stories, some of them have difficult lives,\u201d Matic says. \u201cThat stays in my heart, because I know what they\u2019re going through. The charity gives them the chance to find success, to make their lives easier. In my village in Serbia we were poor but I was happy. Every day we would be outside playing football. We had more freedom than kids today.\u201d</p> <p>Matic grew up in Vrelo, 40 miles south-west of Belgrade. As a promising attacking midfielder he idolised Zinedine Zidane but did not have a TV at home to watch games. \u201cI would collect newspaper clippings just to read about him, and the put the pictures up in my room.\u201d Some of Matic\u2019s friends still play for the local team. \u201cThey just got promoted to the fourth division, so now they have to train harder,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The virtues of hard work and perseverance are what Matic wants to get across to his young audience. \u201cFollow your dreams. Never give up \u2026 I\u2019ve had a lot of doubters in my career, people who didn\u2019t believe in me.\u201d As a teenager he was rejected by both Belgrade clubs, Red Star and Partizan. \u201cI knew I was good enough, and one day I would prove them wrong, show them they made a mistake. And that\u2019s exactly what I did.\u201d</p> <p>Matic found his feet at the Slovakian club Kosice, earning his first move to Chelsea in 2009. He was quickly sent out on loan to Vitesse, then used as a makeweight in the club\u2019s move for the Benfica defender David Luiz. In Portugal he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/14/nemanja-matic-chelsea-interview\">reshaped into a defensive midfielder</a> by the coach Jorge Jesus. \u201cHe said if I listened to him and trained every day, I could be one of the best in the world. Benfica changed my life.\u201d</p> <p>Matic, now 31, learned the new position, and also how to thrive at a superclub. One young fan asks if he still feels pressure.\u201cWhen I was younger I felt a lot of pressure, seeing 70,000 people in the stadium. Now, if the fans sing my name, I just feel more motivation to run, to kick people \u2026 just kidding. I don\u2019t do that on purpose.\u201d </p> <p>Matic was brought back to Chelsea in 2014 by Mourinho, the manager he would later follow to United. He is asked whether the Portuguese lives up to his combative public persona. \u201cIt depends. If you win, he\u2019s the best guy ever. But if you lose, you\u2019re hiding from him at the training ground. But he\u2019s an amazing coach.\u201d</p> <p>Matic holds back only when discussing his surprise second departure from Stamford Bridge, where he won titles playing for Mourinho and Antonio Conte. \u201cI was very happy at Chelsea, but I thought it was the right moment to change club. There were reasons which are hard for me to say now. I will never forget my time there, but I\u2019m a Manchester United player now.\u201d</p> <p>Matic has high praise for his manager, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. \u201cOle is a great manager. I think he has improved a lot since he came to United, and he is different now. I\u2019m sure he has a great future here, and he will win us trophies.\u201d</p> <p>Another question flies in: who is his favourite teammate? Matic tackles it with trademark lack of fuss. \u201cThere is not one guy who is not a good person in our changing room. I\u2019m 31 now, and some of the players are 10 years younger than me. I speak more to players my own age, like Paul [Pogba], David [de Gea] and Juan [Mata], but I set next to Mason Greenwood in the dressing room, so we\u2019ve got to know each other too.\u201d</p> <p>Matic has also been impressed by United\u2019s new recruit, Bruno Fernandes. \u201cBecause I follow the Portuguese league, I knew he was good \u2013 even though he played for Sporting! But I\u2019m very surprised he adapted so quickly to the Premier League. He brings us a lot of qualities, like the confidence he has on the pitch \u2013 he always knows what he wants to do with the ball.\u201d</p> <p>Asked to name United\u2019s best player, Matic does not hesitate. \u201cWe have a lot of young players, but they have maybe not reached their top yet, but Marcus Rashford has the ability to be one of the best players in the world in his position. He\u2019s still improving, but he has everything to reach that top level.\u201d</p> <p>Matic\u2019s work ethic has taken him a long way. \u201cI wake up early. I never stay up late. Get up, train, eat, sleep. Even on holiday, by the end of the week I need to train. Football is my life; I take it very seriously. I\u2019ve felt like a professional player since I was five years old. I don\u2019t know how to be any different.\u201d</p> <p><em>Football Beyond Borders (FBB) uses the power of football to educate and inspire young people across the UK.

  "<p>Councils using emergency coronavirus powers to cut services for older and disabled people could be breaking the law, disability and civil liberties campaigners have warned.</p> <p>At least seven councils have taken advantage of rights under the Coronavirus Act not to carry out detailed assessments of people\u2019s care needs and to delay or reduce care provision, as they find themselves under pressure to divert resources to support the NHS by discharging patients.</p> <p>The civil rights campaign group Liberty has written to the councils requesting the full justifications for invoking the \u201ceasements\u201d of their care duties which it says are required by law.</p> <p>Warwickshire county council invoked the easements last month and warned care receivers that the care and support they received at the time \u201cmay not be provided in the future or may be provided in a different way\u201d.</p> <p>It said the changes may have \u201ca negative impact on some customers\u201d, but stressed it had not yet cut any services.</p> <p>Derbyshire county council said it had \u201csuspended, reduced or changed some non-essential home care services\u201d, while Solihull borough council has asked care recipients if their family or volunteers could help them instead.</p> <p>Sam Grant, Liberty\u2019s policy and campaigns manager, said: \u201cCouncils\u2019 actions not only risk being unlawful. If you are disabled or rely on social care, they could leave you without the most basic support.</p> <p>\u201cCouncils\u2019 actions pave the way for vital safeguards to be stripped away just when people have become even more vulnerable. As a bare minimum, councils must immediately demonstrate they have met the high standards set by the government before they begin relaxing care rules.\u201d</p> <p>Disability Rights UK said its helpline had received multiple calls from disabled people who had lost social care services since the start of the pandemic. It is one of the groups warning that the moves mean the most vulnerable may be the hardest hit by emergency efforts to protect the NHS.</p> <p>\u201cWe appreciate there are significant resource challenges for local authorities, against a backdrop of cuts over the last 10 years,\u201d said Kamran Mallick, the chief executive of Disability Rights UK. \u201cBut the pandemic, and changes to services, are having a massive impact.</p> <p>\u201cThe government needs to make sure disabled people don\u2019t become even harder hit because of the pandemic, and that councils have the money to deliver services which help disabled people stay independent.\u201d</p> <p>\ufeffStaffordshire county council said it had temporarily suspended needs assessments. Coventry city council has done the same and said it may also have to cut some services if staff numbers are further depleted and demand for other Covid-19 support rises.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Councils stressed they were acting proportionately and only changing care provision and arrangements for assessing citizens\u2019 needs where absolutely necessary.</p> <p>Warwickshire said a quarter of its staff had been sick or in self-isolation and that its resources had been stretched by the demand to help the NHS discharge people from hospitals.</p> <p>It said: \u201cIncreased levels of demand combined with the reduction in staff capacity available mean it is not possible to continue to meet the needs of all existing and new customers in line with normal practice under the Care Act.\u201d</p> <p>Birmingham city council said it has been reducing choice for service users \u2013 for example, of which care home to move into \u2013 but said this was because of \u201cthe level of pressure on the care provider sector at the moment, combined with the need to free up capacity in acute hospitals\u201d.</p> <p>Solihull borough council said: \u201cThe decision to exercise the care act easements has been taken to ensure the best possible provision of care for vulnerable adults with the capacity available while protecting staff and managers who are responsible for delivering that care. This also recognises the continued pressure that our care providers are experiencing because of coronavirus.\u201d</p> <p>Alan White, the deputy leader of Staffordshire county council, which temporarily suspended needs assessments, said: \u201cI think everybody recognises these are unprecedented times. I want to thank people for their understanding, and reassure them that we are doing everything in our powers to keep everyone, but particularly the most vulnerable, safe and well.\u201d</p> <p>But Liberty said: \u201cThe government and local councils should be working to shore up \u2013 not weaken - support for disabled people, their carers and those who rely on social care during this pandemic. We need to come through this crisis the right way \u2013 with all of our rights intact.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/02/bill-beaumont-beats-agustin-pichot-in-battle-for-control-of-world-rugby\">Bill Beaumont\u2019s re-election as World Rugby\u2019s chairman</a> was not an end but a new beginning. The former England captain faced several hurdles as a player, but nothing compared to what he faces in his final administrative stint. His narrow victory over Agust\u00edn Pichot shows there is a danger of the international game splitting unless the next few years spawn meaningful change and an end to self-interest.</p> <p>Beaumont was backed by the Six Nations while Pichot harvested the votes of the four Rugby Championship countries: had the former Argentina scrum-half persuaded one of the European unions to back him, he would have won. His failure gave the incumbent a majority of five, but Pichot did not secure enough votes from the countries and associations representing the nations below what is called tier one to bring what had been a stealthy campaign to a successful conclusion.</p> <p>There was little to choose between Beaumont and Pichot in terms of policies, but the Rugby Championship countries have become frustrated at the ability of their European rivals to thwart projects, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/19/world-rugby-nations-championship-rugby-union\">such as the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/19/world-rugby-nations-championship-rugby-union\">Nations </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/19/world-rugby-nations-championship-rugby-union\">Championship</a> which Beaumont floated last year only to see it torpedoed by Ireland and Scotland, although Pichot\u2019s Argentina ended up not voting for it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/05/rfu-government-bailout-england-summer-2021-coronavirus\">RFU will need government bailout if England do not play until summer 2021</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A central plank of Beaumont\u2019s campaign was an independent governance review, but even when he delivers it, there is no guarantee of its recommendations being approved. Some campaigning for Pichot argued only he could drag World Rugby into the professional era, failing to point out the governing body is like the United Nations where the major powers are armed with the weight of veto. Beaumont\u2019s diplomatic skills will be needed and he was the candidate best qualified to deliver change.</p> <p>The sports lawyer Darren Bailey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/30/rugby-needs-a-command-economy-ex-world-rugby-directors-remedy\">argued in last week\u2019s Breakdown</a> that the current crisis gave rugby the opportunity to address three faultlines that had bedevilled it since 1995: north versus south, club versus country and developed versus developing. For all the talk of the need for a global calendar and greater harmonisation between the hemispheres, nothing radical will happen until the primacy of international rugby is established in all countries, which means the systems in France and England mirroring the other eight championship nations.</p> <p>Few clubs in France and England are sustainable, as the last two months have shown, but they have used borrowing and the largesse of backers to tempt players from the southern hemisphere at salaries inflated to more than compensate for either putting a Test career on hold or ending it. The Sanzaar unions responded by expanding Super Rugby to entice more out of broadcasters and help them to compete financially, but they were never able to catch up and diluted what had been the premier tournament below Test level.</p> <p>Australia \u2013 a country that, unlike New Zealand and South Africa, does not have a strong base \u2013 overextended itself and had no slack when the virus led to sport shutting down. Its union is looking for a new chief executive and this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/06/rugby-australia-director-peter-wiggs-resigns\">appointed Rob Clarke</a>, who filled the role for the Brumbies and the Rebels, on an interim basis. \u201cThe game is facing some unprecedented challenges,\u201d he said before going off to find some answers.</p> <p>Australia, like the other southern hemisphere unions, cannot afford for the game to muddle on as before, driven not by a common goal or an executive with the authority to govern in the interest of the game rather than self-interest, but application of sticking plasters that are lacking in adhesive.</p> <p>\u201cThere is still a level of governance reform that is overdue,\u201d said New Zealand Rugby\u2019s chief executive, Brent Impey. \u201cIt would be good to see the courage taken to make the decisions needed to ensure the continued sustainability and success of rugby globally, not just for a limited number of unions and regions.\u201d</p> <p>The south will not, because they cannot afford to, endure another four years of muddle and fudge. The slickness of Pichot\u2019s campaign suggested it was not one that was hastily put together, and if Beaumont\u2019s governance review, which will be set up under the former sports minister Sir Hugh Robertson by the end of the month, comes to nothing the four Rugby Championship countries will have a choice to make: either carry on and let the Six Nations hold sway, or declare that if nothing changes they will no longer be bound by World Rugby\u2019s tour schedule.</p> <p>The ultimate threat would be to break away, but where would they go? They would be out of the World Cup and have no more Lions tours. If Europe continues to oppose the plan for a Nations Championship, something that would offer emerging nations a route to tournament rugby, and with it any form of revenue sharing, a meaningful tactic would be to pull out of the July and November Test windows and negotiate matches on an individual basis.</p> <p>They may be helped, in the short term at least, by the lack of liquidity of clubs in France and England. The upward curve of salaries will be checked and there will be a review of salary cap levels and, in England, the dispensation that allows two marquee players to be registered outside the cap with no limits on their wages.</p> <p>World Rugby has the opportunity to lead from the front, but Beaumont can do no more than advise and help formulate policies. A transformative plan such as the Nations Championship should not have its fate dependent on the unanimous assent of the Six Nations or Rugby Championship. It is the old amateur way of operating, for the benefit of the few.</p> <p>Those days are gone, as Beaumont appreciates every bit as much as Pichot. If the last couple of months have shown anything, it is that the game needs to expand globally. Its footprint is too small. That did not matter once, but it does now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p><em><strong>This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

But their mission, heavily covered in the press, was not to the moon, or into orbit, or even out of the state. The eight pioneers, part of a privately funded project called Biosphere 2, were to be locked in a 3.14-acre enclosed, self-sustaining structure for two whole years, on a mission to collect data and garner insights to aid Martian-style projects in mankind\u2019s (presumed) extraterrestrial future.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/22/circus-of-books-netflix-gay-porn-shop-documentary\">Circus of Books: behind a Netflix film about a mom-and-pop gay porn shop</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Documentarian Matt Wolf, whose new film Spaceship Earth chronicles the Biosphere 2 project from its counter-cultural origins to controversial legacy \u2013 was nine when the experiment began, and missed the substantial media attention at the time.

Biosphere 2, named as such because participants believed Earth to be Biosphere 1, featured a desert, a mangrove forest, a 9,000 square-foot ocean with its own coral reef, and a savannah grassland; its eight inhabitants were expected to cultivate their own food and drink, and to maintain livable atmospheric conditions of oxygen and carbon dioxide.</p> <p>Spaceship Earth reveals how this idealistic ambition \u2013 funded, in this case, by Ed Bass, a philanthropic billionaire from Texas oil money \u2013 stemmed from decades of challenging, idiosyncratic work by a counter-cultural group known as the Synergia Ranch. Wolf pieces together early footage of the so-called Synergists, founded in 1969 by ecologist and certified metallurgist John Allen in the height of San Francisco\u2019s hippy days. The Synergists, as the film\u2019s genuinely remarkable archival footage illustrates, thrived on the convivial and industrious energy of their collective, morphing from Jester-style theater to communal ranch to building their own ship (!) on which to sail around the world.</p> <p>Synergist projects ranged from theater to ecology to architecture and science, \u201cbut at the end of the day, they were experimental people, they were adventurers\u201d, said Wolf, who \u201cdefy the typical categories of hippies because they\u2019re counter-cultural people who identify as capitalists\u201d. Allen, in particular, cultivated powerful financial interests such as Bass to fund their increasingly ambitious, science-fiction inspired projects. (The name \u201cSpaceship Earth\u201d comes from the Buckminster Fuller book Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth, which partially inspired Biosphere 2, as well as the futurist ride at Disneyworld\u2019s Epcot theme park).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"58ef458ca919fae6a1045eaadd19d2ed8fa7ccc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58ef458ca919fae6a1045eaadd19d2ed8fa7ccc9/0_0_1996_1386/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"694\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In the mid-80s, when sustainability and the pressing threat of global warming were far from mainstream concepts, Synergists found in Bass a partner in their mission to build a self-sustaining, miniature world. (Wolf, who said he intended for the film to focus on the Biospherians and not later conflicts over management of the Biosphere, did not invite Bass to participate; he does, however, interview John Allen, who served as executive chairman of Biosphere 2 during the early 90s). The $200m-plus investigation into self-sufficiency recalled, Biospherians say in the film, the frontier explorers of the past.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very intoxicating, that kind of idealism and rhetoric,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cAnd it proved not to translate in the mainstream media context.\u201d Wolf incorporates news clips from the early 90s, which reveal a fixation on the project\u2019s utopian ideals and counter-cultural background. Several reports from the time presented a duality for the project \u2013 science or spectacle? \u2013 as if the project couldn\u2019t be both, or a harbinger of future scientific attention grabs such as Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX. One former researcher on the project called Biosphere 2, in an television interview, \u201ctrendy ecological entertainment\u201d (to prove the point, Wolf includes footage of two Biospherians mud wrestling before a crowd, peering through the glass with their home cameras).</p> <p>\u201cI think one of the fatal flaws of the project is that they called it an experiment, and that comes with the baggage of academic expectations for science,\u201d Wolf said. Biosphere 2, he believes, was \u201ca different kind of science, a whole-systems or total system approach\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/06/spaceship-earth-biosphere-2-documentary\">Spaceship Earth review \u2013 intriguing Biosphere 2 documentary lacks insight</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the time, the conversation around Biosphere 2\u2019s work was \u201clargely dismissive\u201d, said Wolf. \u201cThey had been dubbed failures and in most senses their life\u2019s work had been discounted.\u201d The fact that people often associated Biosphere 2 with the 1996 comedy Biodome with Paulie Shore, \u201cis in some senses a tragedy, given the scope and the ambition of this project\u201d. Still, \u201cwhat\u2019s appealing about Biosphere 2 is the spectacle and theatricality of it,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cThis is a futurist project, and that is outside the realm of traditional science.

(It goes without saying that a film primarily about eight people trapped, albeit voluntarily, in a confined space for months on end has some \u2026 parallels to spring 2020). \u201cThe takeover of Biosphere 2 is analogous to what you could call the takeover of Biosphere 1,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cWe live in a time in which the political powers that be are sabotaging our ability to live sustainably on the planet through insidious policies.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s environmental deregulation, the (pre-corona) booming fossil fuel industries, but also the American gospel of profit maximization, which the Synergists could only escape for so long. The group\u2019s goal to make economically and ecologically viable projects was \u201cnot economically sustainable\u201d, said Wolf, who sees Biosphere 2 as a \u201ccautionary tale\u201d of \u201cthis fantasy of industry and environmentalism coming together to protect our future\u201d.</p> <p>Cautionary tale and imperfect experiment it may be, Wolf said he still hopes viewers \u201cfeel inspired by a group of people who literally reimagined a world\u201d, and whose personal transformation in isolation \u201cwill be useful for viewers today who are now, like the Biospherians, quarantined\u201d.</p> <p>Biosphere 2 demonstrates that \u201cthe model of small groups coalescing around common goals is viable,\u201d said Wolf, but with a balance: \u201cAs we re-enter the world with a certain determination to take new approaches, there are limitations to that idealism because of pervasive forces of capitalism and politics.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Spaceship Earth is available on Hulu and to rent elsewhere from 8 May in the US with a UK date yet to be announced</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Rashid Khalidi\u2019s account of Jewish settlers\u2019 conquest of Palestine is informed and passionate. It pulls no punches in its critique of Jewish-Israeli policies (policies that have had wholehearted US support after 1967), but it also lays out the failings of the Palestinian leadership. Khalidi participated in this history as an activist scion of a leading Palestinian family: in Beirut during the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and as part of the Palestinian negotiating team prior to the 1995 Israeli-Palestinian peace accords. He slams Israel but his is also an elegy for the Palestinians, for their dispossession, for their failure to resist conquest. It is a relentless story of Jewish-Israeli bad faith, alongside one of Palestinian corruption and political short-sightedness.<br><br>Khalidi sets out his stall early on: the Palestine-Israel war was never one between two national movements contesting equally over the same land but was always a \u201csettler colonial conquest\u201d by Europe-based Zionists whose founding father, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/apr/05/antisemitic-attacks-hungary-israel\">Theodor Herzl</a>, laid bare the project to Khalidi\u2019s great-great-great uncle in 1899: Palestine\u2019s indigenous population did not matter and would anyway benefit from the modernising effects of Jewish \u201cpioneers\u201d, such as America with its westward Manifest Destiny. For Khalidi, Jewish settlers, aided by Britain from 1917, and by the US later on, colonised Palestine, creating and securing Israel through six \u201cwars\u201d:<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/01/arthur-balfour-declaration-100-years-of-suffering-britain-palestine-israel\"> the Balfour declaration</a> of 1917; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/27/guardian190-partition-palestine-alistair-cooke-1947\">1947 UN partition plan</a>; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/26/israel-resolution-242\">1967 UN security council resolution 242</a>; the 1982 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/on-the-middle-east/2013/jan/04/lebanon-israel-palestinians-thatcher-reagan\">Israeli invasion of Lebanon</a>; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/12/oslo-israel-reneged-colonial-palestine\">1993 Oslo peace accords</a>; and Israeli leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/sep/29/israel\">Ariel Sharon\u2019s Temple Mount visit </a>in 2000.<br><br>Palestinian leaders from elite notables in the 1930s to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/yasser-arafat\"> Yasser Arafat and PLO-Fatah</a> in the 60s to Hamas never successfully channelled the people\u2019s passion to resist. This is not to \u201cblame the victim\u201d. Khalidi points to the huge obstacles in the way: in Britain and later the US, Protestant Christians bought into this \u201ccolonial war\u201d to \u201ccivilise\u201d the native population. There is a useful tension here between colonial superstructure and the patriarchal hierarchy and cronyism underpinning Palestinian elite leadership. Central to Khalidi\u2019s study are the deceits of the Zionist/Israeli leadership but bubbling up through the text are key moments of resistance that demanded the insurgent organisation and charisma of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/aug/24/archive-1922-death-michael-collins\">Michael Collins</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/10/india\">Mahatma Gandhi</a>, or a Ho Chi Minh.

The Jews needed an \u201ciron wall\u201d of bayonets. British rule after the first world war supported settlement until 1939 when, on the eve of another global conflict, London changed tack to garner wider Arab support. The British defeated a widespread revolt by Palestinians in 1936, in which their elites emblematically fought among themselves as they did against external enemies. There was no Irish-style D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, no nascent branches of government, and no centralised military forces to outwit the British. Britain crushed Palestinian resistance, doing the Jewish state-builders\u2019 work for them. As Israel came into being in 1948, the Palestinian negotiator with the UN didn\u2019t even have a secretary. Many senior Israeli leaders came from America, knew the place, and spoke its language. In 1947, no senior Palestinian leader had lived in or visited the US.<br><br>Khalidi takes the reader through the long, hard years after 1948 when Israel (and neighbouring Arab states) screwed down the Palestinians. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/30/israel-six-day-war-film-censored-voices\">The six-day war</a>, as America struggled in Vietnam, was a hinge event, turning the US to Israel as its prime ally against Soviet-backed Arab regimes. While presidents such as Eisenhower and Kennedy were willing to stand up to Israel, after 1967 \u2013 except Bush Snr and secretary of state James Baker \u2013 the rest fell into line. Khalidi lays out remarkable exchanges between US and Israeli officials (including a thrusting young Benjamin Netanyahu) in which the US rolled over. <br><br>Palestinian resistance endured, helped by the law of unintended consequences: Israel\u2019s crushing of Egypt in 1967 boosted the PLO, while the 1982 Lebanon invasion prompted the 1987 intifada. Israel unintentionally resurrected Palestinian resistance by its heavy-handed actions. Arafat looms large in the book\u2019s final chapters, and not to his credit. He started as he meant to continue, by cheating in student elections as a young man in Cairo. The peace after 1993 brought Arafat into Israel, where it monitored and controlled him. Nothing changed. Fatah militants who had spent time in Israeli jails tortured Hamas detainees. The Greater Israel settlement project on the West Bank continued apace, Israel arguing that Palestinians neither wanted peace nor accepted Israel, a point Khalidi contests.<br><br>The Palestinians have belied David Ben Gurion\u2019s reputed comment that \u201cthe old will die and the young will forget\u201d. Short of another bout of ethnic cleansing, Israel is burdened with a resentful, growing, non-Jewish population. The solution is meaningful dialogue, but this requires political will.

  "<p>Twenty years ago this week, London began a journey into a political unknown. For the first time in history, its voters were asked to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/jun/27/londonpolitics\">directly elect a mayor</a>. Their answer was a twist of irony. They voted for the same man who, 15 years earlier, Margaret Thatcher had sacked as London\u2019s previous \u201cindirect\u201d leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/may/05/londonmayor.london2\">Ken Livingstone</a>, the former head of the Greater London council. They chose the devil they knew. Has the game been worth the candle?</p> <p>The origins of the reform lay in a report by the 1993 <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03003939708433851?journalCode=flgs20\">Commission for Local Democracy</a>, of which I was a member, which proposed elected mayors as a route to revitalising local participation in democracy. In 1995 we persuaded Tony Blair, then in opposition, that it would be a suitably radical departure for his new government. He was hesitant, but saw the proposal as a way to circumvent his opponents among old Labour\u2019s civic cliques. Despite the adamant opposition of his local government shadow, Frank Dobson, Blair put the idea into his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/may/08/londonmayor.uk\">1997 manifesto</a> and, in 1999, into legislation.</p> <p>Opponents of the proposal, however, forced Blair into a crucial concession. He should allow cities to decide in a local referendum if they wanted the change. The referendums were commandeered by the same local politicians that had most to lose from the reform, with the result that it was all but killed. A mere dozen cities voted for a mayor, but one that did overwhelmingly was London, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/aug/12/londonmayor.uk1\">72% in favour</a>. Elections were fixed for May 2000. Initially there was a burst of high-profile runners mooted, such as Richard Branson, Glenda Jackson, Alan Sugar and Jeffrey Archer.</p> <p>In the event, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/may/05/londonmayor.london3\">Livingstone ran as an independent and won</a>. He took to the job as to the manner born. He did not revert to his GLC leftwing anarchism, instead demonstrating the value of doing a job for a second time. He emphasised he was \u201cmayor for all London\u201d, eagerly met City and business leaders and moved from a modest office in Marsham Street to his glamorous <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2129199.stm\">Norman Foster-designed \u201cglass testicle\u201d</a> opposite the Tower of London.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/10/transport.transport\">Livingstone held down bus fares</a>, introduced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/feb/17/london.transport\">London congestion charge</a> and Oyster cards and prepared a new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/aug/25/london.devolution\">London Plan</a>, a concept long dormant. He even had a vision of sorts, albeit controversial, of London as \u201c<a href=\"https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/14812/1/14812.pdf\">Manhattan on Thames</a>\u201d. He loved tower blocks and raised no objection to Blair\u2019s eagerness to welcome what Peter Mandelson called the world\u2019s \u201cdisgustingly rich\u201d into the capital.</p> <p>The mayoralty was handicapped by serious flaws in the 1999 <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1999/29/contents\">Greater London Authority Act</a>, which curbed the powers of the mayor\u2019s new office. In the first place, the office had virtually nothing to run, at least compared with mayors abroad. Livingstone had no role in the capital\u2019s schools, colleges, social care, health service or housing provision. He had only a shared responsibility for the police \u2013 which meant no responsibility in practice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46bd69a39c08e78072a7a6f5229fa5bdf068ee3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46bd69a39c08e78072a7a6f5229fa5bdf068ee3d/0_59_3168_1901/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former London mayor Boris Johnson\u2019s victory over Ken Livingstone was remarkable.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former London mayor \u2018Boris Johnson\u2019s victory over Ken Livingstone was remarkable\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Lentati/Evening Standard/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One thing the mayor did run was public transport. In the case of Transport for London this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jul/24/transport.london\">immediately drew Livingstone into a fight</a> with Gordon Brown\u2019s determination that the Treasury privatise the London Tube. Livingstone and his American transport chief, Bob Kiley, won the argument but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/jul/27/governinglondon.londonpolitics\">lost the fight</a>. Anyone who believes in the superiority of central over local government in Britain should study this costly fiasco. It culminated in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/davehillblog/2010/may/18/london-london\">Tube\u2019s renationalisation by the Tories</a> within a decade. In a nutshell, the mayoralty was proving to be just the old GLC, indeed with the same boss.</p> <p>In retrospect, Livingstone\u2019s early term was probably the most effective of the London mayoralty so far. The decision of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/may/02/london08.london\">Boris Johnson to run for mayor in 2008</a> was bold. London at the time was firmly Labour and his victory over Livingstone was remarkable. Local democracy in Britain suffers from a charisma deficit, and Johnson seemed an ideal antidote.

  "<p> From Plato to Heidegger, philosophers have taken a dim view of the common people. That, however, began to change when the common people turned into a mass-reading public hungry for a little philosophy, under the delusion that the subject has something interesting to say about the meaning of life. A number of pop philosophers emerged to meet this demand, some of them admirable such as Simon Blackburn, others more like the slightly sozzled character you bump into in a bar who thinks the stars spell out some momentous statement. The line between the pop and the pub philosopher is easy to cross.</p> <p>One way of making things easier on your audience is to avoid a philosopher\u2019s ideas and talk about his or her life instead. Very few readers understand the synthetic a priori or the law of the excluded middle, but a lot of them know about falling in love or what it feels like to be miserable. It helps, however, if the life of the thinker in question is reasonably exciting. This was certainly the case with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/26/ludwig-wittgenstein-philosopher-profile\">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>, who fought in the first world war, had a number of illegal gay relationships, lived in a hut on a Norwegian fiord and had to do a runner as a village schoolmaster when he struck a pupil across the face.</p> <p>The problem with the American philosopher William James, founder of so-called pragmatism, is that his life, externally at least, was about as exciting as a slug\u2019s. He was born in New York in 1842, the brother of the novelist Henry James and the grandson of an Irishman from the small Ulster town of Ballyjamesduff, who emigrated to the US and made an enormous fortune from banking and real estate. As an academic psychologist, William spent most of his life teaching at Harvard, and in his later years was fascinated by ghosts, table-rapping and general spookery. He also discovered he could attain a kind of Nirvana with the help of laughing gas. As a celebrated public intellectual, he preached a number of standard liberal pieties, including respect for the individual and the sanctity of personal freedom.</p> <p>None of this was likely to set the Hudson on fire, so John Kaag has found various ways to liven up his subject. The first is to say as little about the intricacies of pragmatism as is decently possible. Popularly caricatured as the belief that truth is what works, it is more accurately a highly sophisticated creed for which truth is what, in the long run, makes a difference to the world. Kaag conveys something of this, while saying nothing at all about its notorious problems. He also tells us rather vacuously that \u201cpragmatism is about life and its amelioration\u201d and that its exponents study \u201clife\u2019s value and worth\u201d, adding the stunning revelation that \u201chuman thought (is) personal, continuous and changing\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'Rigorous' is the last adjective one would use to characterise this book</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a curious way, it is pragmatism itself that licenses Kaag\u2019s reluctance to delve into its subtleties. For if it is often described as the first distinctively American school of philosophy, it is partly because its critique of European rationalism can be made to merge into good old American anti-intellectualism. Kaag is all for the feel and taste of immediate experience, in contrast to some arid scheme of thought, and so is James; but in James\u2019s case this takes the form of a rigorous inquiry into truth and meaning, whereas \u201crigorous\u201d is the last adjective one would use to characterise this book. We are told, for example, that the philosopher Baruch Spinoza was an idealist (he was in fact a materialist) and that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/charles-darwin\">Darwin</a> taught that the weak shall perish, which is not what the doctrine of the survival of the fittest means.</p> <p>Kaag\u2019s cracker-barrel wisdom is occasionally punctuated by forays into his own biography, given that James\u2019s life fails to yield much drama. <em>Sick Souls,</em> <em>Healthy Minds</em> belongs to the American confessional genre, which runs all the way from Puritanism to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/20/norman-mailer-interview-1968\">Norman Mailer</a>. As befits the Me generation, it is as much about the author as his subject. James is sometimes no more than a convenient peg on which Kaag can hang his dishevelled thoughts about getting divorced, his predictably beautiful daughter, getting divorced again and so on. We learn that he has a beer at five o\u2019clock every day, that as a kid he was uncoordinated and stuttered badly, and that his daughter swallowed some amniotic fluid on the way out of the womb but quickly recovered. He even threatens us with a future book on bringing up a child as divorced parents. It isn\u2019t obvious quite what any of this has to do with, say, the pragmatist claim that truth can only be established retrospectively, or indeed with the life of James, but like many an autobiographer Kaag seems to assume that others will be as interested in the small change of his own existence as he is himself.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's no accident that Henry James is among the finest stylists of English language, given William\u2019s supple, graceful prose</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another way of peddling philosophy to the masses is to package it as spiritual therapy, for which there is a seemingly endless appetite. Hence the whimsical subtitle of this book: \u201cHow William James Can Save Your Life\u201d. In reality, Kaag has to admit that James didn\u2019t so much save his life as, rather less sensationally, save him from depression. He tells us how as a young man he felt life was meaningless, as indeed did James himself. In truth, for an East Coast Brahmin with a liberal father and without material worries, he was something of a psychological mess. As well as a Sartrean sense of nausea at the futility of existence, he suffered from partial blindness and was haunted by thoughts of suicide.</p> <p>Then, in a moment of enlightenment, James discovered that the world was not entirely governed by determinism and that there was something called free will. Like knowing where Sweden is, this is a discovery most of us have made without much sense of spiritual illumination. Kaag reads about his master\u2019s conversion and becomes equally life-affirming. There is a widespread prejudice in the Unites States that pessimism is somehow unpatriotic, along with the falsehood that you can be anything you like as long as you set your mind to it. In the end, James turns out to be exemplary of the power of positive thinking. The point of philosophy is to sort yourself out. \u201cWilliam James\u2019s entire philosophy, from beginning to end,\u201d Kaag writes, \u201cwas geared to save a life, <em>his</em> life.\u201d It is a typically imprecise claim.</p> <p>It is no accident that James\u2019s brother Henry is among the finest stylists of the English language, given William\u2019s own supple, graceful prose. Kaag\u2019s literary style is rather less elegant: \u201cNope\u201d, \u201cI sort of get it\u201d, \u201csure as hell\u201d, to \u201csweat a bunch\u201d and so on. But writing popularly doesn\u2019t mean you have to write badly. And being attuned to the nuances of everyday experience, as James taught us to be, doesn\u2019t mean you have to be suspicious of abstract ideas.

  "<p>The federal government will pay Aspen Medical \u2013 the company contracted to contain Covid-19 outbreaks at Newmarch House and on the Ruby Princess \u2013 more than $57m for Covid-19 outbreak response services.</p> \n<p>According to government tender listings, the Department of Health has agreed to pay the Canberra-based Aspen Medical $57,794,779 for services that include providing 35 surge staff to help contain the outbreak at the Newmarch House aged-care facility in Sydney, and for about 30 clinicians who helped screen and test Ruby Princess crew members stranded at Port Kembla in April.The two surge healthcare operations are now being examined by a New South Wales parliamentary inquiry.</p> \n<p>The contracts also include other services, including paying Aspen Medical to consult with the Australian Border Force over how to manage the Ruby Princess situation prior to its docking at Port Kembla, and to provide other testing and personal protective equipment.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/06/private-medical-staff-who-worked-on-ruby-princess-were-sent-into-newmarch-house\">Private medical staff who worked on Ruby Princess were sent into Newmarch House</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The value of the contracts also covers the rolling out of 100 pop-up respiratory clinics around the country that Aspen began working on in early April, however the exact cost of each Aspen service included in the government tenders \u2013 which extend to October \u2013 remains unclear.</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s contracts with Aspen Medical have prompted concern from the federal opposition. The topic was also raised during Thursday\u2019s session of the NSW parliamentary inquiry into the Covid-19 response following the Guardian\u2019s report that the operator sent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/06/private-medical-staff-who-worked-on-ruby-princess-were-sent-into-newmarch-house\">two of its clinicians who had boarded the Ruby Princess into Newmarch House just days later</a>.</p> \n<p>Aspen has said both of the staff tested negative to Covid-19 before their shift at Newmarch House on 25 April, and were \u201cexperienced clinicians with significant experience in infection control and were in full PPE at all times whilst at Newmarch House\u201d.</p> \n<p>The provider confirmed the movement of its staff between outbreaks on Wednesday \u2013 two days after it complied with a request to stand down a member of its surge staff in response to Newmarch\u2019s operator, Anglicare, accusing the carer of \u201cbreaches of the PPE [Personal Protective Equipment] protocol\u201d.</p> \n<p>In relation to the carer, Aspen has said it is waiting to receive an incident report from Anglicare about the PPE breaches, after which it will investigate the allegations internally and \u201cprovide our staff member with a fair and balanced hearing\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Guardian does not suggest that the two Aspen clinicians who worked on both the Ruby Princess and at Newmarch House breached any PPE protocol, nor that they were personally responsible for any further spread of the virus at the aged-care facility.</p> \n<figure

  "<p>The four words in this title are the four possible replies to bureaucratic tick-box questions about the frequency of your various sexual experiences. A young woman here must answer them, before she is allowed to have an abortion. However rigid and blandly routine it seems, the four-part answer grid is cleverly designed to get information about vulnerability: it is so easy instinctively and evasively to deny a difficult question structured as a yes/no, but much harder to check the \u201cnever\u201d box, when \u201crarely\u201d, \u201csometimes\u201d and \u201calways\u201d are coolly offered as equivalently non-judgmental options.</p> <p>The lead character in Eliza Hittman\u2019s tough, realist drama is confronted with this central, four-part inquisition about her life in one brilliantly controlled, enigmatic scene. Theoretically, it is just a bit of form-filling that doesn\u2019t appear to promise any real revelation to the audience. Yet it does just that, delivering a penny-drop moment of realisation. Or perhaps it\u2019s more of an ambiguous hint and all the more disquieting for that.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjw_QTKr2rc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hjw_QTKr2rc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The story is about a 17-year-old called Autumn, played by newcomer Sidney Flanigan, who is pregnant, and lives in a town in rural Pennsylvania where there is no question of being allowed a termination and no question of confiding in her family. After a tense encounter with an anti-abortion counsellor at her local clinic, Autumn gets help from her worldly-wise cousin, Skylar (Talia Ryder), who works alongside her at a supermarket checkout. Skylar scrapes the cash together so that she and Autumn can covertly get the bus together to New York where Autumn can get an abortion without anyone at home knowing. Their journey accumulates gradually in almost wordless tension and fear.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/06/sleazy-bosses-exploited-barmaids-us-cinema-finally-discovers-left-behinds-assistant-support-the-girls-women\">Sleazy bosses, exploited barmaids: US cinema finally discovers the left behinds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Never Rarely Sometimes Always is in some ways part of a tradition going back to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/12/midnight-cowboy-review-john-schlesinger-jon-voight-dustin-hoffman\">Midnight Cowboy</a>: the uncaring big-city bus station as the arena of poverty, vagrancy and the market forces of sexual exploitation. When Autumn and Skylar arrive in New York, absence of money is like an aura that pulses off them. You can feel the grit and chill of everything they touch as, without much of a clue, they ask for directions, and look like easy targets for predators. Hittman shrewdly emphasises the clumsy misery of Autumn having to pull her wheelie suitcase around the sidewalks, clunking up and down subway steps \u2013 all the discomfort of tourism and none of the pleasure. In fact, Autumn and Skylar have already been befriended on the bus by Jasper (Th\u00e9odore Pellerin), a boy who seems friendly enough, though it is Skylar who reveals herself as the most wised-up of the three of them.</p> <p>This narrative doesn\u2019t accentuate abortion as an issue in ways you might expect, and abortionists and abortion are not freighted with obvious meaning in the way they are in, say, Cristian Mungiu\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jan/11/worldcinema.drama\">4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days</a> or Mike Leigh\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/vera-drake\">Vera Drake</a> \u2013 movies set in very different eras, but perhaps not so different as all that, given the anti-abortion rhetoric so current in the US today. At first glance, the film it resembled for me is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/08/comedy.drama\">Juno</a>, the film from screenwriter Diablo Cody, about a teenage girl played by Ellen Page who gets pregnant with her very first sexual experience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39be1dfa26056d944ed66285f53fce426cc5a061\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39be1dfa26056d944ed66285f53fce426cc5a061/0_0_3095_1858/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Excruciating embarrassment \u2026 a revealing moment at the school concert.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Excruciating embarrassment \u2026 a revealing moment at the school concert.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angal Field/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That was a funny, articulate picture, but this is very different, and not merely because Juno does not, as it happens, want an abortion. Autumn has no intention of opening up to Skylar, or to us, about how she feels about being pregnant, or about a future in which she will no longer be pregnant, but in which all her existing problems will remain, having doubtless got worse. She remains almost impassive throughout, although there is a gripping opening scene at a school concert where she reveals her feelings in code by singing a version of the Exciters\u2019 60s hit He\u2019s Got the Power. Autumn is jeeringly heckled by a guy in the audience who knows the truth (or heard some gossip) and, in an atmosphere of excruciating embarrassment, Autumn has to finish the song as best she can.</p> <p>It is Skylar who saves Autumn, and their relationship is at the heart of the film; it develops enigmatically, and in near-silence. By the end, you can feel Skylar wanting Autumn to say something, anything \u2013 such as thank you, maybe. Hittman leaves Autumn\u2019s personal life opaque, and she discloses her own feelings in more singing: her desolate karaoke version of a Gerry and the Pacemakers song: \u201cThe night\u2019s the time for all your tears, / Your heart may be broken tonight, / But tomorrow in the morning light, / Don\u2019t let the sun catch you cryin\u2019\u2026\u201d Music is where the film\u2019s emotional meaning is unveiled. </p> <p>\u2022 Never Rarely Sometimes Always is available on digital platforms to buy from 13 May and to rent from 27 May.</p>",

  "<p><strong>I shared a flat and rental payments with my partner until March when the relationship ended and he moved out. The fully paid-up tenancy lasts until mid June and the notice period is two months, so if I don\u2019t want it to roll over, I need to give notice now. Due to social distancing rules, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to move house in June, but equally I can\u2019t afford to keep on paying the rent by myself. I have offered the landlord a reduced monthly rate between June and August, after which I will move out if lockdown is lifted. The landlord, a multi-national corporation, is adamant that I must pay the full market rate if I stay, even though they are unlikely to find a new tenant during the pandemic. I\u2019m faced with the prospect of having to move out while being uncertain as to how I\u2019m going to view, sign up to and move into somewhere new with the social distancing regulations in place.</strong></p> <p><em><strong>MD, London</strong></em></p> <p>There will be many couples in a similar position, especially as lockdown puts pressure on relationships. The government has urged landlords to compromise if their tenants\u2019 financial circumstances change during the pandemic, but this is guidance only and so there is no legal obligation on landlords to agree.</p> <p>Shelter housing adviser Andy Parnell suggests that you pay as much as you can with or without the landlord\u2019s agreement. \u201cIf the landlord doesn\u2019t agree to reduce the rent or to delay payments, the tenant should keep them updated on how much they can pay, and how they plan to make up the costs in the future,\u201d he says. \u201cThis could help persuade their landlord or letting agent to come to an agreement. And if the landlord considers eviction or takes legal steps to recover unpaid rent, the court involved may take the tenant\u2019s efforts to resolve the situation into consideration.\u201d</p> <p>You can\u2019t be evicted in June because when a fixed-term tenancy agreement comes to an end, the tenant usually still has the right to occupy the property under a periodic rolling tenancy without signing a new rental contract, until the landlord takes legal action to end it.</p> <p>\u201cThe tenant can end the rolling tenancy simply by serving written notice as required by their contract,\u201d says Parnell. \u201cIn contrast, the landlord usually has to serve written notice and then apply to court for a possession order and a bailiff warrant to evict them. Under the new coronavirus legislation, most landlords <a href=\"https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/coronavirus#Eviction\">now need to give three months\u2019 notice as a minimum</a> and, as court proceedings have been temporarily suspended, landlords won\u2019t be able to carry out evictions even when notices have expired.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk.

Some adapt to an anthropomorphised environment, in which different species cross that would not cross in the wild,\u201d he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>With deforestation and land-use change, you open a door</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Habitat destruction is an essential condition for the proliferation of a new virus, he added, but it is only one of several factors. Bats also need to pass the disease on to humans. There is no evidence of this being done directly for coronaviruses. Until now there has been an intermediary \u2013 either a domesticated animal or a wild animal which humans came into contact with for food, trade, pets or medicine. In the 2003 Sars outbreak in China, it was a civet cat. In the Mers outbreak in the Middle East in 2012, it was a camel. Scientists are not yet certain of the animal for Covid-19, though Frutos said initial theories that a pangolin was the intermediary now seem less likely.</p> \n<p>In a soon-to-be-published paper in <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2020.00223/full\">Frontiers in Medicine</a>, Frutos and his co-authors argue the key to containing future epidemics is not to fear the wild, but to recognise that human activities are responsible for the emergence and propagation of the zoonosis. \u201cThe focus must be on these human activities because they can be properly organised,\u201d notes the paper titled, the Conjunction of Events Leading to the Pandemic and Lessons to Learn for Future Threats.</p> \n<p>Scientists have detected about 3,200 different strains of coronavirus in bats. Most are harmless to humans, but two very closely related sarbecoviruses found in east Asia were responsible for Sars and Covid-19. The paper says future sarbecovirus emergence will certainly take place in east Asia, but epidemics of other new diseases could be triggered elsewhere.</p> \n<p>South America is a key area of concern due to the rapid clearance of the Amazon and other forests. Scientists in Brazil have found viral prevalence was 9.3% among bats near deforested sites, compared to 3.7% in pristine woodland. \u201cWith deforestation and land-use change, you open a door,\u201d said Alessandra Nava, of the Manaus-based Biobank research centre.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5051874133066b8a1e2898f5231c456d8233c3fd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5051874133066b8a1e2898f5231c456d8233c3fd/7_0_1639_2048/800.jpg\" alt=\"Civet cat in a cage\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The virus that caused the 2003 Sars outbreak in China came from bats via a civet cat.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Hilton/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>She said diseases were naturally diluted in the wild, but this broke down when humans rapidly disrupted the ecological balance. As a local example, she pointed to Lyme disease, which has spread to humans through capybaras. Some municipalities are culling the giant rodents to prevent contagion, but Nava said this was not necessary in pristine forests that still had jaguars. \u201cYou don\u2019t find Lyme disease in areas with jaguars because they keep the capybara numbers in check,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe problem is when you put different species that aren\u2019t naturally close to one another in the same environment. That allows virus mutations to jump to other species,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to think about how we treat wild animals and nature. Right now we deal with them far too promiscuously.\u201d</p> \n<p>Her conclusions were echoed by Tierra Smiley Evans, an epidemiologist at the University of California who studies virus distributions in the rapidly degrading forests of Myanmar. She has found that endangered or threatened species are more likely to have viruses than animals at lower risk of habitat loss and hunting. She said the connection between environmental stress and human health had been made more apparent by Covid-19 pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that one of the most positive things to come out of horrible tragedy will be the realisation that there is a link between how we treat the forest and our wellbeing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really impacts our health. It is not just a wildlife issue or an environmental issue.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/brazil-coronavirus-deaths-covid-19-bolsonaro\">Brazil: largest rise in Covid-19 deaths follows Bolsonaro 'worst is over' claim</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>To prevent future pandemics, the academics said international cooperation was needed to encourage monitoring and education at a local level so that virus outbreaks could be detected and contained at an early stage. Although this would be expensive, they said it would more economically efficient than waiting for an outbreak to become a pandemic, which forces the world into lockdown.</p> \n<p>They also emphasised that bat culls and bans on wet markets were likely to be ineffective and could prove counterproductive because bats play an important role in insect control and plant pollination. \u201cLiving safely with bats is what we should be focusing on, not eliminating them,\u201d Evans said.</p> \n<p>Conservation groups have also urged greater protection of existing habitats. A recent Greenpeace <a href=\"https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2020/04/24/deforestation-amazon-next-pandemic-covid-coronavirus/\">report </a>warned the Amazon could see the next spillover of zoonotic viruses because the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, is putting a higher priority on opening up the forest than protecting people\u2019s health.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s unforgivable. His appetite for destruction is fuelling the current health crisis and will make future crises we face even worse,\u201d Daniela Montalto, Greenpeace forests campaigner, said. \u201cHe must be stopped and forest protection prioritised. Without it, we will all pay the price.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Victory in Europe was made possible by a remarkable military collaboration between the main anti-Axis powers \u2013 the US, Russia and Britain. But the three-way relationship, between Franklin D Roosevelt, Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill, was never easy, and it set a pattern of national rivalry, suspicion, fear and distrust that persists to this day.</p> <p>A row over a top-secret message, known as SCAF-252, sent to Stalin in late March 1945 by Gen Dwight Eisenhower, the supreme allied commander, shows how <a href=\"http://www.stalkerzone.org/unconditional-surrender-west-cant-forgive-red-armys-capture-berlin/\">fraught the relationship could be</a>. In it, Eisenhower detailed his plans for the final defeat of Nazi Germany \u2013 but omitted to first consult or inform his British allies.</p> <p>Stalin was determined the Red Army would be the first to get to Berlin and topple Adolf Hitler, attaching great symbolic importance to capturing the capital of the Third Reich and its implications for the future European order. Churchill took a similar view, but Eisenhower and a distracted, ailing FDR were not thinking politically.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/ve-day-churchill-feared-de-gaulle-would-declare-victory-early\">VE Day: Churchill feared De Gaulle would declare victory early</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stalin, replying to the SCAF-252 signal on 1 April, encouraged the Americans\u2019 belief, which he did not share, that Hitler would make a last-ditch stand in the Alps in May. He approved Eisenhower\u2019s plan to send US forces south, away from Berlin, telling his trusting ally that \u201cBerlin has lost its former strategic importance\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, he secretly ordered Marshal Georgy Zhukov, his top commander, to immediately encircle the city with 2.5 million troops to ensure the Americans and British did not enter, and to launch an assault \u201cno later than 16 April\u201d. As the historian <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/second-world-war/1945-the-race-for-berlin/\">Antony Beevor has noted</a>, \u201cit was the greatest April Fool in modern history\u201d.</p> <p>The British, in particular Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, were furious at being bypassed. Churchill worried, rightly as it turned out, that Stalin was intent on bringing as much of Europe as possible under Soviet communist rule, and was already breaking his Yalta conference pledge to respect Poland\u2019s independence.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no doubt that he [Eisenhower] is a most attractive personality and at the same time [has] a very, very limited brain from a strategic point of view,\u201d snarled Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, quoted by Beevor in his 2002 book, Berlin: The Downfall 1945. But Churchill could only fume impotently.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0515355b0a4bfa5a689b1ce75191cf70df96a316\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0515355b0a4bfa5a689b1ce75191cf70df96a316/0_292_3476_2087/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street fighting in Berlin during the battle to gain control of the German capital in April 1945\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Street fighting in Berlin during the battle to gain control of the German capital in April 1945.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAlthough I have tried in every way to put myself in sympathy with these communist leaders, I cannot feel the slightest trust or confidence in them. Force and facts are their only realities,\u201d Churchill said. By 8 May, Berlin had fallen to the Red Army, Hitler was dead, and Stalin had his victory.</p> <p>Tensions between the emerging US superpower and a weakened, indebted Britain clinging to its empire, continued through the postwar period. As the author Robert Worth has argued, the idea that Britain was happily content to pass the baton of global leadership to Washington after 1945 is a myth. \u201cThe British did all they could to maintain their overseas empire and deeply resented American efforts to displace them,\u201d Worth wrote.</p> <p>The Americans opposed British colonialism. But, the British said, the US merely replaced it with a de facto colonialism of their own. This rivalry produced <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/10/24/end-show-britain-united-states-middle-east/\">myriad overt and covert tussles for power and influence</a>, particularly in the Middle East.</p> <p>The US, for example, initially backed Iran\u2019s nationalist prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, who, during a 1951 US speaking tour, likened himself to a patriot from the American war of independence fighting British imperialism. Washington, fearful Iran might turn communist, changed tack two years later and backed a British coup plot against Mosaddegh that led ultimately to the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p> <p>In another cloak-and-dagger episode, an American spy masquerading as a foreign correspondent attempted to recruit Egypt\u2019s King Farouk, a British client. The mission was known within the CIA as Operation Fat Fucker. Farouk was later overthrown in a 1952 coup led by Gamal Abdel Nasser, whom US agents had befriended, which, in turn, led to Britain\u2019s 1956 Suez humiliation.</p> <p>Churchill hated Britain\u2019s new-found subservience, but urged his successors to stick to his maxim: \u201cNever be separated from the Americans\u201d. To a large degree, they have. With the exception of Harold Wilson, who broke with Washington over the Vietnam war, later British prime ministers have followed America\u2019s lead on most international issues.</p> <p>And concerning relations with Russia, British and US policy became largely indistinguishable during the cold war. Stalin\u2019s fear in 1945 that western powers would cut a \u201csecret deal\u201d and unite to oppose the Soviet Union came true, exemplified in later years by a Nato alliance that included West Germany.</p> <p>Today\u2019s world bears some uncanny similarities to the world of 1945. Post-Soviet Russia under Vladimir Putin is again on the offensive, employing asymmetrical means such as info-wars and cyberhacks instead of armoured divisions to project its influence across Europe.</p> <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s post-Brexit Britain, having rejected the concept of a common European home, stands alone in ways not seen since 1940. Brexiters\u2019 calls for a stronger US security, economic and trade relationship, to offset the EU rupture, are the modern-day equivalent of Churchill\u2019s desperate \u201cdarkest hour\u201d appeals for Roosevelt\u2019s help.</p> <p>As for the US, Donald Trump\u2019s collusion with Putin\u2019s Russia, and disdain for America\u2019s European allies, is reminiscent of Roosevelt\u2019s and Eisenhower\u2019s naivety in 1945. Not for nothing is Stalin one of Putin\u2019s great heroes.</p>",

She lodged no other defence.</p> <p>Her lawyers argued the defamation was on the lower end of the spectrum due to the limited audience in the group, and that it was deleted in March last year.</p> <p>The NSW district court on Thursday <a href=\"https://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/decision/5ea66751e4b0f66047ed8d74\">ordered Voigt</a> to pay Goldberg $35,000 in damages for the post.</p> <p>In his judgment, district court judge Richard Weinstein said it was on the lower end of damage to Goldberg\u2019s reputation.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough the imputations are serious, it is clear from the evidence that the number of people who have likely viewed the post (it having been removed on or about 7 March 2019) is limited, and very much less than had it, for example, been published on a newspaper website,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Goldberg was ordered to pay Voigt $8,000 in costs for a separate matter.</p> <p>Goldberg said he was still considering the judgement in detail.</p> <p>Voigt said she was also considering the judgment, but said defamation law needed to change.</p> <p>\u201cI think the judge was very fair.

  "<p>Film-makers like it when critics use the word \u201crestrained\u201d to describe their work because it implies an intellectual rigour mostly absent in the excessive spectacles of mainstream cinema. Audiences who are looking for something more substantial like it too, for the same reasons. So for what it\u2019s worth, let me say this right off the bat: director Ben Lawrence\u2019s Sydney-set drama Hearts and Bones, which revolves around the relationship between a war photographer and a South Sudanese refugee, is certainly restrained.</p> <p>It is a human-oriented drama that builds a thoughtful and contemplative space, empathising with characters grappling with difficult circumstances outside the common experience. It is also the kind of drama you sometimes want to grab and shake to life. Get the lens a little dirty; knock the camera around a bit; bring a sense of urgency to the edit; get the script (by Lawrence and Beatrix Christian) to draw bold conclusions to the ethical questions it raises rather than pussyfoot around with vague ruminative responses.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/28/desperately-seeking-susan-and-she-devil-absurd-80s-comedies-ripe-for-redemption\">Desperately Seeking Susan and She-Devil: absurd 80s comedies ripe for redemption</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One thing you never want to mess with is the performances. The protagonist is played by Hugo Weaving, an actor who expresses pathos as if it were a weight constantly pulling him down. The most intense moments in Weaving\u2019s performances, in this film and more generally speaking, tend to occur when he feigns losing control; when the performer\u2019s trademark stoicism gives away to a volcanic inner force.</p> <p>Weaving plays Dan Fisher, a famous photographer who suffers panic attacks in increasing frequency. This is partly to do with angst concerning his pregnant partner Josie \u2013 played by an affecting Hayley McElhinney, whose performance balances assurance with tenderness. The nature of Dan\u2019s trepidation towards their impending baby is best left for the film to disclose. Mostly, however, his PTSD-like panic attacks connect to terrible things he has seen during wartime, one of which we witness in the film\u2019s opening moments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4388653eb77f2a9a7da5c38fb0f826fee0a452a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4388653eb77f2a9a7da5c38fb0f826fee0a452a5/0_0_3543_2363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"two men playing instruments\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ahead of an upcoming exhibition, a South Sudanese cab driver arrives on Dan\u2019s door with a special request.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Madman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That moment, which involves Dan prioritising the duties of being a photographer over intervening in a dangerous situation and potentially saving a life, casts a pall that hangs over the rest of the film. Yet it remains unexplored: just left there, hanging, as a way to make the point that the protagonist Has Seen Things. By the end of it we have no idea whether Dan subscribes to the bogus, outdated idea that a professional photographer (or documentarian) should never interact with the environment around them, but only capture it. That used to be a badge of honour certain photographers wore, as if <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/images-of-suffering-can-bring-about-change-but-are-they-ethical-100809\">capturing suffering</a> were a more noble pursuit than helping another human in front of them.</p> <p>Ahead of an upcoming exhibition, Dan is approached by a South Sudanese cab driver, Sebastian (Andrew Luri), who arrives on his door with a special request: that Dan photograph an African community choir he belongs to. My first thought was that this would lead to the broken Dan becoming whole again by belting out a few uplifting songs with the choristers. But Sebastian has an ulterior motive: he doesn\u2019t want Dan to exhibit photographs of a massacre at the village where he lived 15 years ago. He has his own reasons for this, which are explored over the course of the running time and are points of tension between the two characters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15b1085902fbef50390fabd63d3f3d04d11b8ac0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15b1085902fbef50390fabd63d3f3d04d11b8ac0/575_0_1429_858/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seb and Dan looking at photos in dim light\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An ulterior motive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Madman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of the drama involves dealing with deep-seated emotional wounds and growing tensions between the two men. Newcomer Andrew Luri is terrific opposite Weaving, more than holding his own against the seasoned veteran. Luri plays Sebastian as a determined but deeply conflicted man whose solutions often exacerbate his problems. Every once in a while he responds to a stressful situation with violence, creating a sense of untrustworthiness that agitates an otherwise pleasant demeanour. At times you want to give him a hug; at times you want to stay well clear of him.</p> <p>The tone, temperament and pacing of Hearts and Bones is certainly consistent, though visually there is nothing particularly rich or cinematic about it. Lawrence and his cinematographer Hugh Miller conjured a more interesting, and much moodier look in the director\u2019s previous film, Ghosthunter, an atmospheric documentary investigating a Sydney security guard who claims to chase spirits in his spare time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/03/from-hannah-gadsbys-douglas-to-the-great-whats-new-to-streaming-in-australia-in-may\">From Hannah Gadsby's Douglas to The Great: what's new to streaming in Australia in May</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ghosthunter similarly explores themes of long-standing trauma, and the inability for any of us to escape our past. Both of Lawrence\u2019s films ruminate on one of the greatest lines uttered so far in 21st century cinema, spoken by, of all people, the protagonist of the 2009 family film Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs: \u201cYou can\u2019t run away from your own feet.\u201d</p> <p>It took deep thought to come up with a line like that, and terrific efficiency to distill such profound sentiments into so few words. Hearts and Bones makes profound statements also but is not a work of narrative economy, that\u2019s for sure. Dramatically, it has a vague, lingering quality, at times meditative (another critic-deployed word film-makers tend to like) and sometimes a little inert. On the plus side, the performances are very strong and have plenty of space to breathe.

There was concern the findings would prejudice a jury, so they were withheld. Pell was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/07/cardinal-george-pell-conviction-quashed-australia-high-court-freed-jail-appeal-upheld\">acquitted in April of child sexual abuse charges</a> and released from jail, clearing the way for the report to be made public.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/apr/01/nowhere-to-hide-abuse-survivors-praise-commission-shaking-institutions\">'They had nowhere to hide': abuse survivors praise commission for shaking institutions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia\u2019s royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse heard disturbing details about Gerald Ridsdale\u2019s offending and the response of the Catholic church to it. In 2015, before the Ballarat town hall, the commission heard evidence that suggested Pell was involved in the decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/19/child-sex-abuse-and-its-legacy-of-suicide-like-an-unseen-cancer-in-ballarat\">move Ridsdale</a> between parishes once the abuse came to light, including parishes in Mildura, Swan Hill, Warrnambool, Apollo Bay, Ballarat and Mortlake. Pell has always denied this, or any knowledge of children being abused in Ballarat including by Ridsdale.</p> <p>But the royal commission found: \u201cWe are satisfied that in 1973 Father Pell turned his mind to the prudence of Ridsdale taking boys on overnight camps\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe most likely reason for this, as Cardinal Pell acknowledged, was the possibility that if priests were one-on-one with a child then they could sexually abuse a child or at least provoke gossip about such a prospect. By this time, child sexual abuse was on his radar, in relation to not only Monsignor Day but also Ridsdale. We are also satisfied that by 1973 Cardinal Pell was not only conscious of child sexual abuse by clergy but that he also had considered measures of avoiding situations which might provoke gossip about it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We do not accept that Bishop Pell was deceived, intentionally or otherwise</p> <footer> <cite>Royal commission finding</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gerald Ridsdale committed more than 130 offences against children as young as four between the 1960s and 1980s, including while working as a school chaplain at St Alipius boys\u2019 school in Ballarat. He is now in prison. He is charged with additional historical sexual abuse offences frequently, <a href=\"https://www.standard.net.au/story/6736726/ridsdales-lawyer-says-paedophile-doesnt-deserve-more-jail-over-new-charges/\">as recently as April</a>. He is believed to have offended hundreds of times against children.</p> <p>Pell, who supported Ridsdale during his first court appearance for child sex offences in 1993, has always denied knowing of any child abuse occurring in Ballarat while he worked there as a priest and with a clerical group called the College of Consultors during the 1970s and 1980s. Pell also spent time living with Gerald Ridsdale in 1973, but has said he had no idea he was a paedophile.</p> <p>The commission has previously heard Pell was involved in a College of Consultors decision to move Ridsdale from the Mortlake parish in Ballarat to Sydney in 1982. Evidence from the hearings has revealed priests and clergy staff accused of abusing children within the archdiocese of Melbourne were sometimes \u201cdealt with\u201d by the church by transferring them to other parishes. Pell said senior figures around him deceived him about the extent of abuse within the Catholic church.</p> <p>But the commission found:<strong> \u201c</strong>We are satisfied that Cardinal Pell\u2019s evidence as to the reasons that the CEO deceived him was implausible. We do not accept that Bishop Pell was deceived, intentionally or otherwise\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is implausible given the matters set out above that Bishop [Ronald] Mulkearns did not inform those at the meeting of at least complaints of sexual abuse of children having been made.\u201d</p> <p>Pell had also told the commission that investigating paedophile priest Peter Searson was not his responsibility because he believed the Catholic Education Office and Mulkearns were handling the allegations. Pell gave evidence that he was handed a list of incidents and grievances about Searson in 1989, which included reports Searson had abused animals in front of children and was using children\u2019s toilets. But Pell said this was not enough information for him to act.</p> <p>Searson died in 2009 without facing charges. The commission has previously heard he abused children in parishes and schools across three districts over more than a decade, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/25/no-one-listened-to-hundreds-of-complaints-about-priest-says-principal\">displayed strange behaviours such as animal cruelty and carrying a gun to school</a>.</p> <p>The commission found<strong> \u201c</strong>these matters, in combination with the prior allegation of sexual misconduct, ought to have indicated to Bishop Pell that Father Searson needed to be stood down\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt was incumbent on Bishop Pell, as an auxiliary bishop with responsibilities for the welfare of the children in the Catholic community of his region, to take such action as he could to advocate that Father Searson be removed or suspended or, at least, that a thorough investigation be undertaken of the allegations,\u201d the previously redacted findings said.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the same responsibility that attached to other auxiliary bishops and the vicar general when they received complaints. On the basis of what was known to Bishop Pell in 1989, we found that it ought to have been obvious to him at the time. We found that he should have advised the archbishop to remove Father Searson and he did not do so.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the findings around Pell and Searson were already public. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/31/cardinal-pell-evidence-abusive-priest-searson-royal-commission-counsel\">The commission previously found</a> Pell had the capacity and opportunity to urge the Archbishop to take action against Searson in order to protect the children of the parish and the Catholic community of his region.</p> <p>Pell\u2019s evidence was that he could not recall recommending a particular course of action to the then Bishop Mulkearns. During the commission\u2019s hearings Pell conceded that, in retrospect, he might have been \u2018a bit more pushy\u2019 with all of the parties involved.</p> <p>\u201cWe do not accept any qualification that this conclusion is only appreciable in retrospect,\u201d the commission found.</p> <p>Pell told the commission during a separate appearance in 2014 that he originally took comments about the extent of abuse within the church from victims\u2019 rights groups \u201cwith a grain of salt\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/church-response-to-melbourne-victims-of-child-sexual-abuse-a-betrayal\">Facing questions via videolink in Rome</a> about the Melbourne Response, a scheme he introduced to the Catholic archdiocese of Melbourne in 1996 when he was Archbishop of Melbourne to investigate sexual abuse claims. He introduced the scheme in 1996 because dozens of sexual abuse complaints had come to the attention of the church, putting it under great pressure, he said.</p> <p>To date, not one person has been convicted in Australia for the crime of concealment of child sexual abuse. NSW and Victoria have a concealment offence specifically related to child abuse, and in 2019 Tasmania and ACT embedded a general duty in criminal law to report child sexual abuse offences.</p>",

And many out-of-work employees are not yet fully reflected in state and national unemployment rates. As the economic impacts trickle down, local governments will face tough budget decisions. </p> \n  <p>California has already distributed $10.6 billion in aide to workers \u2014 $2 billion just since Sunday, Newsom said. </p> \n  <p>But some relief could be around the corner. Expected Thursday are clearer guidelines on which businesses will be allowed to open \u2014 and how they\u2019re expected to operate \u2014 as the state enters phase 2 of its plan to reopen. The next phase will see florists, book stores, retailers reopen for curbside pick up. Reopening will be guided by data, Newsom said, and health and safety guidelines will continue to be a priority. </p> \n  <p>Meantime, Newsom reported 95 Californians died in the past 24 hours \u2014 numbers that have ticked up, even while hospitalizations and ICU admissions have improved modestly.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI have all the confidence in the world we\u2019ll recover and be a stronger, smarter society and a more resilient state. But it will take a while. The next few years, we\u2019ll have to work through these challenges.
