  "<p>Over the weekend, Black Lives Matter protests brought thousands on to the streets campaigning for an end to Aboriginal deaths in custody.</p> <p>Many signs at rallies referred to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/deaths-in-our-backyard-432-indigenous-australians-have-died-in-custody-since-2008\">the 432 deaths that are known to have happened</a> since the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody delivered its final report in 1991.</p> <p>That figure is based on Guardian Australia\u2019s findings from a two-year long project to monitor Aboriginal deaths in custody, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/28/deaths-inside-indigenous-australian-deaths-in-custody\">Deaths Inside</a>.</p> <p>We updated the database and published new results on Saturday. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/06/aboriginal-deaths-in-custody-434-have-died-since-1991-new-data-shows\">We found the number had risen to 434.</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/06/aboriginal-deaths-in-custody-434-have-died-since-1991-new-data-shows\">Aboriginal deaths in custody: 434 have died since 1991, new data shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But by Saturday morning even that number was already out of date. Just before marches began in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/06/australian-black-lives-matter-protests-tens-of-thousands-demand-end-to-indigenous-deaths-in-custody\">Melbourne, </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/06/australian-black-lives-matter-protests-tens-of-thousands-demand-end-to-indigenous-deaths-in-custody\"> Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and towns around the country</a>, the department of corrective services in Western Australia confirmed that a 40-year-old Aboriginal man had died in custody at Acacia prison, near Perth.</p> <p>As of Monday, based on reports that have reached us from families and other sources, including coronial reports, we can say that number is now at least 437.</p> <p>Our methodology is explained in full in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/28/deaths-inside-indigenous-australian-deaths-in-custody\">\u201cabout this project\u201d section of Deaths Inside</a>, but we wanted to address the most common questions here.</p> <h2>Why did the Guardian do this project?</h2> <p>We set out to examine what had changed since the royal commission produced its landmark report. We found that little had. People were still dying in the same way, from the same unequal policing, and investigated by coroners who made the same recommendations.</p> <p>Every square in the database is a person and their family, left to navigate a long, complicated and traumatising coronial process. We wanted to tell you the individual stories of each case because the picture they paint, square by square, is so horrifying that many Australians refuse to look at it.</p> <p>When we began this project in late 2017, it was impossible to find up-to-date figures. There was no publicly available, searchable database that acknowledged deaths in custody, even though monitoring was one of the 339 recommendations of the 1991 royal commission. That work is carried out by the Australian Institute of Criminology but its reports are subject to long delays and can be at least four years out of date.</p> <p>Information about deaths that had not yet been subject to an inquest was also hard to find. Prisons often only provided confirmation of a death in custody if requested, meaning that many deaths went unreported.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/28/deaths-inside-indigenous-australian-deaths-in-custody\">Deaths inside: every Indigenous death in custody since 2008 tracked \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And despite evidence in some cases of excessive force or neglect by police or prison officers, there has never been a criminal conviction for a death in custody in Australia. Chris Hurley, the police officer accused of killing Mulrunji Doomadgee on Palm Island in 2004, was acquitted of manslaughter.</p> <p>Two police officers are currently facing murder charges for the deaths of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/13/yuendumu-shooting-nt-policeman-charged-with-over-death-of-indigenous-man\">Kumanjayi Walker in the Northern Territory</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/20/geraldton-shooting-police-officer-arrested-over-death-of-indigenous-woman\">Joyce Clarke in Western Australia</a>, and both have indicated they will plead not guilty.</p> <h2>How did the Guardian arrive at the data?</h2> <p>Deaths Inside lists every Indigenous death in custody we are aware of from 2008 onwards. Where possible the source is a coronial report, but some 20 cases in the database are still awaiting coronal findings. For those cases we have a mix of primary sources, such as statements from police or corrections departments, interviews with family members, lawyers and media reports.</p> <p>To date we have read more than 460 coronial reports, including more than 300 reports on the deaths of non-Indigenous people who died from 2010 to 2015. That five years of non-Indigenous data was used as the basis of a comparative analysis. All reports were tracked across 20 data points.</p> <p>A comparison of case characteristics for Indigenous and non-Indigenous deaths in custody using this data is shown here:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/1591398757562-chart-barGroup.html\" data-alt=\"chart1\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/1591398757562-chart-barGroup.html\">chart1</a> <figcaption>Deaths in custody: case characteristics by Indigenous status, 2010-2015</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Don\u2019t non-Indigenous people die in custody in greater numbers?</h2> <p>That was always the case and never the point.</p> <p>The key finding of the royal commission was that Aboriginal people are more likely to die in custody because they are arrested and jailed at disproportionate rates. That remains as true in 2020 as it was in 1991.</p> <p>One key figure has changed. In 1991, <a href=\"https://aic.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/archive/downloads/npc1991.pdf\">14.3% of the male prison population</a> in Australia was Indigenous. In <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/4512.0March%20Quarter%202020?OpenDocument\">March 2020 it was 28.6%</a>.</p> <p>According to data released by Australian Bureau of Statistics this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2020/jun/07/no-australia-is-not-the-us-our-shocking-racial-injustice-is-all-our-own\">4.7% of all Indigenous men are in jail compared with just 0.3% of all non-Indigenous men</a>.</p> <p>Then, as now, non-Indigenous people died in greater numbers, and at a greater rate, in custody than Indigenous people. But then, as now, Indigenous people made up just 3% of the total population. That means more Aboriginal people are imprisoned and dying as a proportion of their total population.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2020/jun/07/no-australia-is-not-the-us-our-shocking-racial-injustice-is-all-our-own\">No, Australia is not the US. Our shocking racial injustice is all our own | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe conclusions are clear,\u201d royal commissioner Elliott Johnston QC wrote in 1991. \u201cAboriginal people die in custody at a rate relative to the proportion of the whole population which is totally unacceptable and which would not be tolerated if it occurred in the non-Aboriginal community.</p> <p>\u201cBut this occurs \u2026 because the Aboriginal population is grossly over-represented in custody. Too many Aboriginal people are in custody too often.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty-nine years after the royal commission, the coroner investigating the death of Yorta Yorta woman Tanya Day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/09/tanya-day-inquest-coroner-refers-death-custody-aboriginal-woman-public-prosecutor\">found that</a> \u201cMs Day\u2019s death was clearly preventable had she not been arrested and taken into custody.\u201d</p> <p>Day was not in custody because she was a threat to the community, or because she had been sentenced for committing a crime. Police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/31/tanya-day-inquest-how-police-responded-to-questions-about-the-role-of-racism-in-her-death\">couldn\u2019t even say by what authority they held Day for four hours</a> after issuing her an infringement notice for being drunk in public \u2013 an instrument which replaces the need to arrest and charge.</p> <p>Coroner Caitlin English said the inquest examined \u201chow it was Ms Day was taken into police custody for her safety and ended up dying from an injury which occurred in custody\u201d.</p> <p>Day was not the only one. Wiradjuri woman Rebecca Maher, Broome woman Maureen Mandijarra, and a 51-year-old man from Kalgoorlie, whose name is withheld for cultural reasons, all died in police cells after being put there for their own safety.</p> <p>We read many reports of non-Indigenous people dying in horrific circumstances, from suicide, shootings or car chases. But we did not read of a single non-Indigenous person who died after being imprisoned for their own safety.</p> <p>And while the most common cause of death for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in custody was medical issues, or what coronial reports refer to as \u201cnatural causes\u201d, Indigenous people were less likely to have been given all of the medical care they needed prior to their death.</p> <p>Our 2018 analysis found that 34% of Indigenous people were denied all appropriate medical care before their death, compared with 25% of non-Indigenous people. Indigenous women were the worst affected, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/10/indigenous-women-in-custody-more-likely-than-men-to-have-died-where-policy-not-followed\">50% not receiving all the medical care they needed.</a></p> <h2>Why didn\u2019t Deaths Inside record the reason a person was in custody?</h2> <p>Australia does not have the death penalty for any offence, therefore the offence a person committed, or is alleged to have committed, is not relevant.</p> <p>Moreover, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/30/more-than-half-of-147-indigenous-people-who-died-in-custody-had-not-been-found-guilty\">we found that 56% of Indigenous people and 51% of non-Indigenous people who died in custody between 2010 and 2015 were not serving a prison sentence</a> but were instead held on remand, were fleeing police, or were killed during arrest.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact is that the royal commission released almost three decades ago said that to stop Aboriginal deaths in custody we must stop putting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in prison,\u201d the Change the Record co-chair and CEO of the national Aboriginal legal service (Natsils), Cheryl Axleby, said.</p> <p>\u201cOverwhelmingly state and territory governments have failed to take the necessary steps to do this.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>For more information on the data and methods used, please&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/28/deaths-inside-indigenous-australian-deaths-in-custody\">read the \u201cabout the project\u201d section here</a></em></p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Plans to push ahead with reopening schools in England are in disarray, after the government admitted that not all primary school pupils will be able to return to the classroom before the end of summer.</p> <p>Boris Johnson last month said his aim was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/10/boris-johnsons-plans-for-primary-schools-prompt-concern-among-unions\">to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages</a>,\u201d as he announced the opening of primary schools to pupils in reception, year one and year six from 1 June.</p> <p>But government sources now acknowledge that \u2013 with little more than six weeks remaining before schools close for summer \u2013 the practicalities are too difficult for all children to return.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/gavin-williamson\">Gavin Williamson</a>, the education secretary, is to give an update on the progress of schools reopening on Tuesday, and is expected to concede publicly that many primary pupils will not return to their classrooms until the new school year in autumn.</p> <p>The acknowledgement was welcomed by school leaders, with Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, saying: \u201cIf confirmed, we\u2019re pleased to see the government will not force the impossible. Schools will continue to use their flexibility, intelligently, to deliver the very best for all the pupils in their school.\u201d</p> <p>Attendance statistics collected by the Department for Education to be published on Tuesday are likely to confirm that only half of pupils in the three eligible year groups returned to school last week.</p> <p>The attendance figures represent a setback for Johnson\u2019s efforts to use schools as a lever to revive the economy. Johnson\u2019s \u201croadmap\u201d for exiting the lockdown, published last month, stated: \u201cThe government\u2019s ambition is for all primary school children to return to school before the summer for a month if feasible, though this will be kept under review.\u201d</p> <p>But Johnson\u2019s announcement of a 1 June return was greeted with scepticism by parents and opposition from school unions and local authorities, wary of the health and safety difficulties for both staff and pupils in England\u2019s ageing and cramped classrooms.</p> <p>Whiteman, who represents leaders in the majority of England\u2019s primary schools, said: \u201cThroughout lockdown, school leaders and their teams have worked hard to meet the needs of all their pupils. This term, they must be given flexibility they need to balance the needs of the pupils coming back and the children continuing to learn at home.</p> <p>\u201cReturning all pupils before the end of this term will present unsolvable practical barriers if the hierarchies of control are to be maintained. Year groups have had to be split into groups of 15, using up other classrooms and occupying teachers from other years.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In a further confirmation of the difficulties that teachers face, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/matt-hancock\">Matt Hancock</a> hinted at Monday\u2019s Downing Street press briefing that even a full return in September may be difficult.</p> <p>Hancock said that for secondary schools, September was the \u201ccurrent working plan\u201d; but it would require \u201cingenuity\u201d. Johnson has said he would like to see the 2-metre distancing rule altered, although Department for Education guidance already states that young children need not socially distance within the small groups, or \u201cbubbles\u201d, in which they are taught.</p> <p>Scotland and Northern Ireland have already said that their schools will not reopen more widely until after the summer holidays, with Scotland saying that schools will use a flexible mix of in-person and remote learning for the foreseeable future. Schools in Wales are to partially reopen later this month for a brief period.</p> <p>Schools in all parts of the UK have remained open for the children of key workers and vulnerable pupils, with many operating throughout the Easter and half-term holidays.</p>",

On Monday the Estado de S.Paulo newspaper reported that the correction was ordered because Bolsonaro wanted the number of deaths at less than a thousand a day.

class=\"block-title\">Lockdowns reduced infection rate by 81%, study finds</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Lockdowns had a dramatic impact on the spread of coronavirus in Europe with strict controls on people\u2019s movements preventing an estimated 3.1m deaths by the beginning of May, with 470,000 deaths averted in the UK alone, researchers say.</p> \n  <p>Outbreak modellers at Imperial College London said that lockdown slashed the average number of people that contagious individuals infected by 81% and lowered the reproduction number, R, of the epidemic below 1 in all countries they observed.</p> \n  <p>When R is less than 1 the epidemic is in decline because on average, each infected person transmits the infection to less than one other. As countries ease out of their lockdown, scientists are watching R closely: if it rises and remains above 1, the epidemic will grow exponentially. </p> \n  <p>The Imperial team pooled data on Covid-19 deaths from 11 European countries including the UK, Italy, France, Spain and Germany, and worked backwards to calculate the extent of transmission several weeks earlier, to account for the time lag between infections and deaths. Lockdown at the end of March reduced the reproductive number of the UK epidemic from 3.8 to 0.63, they calculate.</p> \n  <p>The model shows that by 4 May between 12 million and 15 million people had become infected, but some nations were hit far harder than others. According to the model Belgium had the largest number of cases per capita with 8% of the population infected, compared with only 0.46% of Norwegians and 0.85% of Germans. Some 5.1% of the UK population was infected, according to a report <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7\">published in Nature</a>. </p> \n  <p>\u201cOur model estimates that we are very far away from herd immunity,\u201d said Axel Gandy, a professor of statistics at Imperial and co-author on the study. Herd immunity is achieved when enough people are immune to a virus that outbreaks die out naturally. In the case of Covid-19, scientists believe upwards of 70% of the population would need to be resistant for herd immunity to kick in. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt tells us we need to be very careful and not to release too much in one go because then you have no control,\u201d Prof Gandy said. \u201cWe need to tread very carefully and do things slowly, so we can backtrack should they not work.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T15:11:40.880Z\">at 4.11pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ede31e98f083999a26dc398\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T12:53:36.098Z\">1.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Authorities in <strong>Pakistan</strong> have stepped up efforts to enforce protocols after the number of coronavirus infections surpassed 100,000. </p> \n  <p>Official statistics released today showed 103,671 confirmed cases and 2,067 from Covid-19.

  "<p>Britain\u2019s retailers suffered a second successive slump in monthly sales during May as the coronavirus shutdown took its toll on the high street.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/03/uk-shops-slash-prices-as-coronavirus-causes-sales-to-plummet\">Price cutting</a> by furniture and homewares shops, which were among the worst hit, failed to entice customers to open their wallets, leaving last month\u2019s sales figures down by 5.9% compared with the same month last year.</p> <p>The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said there were some glimmers of hope last month, which figures from Barclaycard supported, but the outlook remained grim for many retailers even as the lockdown began to ease.</p> <p>From 15 June, most shops will be allowed to re-open, though a demand by ministers that they require customers to maintain physical distancing has thrown the sector into confusion and sparked demands in some quarters for a relaxation of the distancing rule from 2 metres to 1 metre.</p> <p>Last month the BRC warned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/26/reopened-retailers-will-face-fight-for-survival-executive-warns\">shops face a \u201cfight for survival\u201d</a> in the coming months as they try to restore their fortunes with tough new physical distancing and health and safety requirements.</p> <p>Its latest monthly health check of the retail sector found May\u2019s decrease was the second worst decline on record after April\u2019s 19% collapse.</p> <p>Across the industry, the falling demand for petrol and the temporary closure of many retail outlets meant most retailers remained stuck in reverse gear last month.</p> <p>There was an uplift for supermarkets and local convenience stores, which enjoyed a second month of soaring sales as shoppers focused on food and were reluctant to travel far to find it. Analysis of those shops allowed to stay open throughout lockdown found that in May, like-for-like sales increased 7.9% from May 2019.</p> <p>Office supplies, fitness equipment and bicycles all performed well, thanks to strong online sales, and DIY was boosted by the reopening of garden centres, the BRC said.</p> <p>Helen Dickinson, the BRC\u2019s chief executive said: \u201cSales in May demonstrated yet another month of struggle for retailers across the country, despite an improvement on the previous month.</p> <p>\u201cNonetheless, as the sun came out and restaurants lay dormant, food sales rose with consumers taking to their local parks for beers, BBQs and picnics. Clothing and beauty sales improved slightly on April, as people left their homes to meet outside with friends and family.\u201d</p> <p>Echoing the BRC\u2019s retail sales report, Barclaycard said consumer spending fell 26.7% in May, compared with the same month a year earlier. While consumers spent 24.5% more at supermarkets, pushing up the amount spent on its list of essential items by 0.9%, this was not enough to overcome a 36.9% drop in sales of non-essentials.</p> <p>Barclaycard, which says it uses data from almost half of the nation\u2019s credit and debit card transactions, said declines at department stores and in clothing sales of 44.5% and 42.4% respectively added to the decline in non-essential items.</p> <p>However, May\u2019s figures were an improvement on April when spending on non-essential items contracted by 47.7%.</p>",

On Monday the US attorney general, William Barr, stated there were no plans to extradite the prince.</p> \n<p>Asked during a Fox News interview on Monday whether the US has officially asked Britain to hand over Andrew, Barr said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a question of handing him over.

The prince had known the billionaire since 1999 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/07/prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-what-you-need-to-know\">stayed at several of his residences</a>.</p> \n<p>Andrew has been accused of having sex with a young woman provided by Epstein, Virginia Giuffre, when she was 17 \u2013 a claim he categorically denies. In November the prince was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/19/emily-maitlis-prince-andrew-was-unleashed-he-wanted-to-tell-me-everything\">interviewed by the Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis</a> about his relationship with the disgraced financier.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>His remarks sparked a public backlash, and a few days later Andrew issued a statement saying that he would \u201cstep back from public duties for the foreseeable future\u201d.</p> \n<p>The prince, who has always denied any wrongdoing, added: \u201cI continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein ... Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, in January, Berman gave a public statement implying there had been \u201czero cooperation\u201d with the investigation from Prince Andrew. In March, Berman claimed the duke had \u201ccompletely shut the door\u201d on cooperating with the US investigation.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Blackfords hit back, saying in a statement: \u201cThe Duke of York has on at least three occasions this year offered his assistance as a witness to the DoJ. Unfortunately, the DoJ has reacted to the first two offers by breaching their own confidentiality rules and claiming that the duke has offered zero cooperation. In doing so, they are perhaps seeking publicity rather than accepting the assistance proffered.</p> \n<p>\u201cOn 27 January 2020, Mr Geoffrey S Berman, the United States attorney for the southern district of New York, chose to make a public statement about the duke. This led to worldwide media reports that there had been \u2018a wall of silence\u2019 and that there had been \u2018zero co-operation\u2019 by the duke. These statements were inaccurate, and they should not have been made.</p> \n<p>\u201cOn 9 March 2020, Mr Berman made further public statements saying that the duke had \u2018completely shut the door\u2019 on cooperating with the US investigation and that they are now \u2018considering\u2019 further options. Again, the first statement was inaccurate and should not have been made.\u201d</p> \n<p>The statement added: \u201cIt is a matter of regret that the DoJ has seen fit to breach its own rules of confidentiality, not least as they are designed to encourage witness cooperation. Far from our client acting above the law, as has been implied by press briefings in the US, he is being treated by a lower standard than might reasonably be expected for any other citizen. Further, those same breaches of confidentiality by the DoJ have given the global media \u2013 and, therefore, the worldwide audience \u2013 an entirely misleading account of our discussions with them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Later on Monday, Berman&nbsp;issued his own public statement in response, saying: \u201cToday, Prince Andrew yet again sought to falsely portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate with an ongoing federal criminal investigation into sex trafficking and related offences committed by Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, even though the prince has not given an interview to federal authorities, has repeatedly declined our request to schedule such an interview and nearly four months ago informed us unequivocally \u2013 through the very same counsel who issued today\u2019s release \u2013 that he would not come in for such an interview.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf Prince Andrew is, in fact, serious about cooperating with the ongoing federal investigation, our doors remain open and we await word of when we should expect him.\u201d </p> \n<p>A Department of Justice spokesperson in the US said it \u201cdoes not publicly comment on communications with foreign governments on investigative matters, including confirming or denying the very existence of such communications\u201d.</p>",

Moreover, they demanded it on an unsecured basis; for a term of two years.\u201d</p> \n<p>The document added: \u201c[A \u00a3280m payment of fees by Barclays to Qatar was a] sham \u2026 in the sense that the document does not reflect \u2013 and instead conceals \u2013 the parties\u2019 true agreement in a particular respect: whilst they purported to record an agreement that Barclays would pay substantial sums for \u2018advisory services\u2019, in fact those sums were paid for by Qatar\u2019s investment in Barclays.\u201d</p> \n<p>Joe Smouha, QC for PCP, told Mr Justice Waksman that Staveley\u2019s claims arose out of the recapitalisation of Barclays during the financial crisis in October and November 2008.<br><br>\u201cBarclays deliberately misled not only PCP but also its own shareholders and the market in this regard,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>PCP\u2019s court filings added: \u201c[Roger Jenkins, Barclays\u2019 then chairman of investment banking] met Ms Staveley at his home on 23 October 2008. Ms Staveley asked whether the proposed investment would cause a problem to Qatar Holding, Barclays\u2019 then largest shareholder \u2026 Mr Jenkins replied that there was no need to worry about the position of the Qatari investors as they were looking to participate in the capital raising for up to \u00a33bn and that they were \u2018getting the same deal\u2019.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>PCP was paid a fee of \u00a330m for its work on the fundraising, of which \u00a311m was then paid out to other advisers, the company\u2019s filings said.</p> \n<p>The firm\u2019s documents also claim that the company gave up better terms worth up to \u00a31.5bn as it believed it was aligning its deal with the one agreed with Qatar, while they also say PCP missed out on fees that would have been due had it been offered the same terms as Qatar.</p> \n<p>The exact nature of any loss is likely to involve hours of complex argument in the court.</p> \n<p>A Barclays spokesman said: \u201cWe believe the claim is misconceived and without merit and Barclays will be vigorously defending it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jeffery Onions QC, who is leading Barclays\u2019 legal team, said the underlying proposition that Barclays\u2019 bosses chose to jeopardise their livelihoods and perpetuate a serious fraud was \u201chighly improbable\u201d.</p> \n<p>The bank will summarise its defence to the court on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>The hearing, which is being shown online, is expected to last about two months and follows a high profile criminal case.</p> \n<p>In February, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/28/three-former-barclays-executives-found-not-guilty-of-fraud\">three former Barclays\u2019 bosses were cleared of fraud</a> over the investment made by Qatar at the height of the banking crisis.</p> \n<p>The Serious Fraud Office had alleged that lucrative terms given to Qatar were hidden from the market and other investors through bogus advisory service agreements.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But Jenkins, Thomas Kalaris, the former head of its wealth division, and Richard Boath, the lender\u2019s ex-European financial institutions head, who are all in their 60s, were acquitted by jurors following a five-month trial at the Old Bailey.</p> \n<p>The civil court trial involving PCP had been postponed several times to allow the criminal trial to proceed.</p> \n<p>Staveley&nbsp;has, in recent months, been involved in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/11/new-legal-documents-raise-fresh-questions-over-newcastle-takeover-deal-saudi-arabia-premier-league\">brokering a deal</a> which could see a Saudi consortium take control of Newcastle United.</p>",

He said: \u201cWe must capitalise on this moment of change and that\u2019s why I have now tasked City Hall officials to work on an urgent new action plan to be developed with community groups and the police, but all public bodies need to change.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe plan will look to improve trust and confidence as well as transparency, and is intended to cover how our communities can better scrutinise policy and tactics that are still a source of concern in 2020.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the West Midlands, where BLM protests closed part of the M6 on Sunday night, the police and crime commissioner, David Jamieson, said he would convene a meeting of community leaders on Thursday to hear concerns that would be passed on to police.</p> \n<p>A public order policing expert warned of the risk of serious rioting if police were pressured into taking a heavier hand with protesters. Clifford Stott, a professor at Keele University who has advised the Home Office on public order strategy, said: \u201cThe potential as we move on is for widespread rioting and what we are trying to avoid at the moment is a major escalation of public discontent, which is quite clearly there given the levels of mobilisation that are going on.</p> \n<p>\u201cThose levels of mobilisation are very much about police action towards the black community. If we are to ignite a situation where police action is seen to be acting disproportionately again towards that community we are in very dangerous territory indeed.\u201d</p> \n<p>After police stood by and watched the statue toppled in Bristol, the focus will shift on Tuesday to Oxford, where hundreds of students and residents are expected to attend a protest calling for the removal of Oxford University\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/fall-of-bristols-colston-statue-revives-rhodes-campaign-in-oxford\">statue of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/fall-of-bristols-colston-statue-revives-rhodes-campaign-in-oxford\">the colonialist Cecil Rhodes</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat happened in Bristol is the catalyst for this protest,\u201d said Femi Nylander, an organiser for Rhodes Must Fall in Oxford. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a global surge against anti-blackness which has allowed us to rejuvenate that debate. It\u2019s what we saw with Colston \u2013 it was Black Lives Matter who took down that statue of a slave owner. We\u2019re reaffirming our demands to Oxford that they should themselves take this down as a matter of principle and matter of urgency.\u201d</p> \n<p>The campaign group\u2019s demand was backed by the Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran. She said: \u201cThe statues of white supremacists and slave merchants should not still be standing in our cities. That\u2019s why the statue of Cecil Rhodes must come down.\u201d The MP for Oxford West and Abingdon said she was not endorsing vigilante action, but urged Oriel College \u201cto think about what message this statue sends in 2020, and to remove it\u201d.

As countries ease out of their lockdown, scientists are watching R closely: if it rises and remains above 1, the epidemic will grow exponentially. <br></p> \n  <p>The Imperial team pooled data on Covid-19 deaths from 11 European countries including the <strong>UK, Italy, France, Spain and Germany</strong>, and worked backwards to calculate the extent of transmission several weeks earlier, to account for the time lag between infections and deaths. Lockdown at the end of March reduced the reproductive number of the UK epidemic from 3.8 to 0.63, they calculate.<br></p> \n  <p>The model shows that by 4 May between 12 million and 15 million people had become infected, but some nations were hit far harder than others. According to the model Belgium had the largest number of cases per capita with 8% of the population infected, compared with only 0.46% of Norwegians and 0.85% of Germans.

  "<p>The highest-profile presenters on the UK\u2019s biggest black music radio station have accused their own parent company of failing when it comes to responding to the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <p>Capital Xtra breakfast show hosts Yinka Bokinni and Shayna Marie Birch-Campbell said they were \u201cembarrassed\u201d by statements on race issued by Global Radio in response to the recent protests.</p> <p>\u201cAs two black women who front the breakfast show on the biggest black music station in the UK we were honestly embarrassed by the response from Capital Xtra, especially the seemingly \u2018copy and paste\u2019 job in terms of the statement released,\u201d the pair wrote in a joint statement on an internal discussion board, according to messages passed to the Guardian by concerned members of staff.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s upsetting to receive messages from black people who work in the company who are scared of coming forward and at first we weren\u2019t even sure if this was a forum for presenters to share their opinions, but honestly we don\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d</p> <p>The pair said progress on race needed to be made across Global Media, the privately controlled conglomerate that owns stations including Capital Radio, Heart, and Smooth. It also owns LBC which includes among its presenters the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, whose on-air criticism of the protests has angered some staff at Capital Xtra.</p> <p>Bokinni and Birch-Campbell said: \u201cHonestly, we are exhausted. As black women in the public eye and forward-facing representatives of this company who are actively speaking out against white privilege and fighting for change, we currently don\u2019t feel like we have the backing of the place we call home. We are more than open to having discussions and being involved in working out how we can move forward.\u201d</p> <p>Staff are also angry at the <a href=\"http://global.com/about/\">lack of diversity on the Global Media board</a>. The company has 10 board members but only gained a female executive at the end of April, with staff now calling for senior representation for black workers.</p> <p>One source at Global said they were \u201csaddened by the lack of genuine commitment to diversity\u201d at the company and claimed: \u201cThere\u2019s never been any genuine commitment to BAME representation or developing female leaders.\u201d</p> <p>The breakfast show presenters issued their statement following staff discussion of comments made by Global founder and president, Ashley Tabor-King, which prompted a lengthy discussion on the company\u2019s internal work discussion forum.</p> <p>When the discussion became strongly critical of Tabor-King and Global\u2019s progress on racial equality, a manager turned the comments off and proposed moving the entire debate from the main group for all staff to a different discussion forum exclusively for staff from a BAME background.</p> <p>This prompted further objections from staff, with one black employee addressing the manager they held responsible for the decision to turn off the comments: \u201cHow can you expect us to have conversations on \u2018positive solutions\u2019 if senior members of staff like yourself are so uncomfortable that they decide to disregard and dismiss the issues that many of us have pointed out?\u201d</p> <p>A Global spokesperson said: \u201cEvery Global employee is now a member of the BAME group on our internal platform and the conversation was not, and is not, limited for anyone.</p> <p>\u201cWe have also taken several steps in recent days, including the formation of a BAME committee, with an appointed independent expert to advise us, in order that faster progress can be made and this evening all our radio brands will hold one minute\u2019s silence so that those suffering, or who have suffered, can be recognised with respect and dignity. All of our outdoor digital displays will concurrently also carry appropriate messaging.</p> <p>\u201cOver the last 12 months, representation for ethnic minorities has increased from 8% to 13%. The Global Academy at which 39% of the students are from a BAME background recently enabled 15 apprentices to start full-time apprenticeships at Global.</p> <p>\u201cAll this said, we recognise there is still a lot of work to do \u2026 Like a lot of businesses, we are honest enough to say that we are still finding our feet and learning fast.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, sparked unease among some on the left of his party on Monday, as he condemned as \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">tearing down</a> of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol at the weekend.</p> \n<p>Starmer and the shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said they shared the sense of injustice that had brought more than 100,000 people out on to the streets of the UK to join Black Lives Matter protests in recent days.</p> \n<p>But in a clear shift in tone from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s attitude to civil disobedience, Starmer told LBC radio: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have been done in that way, [it was] completely wrong to pull a statue down like that.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/who-was-edward-colston-and-why-was-his-bristol-statue-toppled-slave-trader-black-lives-matter-protests\">Who was Edward Colston and why was his Bristol statue toppled?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He added: \u201cStepping back, that statue should have been taken down a long, long time ago. We can\u2019t, in 21st century Britain, have a slaver on a statue. A statue is there to honour people.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat statue should have been brought down properly, with consent, and put, I would say, in a museum.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some leftwing Labour MPs privately expressed concern at what they felt was an unfortunate departure from Corbyn\u2019s approach.</p> \n<p>Speaking in the House of Commons later in the day, Thomas-Symonds used a similar phrase to Starmer, saying, \u201cI do not condone an act of criminal damage to remove it, but I will not miss a public statue of a slave trader.\u201d</p> \n<p>Thomas-Symonds was responding to the home secretary, Priti Patel, who insisted: \u201cBlack Lives Matter, but police brutality in the US is no excuse for the violence against our brave police officers at home. So to the quiet, law-abiding majority, who are appalled by this violence, and have continued to act within the rules, I hear you.\u201d</p> \n<p>The shadow home secretary made a series of demands of the government, including calling for Patel to act on the recommendations of the Wendy Williams review into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush</a> scandal, and the 2017<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/08/david-lammy-review-bame-children-face-prejudice-flawed-criminal-justice-system\"> David Lammy review</a> into the experience of BAME people in the justice system.</p> \n<p>But his measured tone contrasted with passionate interventions from prominent leftwing Labour MPs, including Lloyd Russell-Moyle, Nadia Whittome and Zarah Sultana.</p> \n<p>Whittome had earlier tweeted, \u201cI celebrate these acts of resistance. We need a movement that will tear down systemic racism and the slave owner statues that symbolise it. And we need to win a government that will always be on the side of this movement.\u201d</p> \n<p>Thomas-Symonds\u2019 predecessor, Diane Abbott, also sounded a note of caution about Labour\u2019s approach. \u201cNobody supports criminal damage. But we need to be careful not to sound as if we care more about the vandalism than the horrors of the Atlantic slave trade,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe truth is that the community in Bristol tried for years to even get a plaque on the statue that mentioned slavery. They were blocked. The statue should have been taken down years ago. There is an excellent <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/international-slavery-museum#section--about\">museum of </a><a href=\"https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/international-slavery-museum#section--about\">slavery</a> in Liverpool. That would be the right place for this statue, if it is eventually fished out of the water.\u201d</p> \n<p>One Tory, representing a former \u201cred wall\u201d Labour seat said Starmer had a significant amount of work to do to eradicate the perception that Labour was soft on law and order. They said: \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing my voters can\u2019t stand, it\u2019s rioting. To them, it\u2019s an anathema to the democratic process.\u201d They said their inbox was full of messages, including from ex-Labour voters, on the protests over the weekend. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want soft-touch policing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ben Bradley, the MP for Mansfield, which turned Tory after 100 years in 2017, said: \u201c99% of my feedback from constituents is horror at the lack of law and order and at the lack of care for others by those breaking lockdown. Many have said they were sympathetic but not now, following the violence.\u201d</p> \n<p>A group of seven \u201cblue collar\u201d Tory MPs also posed for pictures as they offered help to clean up the statue in Parliament Square of Winston Churchill, which had \u201cis a racist\u201d spray painted on it during the protest.</p> \n<p>One Labour MP in a red wall seat said: \u201cThese are the sorts of things that do test the fragility of the voter coalition that used to be very successful for us. Where we see divisions on issues like Brexit, law and order, immigration and so on \u2013 these do become our test points. I thought Keir navigated that very well.\u201d</p>",

But others noted that when New York police went on strike to prove how important they were, and in fact, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/haymarketbooks/status/1266404306644852748\">people reported less crime.</a></p> \n<p>That call seems to have been heeded. On Sunday, the New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, pledged to redirect some of New York City police department\u2019s funding towards youth and social services.

Dr Ian Lipkin, a Columbia University epidemiologist who had Covid-19 in March, is concerned the virus might spread during protests following Floyd\u2019s 25 May death. And the virus\u2019s toll in lives, despair and exhaustion weighs on him. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to see how we recover,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A veteran Brooklyn nurse, Arlene Merteens, told the local news outlet <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/nurse-coronavirus-fear-second-wave-exhaustion\">Gothamist</a>: \u201cI know we have to go on. But I\u2019m so afraid of it, if we really do have a second wave, what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>As a small proportion of New Yorkers return to work, questions and challenges remain about how they will maintain distancing measures on usually crowded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/30/new-york-subway-system-mta-metro\">subway trains</a> and streets, and whether the city\u2019s character as an elbow-to-elbow city will return.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cAll eyes will be on New York City over the next couple months,\u201d said urban policy expert Jonathan Bowles, executive director of the Center for an Urban Future.</p> <p>Some New Yorkers have drawn strength from crises past. New York City rebounded from a financial crisis in the 1970s, a crime peak in the 1990s and the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep us down,\u201d said Carlo Scissura, president of the New York Building Congress, a construction industry group. \u201cWe may go down a little bit, but we go right back up.\u201d</p> <p>Edwin Arce, a Manhattan chef, said he thinks New Yorkers are up to the challenge. \u201cAs a city, we are ready to be back, start going out, living life with the new reality, though, of masks and 6ft [2-meter] separation,\u201d said Arce.</p> <p>The city has already reawakened somewhat as warm weather has drawn people outdoors, more restaurants have offered carryout service, and as thousands of people have marched in protest over the Floyd case.</p> <p>Subway ridership is ticking back up after plunging from 5.4m rides per weekday in February to under 450,000 in April, the city\u2019s transit agency says. Subway schedules are returning to normal, though riders will see signs showing how far apart to stand on platforms, how to wear masks, and the 1-5am shutdowns that began in May will continue so trains can be cleaned.</p> <p>Sam Solomon, a native New Yorker, said he wondered how \u201cnormal\u201d the new normal will be. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s ever going to be like it was,\u201d said Solomon, who has a health-related job. \u201cAfter months of relative isolation, it\u2019s going to be an adjustment being around so many people.\u201d&nbsp;</p>",

  "<p>What would the young Keir Starmer have made of his decision to condemn the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> protesters who felled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\">Bristol\u2019s statue of Edward Colston</a> yesterday? In his years as a barrister, the man who would be Labour leader worked to defend those who challenged the coercive force of the Thatcherite state, be it on protests or picket lines.</p> <p>His aim was to use the courts to protect the liberties that the governments of the day would not, and to muzzle the institutions that impinged upon them, most notably the police. Writing for the Trotskyist pamphlet&nbsp;Socialist Alternatives<em>&nbsp;</em>in 1987, he went as far as to ask \u201cthe question of the role the police should play, if any, in civil society\u201d.</p> <p>Activists on both sides of the Atlantic have asked the same thing in the wake of the death of George Floyd. Yet Starmer\u2019s decision to tell LBC that the action to fell Colston and dump him in the Avon was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d has led some on the left to ask the same question of the Labour party\u2019s new management as Starmer asked of the police 33 years ago: \u201cWho are they protecting, and from what?\u201d</p> <p>In some respects the Colston question was among the most straightforward Starmer could have expected to be asked this morning, during the first of the monthly phone-ins he is to subject himself to as part of his extended introduction to the British public.</p> <p>Would he argue that Colston deserved to stand? Of course not, and indeed he did not. \u201cWe can\u2019t, in 21st century Britain, have a slaver on a statue,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cA statue is there to honour people. This is a man who was responsible for 100,000 people being moved from Africa to the Caribbean as slaves \u2026 He should not be on a statue in Bristol, or anywhere else.\u201d</p> <p>On that argument, none of Starmer\u2019s critics will disagree. What has caused consternation, however, is his suggestions that yesterday\u2019s scenes were \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d, and that Colston \u201cshould have been brought down properly, with consent\u201d. He went on to say that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/barry-gardiner\">Barry Gardiner</a>, the former shadow cabinet minister who took a knee outside Downing Street as part of an earlier BLM protest last week, had been wrong to attend the demonstration during lockdown.</p> <p>To condone any kind of illegality \u2013 even when it involves significant public support \u2013 is a difficult ask of most politicians. Even the most devoted supporters of the ends have found it necessary to question the means, as Marvin Rees, the mayor of Bristol, did when he said that he could not condone the damage protesters had done to a statue that he described as a \u201cpersonal affront\u201d to his existence.</p> <p>But in going further, Starmer has \u2013 to some on the left, at least \u2013 situated himself as the heir to the Labour tradition of disappointment. In Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell, Diane Abbott and Ian Lavery, the last shadow cabinet had a leadership whose political lives had been largely lived unconstrained by the mores of electoralism. They were of the extra-parliamentary left.</p> <p>In 2015, Labour members elected Corbyn. Many people became Labour members precisely because they saw him as a man who would be more at home on a march than criticising one. The 2019 intake of Labour MPs are largely cast in that mould: 24-year-old frontbencher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nadia-whittome\">Nadia Whittome</a>, among its most impressive performers, spoke for much of the Labour grassroots when she described the toppling of Colston\u2019s statue as an \u201cact of resistance\u201d to be celebrated.</p> <p>Starmer has supported the right of activists to peaceful protest and offered his solidarity, but was never likely to go that far. Answers like today\u2019s confirm in the minds of some activists that to be \u201cforensic\u201d and \u201cconstructive\u201d \u2013 the two watchwords of his leadership \u2013 is to care about process above all else. The same criticism has been levelled repeatedly over his approach to coronavirus: support the government until it becomes untenable. His internal opponents will file his comments on Colston next to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/edmiliband\">Ed Miliband</a> suggesting teachers were wrong to strike in 2011, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/mar/16/neil-kinnock-arthur-scargill-miners-strike\">Neil Kinnock\u2019s failure</a> to stand foursquare behind Arthur Scargill and the miners in the absence of a national ballot on strike action.</p> <p>The irony is that Starmer was once one of those very critics. The blunt truth is that, in terms of his strategy for rebuilding Labour\u2019s standing in the country, his team have calculated people like his younger self, standing to his left, matter less than those standing to his right. He has control over the parliamentary party, a mandate from a clear majority of the membership and his favoured candidate in place overseeing Labour HQ. What he does not yet have, however, is a supportive public. Every intervention he makes serves the aim of establishing himself in the collective consciousness as a moderating influence \u2013 both on the government and the Labour party that&nbsp;once belonged to Corbyn.&nbsp;Expect Starmer to talk of supporting the police, not defunding them.</p> <p>Whether that gambit succeeds \u2013 and how history will judge its application to events such as this week\u2019s \u2013 is another question. But one answer is clear: Keir Starmer is not on the picket line any more.</p> <p>\u2022 Patrick Maguire is a political journalist and co-author of Left Out, an upcoming book on Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership of the Labour party</p>",

Finally, at about 4am on 2 June when his condition was getting dramatically worse, Narender was admitted to the emergency intensive care unit in Max Patparganj private hospital and put on a ventilator, but only when his family agreed to pay a deposit of 50,000 rupees (\u00a3520).But he was not permitted to stay.</p> <p>\u201cThe next morning, when the test result came through that he had tested positive for Covid-19, the hospital told us they were unable to admit him because there were no beds and no ventilators for Covid-19 patients, so we would have to take him somewhere else,\u201d said Vikas. \u201cI could not believe it.

In 2019, attempts to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-47670756\">fix a plaque to the pedestal</a> collapsed after Bristol\u2019s Society of Merchant Venturers, the high priests of the Colston cult, insisted on <a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/second-colston-statue-plaque-not-2682813\">watering down the text</a>, adding qualifications that, it was felt, had the effect of minimising his crimes. Yet what repulsed many about the statue was not that it valorised Colston but that it was silent about his victims, those whose lives were destroyed to build the fortune he lavished upon the city \u2026</p> \n   <p>Today is the first full day since 1895 on which the effigy of a mass murderer does not cast its shadow over Bristol\u2019s city centre. Those who lament the dawning of this day, and who are appalled by what happened on Sunday, need to ask themselves some difficult questions. Do they honestly believe that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/bristol\">Bristol</a> was a better place yesterday because the figure of a slave trader stood at its centre?

And there are many, many examples throughout history \u2013 from Martin Luther King to Harvey Milk, protests on behalf of gay rights \u2013 men and women following these people have been prepared to break the law because they believe that the issue of justice, that they wanted to shine a light on, is a bigger project.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He called for more statues of people like slave traders to be removed.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m afraid the time has come in the United Kingdom to look at these statues and say is it now right to celebrate these people who murdered so many men, women and children.

It explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>From 3 April to 3 May 2020, 5.0% of people said they feel lonely \u201coften or always\u201d, around 2.6m people across Great Britain.

We refer to this group as \u201clockdown lonely\u201d. If we adjusted this to be representative of the entire Great British population this would be equivalent to 14.3%.</p> \n   <p>We investigated measures of loneliness from a range of sources to see whether people are more or less lonely since the lockdown began, and who is most affected. We found that while reported estimates vary between surveys because of differences in wording or in how the survey was completed, chronic loneliness does not seem to have changed significantly as a result of lockdown.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>People experiencing chronic loneliness or \u201clockdown loneliness\u201d were also likely to score less well on three of the key measures used to measure wellbeing (ie, happiness), as this chart shows.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6371344952cf91c777642e2013d393b84315c042\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6371344952cf91c777642e2013d393b84315c042/0_0_1278_1226/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Relationship between loneliness and wellbeing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"959\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Relationship between loneliness and wellbeing</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ONS</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T11:03:24.412Z\">at 12.03pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ede03b68f083999a26dc127\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T09:24:30.978Z\">10.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"681f23f8b28bbd55d1120dcf6dbf5bc5746e0662\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/681f23f8b28bbd55d1120dcf6dbf5bc5746e0662/0_0_2333_3500/667.jpg\" alt=\"The empty plinth in Bristol this morning where the statue of Edward Colston stood until yesterday.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The empty plinth in Bristol this morning where the statue of Edward Colston stood until yesterday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eddfb5c8f083999a26dc0e1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T09:21:14.070Z\">10.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Starmer's LBC phone-in - Summary and analysis</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As Labour leader, at PMQs and elsewhere, <strong>Sir Keir Starmer</strong> seems to be adopting a strategy of presenting himself as Westminster\u2019s responsible adult, or designated driver \u2013 the leader offering mainstream, sensible, evidence-based politics. He may be a disappointment to anyone yearning for some Corbynite passion and radicalism, but even supporters of Boris Johnson\u2019s government would have to admit that gravitas, experience and competence have not been its defining characteristics, and so Starmer has arguable spotted a gap in the market. In this, his first LBC phone-in, he was at it again \u2013 repeatedly stressing his desire for consensus and cooperation. He was strikingly non-partisan.</p> \n  <p>He also sounded very different from his predecessor. During the Labour leadership contest he mostly played down the obvious differences between his politics and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s. But the gap between them is considerable, as was well demonstrated by what Starmer said about the toppling of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol. It is hard to imagine Corbyn describing what happened as \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Starmer said that, although the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol should have been removed years go, the manner in which it was pulled down was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d.</strong> Asked for his reaction to what happened yesterday, Starmer said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It shouldn\u2019t be done in that way. Completely wrong to pull a statue down like that.</p> \n   <p>But, stepping back, that statue should have been taken down a long, long time ago. You can\u2019t, in 21st-century Britain, have a slaver on a statue.</p> \n   <p>A statue is there to honour people. And you can\u2019t have that in 21st-century Britain. That statue should have been brought down properly with consent and put, I would say, in a museum.</p> \n   <p>This was a man who was responsible for 100,000 people being moved from Africa to the Caribbean as slaves, including women and children who were branded on their chests with the name of the company that he ran.

  "<p>Democrats in Congress have unveiled a sweeping new set of proposals aimed at reforming policing and transforming law enforcement across the country.</p> \n<p>The new legislation, called the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, comes during ongoing mass protests across the country in response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/george-floyd-protests-enter-third-week\">death of George Floyd while under police custody</a>, and is the most ambitious change to law enforcement sought by Congress in years.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe cannot settle for anything less than transformative structural change,\u201d said the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Congress, drawing on the nation\u2019s history of slavery.</p> \n<p>Before unveiling the package, House and Senate Democrats including Chuck Schumer, Congressman Jim Clyburn, Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester, Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Cory Booker, held a moment of silence at the Capitol\u2019s Emancipation Hall, reading the names of Floyd and others killed during police interactions.</p> \n<p>They wore kente cloths handed out by the Congressional Black Caucus and knelt for eight minutes and 46 seconds, now a symbol of police brutality and violence \u2013 it is the length of time prosecutors say Floyd was pinned under a white police officer\u2019s knee before he died.</p> \n<p>Representative Karen Bass, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, which is leading the effort, called it bold and transformative.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe world is witnessing the birth of a new movement in this country,\u201d Bass said.</p> \n<p>\u201cA profession where you have the power to kill should be a profession where you have highly trained officers that are accountable to the public,\u201d she added.</p> \n<p>The legislation would ban chokeholds by police, including the one used for Floyd, set up a national database for tracking police misconduct and would bar types of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">\u201cno-knock\u201d warrants</a>, according to an early draft.</p> \n<p>The bill also aims to make it easier to pursue legal damages when police violate civil rights, stop racial profiling and racial bias in policing, and limit the transfer of military hardware to police forces.</p> \n<p>However, the package stops short of fulfilling calls by leading activists to defund the police, a push to dismantle or reduce financial resources to police departments that has struck new intensity in the weeks of protests since Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>In Minnesota on Sunday, Minneapolis city council members voted to disband the police force there and rethink how it handles emergency response, with a focus on community and social services. </p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a first step. There is more to come,\u201d said Pelosi. \u201cOnce the House passes the Justice and Policing Act [Senate majority leader Mitch] McConnell will, hopefully, take it up. During the Congress, the president must not stand in the way of justice, the Congress and the country will not relent until this legislation is made into law.\u201d</p> \n<p>The presumed Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, who will visit Floyd\u2019s family in Houston, Texas, has backed a ban on chokeholds and other elements of the package. On Monday, his campaign issued a statement saying that though he \u201cshares the deep grief and frustration of those calling out for change\u201d he \u201cdoes not believe that police should be defunded\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, the bill\u2019s path to becoming law is likely to be precarious, and has to go through the Republican-controlled Senate. It is unclear if law enforcement and the powerful police unions will back any of the proposed changes or if congressional Republicans will join the effort.</p> \n<p>Throughout the press conference on Monday, the Democratic lawmakers vowed to fight for its passage \u2013 a subtle concession that the proposal may actually stall somewhere in the legislative process.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis has never been done before. At the federal level in the Senate Democrats are going to fight like hell to make this a reality,\u201d Schumer said. He added that \u201cnow we must collectively, all Americans, raise our voices and call on Leader McConnell, to put this reform bill on the floor of the Senate before July, to be debated and voted on\u201d.</p> \n<p>A far less controversial bill that would <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/politics/rand-paul-anti-lynching-bill-senate.html\">explicitly make lynching a federal crime</a> for the first time in US history stalled just last week.</p> \n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20200224/BILLS-116hr35-SUSv2.pdf\" title=\"\">Emmett Till Anti-lynching Act</a> is named&nbsp;after the 14-year-old black boy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/emmett-till-long-wait-for-justice\">who was tortured and killed in 1955 in Mississippi</a>, whose death helped spark the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Though the bill passed overwhelmingly in the Democrat-dominated House of Representatives earlier this year, one Republican senator has succeeded in blocking its path.</p> \n<p>Republicans responded to the bill by arguing&nbsp;it was a move to effectively defund police everywhere. The National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee both sent out statements saying Democrats wanted to defund police&nbsp;departments.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat once lived on the liberal fringe has now broken through in serious way,\u201d said the NRSC communications director, Jesse Hunt. \u201cSenate Democrats everywhere are going to have to answer to voters about how they plan to keep Americans safe while their party seeks to \u2018defund the police\u2019.\u201d<br><br></p> \n<p>Brad Parscale, Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign manager, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/parscale/status/1270021700718034944\">weighed in on Twitter</a>, claiming: \u201cDemocrats like Joe Biden want to defund the police.

  "<p>Cities have always been about apportioning and memorialising power; about writing force into space. Britain\u2019s colonial and imperial past is inscribed into the bricks and mortar of every city and town in the country. Mostly this hidden text of power relations and wealth acquisition lies dormant in the half-forgotten significance of street names, in the knotty iconography of grand facades, in the barely read inscriptions on memorials and sculptures, in the nomenclature of grand public buildings. Forming the backdrop of lived lives, these omnipresent clues are rarely fully decoded.

His name is sprinkled liberally through the Scottish capital \u2013 the grand, poker-straight Dundas Street runs north towards the Firth of Forth from the centre of George Street; the city has its Melville Street, Crescent, Terrace, Place and Drive.</p> <p>Sir Geoff Palmer, a professor emeritus of Heriot-Watt University, has been <a href=\"https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/people/edinburgh-professor-renews-call-reword-history-statue-memorialising-man-who-prolonged-slave-trade-2876774\">running a years-long campaign</a> for a new plaque on the base of the sculpture to explain Melville\u2019s role in slavery, since, as he put it in an <a href=\"https://www.thenational.scot/news/18501284.lessons-buried-countrys-shameful-past/?ref=twtrec\">article</a> for the National, \u201che delayed the abolition of the slave trade for 15 years (1792-1807), which caused the enslavement of about 630,000 Africans; and as war secretary lost about 40,000 British troops in Haiti fighting a pro-slavery war.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>In recent days, the name George Floyd has been written by protesters on the base of the sculpture, and a petition has been launched demanding the removal of the statue altogether. The petition also calls for the renaming of the Dundas and Melville streets in honour of Joseph Knight, an African-born man who was enslaved in Jamaica in the late 18th-century, then brought to Scotland by his master. He managed to free himself after a series of court cases in which he successfully argued that slavery did not exist in Scots law.</p> <p>In Glasgow, protesters have renamed a number of central-city streets whose official nomenclature celebrates grandees and notables enriched by slavery \u2013 especially by slave-worked tobacco plantations in Virginia and Maryland.&nbsp;</p> <p>Buchanan Street, the city\u2019s main shopping thoroughfare, is named for the 18th-century plantation owner Andrew Buchanan. At the weekend it was given a new sign calling it George Floyd Street.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cochrane Street \u2013 after Andrew Cochrane, another plantation owner and the Lord Provost of Glasgow \u2013 was given a sign naming it Sheku Bayoh Street, in commemoration of a black man who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/16/sheku-bayoh-brother-shouldnt-have-died-like-this-inquiry-family\">died in Fife in custody</a> in 2015, after being restrained by police.</p> <p>Recent events have also given fresh impetus to Oxford\u2019s Rhodes Must Fall campaign, which began in 2016. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/fall-of-bristols-colston-statue-revives-rhodes-campaign-in-oxford\">protest </a>is planned on Tuesday in front of Oriel College\u2019s sculpture of the imperialist, politician and entrepreneur Cecil Rhodes. A sign taped to a door on the city\u2019s High Street, near the statue, bore the words \u201cRhodes you\u2019re next\u201d \u2013 a reference to the toppling of the Colston sculpture.&nbsp;</p> <p>The meanings locked into Britain\u2019s urban fabric are being increasingly examined, decoded \u2013 and found wanting.</p>",

A small proportion of these arrests are for violent offenses, with the vast majority for relatively <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2020/06/07/like-george-floyd-this-man-was-arrested-for-using-a-counterfeit-bill-but-says-white-privilege-saved-his-life/#55febe86366f\">minor infractions such as the use of forged money</a>, the alleged crime by Floyd that police were called to deal with.</p> <p>A new model could involve community-based policing alongside a much larger system of social services that would deal with issues before they escalate into crime.</p> <p>Police would be demilitarized, removing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/why-are-some-us-police-forces-equipped-like-military-units\">the armored vehicles, high-powered weapons and teargas</a> used against protesters during the outcry over Floyd\u2019s death, and receive better training on how to deescalate situations without violence. The use of chokeholds and other aggressive methods during arrests would be outlawed.</p> <p>Some cities have now started to move in this direction. Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, has said he will look to shift as much as $150m from the police, just days after agreeing to a city budget that boosted police funding. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio has said some funding for America\u2019s largest police force will move to \u201cyouth initiatives and social services\u201d. Council members in New York, however, are pushing for a deeper rethink of policing, including a $1bn divestment of the NYPD.</p> <h2>Would Minneapolis be the first US city to disband its police department?</h2> <p>Stung by outrage over the police\u2019s repeated killing of people, particularly African Americans, many forces have brought in body-worn cameras for officers and instituted training to improve community relations.</p> <p>Critics say these measures have been <a href=\"https://dcist.com/story/19/10/22/five-years-in-activists-say-body-cameras-havent-done-enough-to-change-policing/\">woefully inadequate</a>, however, as evidenced by the continued instances of deaths caused by police, as well as examples of police brutality during arrests and protests. Police officers accused of killing people of colour have routinely avoided being charged and convicted over these deaths.</p> <p>Some cities have attempted deeper reforms, such as <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/minneapolis-not-first-disband-police-department-1509327\">Camden in New Jersey</a>, once considered the most dangerous in America.</p> <p>Camden made a shift to community-based policing in 2013, dissolving the local police department and using police from the local county instead. Daily non-crisis interactions between police and the community went up, training on de-escalating situations was rolled out, and firm rules on using force as a very last resort \u2013 virtually unheard of in the US \u2013 were installed. Officers are also required to intervene if a colleague breaks these edicts.</p> <p>The result <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-04/how-camden-new-jersey-reformed-its-police-department\">has been stark</a> \u2013 complaints over excessive police force in Camden have dropped 95% since 2014. But expanding these reforms across the US\u2019s 18,000 police forces is a major challenge due to widespread resistance to change from pro-police legislators and powerful police unions.</p> <h2>Does policing and criminal justice in the US differ greatly from other countries?</h2> <p>The US is somewhat of an <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/08/us/us-police-floyd-protests-country-comparisons-intl/index.html\">outlier</a> in its policing and sentencing compared with other wealthy nations. Six times more people die in police custody in the US than Britain, on a per-capita basis, with American police fatally shooting around 1,000 people in 2018 compared with just 11 such deaths in Germany and eight in Australia.</p> <p>US police conduct far more arrests than their counterparts in other rich nations, with black men three times <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/20/health/black-men-killed-by-police/index.html\">more likely</a> than white men to die in these interactions. The justice system also condemns more people to prison, too \u2013 the US has more than 2 million <a href=\"https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cpus16.pdf\">incarcerated people</a>, which represents the world\u2019s largest prison population.</p>",
  "<p>A primary school headteacher says he has been \u201coverwhelmed by support\u201d after calling on parents to help tackle structural racism.</p> <p>Robbie McGrath, headteacher at Malin Bridge primary school in Hillsborough, Sheffield, wrote to parents last week after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/george-floyd-killing-memorial-service-protests\">death of George Floyd in the US on 25 May</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt is too easy to look at America and dismiss the issues because our police officers do not carry guns,\u201d McGrath wrote. \u201cThe root cause is the same both in the USA and UK. Our society is built upon white supremacy.\u201d</p> <p>McGrath said while the term conjured images of the Ku Klux Klan and Nazis, \u201cwhite supremacy is much subtler than this. In many instances it is the unidentified bias that sits within the majority of us that white people are superior to people of colour.\u201d</p> <p>He went on to urge parents to have \u201can honest and open conversation\u201d with their children, so that they could \u201crecognise the existence of white privilege\u201d.</p> <p>He told the Guardian he had received scores of emails from parents since.</p> <p>\u201cOur private WhatsApp parents\u2019 groups have been filled with positive messages. People have shown the letter to their bosses, and to their staff.\u201d</p> <p>McGrath said he had decided to write the letter after sending an email to staff mentioning the Black Lives Matter movement and realising how few of them had heard of George Floyd. \u201cIt occurred to me that a lot of white people would be confused by what was happening in America, and the silent complicity was getting to me.

When I sent them the letter, they said it was a hard read, and they had a tough period of reflection. But they sent it on to friends and work colleagues. One of my best friends, who is white, and had the least privileged upbringing of anyone I know, runs a pub nearby. He has sent out the letter on his Twitter feed and to his staff. He says he wants his pub to be anti-racist.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt is accepted that there is institutional bias, across the world.

  "<p>On Sunday, John Oliver devoted the entire episode of Last Week Tonight to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/08/george-floyd-protests-black-lives-matter-donald-trump-defund-police-latest-news-updates\">nationwide protests</a> against anti-black racism and police brutality sparked by the police killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, and the fundamentally broken institution of law enforcement in the United States. \u201cLook, if the police are trying to convince the public they\u2019re not guilty of displaying excessive force, it\u2019s probably not a good idea to repeatedly display excessive force on national television,\u201d said Oliver after several clips of police beating peaceful protesters with batons, wantonly spraying pepper spray or, in New York, driving a police cruiser into a barricaded crowd.&nbsp;</p> <p>Oliver didn\u2019t want to dwell on the president or cable news\u2019s fixation on instances of looting, other than to say: \u201cIf you\u2019ve said the name Macy\u2019s more than you\u2019ve said the name Breonna Taylor this week, you can very much fuck off.\u201d Same goes for if \u201cyou\u2019re asking why a spontaneous decentralized protest can\u2019t control every one of its participants more than you are asking the same about a taxpayer-funded, heavily regimented workforce\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf4cea5oObY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Wf4cea5oObY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cFor any viewers sitting at home shocked by the scenes of police brutality, I get it \u2013 I\u2019m white, too,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cBut it\u2019s worth remembering: that\u2019s the tip of a very large iceberg. It didn\u2019t start this week, or with this president, and it always disproportionately falls on black communities.\u201d</p> <p>As usual, Oliver took a deep dive into how we got here. Police have \u201clong enjoyed an exalted role in America\u201d, he explained, although the reality of policing has always been much different than the hero renegade cops of movies and TV. Law enforcement is \u201cdeeply entangled\u201d with white supremacy, and though you might think \u201cjoin the club, policing, this is America, the only institution not deeply entangled with the history of white supremacy is Olive Garden, and that\u2019s only because it\u2019s always been a powerful symbol of white inferiority\u201d, said Oliver. \u201cThe police have not just been incidentally tainted by racism. For much of US history, law enforcement meant enforcing laws that were explicitly designed to subjugate black people.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/01/john-oliver-when-trump-uses-thugs-code-racism-george-floyd-protests\">John Oliver: When Trump 'uses the word thugs, you know what it\u2019s code for'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some of America\u2019s first police units were actual slave patrols to catch people who had escaped slavery; after Emancipation, police units participated in or abetted lynchings and enforced Jim Crow, or brutalized black people who migrated north, where they faced restricted housing and economic opportunities. Oliver breezed through the non-improvements after the 60s \u2013 Nixon\u2019s fealty to \u201claw and order\u201d, Reagan\u2019s turbocharged war on drugs, and the \u201cbroken windows\u201d or \u201czero-tolerance\u201d model of policing popularized in the 1990s, which saturated low-income communities of color with police and initiated the disproportionately applied random search policy known as \u201cstop and frisk\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>Spending on police went at the expense of social services, health services and other programs, which also put undue responsibilities on law enforcement. Police now \u201chave a massive array of complicated duties that in many cases they aren\u2019t equipped to handle, making them very much the Jared Kushner of local officials \u2013 without, of course, the expression, complexion and general demeanor of a haunted baby\u201d, said Oliver. \u201cSo while we should absolutely be angry at the police right now, let\u2019s also be angry at the series of choices that left them as essentially the only public resource in some communities.\u201d</p> <p>On top of that, America has armed police \u201cto the fucking teeth\u201d, a subject Oliver and his team investigated six years ago. This has promoted a sub-industry of training seminars to reinforce the idea of the police at war, such as the <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/dave-grossman-training-police-militarization/\">\u201ckillology\u201d training</a>, a haunting clip of which showed an officer telling fellow cops to think of themselves as \u201cpredators\u201d. \u201cYou know, the problem with telling someone that they\u2019re a predator is that it primes them to see the rest of the world as potential prey,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cAnd of course cops who went through this training would end up on edge. You wouldn\u2019t train a barber by saying, \u2018here are your scissors, snip like this, and oh yeah, this is how you puncture the carotid artery.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Minneapolis\u2019s mayor banned the \u201ckillology\u201d training after it was revealed the officer who killed Philando Castile five years ago had graduated from one. Which brought Oliver to one of the major obstacles for police reform in America: police unions, who make it incredibly difficult to discipline police for even egregious misconduct, and whose leader in Minneapolis flouted the mayor\u2019s ban.</p> <p>Additionally, civil suits against police are almost impossible to win because of cops\u2019 \u201cqualified immunity\u201d, \u201cwhich sounds like something you get from a horrifying cheat code in Grand Theft Auto\u201d, said Oliver, but actually means public officials\u2019 immunity from lawsuits unless their exact conduct has already been deemed unconstitutional in a previous case. And it has to be exact \u2013 Oliver cited a 2011 lawsuit against the Seattle police department in which a woman claimed excessive force after an officer tasered her three times during a traffic stop. The officer was given immunity because the law on stun gun use wasn\u2019t clear, which is \u201cis absolutely ridiculous \u2013 the method the officer used to assault that woman clearly shouldn\u2019t matter\u201d, said Oliver. \u201cIt\u2019s like if Jeffrey Dahmer was declared innocent because he cooked his victims in an Instant Pot \u2013 the crime is the killing, not what fucking appliance he used.\u201d</p> <p>There is a bill in Congress right now to abolish qualified immunity, but incremental reforms just aren\u2019t going to cut it on their own, said Oliver, when \u201cyou\u2019re contending with an entrenched police culture resistant to any effort to compel reform\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>Which is why many people are advocating to \u201cdefund the police\u201d, a slogan now popular at rallies and a Republican scare tactic which actually means \u201cmoving away from a narrow conception of public safety that relies on policing and punishment, and investing in a community\u2019s actual safety net \u2013 things like housing, mental health services and community organizations\u201d, explained Oliver.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/18/john-oliver-sports-coronavirus-return\">'It's just not possible right now': John Oliver on bringing back sports safely</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Oliver also dismissed the \u201cbad apple\u201d theory of policing, where one just has to rid the force of serial offenders: \u201cThis clearly isn\u2019t about individual officers. It\u2019s about a structure built on systemic racism, that this country created intentionally and now needs to dismantle intentionally and replace with one that takes into account the needs of the people that it actually serves.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not directly impacted by it,\u201d Oliver concluded, \u201cit is tempting to look for a reason to feel better about the world, to look at pictures of cops kneeling and think oh, well, we just need more of that! But we need so much more than that. Because ours is a firmly entrenched system in which the roots of white supremacy run deep. And it is critical that we all grab a fucking shovel.\u201d</p> <p>Oliver gave the show\u2019s last word to <a href=\"https://www.kimjoneswrites.com/\">Kimberly Jones</a>, a black activist and co-author of I\u2019m Not Dying with You Tonight: \u201cThe social contract is broken \u2026 you broke the contract, and for 400 years, we played your game and built your wealth \u2026 they are lucky that what black people are looking for is equality and not revenge.\u201d</p>",

Would I have tugged the rope? I don\u2019t think&nbsp;so. As attractive as it seems, as right as is the cause, that route seems ultimately problematic. What happens when far-right yahoos reflect their warped view of the world by yanking down a statue they don\u2019t like? They\u2019ll be wrong, of course, but they\u2019ll happily and spuriously claim that a precedent has now been set for such actions.</p> <p>But now that Colston statue has crashed to earth, few will shed many tears about it and Bristol would be foolish to even think&nbsp;of putting him back. Some landmarks we can argue about, but a statue whose inscription actively lauded Edward Colston, who made his riches in the 17th-century slave-trade, in the middle of modern-day Bristol became a daily insult to much of that city\u2019s population and to those of us whose efforts and those of their descendants have made this country what it is.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is a valid argument&nbsp;to be had about how history is fairly represented, but we weren\u2019t really having it. Dialogue only occurs when two sides are listening. In this case there was talking but not a great deal of listening. \u201cThere has been a lot of controversy about this statue for many years \u2013 so the question is why didn\u2019t those in the local authority consider taking it down long before rather than waiting for these actions?\u201d <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/police-federation-chairman-criticises-police-18379750\">said </a><a href=\"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/police-federation-chairman-criticises-police-18379750\">John Apter</a>, the chair of the Police Federation.&nbsp;As much as one abhors unlawful direct action, it is important to understand what can happen in a society when democracy seems shorn of good faith, goodwill and responsiveness.&nbsp;</p> <p>This will be a continuing problem for the Conservative government in coming weeks. It will be attempting to grapple with the multiple&nbsp;pockets of turbulence created by the killing of George Floyd \u2013 as evidenced by the resurgent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/jun/07/just-the-beginning-voices-from-the-black-lives-matter-protest-in-london-video\">Black Lives Matter </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/jun/07/just-the-beginning-voices-from-the-black-lives-matter-protest-in-london-video\">movement</a> \u2013 and the allied fear, confusion, and anger surrounding the Johnson administration\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. They are different issues, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/03/censorship-row-over-report-on-uk-bame-covid-19-deaths\">they intersect</a>. If you are black, they both speak to an extraordinary, and lethal, unfairness.&nbsp;</p> <p>And one also clearly feeds from the other,&nbsp;for the pandemic and the&nbsp;world\u2019s reaction to it have already taught us that nothing is immutable. We have in just a few months reshaped our lives, reshaped our economy, emptied our public areas, cut ties we thought would always bind. It has been a revelation. Inevitably the proof that, with the will, we can act decisively to address things we judge vital prompts many to ask: \u201cIf we can move mountains to address a pandemic, how can we continue to say other problems are insoluble?\u201d </p> <p>How can we say that citizens with brown skins suffer longstanding and widespread discrimination \u2013 on the streets, in their schools, in the workplace and the jobs market, in the media, in the criminal justice system \u2013 but that it\u2019s too difficult to do anything about it? How can we say there&nbsp;is no way to address the mindset that defines law enforcement as forcing a knee on to a stricken man\u2019s neck? Our reaction to the pandemic has saved countless lives, but in so doing it has also shown that anything is possible. I believe that revelation did for Colston\u2019s statue and it fuels much of the anger we now see on the streets around the world.</p> <p>Boris Johnson must deal with that, but it is a task for which the prime minister&nbsp;and his government are spectacularly ill-suited. They don\u2019t&nbsp;know how. They have no emotional capital. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/boris-johnson-defence-dominic-cummings-anger-from-allies-and-opponents-alike\">Dominic Cummings affair</a> robbed them of any moral authority in the matter of the pandemic, and in the case of the George Floyd reverberations, they were in deficit even before they took office. What <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/07/boris-johnson-history-of-apologies-controversy-burqa-comments\">can the prime minister say</a> to black protesters? \u201cDear people; I feel your pain \u2013 I fret each day about the lives of your piccaninnies. I long to see again your watermelon smiles\u201d? What does he say to protesters about the director of his No 10 policy unit, Munira Mirza? She who complained so bitterly about race equality initiatives <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/theresa-may-s-phoney-race-war-is-dangerous-and-divisive\">on the basis that</a>:&nbsp;\u201cA lot of people in politics think it\u2019s a good idea to exaggerate the problem of racism.\u201d Can she craft&nbsp;a government policy to meet this moment? Don\u2019t hold your breath.&nbsp;</p> <p>Johnson has no ability to respond constructively to the protests on our streets and no ability to show plausible empathy, and so he will respond negatively,&nbsp;framing the debate as a matter of public&nbsp;order,&nbsp;while playing down the iniquities that led people,&nbsp;at a time of widely acknowledged viral risk, on to the street. The marches were \u201csubverted by thuggery\u201d, he said yesterday.</p> <p>\u201cThe police have our full support in tackling any violence, vandalism or disorderly behaviour,\u201d added Priti Patel, his home secretary. This is a politician who runs the Home Office, the linchpin of administrative inequality in this country \u2013 it would have been valuable to hear her say something about that. But she won\u2019t,&nbsp;and in any event it would be futile in&nbsp;terms of addressing the current turbulence. Patel backed the key planks of her party\u2019s hostile environment that&nbsp;led to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/windrush-report-condemns-home-office-ignorance-and-thoughtlessness\">Windrush scandal</a>. Like Johnson, she has no emotional capital or interest in addressing these problems.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, with Colston\u2019s statue gone, we move into another phase. Protesters feel there is a moment to be seized, but we have a government that is unable to diagnose or constructively respond to it, and utterly ill-equipped to meet it.

  "<p>There have been times in the past week when the news has been so appalling \u2013 and when fury and despair have threatened to take over so completely \u2013 that I\u2019ve gone scrambling in search of musical solace.

  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkish</a> parliament is considering a bill that would greatly expand the powers of a 28,000-strong network of nightwatchmen across the country, a move viewed by critics as an attempt to create an auxiliary police force loyal to the president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.&nbsp;</p> <p>A draft law discussed by MPs on Monday would allow <em>bek\u00e7iler</em>, or night-time community officers, to carry out identification checks and body searches and would authorise the use of lethal force. A vote expected this week is likely to pass the measures.</p> <p>Neighbourhood <em>bek\u00e7iler</em> armed with whistles and batons used to be a common presence in Turkey, often affectionately referred to as \u201cuncles\u201d looking out for burglars and petty criminals. The system was abolished in 2008 but <a href=\"https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/01/turkey-akp-expand-power-police-night-watchmen.html\">revived in 2016</a> after the failed coup against Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government.&nbsp;</p> <p>The current generation of night-time community officers are mostly younger men with links to the youth wing of the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP). They are supposed to serve as backup for police officers dealing with criminals and protesters.&nbsp;</p> <p>A string of terrorist attacks over the last decade mean many Turks are grateful for the extra attention to public safety, but there have been dozens of reports of the new officers beating civilians. Since they were given the right to carry guns in January this year, at least one civilian has been non-fatally shot.</p> <p>The new bill says the community officers will receive instruction in human rights and firearms use, but opposition MPs and rights groups say the stipulated 40 hours of training is not adequate for an auxiliary security force.&nbsp;</p> <p>Several politicians have drawn comparisons with Iran\u2019s Basij militia, a volunteer force loyal to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, whose members beat and harass civilians who fall foul of the country\u2019s strict morality laws.&nbsp;</p> <p>L\u00fctf\u00fc T\u00fcrkkan, of Turkey\u2019s opposition \u0130yi party, tweeted: \u201cA night watch horror has started in this country. They are reckless.\u201d</p> <p>Emma Sinclair-Webb, Human Rights Watch\u2019s Turkey director, said: \u201cThe passing of a law increasing the powers of community officers to intervene in place of the regular police is a troubling demonstration of the growing securitisation of all aspects of life in Turkey.</p> <p>\u201cWe are particularly concerned too about the lack of oversight mechanisms to regulate these community officers and to hold them to account when they abuse their powers. There is a pervasive culture of police impunity already, and oversight of these officers is even more unclear and vague than it is for the regular police.\u201d</p> <p>Naci Bostanc\u0131, an AKP parliamentary whip, dismissed the allegations, telling <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-04/erdogan-empowers-security-force-raising-worries-of-regime-guard\">Bloomberg</a> that \u201cthe watchmen are part of the security forces, who are serving everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government has steadily increased the scope and size of the security forces since protests broke out around the country over the redevelopment of Istanbul\u2019s Gezi park in 2013.

  "<p>As we\u2019ve all seen, when it comes to American police brutality, the gloves are now off and the masks too. Faced with yet more incontrovertible evidence of brutal and racist policing <strong>\u2013</strong> both the killing of George Floyd and others, and some forces\u2019 response to the public protests <strong>\u2013</strong> it has become virtually impossible to maintain the image of American law enforcement officers as straightforward protectors and servers of the people.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/08/george-floyd-protests-black-lives-matter-donald-trump-defund-police-latest-news-updates\">George Floyd protests: fired officer to appear in court as calls to defund police sweep US \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fingers are rightly being pointed at those who have sought to project that image, not least the entertainment industry. It is no secret that movies and TV shows have historically presented American policing in a broadly positive light, by accident or design. Hollywood has done much to promote the good deeds of law enforcement, but in failing to critically assess its failings, they could find themselves complicit in a whitewash. Many a cop show has relied on police cooperation <strong>\u2013</strong> and the conditions that come with it. Even without that, they do not reflect the reality. Who would watch a cop show where half the violent crimes were never solved <strong>\u2013</strong> as is statistically the case in real life? We prefer dogged action heroes, ingenious sleuths and rule-bending mavericks <strong>\u2013</strong> usually white and male. Even a comedy series like Brooklyn Nine-Nine, with its harmonious, multicultural police department and casebook of charmingly petty crimes, does its bit to cast American policing in a favourable light.</p> <p>When it comes to issues of racism within police forces specifically, the picture is equally distorted. The entertainment industry has generally followed the official line: blithe ignorance and denial giving way to grudging admission of a problem, but only as far as the \u201cbad apple\u201d theory. And while it is safe to say the majority of law-enforcement personnel are not racist, the existence of <em>institutional</em> racism is repeatedly denied. The US attorney general, William Barr, did exactly that last Sunday, firmly stating, \u201cI don\u2019t think that the law enforcement is systemically racist.\u201d On screen as well as off, that position is no longer tenable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"45d5bcb5e24ce68caa7ba6a2ad2cd23811ff4a3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45d5bcb5e24ce68caa7ba6a2ad2cd23811ff4a3c/0_0_3414_5100/669.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"669\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is a history that started from a very low point, if you consider DW Griffiths\u2019 notorious Birth of a Nation as a cop movie. In the story\u2019s time frame <strong>\u2013</strong> the post-civil war Reconstruction period <strong>\u2013</strong> modern policing barely existed. Thus, the nascent Ku Klux Klan are depicted as the valiant vanguard of law and order, galloping in to rescue white folks from the marauding blacks and re-establish good, old white supremacy. This was institutional racism in its most brazen and heroic form, and you could say popular culture has been rowing back from it ever since <strong>\u2013</strong> albeit slowly.&nbsp;</p> <p>By the civil rights era, Hollywood was at least going through the motions of acknowledging police racism. We saw it most clearly at the time in Oscar-winner In the Heat of the Night, in which Sydney Poitier\u2019s black Philly cop is plunged into the steam room of Mississippi racism, personified by local chief Rod Steiger. Initially suspecting Poitier of the murder they eventually solve together, Steiger\u2019s journey from gum-chewing southern hick to, er, slightly less racist gum-chewing southern hick was applauded at the time. White audiences could go home feeling like they had been on a similar journey, even if black cinema-goers knew the problem wasn\u2019t that easily fixed.</p> <p>It\u2019s a dynamic that\u2019s played through many an interracial buddy cop movie since. Either the buddies work through their racial differences and come to some symbolic accommodation, or the partnership is equitable and harmonious from the start, as if to say, \u201cwhat racism?\u201d Best buddies Mel Gibson and Danny Glover take on evil pro-apartheid South African racists in Lethal Weapon 2, for example, but there\u2019s no hint of racial strife with their Los Angeles police department <strong>\u2013</strong> the same LAPD that would brutally beat Rodney King with impunity two years later.</p> <p>Where police racism is addressed in movies or TV shows, it\u2019s often brushed off with the \u201cbad apples\u201d defence. Witness Sam Rockwell\u2019s Oscar-winning turn in 2015\u2019s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. He\u2019s another resentful, racist small-town cop, whose reputation for torturing black suspects is even deployed for comedy: \u201cIt\u2019s persons of colour-torturing,\u201d he corrects Frances McDormand when she uses the N-word. Unlike his black victims, Rockwell\u2019s character is treated sympathetically, and ultimately gets a chance to redeem himself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"486f9bdf25fc25b57edc56ec10b76d2fb4902c16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/486f9bdf25fc25b57edc56ec10b76d2fb4902c16/0_0_2400_1629/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke in Training Day\" width=\"1000\" height=\"679\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke in Training Day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These currents have taken a peculiar turn in the early 21st century. What, for example, are we to make of a film like Training Day, which gave LAPD corruption a bizarre twist by making the bad apple an African American cop: Denzel Washington. Besides Washington, pretty much every character of colour in the movie is a criminal, while Ethan Hawke\u2019s rookie is the \u201cwhite saviour\u201d of the piece. Was a corrupt black cop a sign of how post-racial America had become, or a new level of denial?&nbsp;</p> <p>Washington wasn\u2019t the only one. We\u2019ve also had Samuel L Jackson in 2008\u2019s Lakeview Terrace: a malevolent cop who wages war on the interracial couple next door. The get-out is that Lakeview Terrace is \u201cinspired by a true story\u201d <strong>\u2013</strong> although some true stories seem easier to get made than others. Then there was the Netflix sci-fi fantasy Bright, which sketched out an LA populated with mythical creatures but plagued by familiar racial tensions. Thus, Will Smith is buddied up with an Orc <strong>\u2013</strong> a member of the \u201cunderclass\u201d race <strong>\u2013</strong> which puts Smith in the position of the high-handed racist. Such narratives potentially pose interesting questions about race, but they also do plenty to muddy the waters of real-life police racism.</p> <p>Black film-makers have always had a clearer view of this landscape. Systemic police racism is often so taken for granted in African American cinema it barely needs pointing out. Fifty years ago, when Melvin van Peebles\u2019 character killed two white police officers in the pioneering Sweet Sweetback\u2019s Baadasssss Song, he knew his only option was to go on the run. In last year\u2019s Queen &amp; Slim, a modern-day black couple accidentally kill a white cop and come to exactly the same conclusion. In the present, Black Lives Matter era, we\u2019ve had a string of powerful movies centred on African American victims of racist policing, either present-day or historical: Fruitvale Station, The Hate U Give, Blindspotting, Monsters and Men, If Beale Street Could Talk, the list keeps growing. In most of them, justice against police racism is a fantasy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9eef7f5c1192d6c3c606f9907ad2d2b0af989f07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9eef7f5c1192d6c3c606f9907ad2d2b0af989f07/0_35_1830_1098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John David Washington in Blackkklansman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John David Washington in BlacKkKlansman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Blumhouse Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Spike Lee has been telling us this for decades, of course. Watching Radio Raheem getting choked to death by the police in Do the Right Thing feels chillingly prescient today but it was not a fantasy in 1989 either (it was inspired by the 1983 killing of the graffiti artist Michael Stewart). Lee prefaced his Malcolm X biopic with footage of the LAPD\u2019s beating of Rodney King. With BlacKkKlansman, though, he took a curiously even-handed approach. The story partners a black and a Jewish cop to infiltrate the 1970s Klan (who still delight in screenings of The Birth of a Nation), but the overlap between the KKK and the police is largely unexplored.</p> <p>It is no longer just black film-makers who are tackling these issues. Kathryn Bigelow, for example, who gave us the all-white, all-dude, law-enforcement action fantasy of Point Break, was to be found in 2017 restaging the 1967 race riots in Detroit. In horrific detail, her film examines another real-life episode of racist police brutality (that went unpunished). Bigelow was criticised for highlighting black victimhood and passivity as well as ingrained white prejudice, but like many white film-makers, she felt compelled to do what she could. \u201cThere is a responsibility the white community needs to take for racism in America,\u201d she acknowledged at the time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfa17d0e18496b882cd85495934b97ef3505bacb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfa17d0e18496b882cd85495934b97ef3505bacb/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Regina King in Watchmen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Regina King in Watchmen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dc Comics/Allstar/HBO/Sky Atlantic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Going significantly further than anything that preceded it, in terms of mainstream entertainment, was HBO\u2019s Watchmen miniseries. Ahead of its release last year, Watchmen was dismissed as an extraneous sequel to Alan Moore\u2019s celebrated sci-fi comic, but Damon Lindelof\u2019s story surprised everyone with its head-on examination of historic American racism. The series begins with a recreation of the 1921 Tulsa race massacre (which many viewers had to Google to check it really happened), and its labyrinthine plot takes in a black police recruit encountering blanket racism in the 1930s, a resurgent white-supremacist movement with ties to law enforcement, a modern-day police chief with Klan regalia hidden in his closet. And just to add extra resonance, everyone is wearing face masks.&nbsp;</p> <p>This by no means to suggest that white and mainstream film-makers are riding in to save the day, but it\u2019s another sign that the tide is turning. Events of the BLM era have compelled white film-makers to take a look at the stories they tell, and perhaps acknowledge their complicity in the myth-peddling. The tired old screen narratives around issues of police and racism are no longer fit for purpose when measured against the events unfolding in America\u2019s streets and captured on its cellphones. On screen as in life, the reality is no longer possible to deny.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Frederick Barclay\u2019s nephews have said they felt it was \u201cnecessary and reasonable\u201d to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/24/frederick-barclay-was-secretly-recorded-at-ritz-high-court-hears\">bug the conservatory of the Ritz hotel</a> after becoming concerned that their billionaire uncle\u2019s conduct could potentially damage the family\u2019s business empire, according to documents lodged at the high court.</p> <p>Barclay, 85, and his daughter, Amanda, are suing three of his twin brother Sir David Barclay\u2019s sons \u2013 Alistair, Aidan and Howard, and Aidan\u2019s son Andrew \u2013 over 1,000 conversations secretly recorded at the Ritz hotel across several months.</p> <p>The high court has previously heard that the \u201celaborate system of covert recording\u201d came to light in January when Alistair Barclay was filmed on CCTV \u201chandling the bug placed in the conservatory at the Ritz\u201d. Last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/18/sir-frederick-barclay-releases-footage-of-alleged-ritz-bugging\">Sir Frederick released the footage to the media</a> and claimed the Ritz was sold for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/06/frederick-barclays-nephews-taped-1000-of-his-conversations\"> \u201chalf the market price\u201d</a>, with a discussion about a \u00a31.3bn deal with Saudi Arabia-based Sidra Capital allegedly among the recordings.</p> <p>The written defence, filed on Monday, claims Alistair began the bugging without the prior knowledge of the other defendants including Aidan Barclay, the chairman of the publisher of the Daily and Sunday Telegraph.</p> <p>Alistair placed an \u201coff-the-shelf recording device\u201d, which the documents say he bought over the counter from a shop in central London, on 6 November. The defence document claims Alistair resorted to bugging after being \u201ctroubled about what seemed to him to be a remarkable change in their conduct posing a significant risk of harm to his brothers Aidan and Howard Barclay, to the group, to their interests (that is, of his brothers and the group) and to his own interests.\u201d By 13 November all the defendants were aware of the bugging operation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"079a23a7b7d83bbe593d56d0782525c97de079df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/079a23a7b7d83bbe593d56d0782525c97de079df/92_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A screengrab appears to show Alistair Barclay placing a covert recording device in the conservatory of the Ritz hotel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A screengrab appears to show Alistair Barclay placing a covert recording device in the conservatory of the Ritz hotel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sir Frederick Barclay/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Monday, Heather Rogers QC said the defendants felt it was \u201cnecessary and reasonable\u201d to bug the Ritz to protect the family and its business interests. The Barclay brothers\u2019 empire, which is controlled by Aidan and Howard, also includes the delivery firm Yodel and online retailer Very Group. The 114-year-old Ritz was sold earlier this year by Sir David\u2019s side of the family to a Qatari businessman for about \u00a3750m.</p> <p>The defendants have admitted \u201cthe recordings contained private and confidential information of the claimants\u201d and accepted that Sir Fredrick and Amanda were entitled to general damages for breach of confidence, misuse of private information and breach of data protection laws. \u201cThe defendants will seek to agree the appropriate damages/compensation with the claimants,\u201d said Rogers. However, they deny their actions caused any loss to the claimants\u2019 economic and/or financial interests.</p> <p>Sir Frederick and Sir David are no longer beneficiaries of the family trust, and Amanda has been left with a 25% share but no voting power to block any decisions. Aidan and Howard control and run Ellerman Holdings, the holding company for the Barclays\u2019 UK assets.</p> <p>\u201cAs set out clearly in our defence, we do not dispute that the recordings were made and discussed between us,\u201d said a spokesman for the defendants. \u201cThe actions we took were the result of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/22/aidan-and-howard-barclay-break-silence-over-family-feud\">serious concerns about aspects of Sir Frederick\u2019s conduct</a> and were taken in the belief that they were necessary and reasonable to protect the Barclay group\u2019s business interests from potential damage.</p> <p>\u201cWe have never made, and never intended to make, any of the recorded information public. We did not conspire to&nbsp;injure&nbsp;any business&nbsp;or&nbsp;financial interest of Sir Frederick or Amanda.&nbsp;That was never our intention and there was no conspiracy as alleged. We regret any distress caused to Sir Frederick and Amanda Barclay, but our intention has always been to act in the best interests of the entire family.\u201d&nbsp;</p>",

  "<p>A tax incentive for small businesses will be extended for six months as the Morrison government pledges $300m towards encouraging firms to invest.</p> <p>With parliament resuming on Wednesday, the government is set to announce legislation to extend the life of a measure that allows small businesses to instantly write off the value of assets worth up to $150,000 per item.</p> <p>It is the latest in a series of announcements of smaller economic stimulus measures, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/03/morrison-government-to-offer-25000-grants-to-help-build-and-renovate-homes\">last week\u2019s $688m package offering grants for eligible singles and couples planning to build or renovate homes</a> \u2013 a plan that Labor has vowed to scrutinise during the forthcoming parliamentary sitting.</p> <p>The government estimates that as many as 3.5m businesses have annual turnover of less than $500m and are therefore eligible to benefit from the extension of the instant asset write-off \u2013 although it is unclear how many will actually take advantage of it.</p> <p>Assets need to be first used or installed ready for use by 31 December \u2013 extending the 30 June cut-off that was part of one of the first major stimulus packages announced in March. Examples of eligible assets include trucks and tractors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

stimulus package</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said the extended timeframe would help firms to invest in assets to support their business as the economy reopens and coronavirus health restrictions continue to be eased.</p> <p>\u201cThey are designed to support business sticking with investment they had planned, and encouraging them to bring investment forward to support economic growth over the near term,\u201d Frydenberg said in a joint statement with the employment minister, Michaelia Cash.</p> <p>They said the move \u2013 to cost $300m over the budget cycle \u2013 would also help to improve cash flow for businesses by bringing forward tax deductions.</p> <p>\u201cHardworking Australian businesses can rest assured that the Morrison government will do all that is necessary to support them to bounce back stronger and get to the other side of this crisis,\u201d Frydenberg and Cash said.</p> <p>While the initial move to increase access to the write-off for assets of up to $150,000 was announced in March, it is unknown how many firms have taken up the scheme so far, because they will report the data in their 2019-20 tax returns.</p> <p>The government says it will need to legislate to give effect to the six-month extension.</p> <p>That stands in contrast to the homebuilder program, which will provide grants worth $25,000 for eligible singles and couples intending to build a new home as a principal place of residence valued up to $750,000 including the land, or planning to renovate an existing property, with the upgrade valued at between $150,000 and $750,000.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/07/government-stimulus-measures-should-be-subject-to-scrutiny-labor-says\">Government sources confirmed on Sunday</a> that the homebuilder program would be rolled out within existing partnership agreements with the states, and would therefore not be legislated before the parliament.</p> <p>Labor has raised concerns, though, that the package will not do enough to support the building sector and does not include a program of social housing construction.</p> <p>A spokesman for Jason Clare, the shadow housing minister, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that they want to avoid legislation on this because there are some pretty obvious holes in this package that should be subject to scrutiny.\u201d</p> <p>The government has also signalled that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/02/australias-arts-support-package-in-limbo-as-meeting-of-ministers-ends-in-stalemate\">a long-awaited rescue package for the arts and entertainment sector is imminent</a> and is also considering changes to the jobkeeper wage subsidy scheme.</p> <p>During the parliament fortnight, the government is also expected to face questions about its plan to reintroduce childcare fees from 13 July amid concerns of a potential drop-off in attendance once the costs are back.</p> <p>The education minister, Dan Tehan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/08/australian-government-to-end-free-childcare-on-12-july-in-move-labor-says-will-snap-families\">announced on Monday that</a> the old childcare subsidy arrangements would return soon, because demand had been steadily increasing and the emergency relief package had \u201cdone its job\u201d.</p> <p>He revealed the government would stop paying the economy-wide jobkeeper wage subsidy to childcare services from 20 July, replacing this with a total of $708m in transition payments that he conceded may be less than the amount the sector would have received under jobkeeper.</p> <p>Tehan said the government would ease the previous activity test until 4 October in a bid to support eligible families whose employment had been affected by Covid-19.</p> <p>But Georgie Dent, the national campaign director of The Parenthood, said the advocacy group\u2019s recent survey of 2,200 families had found that 42% of respondents indicated at least one parent was earning less as a result of Covid-19.</p> <p>About a third of respondents reported they would need to reduce days or remove their children altogether if out-of-pocket fees returned to pre-Covid-19 levels.</p> <p>\u201cGiven families are already so squeezed financially it\u2019s awful to contemplate that getting back to work might not be possible simply because the cost of childcare is too high,\u201d Dent told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cThe announcement today indicates that the government either ignored what parents have said about the changes to their financial circumstances since Covid-19 or didn\u2019t believe them.</p> <p>\u201cIf a third of families are forced to reduce the number of days their children attend early education and care or remove them altogether, as they said they would be forced to if full fees returned, it will threaten the sector.\u201d</p>",

Other players soon joined him. At the time, the league said it did not condone the protests and Kaepernick has not played in the NFL since he left the San Francisco 49ers at the end of the 2016 season.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/06/nfl-statement-wrong-players-racism-protests-roger-goodell-donald-trump-football\">The NFL did the unthinkable: it gave Donald Trump the middle finger</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The NFL had issued its statement on Friday supporting peaceful protests after a demand from several of the league\u2019s highest-profile black players, including the Super Bowl MVP, Patrick Mahomes.</p> \n<p>Shortly afterwards Goodell released the NFL\u2019s statement. \u201cWe, the National Football League, condemn racism and the systematic oppression of black people,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cWe, the National Football League, admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all players to speak out and peacefully protest. We, the National Football League, believe that black lives matter.\u201d</p> \n<p>Significantly, the NFL did not mention kneeling during the anthem or Kaepernick in the statement. Large parts of the NFL\u2019s fanbase is conservative and both the league and Trump know that many of them see kneeling during the anthem as disrespect of the military and the flag. </p> \n<p>This is not the first time in the last week that Trump, who trails Joe Biden in polls for November\u2019s presidential election, has called out a prominent NFL figure on the subject of the protests. On Friday, New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees apologized for comments he made&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/04/drew-brees-apology-national-anthem-protest-comments-nfl-football\">implying that players who kneel during the national anthem</a>&nbsp;are unpatriotic. </p> \n<p>Trump&nbsp;took aim at Brees later, saying on Twitter: \u201cI am a big fan of Drew Brees. I think he\u2019s truly one of the greatest quarterbacks, but he should not have taken back his original stance on honoring our magnificent American Flag. OLD GLORY is to be revered, cherished, and flown high... We should be standing up straight and tall, ideally with a salute, or a hand on heart. There are other things you can protest, but not our Great American Flag - NO KNEELING!\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBE4y_9Hj2S/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

It has never been. We can no longer use the flag to turn people away or distract them from the real issues that face our black communities. We did this back in 2017, and regretfully I brought it back with my comments this week. We must stop talking about the flag and shift our attention to the real issues of systemic racial injustice, economic oppression, police brutality, and judicial &amp; prison reform. We are at a critical juncture in our nation\u2019s history! If not now, then when? We as a white community need to listen and learn from the pain and suffering of our black communities. We must acknowledge the problems, identify the solutions, and then put this into action. The black community cannot do it alone. This will require all of us.</a></p> \n   <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drewbrees/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Drew Brees</a> (@drewbrees) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-06-06T02:10:07+00:00\">Jun 5, 2020 at 7:10pm PDT</time></p>\n  </div>\n </blockquote> \n <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/us/drew-brees-nfl-trump-instagram-trnd/index.html\">Brees then addressed the president directly</a> in an Instagram post, saying he stood by his apology. \u201cWe can no longer use the flag to turn people away or distract them from the real issues that face our black communities,\u201d he wrote.</p> \n<p>\u201cThrough my ongoing conversations with friends, teammates, and leaders in the black community, I realize this is not an issue about the American flag.

  "<p>The UK should have been a world leader in tacking Covid-19. It has<strong> </strong>universal healthcare delivered through a single, joined-up system, a historically strong public health community and outstanding government scientists and scientific advisers. Instead we lead the world in the worst league tables: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/06/coronavirus-world-map-which-countries-have-the-most-covid-19-cases-and-deaths\">Covid-19 cases and deaths</a>. The initial response from the UK government was too late, but eventually action came. Boris Johnson\u2019s address on 23 March was a strong and clear call to unite and take action together to tackle the epidemic. The whole country visibly got behind the efforts, and by early April there were clear signs the epidemic was slowing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The key tools \u2013 social distancing, contact-tracing and self-isolation \u2013 only work if people fully engage</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, the lack of a clear long-term strategy soon became obvious. Government policies have been reactive, based on short-term tactics aimed at media concerns and on short-term visible gains. This lack of strategy is clear to see. The devastating impact on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/28/why-did-so-many-people-die-of-covid-19-in-the-uks-care-homes\">care homes</a> was entirely predictable, yet still there is no clear strategy of mitigation and future protection. On testing, the much-vaunted targets of 100,000 or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/covid-19-tests-exceed-200000-per-day-target-government-claims\">200,000 daily tests</a> will achieve nothing on their own. Testing needs to be an integral part of strategic efforts to control the epidemic. Whole <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/26/more-than-two-million-operations-cancelled-as-nhs-fights-covid-19\">sections of the NHS ground to a halt</a> with no attempt at strategic planning, and general practice, which should and could have been at the forefront of efforts to control the pandemic, has been largely ignored and left to its own devices.</p> <p>In the face of a global pandemic, the government has pursued its policies in isolation. Travel policies are out of line with neighbouring countries, Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/22/uk-government-accused-of-cover-up-over-eu-scheme-to-buy-ppe\">failed to be part</a> of successful EU efforts to secure PPE supplies, and instead of using an internationally tried and tested tracing app, it wasted time and resources trying to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/07/uk-may-ditch-nhs-contact-tracing-app-for-apple-and-google-model\">develop its own</a>. Most recently we have seen a lifting of lockdown measures while new infections <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/covid-19-spreading-too-fast-to-lift-uk-lockdown-sage-adviser\">are </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/covid-19-spreading-too-fast-to-lift-uk-lockdown-sage-adviser\">estimated to be 8,000</a> per day and with no effective case-finding system in place \u2013 patently a decision taken against scientific advice.</p> <p>Public confidence is critical to beating this epidemic because the key tools \u2013 social distancing, contact-tracing and self-isolation \u2013 only work if people fully engage. Two factors have massively dented public confidence, threatening control efforts. First, the obvious lack of a clear long-term strategy, which creates the impression of a government that is not in control. Second, a series of political mishaps. The health secretary blaming PPE shortages <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/10/matt-hancock-urges-public-not-to-overuse-ppe\">on NHS staff</a>. The prime minister\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/the-week-of-staying-alert-that-left-the-government-in-a-daze-coronavirus-boris-johnson\">confused address</a> to the nation on 10 May. And a top government adviser \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-refuses-to-resign-or-apologise-for-lockdown-breach\">Dominic Cummings</a> \u2013 breaking the very spirit of collective action needed to defeat the epidemic.</p> <p>If we are to control this epidemic, we need the whole country to be united in a collective effort. To achieve this we need to restore trust in the government. A starting point would be an unequivocal apology for the mistakes made so far. For each major error we need a clear plan in place for how the negative impact will be mitigated. We then need a clear long-term strategy for minimising the future impact of the epidemic, covering the possibilities of us getting an effective or partially effective vaccine, or no vaccine at all. This strategy needs to be explained to the whole population, and as new measures are announced, they must be presented as part of this overall strategy.</p> <p>First, the government needs to be transparently guided by the scientific advice. When policy goes against that advice, as it appears to have done with recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/uk-lockdown-must-not-be-lifted-until-covid-19-transmission-is-understood-say-scientists\">relaxations in the lockdown</a>, we need a clear justification. As a scientist I accept that there will be times when wider political or economic considerations mean the chosen policy goes against the science. But we need to know the rationale to build and maintain public trust.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/07/after-six-months-of-coronavirus-how-close-are-we-to-defeating-it\">After six months of coronavirus, how close are we to defeating it?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Second, we need a strategic, systematic approach to testing for Covid-19 with all results linked to people\u2019s NHS health records. This would allow us to understand how the virus is circulating in the community, in institutions, schools and workplaces, and what measures are needed to control it. Third, we need much clearer international cooperation with our partners in Europe and beyond. Fourth, we need a clear plan to minimise future damage and suffering in the care sector. And, finally, we need a clear plan to restart the currently paused functions of the NHS and engage general practice in the fight against the virus, for example as an integral part of the crucial contact-tracing initiative.</p> <p>Only with a clear strategy will we be able to unite the nation in a collective shared response to the epidemic, with everyone accepting that there will be hardship and discomfort, but that together we can beat this. The alternative could leave us facing years of continued devastation. Without collective, united action underpinned by a clear long-term strategy, I fear for us all.</p> <p>\u2022 Liam Smeeth is dean of the Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine</p>",
  "<p>Succession manages to combine the two key quarantine trends of 2020: insanely rich people acting in their own horrible self-interest, and really nice houses that you wish were yours. As such, it has been nothing short of a tragedy that we haven\u2019t been able to watch the show in the UK while under lockdown, since it fell off the streaming services some time after season two aired.</p> <p>However, miracle of miracles, this error has now been rectified. As of today, both seasons of Succession \u2013 our Fleabag and Chernobyl-beating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/02/50-best-tv-shows-2019\">best show of last year</a>, remember \u2013 are available to view again. If you haven\u2019t seen it, you should close this page now and steam through every episode as a matter of urgency as there are <em><strong>spoilers ahead</strong></em>. But if you have, let me whet your appetite for a rewatch with a list of Succession\u2019s best moments.</p> <h2>The car crash</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ff0a61b470e2ed89aa5e415a23eb8766e68907a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ff0a61b470e2ed89aa5e415a23eb8766e68907a/0_345_5196_3118/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kendall Roy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kendall Roy ahead of the unhappy incident.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first season of Succession had to accomplish a lot. Not only did it have to introduce you to some of the worst, least sympathetic characters ever seen on television, but it also had to make you care about them. When the season finale managed to do this, it was like watching a magic trick. Kendall Roy \u2013 the closest thing the series has to a lead \u2013 involves himself in a fatal Chappaquiddick-style car crash. In the immediate aftermath, he finds himself being sucked back into his father\u2019s toxic orbit, and his total helplessness in the moment is enough to smash your heart into dust.</p> <h2>The Roy family softball trip</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43329781bdcfa06a6ecb41be2f8cf9a7143126b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43329781bdcfa06a6ecb41be2f8cf9a7143126b9/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Roy family touchdown for a game of softball.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Roy family touchdown for a game of softball.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How unlikable are the Roy family? Glad you asked. We get a good idea of their complete awfulness in the first episode, when the family take a spontaneous trip to play a game of softball; an operation that involves fleets of helicopters and luxury cars. But when they find themselves a player short, Kieran Culkin\u2019s smarmy Roman approaches the young son of some onlookers and promises him a million dollars if he hits a home run. The boy fails, Roman rips up the cheque in front of him and you have a brand new worst enemy.</p> <h2>The Vaulter headlines</h2> <p>In season two, though, Succession hardened its gaze. It wasn\u2019t just the Roy family in its sights any more; it was the entire online-content industry. One subplot involved the acquisition of Vaulter, a vaguely Vicey/Buzzfeedy/Gawkery website that was kept afloat on an empty wave of pure clickbait. The headlines that ran on vast screens in the background were perfectly judged \u2013 \u201cWait, Is Every Taylor Swift Lyric Secretly Marxist?\u201d, \u201cThis Tinder for Pedophiles App Sounds Like a Really Bad Idea\u201d, \u201c5 Reasons Why Drinking Milk on the Toilet Is Kind of a Game-Changer\u201d \u2013 even if they did hit a little close to home for a man currently employed to write a listicle of TV show moments for the internet.</p> <h2>Boar on the Floor</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYqqW3c2mBU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dYqqW3c2mBU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>People often call Succession Shakespearian, and nowhere was this more evident than with Boar on the Floor, a game instigated by patriarch Logan Roy in season two. The rules of the game are simple: you pick your emotionally weakest dinner guests, and force them to them crawl around on the ground making pig noises while you throw sausages at them and chant: \u201cBoar on the floor\u201d. It\u2019s both a power move and a Guantanamo-level act of total humiliation. When lockdown lifts, try it with your friends.</p> <h2>Logan in Scotland</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0c13192fca149eda2201ae4be66c3ef2c3c2d4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0c13192fca149eda2201ae4be66c3ef2c3c2d4f/0_0_3143_1886/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Logan Roy enjoys a wee dram of scotch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Logan Roy enjoys a wee dram of scotch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A genius move on the part of Succession was to fold in elements of Brian Cox\u2019s life into his character. For instance, in the second season it became apparent that Logan Roy, like Cox, was Scottish. An entire episode was set in his hometown of Dundee. In most shows, this might be an attempt to humanise a monster, but not here. In one scene, Roman reveals that he has bought the Scottish football club Hearts as an ostentateous show of love and loyalty; Logan responds by telling him that he actually supported Hibs, and the wedge between generations becomes even bleaker.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Roman and Gerri\u2019s phone sex</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwGwXMdW4jU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DwGwXMdW4jU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The characters on Succession are all so broken that even romance ends up rotten and curdled. In the episode Safe Room, Roman rings his father\u2019s counsel, Gerri, to complain about nothing in particular, and they quickly fall into a bout of excruciating phone sex. \u201cYou disgusting little pig,\u201d she tells him as he masturbates on his bed. \u201cYou are a revolting little worm.\u201d Just to compound the awkwardness of the scene, Roman later proposes to Gerri.</p> <h2>Logan Roy screams at a car</h2> <p>This is why you hire Brian Cox. At the end of the second season\u2019s sixth episode, Logan learns that a skin-saving multi-billion-dollar deal he has long been angling for with his rival Nan Pierce has fallen through. For most of the series, Logan is the gruff puppet master. But as the rug is pulled from beneath him and he realises that he cannot talk his way out of it, he loses control and erupts in an orgy of genuinely frightening anger. \u201cWe haven\u2019t finished! We haven\u2019t fucking finished!\u201d he screams at Nan\u2019s car as it leaves, with such intensity you assume it will end in a heart attack. The man deserves all the awards going.</p> <h2>Kendall\u2019s rap</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDQTc-9kM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6dUDQTc-9kM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cBitches be catty/ But the king\u2019s my daddy / Rock all the haters while we go roll a fatty / Squiggle on the decks / Kenny on the rhymes / And Logan big ballin\u2019 on Hamptons time / L to the OG / Dude be the OG / A-N he playin\u2019 / Playin\u2019 like a pro\u201d. In years to come, this will be the moment that Succession is remembered for. In the meantime, it just appeared on Spotify.</p> <h2>Tom eats the chicken</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtwpy_AdyU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GCtwpy_AdyU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Tom might be the best character on Succession, an outsider who married into the family and simply cannot keep up with all their craven behaviour. In the season two finale, set aboard a comically extravagant yacht, he finally regains a scrap of control. Scared for his job and publicly humiliated, with his marriage in tatters, Tom (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/29/matthew-macfadyen-we-are-all-living-by-the-seat-of-our-pants\">played by Matthew Macfadyen</a>) sits down next to Logan and \u2013 without saying a word \u2013 grabs a handful of his food and rams it into his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s so batty and odd and so&nbsp;<em>Succession</em>, that moment,\u201d Macfadyen <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/succession-season-2-finale-matthew-macfadyen.html\">said after the episode</a>. \u201cTom\u2019s really at a low ebb. He thinks,&nbsp;Fuck it, you know?\u201d</p> <h2>The press conference</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQh0_CzjKko\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jQh0_CzjKko?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Finally, here\u2019s the moment that will vault Succession into the future. The season two finale ended with Kendall decisively breaking away from the clutches of his father, by holding a press conference where he finally told the world the truth about all of Logan\u2019s wrongdoings. On its own, the moment was utterly explosive. But then we cut back to Logan, watching the conference from the yacht. His unknowable smile \u2013 maybe pride, maybe contempt, maybe excitement at finally having a worthy foe \u2013 could send Succession in any direction whenever it returns.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Succession is available on Sky, the streaming service Now TV, and via digital download now</em></p>",
  "<p>Pressure from Facebook staff is continuing to mount on Mark Zuckerberg over his policies towards posts by Donald Trump, with moderators joining those criticising their boss for his stance.</p> <p>The moderators penned an open letter to their colleagues in support of virtual walkouts that have broken out at the company, after Zuckerberg refused to take down posts by Trump that many believed breached the site\u2019s policies on incitement of violence.</p> <p>\u201cWe would walk out with you \u2013 if Facebook would allow it,\u201d the moderators write. <a href=\"https://medium.com/@fbcontentmods/this-is-a-message-of-solidarity-from-a-group-of-current-and-former-content-moderators-at-facebook-6af1b3b2a020\">In their statement</a>, all the company\u2019s currently employed moderators remained anonymous, highlighting the precarious nature of their employment, which is subcontracted out through third parties.</p> <p>\u201cAs outsourced contractors, non-disclosure agreements deter us from speaking openly about what we do and witness for most of our waking hours. Safety and data protection are important, but so is a healthy debate about what happens at Facebook.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t walk out, but we cannot stay silent \u2026&nbsp;Facebook can do better,\u201d the letter continues. \u201cWe need to express that Mr Zuckerberg\u2019s words about personal dismay caused by Trump\u2019s \u2018looting and shooting\u2019 rhetoric are not enough. The benefit of the doubt this politician is being given as a user, even with such a large platform, is unparalleled \u2013 the attempt to retroactively place his words behind the context of other posts actually has had effect of putting it on an isolated pedestal. This may be the ultimate exhibit of white exceptionality and further legitimisation of state brutality we have witnessed in the last weeks.\u201d</p> <p>The precariousness of their employment situation has even limited the ability of the moderators to put together a statement of support. \u201cWe are so alienated, even more with working from home,\u201d one currently employed moderator told the Guardian. They, and a colleague, both asked to speak anonymously for fear that they would lose their jobs for breaking a non-disclosure agreement. \u201cWe are not able to speak freely because we communicate mainly on the company channels. It\u2019s really tricky to even talk about it, to find someone and ask if they want to sign this sort of statement.\u201d</p> <p>The letter was co-ordinated by the <a href=\"https://www.foxglove.org.uk/\">legal nonprofit Foxglove</a>, whose co-founder Cori Crider said: \u201cZuckerberg could do so much more to make his platform safe and equal, and the real experts in that are the moderators themselves \u2013 people who clear the hate speech and violence off Facebook day in and day out.&nbsp;But their contracts are so precarious it\u2019s almost impossible for them to organise, or to speak up the way employees can. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/02/google-workers-sign-letter-temp-contractors-protest\">Google walkout showed massive&nbsp;solidarity&nbsp;with Google\u2019s precarious contract workers</a>; this is a golden opportunity for Facebook staff to follow suit.\u201d</p> <p>The walkouts began on 1 June, as dissatisfaction within Facebook spilled out into the public sphere. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/01/facebook-workers-rebel-mark-zuckerberg-donald-trump\">Employees took to Twitter</a> to state their opposition to Zuckerberg\u2019s personal decision to take no action against Trump for a post published amid unrest in Minneapolis that said \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d. Twitter hid Trump\u2019s post and added a warning, but Zuckerberg decided to leave the post intact.</p> <p>Employees then staged a virtual walkout that was quickly endorsed by the company as an act of protest. \u201cWe encourage employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson said at the time.</p> <p>After the walkouts, pressure mounted: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/02/mark-zuckerberg-criticised-by-civil-rights-leaders-over-donald-trump-facebook-post\">employees resigned</a> as activist leaders condemned Zuckerberg for \u201csetting a very dangerous precedent\u201d, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/06/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-trump-scientists\">more than 140 scientists directly funded</a> by the Facebook founder\u2019s personal charity called on him to take action over the weekend. On Saturday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/05/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-trump-policies-review\">Zuckerberg made another public statement</a>, promising to \u201creview potential options\u201d for how to intervene.</p> <p>As well as expressing general support for their directly employed colleagues, the moderators wanted to highlight the direct effects racism and police brutality has on their work. \u201cWe are definitely seeing more difficult content in our [moderation] queues recently,\u201d one told the Guardian. \u201cWe are seeing a lot of police brutality \u2013&nbsp;the images we are seeing from the US are just terrible. My colleague told me they are quitting the queues today because they saw three videos from the protests in a row and they can\u2019t handle it.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re also seeing an increase in hate speech and racism, not only in our queues but also amongst ourselves. I have heard a few people, who I would have never expected, express racist opinions \u2013&nbsp;this work is impacting our attitudes and our views.\u201d</p> <p>The moderators\u2019 letter ends with a plea to Zuckerberg \u201cand the rest of Facebook management to reconsider this decision [to take no action against] Donald Trump, to listen and honour the voices of its black employees and users.</p> <p>\u201cTo the employees themselves \u2013 solidarity. Let\u2019s mourn. Let\u2019s organize. Let\u2019s unionize. #BlackLivesMatter\u201d</p>",

This is an intense time for our community, and the most important thing is for us to maintain momentum and not lose sight of how critical it is to pursue long term solutions and commitments, for the sake of our generation, and the next. Our individual pursuits of success and belonging remain, but now more than ever, it\u2019s important to use this movement as fuel to inspire new ways of thinking, building, and growing, together. I believe any great movement starts with a renewal of the mind. I know you\u2019re all thinking, what\u2019s next? Where do we go from here? Because I\u2019m thinking the same shit! Conversations about black businesses, ownership and support are happening, and I will continue to have these conversations with the full intention of birthing ideas that are sustainable and tangible. Let\u2019s increase our knowledge! I\u2019m excited to see an awakening happening in all of us! I\u2019ll continue to use my platform to fight against the injustices and inequalities in our community, no matter what. Nonetheless, one man can\u2019t do it alone - I need you, and we need each other! We need everyone, across industry\u2019s, soci-economic backgrounds, countries, to unite with a shared goal of REAL change. Before the pandemic hit, I visited a few schools in Southwark, to share my journey and to truly understand the minds and needs of our next generation. It was eye opening and inspiring to say the least, and I look forward to continuing this work, and contributing more, once it is safe to do so. I urge the black men of our community, my peers, to do the same. Connecting with our kids and motivating them towards a future that is stronger and brighter, is urgent, and necessary. In the meantime, let\u2019s work on clearing the runway for them, so they can take off, and fly. Love everyone, and stay safe x</a></p> \n   <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/johnboyega/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> John Boyega</a> (@johnboyega) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-06-07T10:17:57+00:00\">Jun 7, 2020 at 3:17am PDT</time></p>\n  </div>\n </blockquote> \n <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/04/john-boyega-anti-racism-speech-wins-praise-star-wars-costars-black-lives-matter\">Boyega won wide praise after his impromptu speech</a> at a Black Lives Matter rally in London on 3 June in support of the widespread protests in the US over the killing of George Floyd. \u201cBlack lives have always mattered,\u201d Boyega said in his speech. \u201cWe have always been important.

Second, if you have the opportunity, tell your story.\u201d</p> <p>Mapanje has continued to tell his story in the poems of more recent collections \u2013 including some happier narratives from his current life in the UK. A senior lecturer at the Newcastle University, he published <a href=\"https://www.bloodaxebooks.com/ecs/product/greetings-from-grandpa-1120\">Greetings from Grandpa</a> in 2016. &nbsp;Skipping Without Ropes comes from the collection of that title, first published in 1998. It\u2019s one of the many prison poems included in The Last of the Sweet Bananas: New and Selected Poems.</p> <p>Poems in jail had to be memorised rather than written down, and Skipping Without Ropes reflects this process of composition. It is not simply repetitive, but accumulates energy and rage. Jumping, with or without rope, is an activity dependent on resistance to gravity. The hard ground under the bouncing soles of Mapanje\u2019s poem is the prison yard, and under that, the political system.&nbsp;The plural of the title proclaims the breadth of its reach.</p> <p>Mapanje doesn\u2019t spare much time on the backstory: he\u2019s in performative mode. \u201cI will, I will skip without your rope / Since you say I should not, I cannot / Borrow your son\u2019s skipping rope.\u201d Even so, he tells us something significant about the moment of disempowerment. The speaker isn\u2019t permitted the briefest respite of a period of exercise involving a change of status. He isn\u2019t allowed a child\u2019s toy: he isn\u2019t allowed to be his country\u2019s son \u2013 not even a surrogate son.</p> <p>The second stanza reveals that he has earlier asked for a \u201clace\u201d \u2013 presumably a shoelace \u2013 and that request, too, has been refused. The humiliations are small in the context of the imprisonment, but toxic: they sting the speaker into rage. But it\u2019s not only rage: \u201cI will create my own rope, my own / Hope and skip without your rope.\u201d The rope doesn\u2019t have to be the noose of a self-hanging. It produces a \u201cforged hope\u201d in stanza three, then, again, simply a hope (\u201cI do without your / Rope but with my hope\u201d). The mind resists, the will insists, and the hope comes into being.</p> <p>You can hear the speaker\u2019s feet pounding the concrete as he counts jumps, and, in jolting line breaks such as those after \u201cyour\u201d&nbsp;(stanzas five and six), gasps of breathlessness. He simultaneously&nbsp;works up a sweat and his contempt. Physical disgust at the prison food (\u201cweevil pigeon peas\u201d) sparks off moral disgust at the self-aggrandisement of the tyrant \u2013 \u201cyour Excellency Life / Glory\u201d.</p> <p>Although a powerful performance on the page, <a href=\"https://www.bloodaxebooks.com/ecs/product/the-last-of-the-sweet-bananas-775\">the poem needs to be heard</a>. Describing the kinds of mental torture inflicted on the prisoners, Mapanje leaves you in a better position to appreciate the images in stanza two. Notice also how his voice changes at the end of the poem, when he demands \u201cGuards! Take us for a shower!\u201d The exclamation marks in might suggest a joke or a taunt. It\u2019s neither, as you\u2019ll hear.</p> <p>Political progress, the poem reminds us, is not by polite invitation: there\u2019s&nbsp;no outstretched hand from authority, no sharing of rope by the prison guards. It has to be conjured up, energised, and repeatedly re-energised, from the mind and body of the activist. Skipping with the imagined rope, Jack Mapanje, as man and poet, makes a creative force of anger that sounds through the world\u2019s many starless nights.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>Skipping Without Ropes appears in <a href=\"https://www.bloodaxebooks.com/ecs/product/the-last-of-the-sweet-bananas-775\">The Last of the Sweet Bananas: New &amp; Selected Poems</a> (Bloodaxe Books, 2004).</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Connor Scott and Vidya Patel were both winners at 2015\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p023t1xz\">BBC Young Dancer competition</a>, she taking the South Asian dance category, he the overall title. It\u2019s not the kind of contest that offers the equivalent of a record deal and a No 1 hit, but their careers have been steadily on the rise, Patel collaborating with choreographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/dance-blog/2016/jan/12/bbc-young-dancer-vidya-patel-kathak-indian-classical-dance\">Richard Alston</a>, Scott touring with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/06/mam-review-michael-keegan-dolan-sadlers-wells-teac-damsa\">Michael Keegan-Dolan</a>.</p> <p>They\u2019ve also worked together, and the resulting duet, About the Elephant, was filmed in 2018 at Newcastle\u2019s Dance City and is available online from The Space. There are no flashy competition moves here; the shooting and staging are unfancy. There is no set, just an empty stage bathed in blue light, but when you\u2019ve got two people and a connection, you don\u2019t need much else.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAUXEbr_G3M\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MAUXEbr_G3M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Patel and Scott come from different dance styles (Patel from kathak, Scott from contemporary, although he originally started in Latin and ballroom), but they\u2019re both very precise dancers and their energy is as closely matched as their identical wheat-gold tunics and skirts. At first they face one another, not touching, but moving with the same breath. Their arms circle each other, skirting the currents of air, then Scott gently grabs Patel\u2019s wrist and her hand flutters like a fledgling\u2019s wing. Patel\u2019s hands are beautiful, that articulacy ingrained from her kathak training. No matter what she\u2019s doing her hands are always composed, in the way a ballet dancer\u2019s toes are always pointed.</p> <p>The connection between the dancers isn\u2019t romantic, but it is tender and very present. Sometimes they move exactly in unison, sometimes tiny details deliberately diverge (Patel\u2019s fingers stretched out, Scott\u2019s folded to his palms), elsewhere they digress into their own modes \u2013 Patel\u2019s tight corkscrew turns versus Scott\u2019s more expansive curlicues \u2013 before returning to the fold.</p> <p>The third person on stage is musician Shammi Pithia, creating an airy soundscape with bansuri flute. The blurb says this is a piece about looking for clarity in a world of noise, and yes, you can see that clarity, for sure. But more simply it\u2019s a conversation between two styles and two people, a palpable meeting of energies between two bodies \u2013 all the more potent since it\u2019s just the thing many of us are missing right now.</p>",

Thank you, as always, to those who took the time to reach out on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">Twitter</a> and elsewhere. </p> \n  <p>Here are the key developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Minneapolis city council pledged to defund city\u2019s police department. </strong>A veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis city council announced its intent to dismantle the city\u2019s police department and invest in community-led public safety, a move that would mark the first concrete victory in the mounting nationwide movement to defund law enforcement agencies in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd. My colleague Sam Levin explains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">here</a> what defunding the police might mean. </li> \n   <li><strong>New York City\u2019s mayor pledged to cut police department funding. </strong>New York City mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday pledged to cut the police department\u2019s funding, shifting the savings to social services. In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">tweet</a> from the City of New York shared by the mayor, de Blasio outlines policing reforms, including a plan to \u201cShift funding from NYPD to to Youth and Social Services.\u201d </li> \n   <li><strong>New York City\u2019s curfew was lifted. </strong>De Blasio also lifted a citywide 8pm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/george-floyd-protests-curfew-rules-arrests\">curfew</a> that drew extensive criticism for intensifying tensions between protesters and police \u2013 including numerous accounts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/new-york-police-brutality-protests-george-floyd\">brutality</a> against participants in demonstrations following the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd.</a> </li> \n   <li><strong>A protester was shot in Seattle. </strong>A man drove a car into a demonstration and shot a protester in Seattle, Washington.<strong> </strong>It\u2019s unclear exactly what happened, but police said officers have a man <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeattlePD/status/1269836366109536262\">in custody</a> who drove a car into a crowd at 11th avenue and Pine street, and that officers recovered a gun. Video footage shows a man driving a black sedan into the gathering, and catches a loud bang before the man exits the vehicle, gun in hand. The man then walks into the crowd with the gun at his side.</li> \n   <li><strong>US attorney general said troops were a last resort. </strong>The US attorney general, William Barr, appeared on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, where he was asked about the decision to have military troops on standby to respond to US citizens exercising their right to protest. \u201cI think our position was common, which was that they should only be deployed ... as a last resort and that we didn\u2019t think we would need them. I think everyone was on the same page,\u201d he said. Reports emerged last week that Donald Trump wanted 10,000 active troops to be ordered on to the streets of America to police the protests. Barr denied that accusation on Sunday. \u201cThe president never asked or suggested that we needed to deploy regular troops at that point,\u201d he said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Thousands marched in Phoenix, Arizona,</strong> where protesters rally not just for George Floyd, but for Dion Johnson<strong>, </strong>a 28-year-old black man who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-minneapolis-minnesota-us-twitter-donald-trump-latest-news-live?page=with:block-5ed1ebe48f084df971c8c71b#block-5ed1ebe48f084df971c8c71b\">shot and killed </a>by an Arizona Department of Public Safety officer.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T07:07:42.569Z\">at 8.07am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edde0218f0883ec2fc1cbb1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:55:45.212Z\">7.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">New York City Mayor pledges to cut police department funding</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday pledged to cut the police department\u2019s funding, shifting it instead to social services. </p> \n  <p>In a tweet from the City of New York shared by the mayor, de Blasio outlines policing reforms, including a plan to \u201cShift funding from NYPD to to Youth and Social Services.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe amount will be finalized with the city council during the budget process,\u201d the statement says:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYCMayor?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NYCMayor</a> announces new policing reforms in New York City: <a href=\"https://t.co/aWQgz0NBDK\">pic.twitter.com/aWQgz0NBDK</a></p>\u2014 City of New York (@nycgov) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 7, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edddd318f08bd75dbb63dca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:40:20.014Z\">7.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As always, please do get in touch with questions, comments, news and tips from your part of the US on twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">@helenrsullivan</a> or via email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:41:33.047Z\">at 7.41am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edddbfe8f083999a26dbfa5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:37:07.408Z\">7.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Meanwhile British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted on Sunday that the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1269724206440370178?s=20\">anti-racism protests in the UK</a> were \u201csubverted by thuggery\u201d, after some protestors clashed with police in London: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1269724206440370178\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">People have a right to protest peacefully &amp; while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police.

Wolf was asked the question on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday, by host Martha Raddatz, who pointed out <strong>African Americans are killed by police at twice the rate of white Americans</strong>.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI do not think that we have a systemic racism problem with law enforcement officers across this country,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cDo I acknowledge that there are <strong>some law enforcement officers that abuse their jobs?</strong> Yes. And again, we need to hold those accountable. And I would say that there are individuals in every profession across this country that probably abuse their authority and their power ... </p> \n  <p>\u201cI think painting law enforcement with a broad brush of systemic racism is really <strong>a disservice to the men and women who put on the badge</strong>, the uniform every day. Risk their lives every day to protect the American people, to protect them so that they can go to school. They can have a business and come home safe to their families.

Here, it\u2019s the virus that\u2019s in charge,\u201d Rouse said. \u201cIt\u2019s our ability to really combat the virus. And there\u2019s so much uncertainty there.\u201d</p> <p>Even as stay-at-home orders have lifted across the US in recent weeks, millions remain out of work as businesses grasp for a new normal.</p> <p>Max Katz-Balmes, who majored in environmental studies and economics at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, had lined up a paid position directing an outdoor summer camp for kids in California, until it was cancelled.

It took about a month to hear anything; then, he had to&nbsp;submit his application<strong>&nbsp;</strong>again because he messed up the first time.&nbsp;He is waiting for a response.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to have to take out loans or rely on my parents,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fear of not knowing whether or not I have this unemployment support, or what the world will look like in a couple years, or if jobs will be available for my classmates or whatever, those uncertainties definitely are stressful.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Gabriel Lara, who just earned his degree from Chicago-Kent College of Law, is working remotely as a law clerk, and he already has an offer to be a full-time attorney. But that role, which was supposed to begin in September, has now been postponed until January.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely made me have to figure out how to survive on savings for more time,\u201d Lara said.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Impossible choices</h2> <p>High school&nbsp;graduates&nbsp;are also having to adapt.&nbsp;Jayde Alioto, who is&nbsp;graduating&nbsp;from Forest high school in Florida this month, said she tried to file for unemployment multiple times after being laid off as a hotel server and losing catering gigs. But she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/15/florida-unemployment-system-coronavirus-applications\">couldn\u2019t access the website</a> because, she thinks, so many others were also trying to claim benefits.&nbsp;</p> <p>Alioto was unemployed for about six weeks but now works at a local restaurant as she makes plans to take a course in phlebotomy.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve pretty much been taking stuff week by week,\u201d&nbsp;she said.&nbsp;\u201cBecause with everything going on, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen.\u201d</p> <p>Even&nbsp;graduates&nbsp;in \u201cessential\u201d professions are struggling to drum up work. Elissa Gibbons just earned her associate degree in nursing from Austin Community College in Texas, and before spring break she applied to pediatric positions at hospitals. Soon after, she started getting emails saying the facilities were no longer hiring.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a big believer in everything happens for a reason, and so we shall see what happens,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat comes from all this.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Experts voiced empathy for all&nbsp;graduates&nbsp;but said they expected the worst of the financial crisis to fall on people who&nbsp;generally didn\u2019t have the luxury of a college degree, as it<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/12/great-recession-still-with-us/547268/\">&nbsp;did following the last financial crisis</a>. Manufacturing, services and tourism are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61b4bc60-5e4b-11ea-b0ab-339c2307bcd4\">expected to</a>&nbsp;disproportionately struggle.</p> <p>\u201cOur concern is primarily with those who have been educated with narrow technical training and the promise of an immediate job,\u201d said Lynn Pasquerella, president of the Association of American Colleges and Universities.&nbsp;</p> <p>Taytum McGill, who studied&nbsp;salon and spa management&nbsp;at Northeast Alabama Community College, had been saving up to attend eyelash certifications, color correction trainings and spray tan classes. Suddenly, they have all been cancelled. The 19-year-old is leaning on two jobs right now \u2013&nbsp;one at her alma mater, the other at a local restaurant \u2013 but she still can\u2019t afford to live independent from her parents.&nbsp;</p> <p>Regardless, she is confident in her career outlook,&nbsp;once she lands an interview and starts working in a salon.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll ever go back to normal. I\u2019m very hopeful that it will. But even if it doesn\u2019t, I feel like I could still build clientele that would help me in the future,\u201d McGill said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Others are more pessimistic. When Abigail Randall, a senior at the University of Washington, searches for work in her wheelhouse \u2013&nbsp;public relations, creative film and marketing \u2013&nbsp;so many of the positions are either part-time internships or unpaid roles. She tried applying to work in a credit union\u2019s call center, but within an hour and a half, she got a rejection email.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to put into words. It feels like I\u2019m being asked to make yet another impossible series of choices,\u201d she said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Marianne Wanamaker,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>an associate professor of economics at the University of Tennessee,&nbsp;warned that in this inhospitable economy, students shouldn\u2019t just wait around for their dream jobs. Once the downturn eases, they will be able to switch roles,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>but&nbsp;\u201cit\u2019s easier to get a job when you already have a job\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>Young people who can\u2019t find a paid internship or job right now should volunteer if they can, or enroll in some kind of online training, Pasquerella suggested.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe important part is creating a narrative between their education, what they\u2019re doing now for personal and professional development and what employers are seeking,\u201d she said.&nbsp;</p> <p>The landscape may be grim, but it isn\u2019t completely barren of opportunity,&nbsp;experts suggested. Amanda Sloat, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/opinion/contributors/2020/04/22/graduating-pandemic/3000450001/\">listed&nbsp;a slew</a>&nbsp;of virtual internships and online volunteer ideas that recent&nbsp;graduates&nbsp;can take up while they search for jobs.</p> <p>\u201cThis is just a much earlier example of life being very unpredictable and forcing students to be much more flexible, and also developing a real sense of resilience and ability to withstand the uncertainty,\u201d said Sloat. \u201cAnd to adapt, and to think creatively.\u201d</p> <p>Back in California, Guerra is keeping her options open. She has jumped on a lot of phone interviews, but she is not finding&nbsp;many opportunities in her fields of interest: education and policy reform. She has read articles claiming that now is the time to go back to school, and she is keen on the idea \u2013&nbsp;but first, she needs a job to pay her rent.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThat should be, like, our slogan. \u2018Adapt and overcome, class of 2020\u2019,\u201d Guerra said. \u201cIt\u2019s what we have to do.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>When the Neameh sailed out of Colombia on 4 May, it should have been a routine shipment: just over 4,000 cattle, on their way to Egypt, an important hub for the global trade in live animal exports.</p> <p>But accusations of cocaine smuggling and a police raid of the ship&nbsp;lengthened the journey.</p> <p>As the Neameh sailed into the mouth of the Mediterranean in the early hours of 21 May, it was apprehended close to Gibraltar by Spanish customs agents and the Spanish navy on suspicion of cocaine trafficking.</p> <p>Spain\u2019s health ministry did not allow any of the cattle to disembark, or the offloading any carcasses, while customs and police searching the ship were unable to use sniffer dogs because of the stench.

While 20 were normally tasked with taking care of the livestock, just three or four labourers were permitted to care for the animals while the search took place.</p> <p> The ones chosen were apparently unfamiliar with what needed to be done to keep them safe and healthy. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t conduct proper feeding and watering,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cattle lay down, but normal practice is to get them up and then put out the feed so that no cattle jump on top of one another.

  "<p>Swimmers itching to take advantage of the easing of lockdown to have their first sea bathes or wild swims of the summer should pick their spot wisely: only two-thirds of the UK\u2019s bathing waters are of excellent quality, according to the latest data, putting Britain near the bottom of <a href=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/quality-of-europes-bathing-waters\">Europe\u2019s league table for bathing water quality</a>.</p> <p>Most of the rest of the UK\u2019s beaches were of good or sufficient quality last year, with fewer than one in 20 judged to be poor, in the annual survey by the European Environment Agency.</p> <p>While the UK\u2019s showing was better than the previous year, with 66% of sites reaching the \u201cexcellent\u201d standard for 2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/06/uk-near-bottom-of-european-bathing-waters-league-table\">compared with 63% in 2018</a>, it came in sixth from bottom in the survey of European countries, comprising EU member states plus Switzerland and Albania. Overall, 85% of bathing sites surveyed by the EU\u2019s environmental watchdog received the top rating of excellent for 2019.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/euwater-zip/giv-3902ugRehgJmrK1k/\" data-alt=\"graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/euwater-zip/giv-3902ugRehgJmrK1k/\">graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Poland appeared to score worst, with only 22% of sites being of excellent quality, far below the next lowest on the list, Albania, where 59% of sites qualified for the top rating. However, the survey\u2019s compilers noted that Poland\u2019s poor showing was affected by the large number of newly identified sites \u2013 419 out of 606; this meant monitoring was incomplete. Of the 187 sites which were classified, they said, about 70% were found to be excellent.</p> <p>Only 5% of monitored sites across Europe failed to reach the minimum rating of \u201csufficient\u201d. The survey does not take account of all possible bathing waters, monitoring only commonly used coastal beaches and some inland sites.</p> <p>Earlier this year, UK campaigners <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/06/push-for-bathing-water-quality-hailed-game-changer-uk-rivers\">called for communities to apply for bathing water status for their swimming spots</a>, which forces water companies and the Environment Agency to clean up the water if it does not meet requirements. In many areas, water companies are legally allowed to discharge untreated sewage into waterways, but having rivers designated as bathing areas means these outflows can be curtailed.</p> <p>Swimmers are also warned that the EEA data is from last year and so does not take into account the impacts of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/16/2019-was-bad-year-for-floods-and-drought-in-england-say-charities\">unusually wet winter</a> followed by an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/29/uk-spring-the-sunniest-since-records-began-says-met-office\">exceptionally dry spring</a>. Bathers are advised to check before setting out and to heed the government\u2019s rules on physical distancing, as well as any local restrictions in force.</p> <p>Out of 22,295 bathing sites in Europe, nearly 85% were of excellent quality, according to the EEA report. Cyprus, Austria, Malta, Greece and Croatia topped the list with more than 95% of all sites proving to be of excellent quality. </p> <p>The EU\u2019s environment commissioner said countries should not take high quality water for granted. \u201cClean bathing water is usually taken as something that is gifted, but it\u2019s actually one of the European collective achievements,\u201d said Virginijus Sinkevi\u010dius. \u201cIt\u2019s the result of hard work by many people over many years. This year\u2019s report once again confirms that European citizens can continue to enjoy very high quality standards when bathing in European waters and all measures must be taken to continue along this path.\u201d</p> <p>Before the UK was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/13/the-eus-effect-on-blackpools-beaches-before-and-after-pictures\">forced by EU regulations to clean up beaches</a> and inland waterways, many were unfit for swimming and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/03/brexit-would-return-britain-to-being-dirty-man-of-europe\">heavily polluted</a> with sewage or other effluent. Campaigners are concerned that the UK could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/these-three-post-brexit-bills-bulldoze-a-hole-through-environmental-protections\">water down some of its environmental commitments</a> after Brexit without firm EU directives to follow on measures such as water and air quality.</p> <p>The quality of UK beaches has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/may/27/uk-beaches-europe-cyprus-malta\">risen and fallen in recent years</a>, and can vary markedly based on factors such as droughts, which cause sewage to back up, followed by heavy rain, which can flush it out into rivers and on to beaches. This year\u2019s showing continues a poor run compared with earlier this decade, however, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/may/21/quality-uk-beaches-wet-weather\">83% of beaches were rated excellent in 2011</a>.</p> <p>After Brexit the UK can still submit to monitoring by the EEA, which as part of its remit reports on several other European or neighbouring states that are not EU members, including Iceland, Greenland, Norway and Turkey.</p> <p>\u201cRegular monitoring and assessment of bathing water are essential for ensuring that we maintain the already very high quality across Europe and, where needed, we take effective measures to address water pollution,\u201d said Hans Bruyninckx, the executive director of the EEA. \u201cCleaner bathing waters do not only benefit our own health and wellbeing, but also the health of the environment.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 and 12 June 2020 to include detailed figures for Poland and to make it clear that the country\u2019s poor showing was affected by a large number of sites where monitoring was incomplete, and that of those sites which were classified, about 70% were found to be excellent.</p>",
  "<p>Andrew Knapper moved to the UK from Canada in January 2005 for a temporary contract, but never expected to stay. \u201cI was based in Stirling in Scotland for a nine-month role in management consultancy,\u201d he says. One Sunday that summer, he and a friend decided to go for a hike up Ben Lomond. He didn\u2019t know it at the time, but Rachel Hirst wasn\u2019t far behind. \u201cIt was one of those rare sunny days in Scotland, so I thought I\u2019d go for a walk before getting on with some work,\u201d she says. When she got to the top, she found herself sitting near Andrew.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI was wearing my rain trousers that day as it had been cloudy in the morning,\u201d he says.&nbsp;\u201cBut, as a Canadian, I have always called them pants. I was talking to my friend about whether I would need to wear them on the way down.\u201d Rachel found it hilarious. \u201cI overheard him ask his friend if he should take his pants off and I burst out laughing. I told him, as a good English girl, I\u2019d always been taught to keep my pants on.\u201d</p> <p>They soon got chatting and Rachel joined Andrew and his friend on a different route back down the mountain. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, because up until that point I had been very happy being single. But walking down that hill, I knew there was something there,\u201d she says. \u201cI asked if I could stand him a pint when we got to the bottom and he found that really funny.\u201d After drinks at the pub, they exchanged numbers. \u201cShe texted me afterwards to say how much she\u2019d enjoyed herself. She never did make it to the office that afternoon.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Due to other commitments, it took them three weeks to set up a date. \u201cOn the third week, my sister\u2019s godmother was staying with me, but I couldn\u2019t put him off again,\u201d says Rachel. Instead, he joined them on a trip to <a href=\"https://www.nts.org.uk/visit/places/the-hill-house\">The Hill House</a> in Helensburgh. \u201cI was on my best behaviour,\u201d says Andrew. \u201cLater on, she [the godmother] went home and we were able to get to know each other better. We pretty much became a couple that day.\u201d The pair discovered they had lots in common and shared passions for hiking and travelling. At the end of the year, they went to Jordan together and took plenty of trips around the UK.&nbsp;</p> <p>The following summer, Andrew began work in Belgium, returning to see Rachel in Glasgow every weekend. \u201cSometimes I would go and meet him in Amsterdam or Paris or Prague. We had lots of little adventures.\u201d They moved in together in July 2007 and got married the following month in the Yorkshire Dales, where her family lived. Their first son was born in 2008. \u201cHe was a honeymoon baby, but he came early. I spent a lot of time reminding people he was early,\u201d says Rachel, laughing. \u201cOur second son was born in 2010.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Rachel works as an ecologist and Andrew has continued his work in consulting, across the UK and abroad. He went to Australia for a project in 2016, which she says was \u201creally hard\u201d. One of the nice things about lockdown is that they are able to spend more time together.&nbsp;</p> <p>Andrew says that, while Rachel is beautiful and intelligent, they also have shared values. \u201cShe has a strong sense of what it means to be a family, which I have always appreciated, especially when I am far away from my home,\u201d he says. For Rachel, it is her partner\u2019s relaxed nature that makes their relationship work so well. \u201cHe\u2019s never fazed by anything and he\u2019s always prepared. When I am busy flapping, he keeps me in check.\u201d</p> <p>When lockdown is over, the couple plan to spend more time travelling and exploring with their boys. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken them to see Ben Lomond before, to see where we met,\u201d says Rachel. \u201cThey call it our mountain.

  "<p>With the US presidential election looming, equal rights groups and others on the left say the protests<strong> </strong>sparked by George Floyd\u2019s death can translate into a surge in young people voting in November.</p> <p>While Donald Trump\u2019s autocratic response to the demonstrations has shocked young people into action in the US and beyond, advocates believe the movement against police brutality has energized youth voters to think beyond the presidential election, which could have a real impact on state and local elections, where decisions about policing and criminal justice are made.</p> <p>Around the country, people running for local office say they are already seeing a spike in enthusiasm among 18- to 29-year-olds, who historically vote in smaller numbers than their elders.</p> <p>\u201cI have so many young kids reaching out to our campaign, saying: \u2018How do we volunteer, can I intern to learn more, I\u2019d really like to run for office,\u201d said Nada Elmikashfi, a 24-year-old <a href=\"https://www.nadaforwisconsin.com/\">candidate for state senate</a> in Wisconsin.</p> <p>\u201cI think whatever political apathy afflicted our generation, it isn\u2019t a choice any more.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Elmikashfi, who has been part of protests in Madison, Wisconsin\u2019s capital city, said the brutal death of Floyd has \u201cbrought a lot of attention on down-ballot races\u201d, but she isn\u2019t sure whether that enthusiasm will carry over to the presidential election, where Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate, has faced criticism for his responses to the demonstrations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"64da25304afa6480725db6d2252d97f1fce0dac3\"> <img

</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFrom conversations that I\u2019ve been having with people my own age, and whether this is right and wrong, it\u2019s this idea that the Democrats are putting Trump as \u2018This is the sole reason you should vote for us\u2019,\u201d Elmikashfi said.</p> <p>\u201cI think constituencies across the country are put in a tight spot, where you have a fascist president who is incredibly destructive to America, but then you also have Democratic party leadership that isn\u2019t very progressive, that doesn\u2019t uplift the working class, but that feels entitled to your vote.</p> <p>\u201cYoung kids understand Trump is more damaging, the question is: is it really gonna change under Biden.\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s reaction to Floyd\u2019s death, and the ensuing surge in protests nationwide, has <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-biden-police-oversight-board/\">included him musing</a> that police officers could shoot suspects in the leg, \u201cinstead of in the heart\u201d, a suggestion that seemed to overlook the issue of people of color being apprehended at far higher rates than white people.&nbsp;</p> <p>The former vice-president, who is 78 years old, struggled to attract young supporters during the Democratic primary, weighed down by a problematic record that includes <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/us/politics/biden-busing.html\">opposing bussing minority students</a> to different school districts, and his lead role in a 1994 \u201ctough on crime\u201d

misjudging the level of emotion and the desire for change.</p> <p>\u201cThe death of George Floyd is emblematic of everything that\u2019s wrong with America, whether it\u2019s how we handle Covid, to the existing racism and police brutality that black and brown communities have suffered for years,\u201d said Moumita Ahmed, who is <a

In recent years the youth-led protests against gun violence following the Parkland school shooting, led to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/12/26/18145305/gun-control-violence-parkland-effect-2018\">stronger gun laws</a>, while young climate activists <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/the-weekly/democrats-climate-change-green-new-deal.html\">succeeded in drawing attention to the Green New Deal</a> environment legislation, which many Democratic politicians have since endorsed.</p> <p>On Monday George Floyd\u2019s brother, Terrence Floyd, called for people to vote in November, particularly in statewide and local elections like Ahmed and Elmikashfi\u2019s. That effort to build on the energy of the past two weeks is being supported by organizations like <a href=\"https://www.organizing20.org/\">Organizing 2.0</a>, <a href=\"https://nextgenamerica.org/\">NextGen America</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.naacp.org/\">NAACP</a>, which aims to build equal rights in the US.</p> <p>Tiffany Dena Loftin, director of the <a href=\"http://naacpyc.org/\">NAACP youth &amp; college division</a>, said it has been registering people to vote at demonstrations, demonstrate how the voting process works and help people find their voting precincts. Loftin said young people had been stunned by Trump\u2019s advocating of violence against protesters and \u201cencouragement of police violence\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThat is resonating with young black voters across the country, they\u2019re paying attention,\u201d Loftin said.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re fed up and they\u2019re done. So that is definitely a motivation to go to the polls. I want to be clear \u2013 it\u2019s not a scare tactic. We\u2019re not afraid of Donald Trump being president for another four years.\u201d</p> <p>Loftin said the NAACP has also encouraged people to take part in the 2020 census, a once-a-decade event that will influence the amount of government funding neighborhoods receive, and potentially how they are represented in Ccongress. Like Ahmed and Elmikashfi, she said local races are just as important as the headline-grabbing Trump v Biden election.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a laser focus on district attorney races, mayoral races, district races, the president and what their decisions are going to mean for how black folks in this country walk and experience their everyday lives.\u201d</p> <p>The importance of participating in elections was on the minds of people at a protest in New York City on Tuesday, where thousands walked through Manhattan to demonstrate at Gracie Mansion, the official residence of Mayor Bill de Blasio.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s another stage of this movement that does need to happen. I think voting is important,\u201d said Justin Withers, 23.</p> <p>\u201cI hope that this does change the voting. I hope it does. We\u2019ve failed in the past but I hope now because it\u2019s so many people that people will finally wake up.\u201d</p> <p>Just 46.1% of 18- to 29-year-olds <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2017/05/voting_in_america.html\">voted in the 2016 presidential election</a>, compared with an overall turnout of 61.4%. The highest turnout, meanwhile, was among people aged 65 and over, who are statistically more likely to be conservative.</p> <p>In the 2018 midterms, the less glamorous elections that re-elect members of the House of Representatives and some senators as well as local officials, 36% of young people voted \u2013 although this was a big increase on the 20% of 18 \u2013 29-year-olds who voted in the 2014 midterms.</p> <p>That could suggest interest and awareness is growing among younger voters. Although Withers, who lives in Brooklyn, predicted that despite renewed enthusiasm, the turnout in 2020 would remain relatively low among people of color \u2013 due to efforts in states around the US to make it more difficult for black people, and other minority groups, from voting.&nbsp;</p> <p>Since <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html\">the Voting Rights Act was weakened</a> in 2013, many states have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/nov/07/which-us-states-hardest-vote-supression-election\">brought in laws making it more difficult to vote</a>, from purging people from electoral rolls if they have not voted in a given amount of time, to preventing efforts to register voters, to requiring government-issued photo ID to vote \u2013 something people of color and low-income Americans <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/getting-a-photo-id-so-you-can-vote-is-easy-unless-youre-poor-black-latino-or-elderly/2016/05/23/8d5474ec-20f0-11e6-8690-f14ca9de2972_story.html\">are less likely to have</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is voter suppression is still happening,\u201d Withers said.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s still 10 times harder for the people who know what\u2019s right, for the people who are minorities, to be able to vote.

And despite the World Health Organization\u2019s reminder that pets don\u2019t spread Covid-19, vets have seen an increase in the number of cases of cats brought in in an alcoholic coma, after being washed in hand sanitiser, and dogs with burns on their skin and paws after being washed in bleach or other corrosive substances at the end of a walk.</p> <p>Some cases have involved substances that are harder to obtain, such as the diabetes drug metformin, after the possibility was raised that it might have a therapeutic effect against Covid-19.</p> <p>In one case, a woman swallowed hair dye containing a molecule called paraphenylenediamine that can cause a severe allergic reaction and burn the body\u2019s soft tissues.</p> <p>Her goal appeared to be internal disinfection.

When the country went into lockdown that decision seemed a prudent, if painful one; the home is normally full of the laughter and joy of up to 30 residents and their visitors, who are usually such an important presence. Deprived of their company, many of our residents have become more anxious, confused or both, in spite of our best efforts to maintain connections using technology.</p> <p>By the end of March, 16 out of 58 staff members were isolating because they or a family member was sick, or shielding,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>meaning it has also been a day-by-day struggle to make sure we have had enough people on duty, not to mention supplies of food and personal protective equipment (PPE). Thankfully our local authority has provided support on all fronts, which helped us through the most turbulent initial weeks, and we\u2019ve since managed to find new suppliers and recruit new staff&nbsp;alongside those who have been able to come back to work.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have for the most part stopped worrying about becoming ill ourselves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><br>We have watched the devastating consequences of the virus in other homes with horror. Our own numbers make painful reading, with 11 deaths in as many weeks, but we think we have actually been lucky; most of those have been the culmination of a long illness, or new admissions to us from our local hospital for end-of-life care. Initially only three residents were tested so we won\u2019t know for sure \u2013 and we try not to drive ourselves crazy wondering \u2013 but, although one of those three positive patients has sadly died, the other two, including a lady in her 90s, appear to have made a full recovery.</p> <p>The rollout of the promised weekly testing of all care home residents and employees is painfully slow. Our first full set of tests arrived on Sunday 17 May, with a 30-hour window of opportunity to carry out tests before the prearranged collection; miraculously we managed to&nbsp;test 72 people, including all but three of the staff who weren\u2019t on duty over those two days. When the results arrived&nbsp;two days later, a resident and a member of staff&nbsp;\u2013 neither of whom had experienced any symptoms \u2013 had tested positive. By chance, that staff member hadn\u2019t been at work for a few weeks, but it brought home how important&nbsp;testing is, and how badly we need to repeat it regularly. Disturbingly, we still have no idea&nbsp;when that will be possible.<br><br>Current guidance states that the PPE that staff wear will protect them from transmitting the virus, and we can only hope this is the case, because our converted premises, which give us a lovely homely atmosphere, make social distancing impossible \u2013 even if two people&nbsp;washing and dressing the same resident&nbsp;could keep two metres apart. The guidance at least means we won\u2019t lose half the staff team as the result of a single positive test \u2013 as the PPE is supposed to protect us \u2013 but given how Covid-19 has spread in other homes, all the PPE and infection-control processes in the world don\u2019t give us confidence that if we have another case, we will be able to contain it.<br><br>And that is why, despite the easing of restrictions, and the government\u2019s seemingly spontaneous last-minute decision to allow the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/30/lockdown-to-be-eased-for-englands-most-clinically-vulnerable\">extremely vulnerable</a>\u201d to leave their houses, we are not yet comfortable with even the most socially distanced of visits.&nbsp;The only piece of&nbsp;official guidance, issued to&nbsp;care homes on 15 May,&nbsp;advises that face-to-face visits should only take place at the very end of a resident\u2019s life, and under strict conditions (no more than two visitors, no kissing, PPE to be worn). It hasn\u2019t been updated, leaving homes to navigate this minefield for themselves.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/12/testing-coronavirus-uk-care-homes-complete-system-failure\">Testing for coronavirus in UK care homes a \u2018complete system failure\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Portsmouth has had lower infection and death rates than many parts of the country, but as people start to mix we know that the local infection rate is likely to go up,&nbsp;making it&nbsp;more likely that any visitor brings more than they intend with them. It is a short step from there to another outbreak in the home, and we can\u2019t count on being so lucky next time.<br><br>So for the time being, we are keeping our doors closed and&nbsp;trialling&nbsp;meetings between a resident inside the conservatory and a visitor outside who will be able to see and speak to each other through the glass double doors. We are also puzzling over how to provide chiropody, and when&nbsp;hairdressing and worship can resume in the home.<br><br>In spite of the severe symptoms some of our colleagues suffered, we have for the most part stopped worrying about becoming ill ourselves.

Whatever the case, where other movies of a similar vintage have slid into obscurity, we\u2019re still talking about it 25 years later.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2020/mar/25/the-guide-staying-in-sign-up-for-our-home-entertainment-tips\">The Guide: Staying In  \u2013 sign up for our home entertainment tips</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You can\u2019t engineer cult status, but Showgirls accidentally hit upon the perfect formula: big budget yet inherently trashy premise; quotably absurd dialogue (\u201cIt must be weird not having anybody cum on you\u201d); ridiculous characters; lavish musical numbers; salacious yet utterly unsexy nudity; and showbiz melodrama played dead straight. Everything about it is over the top, even the toplessness, but especially memorable is Elizabeth Berkley\u2019s wildly overcommitted performance as striving stripper/dancer Nomi, who gyrates and schemes her way up (or is it down?) the greasy pole of Vegas stardom, licking it along the way for good measure.</p> <p>Another key factor in Showgirls\u2019 cult status was the way it bombed so spectacularly, commercially and critically. Nothing breeds cult success like failure. Showgirls became a hit on home video. It was embraced by trash aficionados. Ironic fan screenings were held. Film-makers, including Jim Jarmusch and Quentin Tarantino, praised it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2glm9WFW2o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l2glm9WFW2o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The rehabilitation really got going in 2003, when Film Quarterly published a roundtable discussion of the movie, assessing its artistic merits, its handling of gender, class and sexual issues, the way it \u201ctakes mass culture seriously, as a site of both fascination and struggle\u201d. Now we have two new docs: Goddess: The Fall and Rise of Showgirls, from the makers of I Am Divine, and the entertaining <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMncUW0HQ6A\">You Don\u2019t Nomi</a> (released on streaming this Friday), which charts the movie\u2019s chequered history and puts it in the context of Verhoeven\u2019s recurring \u201cthemes\u201d, including sex, violence, and, more problematically, sexual violence; he\u2019s barely made a movie that doesn\u2019t feature a rape scene. Showgirls\u2019 is one of the worst, but at least it has meaningful consequences, and is avenged in its own twisted way.</p> <p>People loved Verhoeven\u2019s movies when they took aim at hardline law enforcement (RoboCop) or US militarism (Starship Troopers), or even male fragility (Basic Instinct), but with Showgirls, the target was the American dream itself \u2013 and the dishonest \u201cstar is born\u201d narratives churned out to sustain it. If Showgirls has a message, it\u2019s that the game is rigged for women like Nomi. She thinks she\u2019s climbing the pole but really she\u2019s just spinning round it. The real power lies with the men running the racket. Nobody wanted to hear that at the time; maybe they\u2019re ready to now. In its own messy way, Showgirls is a #MeToo story with a male gaze. </p>",

Settler-colonial Australia must decolonise and transform out of their romanticised history books to a new way of thinking and viewing the world.

Our communities operating under Indigenous legal and knowledge systems should not be feared but embraced. Our culture is the oldest continuing on the planet and a gift to humanity. A pathway together cannot be forged under a collapsing western capitalist-colonial system, but can be reconstructed by enabling Indigenous sovereignty and a new system of governance centred on respecting difference not intolerance.

  "<p>In November 1966, the Gemini 12 spacecraft, carrying two astronauts, splashed down in the Pacific. The four-day mission was a triumph, proving that humans could work in outer space, and even step into the great unknown, albeit tethered to their spacecraft. It catapulted the US ahead of the USSR in the space race.</p> <p>From then, Nasa\u2019s goal was to beat the Russians to the moon. That meant weeks rather than days in space, in an isolated, claustrophobic environment. There was one perfect way to prepare humans for these conditions: going underwater. The world was gripped. If we could land people on the moon, why not colonise the ocean as well?</p> <p>Nasa scientists were not the first to dream of marine living. Evidence of submarines and diving bells can be found as far back as the 16th century. The literary grandfather of all things deep, Jules Verne, popularised the idea of a more sophisticated underwater life with 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea in 1872, but it was in the 20th century that the fascination really took hold.</p> <p>In the 1930s, American naturalist William Beebe and engineer Otis Barton collaborated on experimental submersibles called <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2015/09/02/the_bathysphere_and_the_discovery_of_deep_sea_marine_life_on_99_percent.html?via=gdpr-consent\">bathyspheres</a> which set records for deep diving and opened up the underwater realm of plants and animals to science. Swiss physicist and oceanographer Auguste Piccard created the bathyscaphe (which used floats rather than surface cables) in 1946, and his son, Jacques, was on the <a href=\"https://geology.com/records/bathyscaphe-trieste.shtml\">record-breaking voyage</a> to explore the Mariana Trench, the deepest place on Earth, in 1960.

The first, in 1962, was suspended 10 metres under the water off the coast of Marseilles, but Conshelf II was a starfish-shaped \u201cunderwater village\u201d that sat on the seabed proper, 30 metres down in the Red Sea off Sudan. It contained all the accoutrements of <em>la vie louche</em>, including television and radio. Cousteau used it as a base to explore the ocean in his yellow submarine, descending to 300 metres to capture the deepest footage yet recorded.</p> <p>His team spent 30 days beneath the waves, and in the process changed humanity\u2019s relationship with the ocean by proving that \u201csaturation diving\u201d could allow people to spend long periods underwater. By diving to a certain depth, divers saturate their bodies with the inert gases in air. This allows them to exist at the extreme pressure of the ocean floor. It typically involves breathing a mix of helium and oxygen, to avoid the possibility of the bends and nitrogen narcosis.</p> <p>Conshelf sparked a craze.

This is in large part due to the marine biologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/06/oceanographer-sylvia-earle-the-world-is-holding-its-breath-for-australia\">Sylvia Earle</a>, one of the most famous explorers of her generation. In 1969, Earle made history with Mission 6, when she and an all-female team of scientists spent two weeks on Nasa\u2019s habitat <a href=\"https://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2014/07/17/project-tektite-i-and-the-birth-of-the-underwater-construction-teams/\">Tektite</a> (named after meteor remnants on the seabed). This Virgin Islands research facility was for studying aquatic life \u2013 marine science, engineering and construction underwater \u2013 and small-crew psychology in extreme conditions. The research was for the Apollo missions and the moon landing was just months away.</p> <p>Built by General Electric, Earle and her team would enter Tektite through what she calls an \u201cunderwater door\u201d \u2013 emerging as if from a swimming pool into the deep-sea two-up, two-down apartment. It was dry, climate-controlled and comfortable, with carpets, bunks and a hot freshwater shower to wash off the salt. It even had a microwave.</p> <p>\u201cNasa had a team of psychologists watching to get insight into behaviour of living in isolation,\u201d says Earle today. \u201cWe were there as guinea pigs: our research was on the oceans, their research was on us.\u201d</p> <p>But Tektite wasn\u2019t just a research station \u2013 it was a vision of stylish underwater living. With their scientific gear and Charlie\u2019s Angels wetsuits in their Bond-villain lair, Earle and her team caused a media sensation.</p> <p>\u201cThey called us the aquababes, the aquanaughties, all sorts of things,\u201d Earle recalls with a snort. \u201cWe speculated what they would say about the astronauts if they were seen the same way \u2013 would they be the astrohunks?\u201d</p> <p>Habitats such as Glaucus, Conshelf and Tektite were built as tributes to humankind\u2019s abilities, but their true achievement was to spark an entirely different understanding of marine animals. \u201cBack then we could only explore using nets, and just saw dead bodies \u2013 not living creatures. Having the continuous interaction allowed us to get to know individual animals,\u201d Earle says. \u201c[In underwater habitats] we could stay, the way you look at bears or birds: we were there for the long haul, 24 hours a day or night. It was possible to see how a little group of damselfish reacted when a predator tried to swipe their eggs, for example.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"107f23d980ca9a675905b3ea847ecd66e1d9113d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/107f23d980ca9a675905b3ea847ecd66e1d9113d/0_175_4215_2529/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peggy Lucas with team leader Dr Sylvia Earle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Engineer Peggy Lucas and team leader Dr Sylvia Earle in Nasa\u2019s Tektite habitat in the Virgin Islands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"8a25664671cca5fd3dac51edbef503544c96852a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a25664671cca5fd3dac51edbef503544c96852a/0_147_2500_1582/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Artist\u2019s cutaway view of the Tektite II habitat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"633\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cutaway model of Nasa\u2019s Tektite II habitat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NOAA Central Library Historical Fisheries Collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76f95a49a585d6c3d54f8e0b5362f0f7669edbb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76f95a49a585d6c3d54f8e0b5362f0f7669edbb1/0_186_5478_3288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Sylvia Earle diving.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Sylvia Earle diving off Magic Point, New South Wales, Australia, with a Port Jackson shark in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Sydney Morning Herald/Fairfax Media via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou look at a school of fish and they all look alike, but when you <em>really</em> look at them \u2013 well, it\u2019s like a bunch of people getting on the New York subway: a fish would say they all look the same, but we know they\u2019re different. Getting to appreciate the individuality of creatures other than humans was a breakthrough for me \u2013 it reinforces that you can\u2019t just lump them all together.\u201d</p> <p>But, in 1973, the world was shaken when Opec declared an oil embargo. Energy prices in the west skyrocketed. At first, the oil shock fuelled even wilder fantasies of a watery future, straight out of science fiction. Architects and designers imagined whole cities underwater, fed by hydropower stations, with deep-sea mining using freight submarines.</p> <p>Much like living in space, though, it\u2019s extremely difficult to live underwater. Aquanauts spending months in saturation suffered intense pressures on their body tissues \u2013 their brains, nervous systems. There were also interpersonal problems. As the marine biologist Helen Scales notes in her 2014 radio documentary <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04fzc7m\">The Life Sub-Aquatic</a>:\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever lived in a house with anyone, the first thing you do is storm out if you have a quarrel. You\u2019re not going to do that [underwater].\u201d</p> <p>Advances in robotics changed the game. Much of the research being done by Earle and her colleagues could be more efficiently performed by humans operating devices remotely from the surface. By the end of the 70s, the US government pulled back on its efforts. The moon missions were over. So, it seemed, were the ocean habitats.</p> <p>A few people refused to let the dream die. One was Australian <a href=\"http://www.lloydgodson.com/underwater-projects.html\">Lloyd Godson</a>. His habitat, BioSub, experimented with sustainability. Fuelled by solar panels, it featured a support system adapted from work by American high school students, with algae removing the CO2 from his exhalations and creating oxygen. In 2007 he moved in. It worked \u2013 sort of. \u201cBy day 12 I was lethargic, getting really irritated with people asking questions,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cMy wife told me to call it a day.\u201d</p> <p>In 2010 Godson spent 14 days underwater at the Legoland aquarium in Germany and used a fixed bicycle to set a world record for generating electricity underwater.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30599a1d35d873f6d6ca534e7dca309eb0332d25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30599a1d35d873f6d6ca534e7dca309eb0332d25/0_156_11896_14868/800.jpg\" alt=\"The SeaOrbiter designed by French architect Jacques Rougerie\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The SeaOrbiter, designed by French architect Jacques Rougerie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacques Rougerie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Better funded is the French architect Jacques Rougerie, who has built a career designing underwater habitats and environments. \u201cI had the pleasure of going on Cousteau\u2019s Calypso, participating in expeditions, talking to the crew \u2013 and what he created was a fascination for underwater living,\u201d Rougerie says from his office in Paris. \u201cThe early explorers opened the chamber of the possible for humanity. When you are underwater you feel like you\u2019re in a new dimension \u2013 floating in space, like an astronaut.\u201d</p> <p>Citing Leonardo da Vinci as an inspiration, Rougerie designs sea museums, underwater laboratories and habitats, and his foundation hosts an <a href=\"https://www.fondation-jacques-rougerie.com/\">annual competition</a> for students to conceive of underwater villages. Rougerie himself has twice lived for long periods underwater, and both times he didn\u2019t want to return to land. \u201cSadness invades you,\u201d he says. \u201cI was happy to come back and see family, but the first thing you think of is the next experience.\u201d</p> <p>Rougerie\u2019s ultimate goal remains that old 1960s dream: a proper underwater village, housing up to 250 people. In his vision, these aquanaut settlers would live in osmosis with the ocean, in a self-sufficient, autonomous community running on renewable marine energy such as tidal power, wave sensors and ocean thermals.</p> <p>Perhaps most ambitious of all is <a href=\"http://www.seaorbiter.com/\">SeaOrbiter</a>, Rougerie\u2019s take on the International Space Station for the ocean. It looks like a floating seahorse: two-thirds of its 51 metres are submerged, with panoramic windows, the lower section acting to stabilise a huge sail-shaped portion above water.</p> <p>\u201cThe goal, above all, is to help the climate and biodiversity by exploring across the grand currents of the ocean,\u201d he says. \u201cTo float 24/7 on a permanent structure, a combination of men and robots with a scientific purpose.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Rougerie\u2019s claims that he has secured Chinese investment, SeaOrbiter appears no closer to pushing off.</p> <p>Indeed, after all the projects of the past 50 years, only one permanent underwater habitat remains on the entire planet: <a href=\"https://medium.com/predict/aquarius-reef-base-an-actual-underwater-lab-and-the-last-of-a-dying-breed-eacb5b7989c7\">Aquarius Reef Base</a>, a research station run by Florida International University and which sits 20 metres down on the seabed off the Florida Keys.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b07ca532794af8364d22c0dbe0d7de57b75984e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b07ca532794af8364d22c0dbe0d7de57b75984e/0_117_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fabien Cousteau waves from inside Aquarius Reef Base, a laboratory 63 feet below the surface in the waters off Key Largo, Florida in 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fabien Cousteau waves from inside Aquarius Reef Base, an ocean-floor laboratory off Key Largo, Florida in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wilfredo Lee/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aquarius plays host to a stream of people \u2013 scientists, film-makers, astronauts, even Jacques Cousteau\u2019s grandson Fabien \u2013 who want to experience time underwater.

In the 21st century, underwater \u201cliving\u201d has become almost exclusively the preserve of hotels and resorts that sell \u201cexperiences\u201d to guests via underwater glass ceilings and fish windows. The world\u2019s largest underwater <a href=\"https://under.no/\">restaurant</a> opened in Norway in 2019. Submerged hotels in the <a href=\"https://www.conradmaldives.com/\">Maldives</a>, <a href=\"http://www.poseidonresorts.com/\">Fiji</a>, Dubai and Singapore use elevators to take guests below the waterline, and feature amenities such as <a href=\"http://www.poseidonresorts.com/\">Poseidon\u2019s undersea chapel</a> (\u201cfor a wedding ceremony or vow renewal truly unlike any other\u201d), and are a lot more comfortable than Tektite ever was.</p> <p>Instead, the architects and scientists who still look to aquatic habitation spend most of their time thinking not about underwater cities, but floating ones. Long the refuge of the poorest city dwellers, such as the vast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/feb/23/makoko-lagos-danger-ingenuity-floating-slum\">Makoko floating slum of homes on stilts in Lagos</a>, houses on water have become newly popular as waterfront property prices \u2013 and sea levels \u2013 have risen across the world.</p> <p>So far, most of this effort to colonise the water has gone into land reclamation projects, such as the Odaiba island in Tokyo, or South Korea\u2019s Songdo \u201csmart city\u201d.

His firm <a href=\"https://www.waterstudio.nl/floating-cities-the-next-big-real-estate-boom/\">Waterstudio</a> builds floating buildings, mainly in the Netherlands, to help cities be more resilient. Recently, Olthuis started adding submerged levels to his structures. \u201cIn Holland the licences for dwellings on the water are small, but they say nothing about living underwater.\u201d</p> <p>The goal is partly ecological, Olthuis says. \u201cTen years ago, it was about proving that a structure did not have a negative effect \u2013 but now it\u2019s about also having a positive effect.\u201d He points to the \u201crigs to reefs\u201d principle where abandoned oil rigs have been transformed into habitats for ocean life. Waterstudio\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.waterstudio.nl/projects/sea-tree/\">Sea Tree</a><a href=\"https://www.waterstudio.nl/projects/sea-tree/\"> </a>builds on that concept: it\u2019s a platform that attracts birds, bees, fish and water plants into a single dense floating structure that can be moved between cities. He says the first Sea Trees have been commissioned by a Chinese developer in Kunming, who was asked to create a tourist attraction after a dam permanently altered the landscape.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-world-oceans-day\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-world-oceans-day&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-world-oceans-day&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The Bjarke Ingels Group last year revealed a concept for a buoyant municipality called <a href=\"https://oceanix.org/\">Oceanix City</a> \u2013 a modular system of floating islands clustered in multiples of six to form a kind of archipelago. Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.seasteading.org/\">Seasteading Institute</a>, founded by PayPal\u2019s Peter Thiel and the grandson of the economist Milton Friedman, continues to pursue its libertarian goal of floating communities living outside the boundaries of national law. The Chinese construction giant CCCC has a design similar to Oceanix City, while the architect Vincent Callebaut has imagined a city called <a href=\"http://vincent.callebaut.org/object/080523_lilypad/lilypad/projects\">Lilypad</a> with a series of oceanic skyscrapers that would house 50,000 people.</p> <p>\u201cI see blue cities,\u201d says Olthuis. \u201cNot floating cities.

  "<p>Moments before powerlifters attempt a superhuman feat of strength, they like to hold a capsule of ammonia to their nose, snort deeply, and feel a huge jolt of adrenaline rip through their bodies. But it is going to take far more than smelling salts to revive weightlifting\u2019s reputation after the publication of a truly eye-bulging independent investigation by the Canadian law professor Richard McLaren. Corruption. Cronyism. Cover-ups. Bribes. An omerta that would impress the five families. It\u2019s all there in <a href=\"https://mclarenweightliftingenquiry.com/wp-content/themes/mclarenweightlifitingenquiry/assets/mclaren-independent-investigator-report-iwf-final.pdf\" title=\"\">a 122-page report</a> that leaves the reader feeling they have bathed in a fetid swamp.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/06/ioc-very-serious-allegations-weightlifting\">IOC concerned by \u2018very serious\u2019 doping allegations in weightlifting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Think Fifa and double it. The IAAF and quadruple it. McLaren\u2019s investigation found that more than $10m (around \u00a37.9m) was unaccounted for in the books of the International Weightlifting Federation, that 40 doping positives were covered up and vote-buying to ensure the re-election of the former president Dr Tamas Ajan was rampant. And that was just for starters.</p> <p>The Hungarian, a senior figure in the sport since 1976, also \u201cran the IWF as if it was his own personal fiefdom\u201d, concluded McLaren, whose team also established that Ajan was \u201cthe sole person making all cash deposits into the IWF\u2019s bank accounts\u201d and \u201cmillions of dollars in cash withdrawals conducted by Ajan were never recorded\u201d.</p> <p>A confidential witness told McLaren\u2019s investigation team that at one point Ajan even called up the head of the Albanian weightlifting federation and issued an ultimatum: pay a $100,000 fine for doping offences \u2013 in cash \u2013 or his team would not go to the Rio Olympics. Cue a comical scene involving four Albanian officials taking $25,000 each in cash on a road trip from Tirana to Budapest. At least Ajan gave them a receipt.</p> <p>Other countries \u2013 including Russia and Romania \u2013 did not even get that. No wonder an expert in money laundering quoted in McLaren\u2019s report described Ajan\u2019s modus operandi as apparently \u201csymptomatic of corruption or criminal activity\u201d. Investigators also uncovered a deleted letter addressed to Ajan from the Azerbaijan National Olympic Committee\u2019s president in 2016 \u2013 thanking him for delaying the doping suspensions of certain Azeri weightlifters so they could compete. Meanwhile, McLaren\u2019s report notes the 2013 and 2017 presidential elections were \u201castonishingly bribery prone\u201d, with Ajan securing his presidency \u201cby paying member federations cash bribes ranging from $5,000-30,000 to vote for him and his team of cronies\u201d.</p> <p>It is astounding stuff. The question is, why did all this take so long to come out? Part of the explanation, surely, is that Ajan established a culture of fear, with McLaren also reporting: \u201cIn one historical instance, he stated to a confidential witness that he could turn their athletes\u2019 samples \u2018dirty\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Lack of financial scrutiny must be another factor. Until 2009, the work of the IWF\u2019s internal auditors committee consisted of \u201cgoing to Budapest, collecting $100 or a bottle of whiskey and listening to Ajan say: \u2018Here you are, here are the books. Sign them and we go to dinner.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ac81f34f6f8083ae8dcb868edae719103a95a0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ac81f34f6f8083ae8dcb868edae719103a95a0f/0_216_3445_2067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tamas Ajan, the Hungarian former president of the International Weightlifting Federation, pictured in 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tamas Ajan, the Hungarian former president of the International Weightlifting Federation, pictured in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rotten people in rotten sports federations largely get away with it because there is no sports sheriff to watch over them, no sports judge to jail miscreants and little public thirst in scrutiny. No one cares enough.</p> <p>The International Olympic Committee, whose money keeps many sports organisations afloat, could do it although it has previously shown scant sign of wanting to do so. Indeed, McLaren\u2019s report recounts that when Dr Antonio Urso, the president of the European Weightlifting, complained millions were missing from the IWF\u2019s Swiss bank accounts more than a decade ago nothing was done \u2013 with the IOC ethics commission stating it was an issue for the individual federations. Since the report has been published the IOC has issued a statement noting the \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d contents of McLaren\u2019s report and undertaking to \u201csupport the efforts\u201d of IWF to reform its governance.</p> <p>The answer, surely, is for an independent enforcer, packed with serious investigative muscle, to scrutinise international sports bodies more closely. Why not McLaren and his team, given their record with weightlifting and, before that, Russian state-sponsored doping. There is an obvious problem, though: who would fund it? As things stand, it is journalists who usually shine the initial light. McLaren began his investigation at the behest of the IWF after the ARD documentary Lord of the Lifters. The German broadcaster also exposed the extent of Russian doping \u2013 and how the IAAF had accepted secret payments to ignore doping cases.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/02/hafthor-bjornsson-game-of-thrones-mountain-breaks-world-deadlift-record\">Hafthor Bjornsson, Game of Thrones' 'Mountain', breaks world deadlift record</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other organisations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/31/japan-businessman-admits-giving-gifts-for-successful-tokyo-olympic-bid\" title=\"\">including the Guardian</a>, have exposed corruption in the Tokyo 2020 Olympic bid and in AIBA, amateur boxing\u2019s governing body.

But unseasonal rains have allowed several generations of locust to breed, resulting in new swarms forming. </p> \n<p>Huge swarms of locusts have been causing devastation across swathes of Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Erratic weather conditions and storms have aided their path. As a result, countries have been battling the pests for months to avoid a hunger crisis.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3d69dfa8-21c8-416e-b666-8db3e4dc4393\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In normal times, locusts are not usually a threat.

As few as two locusts touching each other can create a connection that starts them forming into groups. This unlocks their destructive \u201cgregarious\u201d state that changes their behaviour and even colour.</p>\n    <p>Rains help the swarms to form. The moisture turns deserts into ideal habitats for breeding and the locusts feed off the growing vegetation. In two generations, the number of locusts can increase 400-fold.</p>\n    <p>They easily devour fields of crops and when the food dries up, they move on. \u201cBands\u201d of wingless, gregarious locusts move in the same direction, while adult winged \u201cswarms\u201d migrate by air in search of greenery.</p>\n    <p>Dry weather usually kills them off naturally but when things change, plagues begin. A combination of ideal breeding conditions and a lack of control operations can allow unchecked breeding, which is what happened in Yemen in 2018.

  "<p>He invented streetwear, was the most high-profile black fashion designer of the 80s and influenced a generation, yet fashion history has largely forgotten Willi Smith. That is all about to change with a new <a href=\"https://www.rizzoliusa.com/book/9780847868193/\">book</a> celebrating the designer, who died in 1987.</p> <p>\u201cThe lack of scholarship on Willi Smith created a missing link in our understanding of contemporary fashion and visual culture,\u201d says Alexandra Cunningham Cameron, curator of the <em>Willi Smith: Street Couture</em> exhibition at <a href=\"https://www.cooperhewitt.org/\" title=\"\">Cooper Hewitt</a>, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York.</p> <p>His label, Williwear, was ahead of its time: mixing the relaxed fit of sportswear with high-end elements of tailoring. His clothes were not meant to be untouchable, catwalk-only designs. Although the term \u201cstreetwear\u201d has been much chewed over recently, Smith\u2019s more elastic definition of the term (bringing urban culture to the catwalk) has been incredibly influential. \u201cHe mixed looks from workwear, the military, African and Indian prints,\u201d says fashion historian Darnell-Jamal Lisby. \u201cHe was enamoured with denim and the idea of the romanticised cowboy, often incorporating tweeds, denim or corduroy into his collection. He loved jumpsuits and the utilitarian aspects of the silhouette.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"44af00917f216f19cae9af45f740203b77a6f2e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44af00917f216f19cae9af45f740203b77a6f2e4/0_847_4244_6911/614.jpg\" alt=\"Willi Smith autumn 1975 collection.\" width=\"614\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Willi Smith autumn 1975 collection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fairchild Archive/Penske Media/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His clothes were meant for everybody. He said: \u201cFashion is a people thing and designers should remember that. Models pose in clothes. People live in them.\u201d Though he was inspired by New York City, he wanted people everywhere to appreciate the culture and inspiration of the city. \u201cBeing black has a lot to do with my being a good designer,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of these designers who have to run to Paris for colour and fabric combinations should go to church on Sunday in Harlem. It\u2019s all right there.\u201d His friend, former neighbour and fashion editor <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/community/people/kim-hastreiter\" title=\"\">Kim Hastreiter</a> says this philosophy went deep: \u201cHe loved street culture and made clothes for people to wear on the street.\u201d </p> <p>Smith was born in Philadelphia in 1948 and went to Parsons School of Design on a scholarship in 1965 after getting an internship with the couturier <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/05/fashion/arnold-scaasi-a-designer-who-dressed-generations-of-scaasi-girls-dies-at-85.html\" title=\"\">Arnold Scaasi</a>. His grandmother worked as a housekeeper for one of Scaasi\u2019s clients. Williwear hit its stride in the early 80s (it was founded in 1976 with Smith\u2019s friend Laurie Mallet), when the label incorporated some elements of hip hop culture into its aesthetic, most notably his 1983 autumn-winter collection called Street Couture, which featured music and dance performances. That year Smith became the youngest-ever winner of the American Fashion Critics\u2019 Award for Women\u2019s Fashion. </p> <p>Smith was part of a wave of young black American designers who made their names in the 70s. There was <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90305316/rediscovering-patrick-kelly-the-designer-who-made-blackface-his-brand\" title=\"\">Patrick Kelly</a>, who found fame in France with his controversial designs, and celebrity favourite <a href=\"https://stephenburrows.com/about-2/\" title=\"\">Stephen Burrows</a>. There was also <a href=\"https://queenshistoricalsociety.org/featured/jay-jaxon-exhibition/\" title=\"\">Jax Jaxon</a> (\u201cthe first black designer to be at the helm of a couture house: Jean-Louis Scherrer from 1969-1970,\u201d says Lisby), and Smith\u2019s best friend <a href=\"https://www.thehistorymakers.org/biography/alvin-bell-41\" title=\"\">Alvin Bell</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI think the success of Smith and Kelly set them apart from their peers and predecessors,\u201d says Lisby. \u201cSmith owned the most lucrative business out of them.\u201d By 1986, Williwear was grossing sales of more than $25 million a year in more than 500 stores.</p> <p>\u201cHe was a <em>huge</em> hero to African American women,\u201d says Hastreiter. \u201cThey worshipped Willi and felt such enormous pride in his success. He was a black man who could change our society\u2019s inherent racist perception of black men in general,\u201d she says. \u201c[For black women he became] their dream husband, dream boss, dream best friend, dream leader, their dream son, dream teacher. He represented so many dreams, their dreams for the future of their African American community. A lot was projected on to Smith. It must have been a lot of pressure.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d84b594d14c64e1450ebe561a6b53e64cc2661cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d84b594d14c64e1450ebe561a6b53e64cc2661cc/0_438_3493_2095/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Williwear New York showroom in 1982.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Williwear New York showroom in 1982.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andreas Sterzing/Courtesy of Cooper Hewitt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She says that what really drove him wasn\u2019t ambition but a sense of giving back to his community. \u201cWhat would make him proud was not when a movie star wore his clothes. He would burst with pride when he\u2019d see black kids on the streets running around in his stuff or those black ladies at the bank wearing it to work.\u201d The oft-repeated quote from him: \u201cI don\u2019t design clothes for the queen, but the people who wave at her as she goes by,\u201d emphasised his universal outlook.</p> <p>Smith also broke boundaries when it came to collaborating with artists and creatives (something commonplace among today\u2019s designers such as Dior\u2019s Kim Jones or Rick Owens). He kept close ties to artists he met studying at Parsons, such as <a href=\"https://christojeanneclaude.net/\" title=\"\">Christo</a> and also worked with the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/19/video-art-first-fifty-years-nam-june-paik-joan-jonas-bill-viola-zhang-peili-pipilotti-rist\" title=\"\">Nam June Paik</a>, Bill T Jones and Dan Friedman.

Smith also contributed to Spike Lee\u2019s 1988 musical comedy-drama <em>School Da</em><em>ze</em>. \u201c[Costume designer] Ruth E Carter commissioned him to make the gowns for the homecoming court,\u201d says Cunningham Cameron. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/mar/29/how-streetwear-styled-the-world-from-hip-hop-to-supreme-and-palace\">How streetwear restyled the world \u2013 from hip-hop to Supreme and Palace</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During this period of professional success, Smith contracted Aids. \u201cWhen he wasn\u2019t well he would disappear,\u201d says Hastreiter. \u201cLike many other successful people with Aids, Willi didn\u2019t talk about it.

  "<p>Fashion people love to exaggerate, but I have been to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/feb/15/the-view-from-the-front-row-a-history-of-the-fashion-show-photo-essay\">a lot of fashion shows</a> \u2013 about 3,000, by according to my back-of-envelope maths. Mostly in London, Paris, Milan and New York, but also Tokyo and Rio de Janeiro, Berlin and Edinburgh, Marrakech and Reykjavik. Twenty years of pret-a-porter and haute-couture collections \u2013 two of each every year, give or take two maternity leave gaps, a bout of appendicitis and the time I messed up my US visa \u2013 adds up to a lot of catwalk time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc817aac7edaa4e52b9b440201d62bff57076c18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc817aac7edaa4e52b9b440201d62bff57076c18/0_141_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Models present creations by the designer Marc Jacobs as part of his AW13 women\u2019s ready-to-wear fashion show for Louis Vuitton in Paris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On track \u2026 models present creations by the designer Marc Jacobs as part of his autumn-winter 2013 women\u2019s ready-to-wear fashion show for Louis Vuitton in Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beno\u00eet Tessier/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But now, suddenly, the fashion show is over. No more impossibly beautiful people in ridiculously gorgeous (or just ridiculous) clothes. No more seating squabbles, no more front-row gossip, no more writing copy in the back of a minicab between shows. There are no real-life catwalks this season, with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/21/london-fashion-week-to-go-online-only-as-lockdown-endures\">first all-digital London fashion week kicking off on Friday</a>, and online-only events scheduled for Paris and Milan next month. Most probably no physical shows for the rest of the year, with September\u2019s fashion weeks looking unlikely. And after that, who knows? Will social distancing and recession kill the catwalk for ever?</p> <p>The squash and squeeze of fashion week makes watching football from my seat in the west stand at the Emirates look like a Glyndebourne picnic, and is at odds with new protocols about how we navigate each other. But long before the pandemic it was clear that fashion shows were out of control. Fashion weeks in cities throughout the world, brands presenting six or eight collections a year rather than two, with lavish production and international travel added up to an indefensibly large carbon footprint. If the combined impact of social distancing, travel restrictions and recession is that the fashion week is reinvented as a virtual moment, there will be much to celebrate in that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a8c6d2a1f2f4754b4fd80c2e5edf768e4ea6ea9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8c6d2a1f2f4754b4fd80c2e5edf768e4ea6ea9c/0_221_3281_4098/801.jpg\" alt=\"Spikes and the star-spangled banner\u2026 Alexander McQueen takes a bow at the end of his spring-summer 2000 ready-to-wear show.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spikes and the star-spangled banner\u2026 Alexander McQueen takes a bow at the end of his spring-summer 2000 ready-to-wear show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Marineau/Conde Nast/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But I will really, really miss fashion shows. They have brought me so much joy. My entry to fashion week coincided with the moment the catwalk was evolving from its second half of the 20th-century form \u2013 a chic but rule-bound, elite, inward-focused parade that served a clique of editors and buyers \u2013 into a stadium-sized pop cultural carnival.</p> <p>The first fashion week I attended, as this paper\u2019s new deputy fashion editor, was New York in September 1999. My trusty pre-Google paperback Dictionary of Fashion and Fashion Designers in no way prepared me to report on what I found. I remember <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/sep/14/interview-donatella-versace-my-brothers-death-made-me-strong\">Donatella Versace</a>\u2019s Versus show, where Madonna sat next to Rupert Everett on the front row \u2013 both in cowboy hats, I think \u2013 applauding Kate Moss as she strutted past us in white hot pants and gold boots. At Calvin Klein, Trish Goff wore a pencil skirt and plain fine-knit sweater with the sleeves pushed up and I had the feeling (one I have had many times since) of finally knowing exactly how I wanted to dress thereafter. Watching Naomi Campbell at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/04/marc-jacobs-i-have-the-word-shameless-tattooed-on-my-chest\">Marc Jacobs</a>, and that season\u2019s new face \u2013 Gisele B\u00fcndchen \u2013 in a zebra-print bikini at Michael Kors, I was knocked out by the visceral power of the supermodel, goddess-made-flesh. And then there was a hurricane, and shows started getting cancelled. But the Alexander McQueen event went ahead, even though it took place on a pier in the Hudson.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c35a3a786c57198548eac52bf07778b80ff95c30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c35a3a786c57198548eac52bf07778b80ff95c30/0_124_4926_2955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trolleyed \u2026 Rihanna pushes model Cara Delevingne at the Chanel autumn-winter 2015 show in Paris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trolleyed \u2026 Rihanna pushes model Cara Delevingne at the Chanel autumn-winter 2015 show in Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/Corbis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Around the time of the millennium, McQueen was at the forefront of reinventing fashion as theatre. His rival for fashion\u2019s attention was John Galliano, who had begun turning Christian Dior Paris catwalks into psychedelic costume parades. McQueen and Galliano had very different aesthetics \u2013 Galliano vibrant and supersized, McQueen dark and lean \u2013 but both loved to shock their audiences.</p> <p>That night in New York, the models walked through a catwalk submerged in water. (Nothing to do with the hurricane, that was just the way that McQueen, with his uncanny instinct for the zeitgeist and apparently the weather, had planned the show.) After the model finale, a field of iron spikes rose up from the ground, their points skywards, and a troupe of dancers in burqa-like coverings pirouetted above them, suspended by silk ropes \u2013 an allusion to western fear of Islam that was made all the more unsettling when McQueen took his bow and dropped his baggy jeans on the catwalk to display stars-and-stripes boxer shorts. It was my first taste of the appetite-jolting salty-sweet lick of beauty and bombshell that a fashion week can be, and I was blown away. I suspect my reports were hopelessly breathless. I remember being halfway through reading one down the phone to the office in London, when the copytaker interrupted me, not unkindly, to ask: \u201cIs there much more, love?\u201d before sighing and audibly lighting another cigarette.</p> <p>Fashion shows are as much about drama as they are about clothes. I have admired hundreds of perfect boucl\u00e9&nbsp;tweed suits, but the Chanel shows I will never forget are those staged in a giant supermarket where Rihanna pushed Cara Delevingne down the soft-drink aisle in a shopping trolley, the one where a space rocket launched during the finale \u2013 and the one where a voice informed us just before the show that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/karl-lagerfeld\">M</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/karl-lagerfeld\"> Lagerfeld was indisposed</a>, and would not be attending that morning. He was 85, and had never missed one of his own shows before that; a month later, he was dead.</p> <p>There is a special thrill in the expectant wait for a debut show to begin \u2013 Raf Simons at Dior, where the atelier was wallpapered with thousands of fresh blooms; Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re at Louis Vuitton, where an earnest note from the designer was on every seat; Lindsay Lohan at Emanuel Ungaro \u2013 of which, well, the less said the better. There is the camp, Strictly-final emotion of a farewell show. (After two decades of these I can tell you that nobody blinks back tears as prettily, in immaculate black tie and with a poignant half smile, as Tom Ford.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"573f2cc0f3f1962891c16765cf50930b3fbe1f76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/573f2cc0f3f1962891c16765cf50930b3fbe1f76/0_0_658_1024/643.jpg\" alt=\"Hussein Chalayan\u2019s coffee table hooped skirt, London fashion week, February, 2000.\" width=\"643\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hussein Chalayan\u2019s coffee table hooped skirt, London fashion week, February 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sinead Lynch/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>On stage at Sadler\u2019s Wells in 2000, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/15/hussein-chalayan-everything-we-build-and-design-in-a-way-reflects-the-body\">Hussein Chalayan</a> transformed chairs into dresses and a coffee table into a hooped skirt. When Marc Jacobs was at Louis Vuitton, a courtyard of the Louvre was decked out as a belle \u00e9poque railway station, and we sat on benches waiting for the show to begin. Then a real train trundled down the tracks and the models got out of it. That was eight years ago, and I still wonder how they did it.</p> <p>In 2007, Prince got up out of his front row seat at Matthew Williamson and did a set on the catwalk. In 2018, the actual Queen turned up at London fashion week. And yet for all the hoopla, some of the most perfect fashion moments have been those shows that are pure, old-school chic. Christian Lacroix\u2019s catwalk shows in Paris, when a red rose was left on every seat and his seamstresses cheered from the back rows. Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s final shows before his retirement, the audience squished on to tiny benches but thrilled to be there, the elegance austere and intoxicating as cold vodka. In recent seasons, The Row have conjured that same chic mood at their sublime New York fashion shows.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68ee309884eca5af514d0a477777df93bf4bc874\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68ee309884eca5af514d0a477777df93bf4bc874/0_20_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prince performs before the Matthew Williamson spring/summer 2008 show at London fashion week\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prince performs before the Matthew Williamson spring/summer 2008 show at London fashion week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are cultural issues with fashion shows that run deeper than the logistics of social distancing and are as problematic, in their own way, as the events\u2019 carbon footprint. Whether you look on the catwalk or the front row, or at the Instagram influencers, the world view of fashion weeks skews sharply towards skinny white women. There is still a huge amount of work to be done on diversity, not just on model casting but in ensuring that people of colour are represented within brands\u2019 creative teams, and in audiences. There are still too few women at decision-making level within the fashion business. However, it is not true that fashion shows have nothing interesting to say. Jean Paul Gaultier was challenging gender stereotypes on the haute-couture catwalk back in 2002. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2019/apr/09/raf-simons-on-life-after-calvin-klein-ive-never-defined-myself-as-a-fashion-designer\">Raf Simons</a> used his debut at Calvin Klein in February 2017 to challenge Trump culture with a homage to an alternative vision of Americana. Maria Grazia Chiuri\u2019s Christian Dior shows have consistently placed feminism at the forefront of fashion-week conversation. Vivienne Westwood has made London fashion week a platform for climate activism. At New York fashion week, Pyer Moss designer Kerby Jean-Raymond has shown the power of being both an activist and a designer. In 2016, his collection was accompanied by the screening of a powerful film about police brutality against people of colour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aaa0f1fefa3001e9108d61b49a93da87267c4e5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aaa0f1fefa3001e9108d61b49a93da87267c4e5f/0_0_2464_1648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexander Mcqueen Spring-Summer 2004 Ready-To-Wear Collection In Paris, France On October 11, 2003.FRANCE - OCTOBER 11: Alexander McQueen spring-summer 2004 ready-to-wear collection in Paris, France on October 11, 2003 - Alexander McQueen.

The synchronised intake of breath that would sweep around the Tennis Club in Paris during a Phoebe Philo Celine show on first view of a particularly delicious polo neck. The camaraderie and hysteria that builds over the course of a month on the road. The time Anna Wintour jumped up and led a standing ovation for McQueen\u2019s They Shoot Horses Don\u2019t They? The backstage scrum to get close to a designer for a quote, which is usually mumbled or Delphic or both. (One season, I thought Miuccia Prada said her collection was about moccasins and another broadsheet fashion editor thought she had said it was about democracy; either was equally believable.) I will even miss people unfathomably bursting into tears at Comme des Gar\u00e7ons. All of this has been, frankly, a blast.</p> <p>But fashion must move with the times, Otherwise it\u2019s not fashion. The catwalk has reinvented itself a hundred times over, swapping ballgowns for streetwear, ditching stuffy salon shows in favour of popcorny clickbait. Digital is how we live now \u2013 so that\u2019s where the fashion show needs to live, too. The catwalk has a fabulous history, but fashion is about the future. So I\u2019ll be binge-watching the next season of fashion from here, at home on my laptop. And I can\u2019t wait.</p>",

Maybe it was that phrase: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p> <p>The consonance of the phrase with the very root of our pandemic fears is uncanny.&nbsp;The phrase linked the coronavirus with the ubiquitous and implacable nature of institutional racism. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d \u2013 yet people were prepared to risk being afflicted with coronavirus just so they could express their protest at the chokehold killing of a black man.</p> <p>There have been many times when black people have been gagged, strangled and choked by the police in the US, and even in Britain. The names of those who have died unjustly at the hands of the police are legion. And the police officers have mostly always gotten off entirely free. What happened to George Floyd isn\u2019t new. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d was uttered by another police victim, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/21/eric-garner-police-chokehold-firing-pantaleo\">Eric Garner</a>, less than a decade ago. But now there has been a crossover protest on a universal scale. This time is different. This time it is epochal. Language taps into primal fears.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When people say they are colour-blind they are being naive. They are in sweet denial. History is not colour-blind</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We don\u2019t really empathise when we understand. People understand racism. It isn\u2019t difficult to understand. But still people don\u2019t behave as if they understand. Perhaps we empathise best when we can enter into the condition. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d suddenly equates racism with the deprivation of air, which is what it always was. Previously we saw racism, if we saw it all, as a diminishment of a person\u2019s humanity. But that was always too vague. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d goes beyond saying that you are depriving me of freedom, of humanity, of respect. It says: \u201cYou are depriving me of the right to air itself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d: we need a new language to express the fundamental clarity of what happens when people are demonised, excluded, deprived, oppressed, and killed because of the colour of their skin. We need a new language, a phrase for that condition.</p> <p>Only an extreme, and terminal agony could have expressed the very heart of what racism does as when George Floyd said, almost in a whisper: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Not even William Shakespeare, Walt Whitman, James Baldwin or Toni Morrison at their most eloquent came out with anything as simple in the genius of its truth as: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe it should be the phrase that people who are oppressed should use. It should become the mantra of oppression. Maybe every time the police stop you in your car for no other reason than that you are a black man or woman, you should say: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Maybe every time people cross the road in the evenings when they see you, one should hold up a placard that says: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Maybe when jobs are denied you, deserved promotions elude you, or when the police come to deport you, like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/20/its-inhumane-the-windrush-victims-who-have-lost-jobs-homes-and-loved-ones\">Windrush victims</a>, one should record the moment on one\u2019s phone while saying: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Maybe the true response to all the subtle and deadly forms that racial discrimination takes should now have a new code: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p> <p>The truth is that \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d hints at the apocalypse of human values. When George Floyd said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and still the police officer applied the chokehold to his windpipe, it was declared in that moment that a human life means nothing in that country. That\u2019s where the apocalypse begins.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d will become the condition of the world. We ignore the deadly warnings of climate catastrophe. It took the worldwide outcry of the #MeToo movement to signal to the world that millions of women are in situations where they can\u2019t breathe. Boris Johnson had oxygen support, delivered through a tube under his nose, lingering for days <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/boris-johnson-it-was-50-50-whether-to-put-me-on-ventilator-coronavirus\">between life and death</a> \u2013 perhaps he knew the meaning of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d? Across the world right now we are asking ourselves what it means to be human.</p> <p>When people say they are colour-blind they are being naive. They are in sweet denial. History is not colour-blind. Examine the history of slavery and of colonialism and of genocide. Education is not colour-blind. Otherwise the objective facts of what a people have done and what has been done to a people would be as much part of the curriculum as the death of Socrates, the plays of Shakespeare, and basic mathematics.

Black Americans have had enough | Niambi Michele Carter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maybe the real trouble is colour deficiency. We know what racism is. It is, finally, the reduction of the human race to the validity of one race. Put another way, it is saying that there is a hierarchy of being human, that some are more human than others, or that some are less. The moment you can think, even unconsciously, that one race is superior to another, that is the beginning of murder. It is the beginning of genocide. By small degrees what is innocently thought of as minor variations of a hierarchy of being human slowly becomes degenerates into allowing one set of people to suffer and endure conditions that another set of people would not tolerate, for a second, for themselves.</p> <p>Racism is a human thing. It is a human problem. It can be solved. All it takes is facing the truth that many of us have been lied to about history and about other people\u2019s humanity. All it takes is realising that to passively sanction the diminishment of anyone\u2019s humanity on any ground is to begin to sanction your own diminishment too. This really isn\u2019t rocket science. Racism is a failure of humanity. It is a failure to be human. This lack of empathy is part of the problem that is destroying the world. The lack of empathy extends not just to humans but to other species, and even to the planet as a whole.&nbsp;</p> <p>That police officer who pressed his knee on George Floyd\u2019s neck snuffed out one life, but lit a universal fire. It is deeply moving that the world has responded not to the death of a great man or woman, but to the killing of one of the Earth\u2019s poor and seemingly insignificant people.&nbsp;</p> <p>We know what to do. We must tear out the unconscious racism in our spirit. We must insist on the human rights of all peoples. We let people live their freedom, and their possibilities, within the law. This is a great moment in the life of humanity and it is rich with the possibilities for change.</p> <p>Maybe \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d will begin the real change that our world so desperately needs.

  "<h2>Top story: It\u2019s like the toppling of Saddam statue, says historian</h2> \n<p>Morning everyone. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories to start your week.</p> \n<p>Anti-racism campaigners have claimed a symbolic victory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">after protesters in Bristol toppled a statue to the 17th century slave trader Edward Colston</a> that has long been the focus of anger in the city. Demonstrators driven by the worldwide reaction to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis gathered at the memorial on Sunday before attaching ropes to it, hauling it down and then pushing it into the docks. The historian David Olusoga&nbsp;compared it to the toppling of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Iraq but home secretary, Priti Patel,&nbsp;called the incident \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. Colston made a fortune from the slave trade <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/who-was-edward-colston-and-why-was-his-bristol-statue-toppled-slave-trader-black-lives-matter-protests\">but was honoured by the city for his philanthropy</a> to churches, almshouses and schools, some of which still bear his name. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/07/anti-racism-mass-protests-take-place-in-cities-across-the-uk\">After a weekend of protests all over the country</a>, ministers have been criticised by black politicians and campaigners<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/ministers-face-backlash-over-suggestions-that-britain-is-not-racist\"> for claiming that Britain is not racist</a>.

  "<p>The moment Gareth Thomas found out he was HIV positive, all he could imagine was the Aids epidemic. Sensational images of his future took over: frailty, shame, isolation, social exclusion. He remembered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/sep/04/how-we-made-dont-die-of-ignorance-aids-campaign\">Norman Fowler\u2019s tombstone advert</a> and the people with leprosy he learned about at school who were banished to colonies. He thought it was a death sentence.</p> <p>\u201cIt was an overriding feeling that my life was over,\u201d says the former Welsh rugby captain. \u201cIt\u2019s like somebody holding a gun to your head and pulling the trigger \u2013 how do you explain how that feels?\u201d</p> <p>It has been almost nine months <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gareththomas14/status/1172979157762039810\">since Thomas announced </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gareththomas14/status/1172979157762039810\">he was HIV positive</a>. A BBC documentary, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0008yrh/gareth-thomas-hiv-and-me\">Gareth Thomas: HIV and Me</a>, aired shortly afterwards. He timed the announcement to coincide with his taking <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-wales-49713288/gareth-thomas-takes-on-ironman-wales-to-break-hiv-stigma\">part in an Ironman triathlon</a>. It was a carefully orchestrated media campaign to drive home a very simple message: HIV didn\u2019t weaken him. He was in control. His life was not over.</p> <p>Thomas is probably the most famous person who has talked about living in the UK with HIV. The Terrence Higgins Trust conducted a survey shortly after his announcement and found that 74% of British adults were aware he had HIV, which was helped by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-50440058\">Prince Harry\u2019s public show of support</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I knew about HIV was everything I shouldn\u2019t have known about HIV,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was very historical, very past tense and very unfactual.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/04/living-with-hiv-always-get-asked-are-you-going-to-die\">Like many people living with HIV</a> today, Thomas takes one pill every day at 6am, which stops the virus from replicating in his body. Modern antiretroviral medication reduces the virus in the bloodstream to such an extent that a person becomes \u201cundetectable\u201d \u2013 they are unable to pass on the virus through sex.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef3006211760e6b3707c1714567ca759ddccd554\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef3006211760e6b3707c1714567ca759ddccd554/0_0_2204_1323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gareth Thomas playing against the All Blacks for the Lions in 2005\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Playing against the All Blacks for the Lions in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Gray/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The beginning of lockdown got him in a \u201cright old tizz\u201d, he says, speaking via Zoom from his home near Bridgend, Wales, where he lives with his husband, Stephen Williams-Thomas. Hearing the word \u201cvirus\u201d on the radio constantly brought him back to darker times \u2013 and the fear he felt about finding out he was HIV positive. He cried a lot.</p> <p>Now he is in a more comfortable rhythm. \u201cIn the first week of lockdown, I thought: I\u2019ve got to get super-fit, learn maths, read books and bake banana bread. There was all that pressure that you can\u2019t waste time. Now I just do the stuff I want to do.\u201d This includes walking the dog and spending lots of time with his husband, \u201cwhich is really nice because it\u2019s not something we are used to\u201d. His work, as a media commentator and campaigner, is at a \u201cbare minimum now\u201d, in contrast to its usual hectic pace \u2013 and the house-move just down the road that was supposed to be completed is on hold. \u201cI\u2019m not buying into the pressure of having to fill my time just because I\u2019ve got time.\u201d</p> <p>Is it hard to be still, as someone who built a career out of competing? \u201cPeople think competitors are winners, or people who have to concede. I\u2019m competitive because I enjoy competition \u2013 not because I feel like I have to achieve something. I really found this \u2013 not having any competition for probably the first time ever in this world \u2013 quite calming.\u201d</p> <p>He first got married in 2001, to Jemma Thomas, whom he had known at school. He came out to her in 2006, and she supported him through his public announcement of his&nbsp;sexuality. Their divorce was finalised in 2010 and Thomas married Stephen a few years ago, without fanfare. In fact, he made the marriage public only after revealing his HIV diagnosis, thanking his partner for his support. Carrying such a secret is familiar territory for Thomas \u2013 when he came out publicly in 2009 at the age of 35, becoming one of the first professional athletes to do so, he said he had endured \u201cyears of despair\u201d keeping his sexuality a secret from his wife, friends, family and colleagues. Even today, he shuts down any questions about his marriages.</p> <p>Thomas shot on to the professional rugby scene in 1994, aged 20, playing for his home town, Bridgend. He made his international debut just a year later against Japan. It was playing for Wales that cemented his reputation. Career highlights include captaining Wales in 2005 to the first grand slam in 27 years, in 2007, before going on to become the country\u2019s most capped rugby union player (he was overtaken by Stephen Jones in 2011).</p> <p>To come out in the macho world of rugby was, at the time, extraordinary. To come out as HIV positive in 2019 felt similarly enormous. \u201cIt felt much more shameful,\u201d he says. He won\u2019t say when he was first diagnosed, in order to protect his previous partners, but it was some time ago. Unlike his sexuality, he felt he would be blamed for his HIV status and told that he should have been more careful. \u201cThis was something that I felt people wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac8b5a76564534f8c4052ea1ab89cab910a77085\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac8b5a76564534f8c4052ea1ab89cab910a77085/0_69_3124_1874/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prince Harry attending a Terrence Higgins Trust event with Gareth Thomas at Twickenham last year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prince Harry attending a Terrence Higgins Trust event with Thomas at Twickenham last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He would be proved right. For evidence that stigma against those with HIV is still very much alive, consider the manner with which Thomas was forced to tell his parents. One day, having stayed with them, his father was driving him to get a train to London. They noticed a man standing in the road. His father pulled over to check if he was OK.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a reporter. He stuck his head in the window and he said to my father: \u2018Do you have any comment about your son having HIV?\u2019 I put the window up and I said to my father: \u2018Just drive.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Thomas reassured his father that it was \u201cjust the press looking for a story\u201d. Thomas boarded the train to London and his father went home. The reporter followed his dad.</p> <p>\u201cHe knocked on the door and my mum and my dad answered,\u201d says Thomas. They noticed a recording device in the reporter\u2019s pocket. Again, the reporter asked them to comment on their son\u2019s HIV status. His parents refused and closed the door. \u201cThen I had the phone call from my mother, in tears. I have never felt like I was so far away from home in my entire life.\u201d</p> <p>When Thomas arrived back in Wales that night, he went to his parents\u2019 house and told them everything. They, too, had very little understanding about the realities of being HIV positive in the UK today. \u201cWhat this journalist didn\u2019t know is that my parents thought I was gonna die \u2013 they didn\u2019t know any different.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas and his legal team were granted an injunction<strong> </strong>preventing the newspaper from revealing that he was HIV positive. It was the catalyst for Thomas deciding to go public, however, and he began making the BBC documentary. Before its release, though, his legal team were unable to prevent a story running in the Sun about an unnamed sports star who was about to reveal that he had HIV.</p> <p>Thomas says the article was \u201cthe biggest load of bullshit to do with HIV\u201d. Why does he think there is still an appetite to expose people as HIV positive? \u201cBecause people don\u2019t know that much about HIV, it is a really easy subject to sensationalise. There are not that many public figures who are open about it.\u201d</p> <p>He is still angry about losing his autonomy over the situation. Thomas is incredibly close to his family, especially his parents, and is fiercely protective of them. \u201cIt was my right to pick the moment to tell my family about this. It wasn\u2019t somebody else\u2019s right to force that moment upon us. I can never pick that moment again. I never had that opportunity and that really pisses me off.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas has <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/gareth-thomas-says-a-tabloid-reporter-outed-him-as-hiv-to-his-parents-before-he-could-633945\">previously stated that</a> he would not have revealed his status were it not for newspaper threats to publish it. Now he is grateful that it is public. \u201cI actually feel kind of empowered and feel like I live a freer, happier life when I don\u2019t have secrets,\u201d he says.&nbsp;\u201cI\u2019m quite happy to shine a light on the negative moments in life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75cbcf09d08ebc6b70e2ef66a5a4d152aaf9598c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75cbcf09d08ebc6b70e2ef66a5a4d152aaf9598c/215_1_3541_2125/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Celebrating after completing his first Ironman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Celebrating after completing his first Ironman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Huw Fairclough/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Thomas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/dec/19/gareth-thomas-gay\">came out as gay</a>, he was the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/britishandirishlionsrugby/6841818/Wales-and-Lions-full-back-Gareth-Thomas-reveals-he-is-gay.html\">first </a><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/britishandirishlionsrugby/6841818/Wales-and-Lions-full-back-Gareth-Thomas-reveals-he-is-gay.html\">professional rugby union player</a> to do so. Since then, he has counselled other athletes on coming out, including a few footballers.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a media witch-hunt,\u201d says Thomas about the intense focus on the potential first openly gay Premier League player. \u201cIf it\u2019s taking up column inches now, when there isn\u2019t one, imagine what it will take up when the reality comes our way. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re helping to create an environment where the footballer could feel safe <strong> </strong>and protected.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas retired in 2011 and since then has appeared on Celebrity Big Brother and Dancing on Ice. At one stage, Mickey Rourke was going to adapt his story for the big screen and <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/super_league/celtic_crusaders/9385361.stm\">play the rugby star himself</a>, after reading about him in Sports Illustrated. Rourke apparently even hired a speech coach to <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/movie-star-mickey-rourke-set-94326\">help him master the Welsh accent</a>. The project is still in the works, although it won\u2019t be Rourke playing Thomas, he says.</p> <p>Now well adjusted to his retirement from professional rugby, Thomas doesn\u2019t miss playing much, although he does miss the camaraderie and the structure it gave him. He will probably be remembered as much for his achievements off the field as those on them \u2013 he has used his platform to champion issues close to him: LGBTQ+ equality, mental health and, more recently, raising awareness about HIV. Could his career drift toward something more political?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve ruined years of my life by untruths.

I\u2019ve ruined years of my life by untruths. I\u2019ve looked people in the eye and I\u2019ve been somebody who I\u2019m really not. People always say to me: \u2018You\u2019ve earned the right to move on now.\u2019 But you know what? I don\u2019t want to ever be that person again. So I\u2019m not going to forget about those moments because if I forget about them, then I justify them. So I make sure that I keep all my screw-ups with me.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas plans to continue doing what he can to raise awareness around HIV and has taken on the role of <a href=\"https://www.tht.org.uk/news/gareth-thomas-announced-hiv-commissioner\">commissioner on the first HIV Commission</a>, which was set up by the Terrence Higgins Trust and National Aids Trust to create recommendations on how to end HIV transmissions in England. </p> <p>\u201cI feel really proud of the way I took control of my narrative,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I felt it was potentially educating or re-educating a lot of people.\u201d </p> <p>Is it a topic that should be taught in schools? \u201cYeah, I personally think so,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m very passionate about children learning about HIV; to be able to protect yourself or to be able to have the knowledge of HIV is a very powerful tool to have. And, I\u2019ll be brutally honest, I personally think it would make my life, and the lives of other people with HIV, a lot easier or a lot less complicated.\u201d</p> <p>Still, things are a lot less complicated for Thomas now than they were this time last year.

Cancer patients (34%) were the most likely to receive care as normal, but only 10% of very overweight people did so.</p> <p>The conclusions have come from academics at Essex University led by Prof Michaela Benzeval, the director of its <a href=\"https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/\">Understanding Society</a> study at the Institute for Social and Economic Research, which undertakes longitudinal research into life in the UK and is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.</p> <p>Their stark findings, based on the experience of 3,414 people with health problems, have prompted experts to warn that patients\u2019 inability to access care in recent months could damage their health, increase the already large number of people on NHS waiting lists and even cost lives.</p> <p>Rachel Power, the chief executive of the Patients Association, said: \u201cWhile the radical changes the NHS made to its services were impressive as an organisational feat, it should not congratulate itself too quickly. The consequences for patients of so much treatment being curtailed have not yet been identified.</p> <p>\u201cThis emerging research suggests they might prove to be very serious indeed.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, stressed that the NHS\u2019s \u201cdifficult decision\u201d to cancel so much planned care during the pandemic was intended to stop patients getting coronavirus by coming into hospital for care and to free up staff to concentrate on the disease. But it resulted in a backlog of patients whose operation or assessment now needed to happen as soon as possible, he added.</p> <p>Marshall said: \u201cAlthough these health interventions might not have been deemed critical, they will have been necessary for our patients, or else they would not have been recommended. In some cases, the longer patients have to wait, the more likely it is conditions will deteriorate.\u201d</p> <p>The research is the first to quantify how many patients decided not to proceed with a scheduled test, operation or outpatient consultation. NHS leaders and senior doctors have pointed out that many patients were too scared to come into hospital.</p> <p>One in 10 people cancelled their own care, the research found. People with respiratory problems (12%), cardiovascular conditions (12%) and diabetes (11%) were the most likely to do so. But only 7% of cancer patients opted not to proceed.</p> <p>More positively, the study also found that, despite the suspension of so much hospital-based care, 98% of people were still able to obtain prescription medications and 75% could access GP services or see a pharmacist. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging that a high proportion of people have been able to access care in the community,\u201d said Marshall.</p> <p>Jennifer Dixon, the chief executive of the Health Foundation, which co-funded the research along with the ESRC, voiced unease about its findings.</p> <p>She said: \u201cThese findings show the serious impact Covid-19 has had on the delivery of services for people with long-term conditions like cancer, diabetes and cardio-vascular disease. That 63% of people with serious long-term conditions had their planned treatment cancelled suggests we may be storing up greater health problems for the future.</p> <p>\u201cWhile measures were put in place to protect and support vulnerable people, it\u2019s evident that many people\u2019s needs may have gone unmet during the lockdown, meaning their conditions may have worsened when they should have been receiving care.\u201d</p> <p>Benzeval said the widespread lack of treatment was \u201cobviously worrying for the individuals concerned, and may impact on their long-term outcomes\u201d.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the NHS in England<strong>&nbsp;</strong>said:&nbsp;\u201cData for health service usage show a strong rebound in patients coming forward for check ups and treatment. The ONS report today has not found evidence of significantly increased cancer mortality, with&nbsp;Covid-protected cancers hubs in place and almost 30,000 people starting cancer treatment in March.

  "<p>Under the cover of lockdown, they came. Armed with petrol bombs, acid bombs, gas cylinders, molotov cocktails and explosives, the men, numbering around 100, piled stealthily into small boats to cross over the Ganges river. Reaching their target, the banks of the small town of Telinipara, they climbed ashore. And then, they pounced.</p> <p>The violent onslaught that began at midday of 12 May was the pinnacle of the worst outbreak of religious violence in India since the riots that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/india-delhi-after-hindu-mob-riot-religious-hatred-nationalists\">ripped through north-east Delhi in February</a> and killed over 50 people. Over three days in this small town in West Bengal, which, like the rest of India was under a strict nationwide coronavirus lockdown that confined everyone to their homes, Hindu attackers burned and decimated Muslim homes and shops and vandalised two mosques and a Muslim shrine. According to multiple accounts given to the Guardian, the perpetrators also exposed themselves to Muslim women and made rape and death threats as they carried out the brutality. In retaliation, local Muslims then began setting fire to Hindu homes.

Already socio-economically disadvantaged, Muslims have faced discrimination, boycotts and fatal lynchings and a recent amendment to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/20/india-largest-protests-in-decades-signal-modi-may-have-gone-too-far\">citizenship law</a>, introduced in December, ruled that refugees from all religions except Islam could have Indian citizenship.</p> <p>Modi\u2019s landslide re-election win in May last year marked an escalation in the Hindu nationalist agenda, and with that came more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/06/feed-them-bullets-not-biriyani-bjp-uses-delhi-elections-to-stoke-religious-hatred\">brazenly anti-Muslim rhetoric</a> from BJP leaders and politicians. It was the provocative comments of a BJP leader that are widely acknowledged to have sparked the communal riots in Delhi in February.&nbsp;And as coronavirus began to take hold across India in March, it was the comments of BJP politicians and public figures that helped fuel the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-targeting-muslims-spread-in-india\">widely-adopted conspiracy theory</a> that it was a \u201cMuslim virus\u201d and that Muslims across the country were on a mission of \u201ccorona jihad\u201d to infect innocent Hindus.</p> <p>The scapegoating of Muslims as coronavirus \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d&nbsp;was followed by&nbsp;everything from the boycotts of Muslim businesses to refusals by hospitals to take in Muslim patients.&nbsp;But in Telinipara, it manifested as an all-out anti-Muslim riot. This week, the police filed cases against two BJP MPs for their role in triggering the violence.&nbsp;</p> <p>The trouble began for Telinipara when it emerged that five Muslims had tested positive for coronavirus in early May. Within hours<strong>,</strong>&nbsp;in many Hindu majority localities of Telinipara, the residents set up blockades on roads and lanes to bar Muslims from entering.</p> <p>\u201cMuslims were banned from using public toilets and collecting food provisions from ration shops,\u201d said Mohammad Hashim, a local municipality councillor. \u201cIn the neighbouring town of Chandannagar, using loudspeakers, some Hindus made public announcements, asking people not to let Muslims from Telinipara enter the area. Hindu youths even threatened to beat up Hindu shopkeepers if they sold anything to Muslims.\u201d</p> <p>It was also on 10 May that things began to turn violent. The first reported incident was that night when a gang of young Hindu men from the village who, armed with sticks and metal rods, attacked a group of Muslims living in a labourer colony and demanded they leave the colony. In retaliation, local Muslim men began attacking Hindu shops and homes, burning some to the ground.</p> <p>On 11 May, West Bengal BJP MP Locket Chatterjee spoke to a local TV channel, claiming that Muslims in Telinipara were violently refusing to comply with coronavirus quarantine. \u201cIn Telinipara, Muslims have vandalised and set fire to Hindu households,\u201d she said. \u201cThose who attacked the Hindus are all corona positive. They do not want to go on quarantine. They are moving around freely in the Hindu localities. They want to infect all Hindus. Even police have not taken any action against them.\u201d</p> <p>However police, health officials and those who tested positive have since confirmed to the Guardian that this statement was false and all five reported to the police station as requested and had been peacefully taken to a local quarantine centre.</p> <p>Another Bengal BJP MP, Arjun Singh, also waded in, posting a photo of one of the Muslim labourers who had been injured in the first attack. But Singh claimed the man was an injured Hindu, beaten by Muslim mobs, and posted on Faceboook: \u201cHow long will the blood of Hindus flow on in Bengal \u2026 we will not stay quiet if they [Muslims] attack ordinary people. You are playing with fire. Bengal will burn to ashes.\u201d</p> <p>The next day, on 11 May, Singh posted: \u201cIf police and [West Bengal] government are not protecting the Hindus,&nbsp;we will come out and fight to the last drop of our blood, to save our own people.\u201d</p> <p>Humayun Kabir, local commissioner of police, confirmed that after an enquiry, the police had filed two cases against Singh and one against Chatterjee&nbsp;accusing them of inciting rioting&nbsp;and a cybercrime investigation was being carried out into Singh\u2019s social media posts.</p> <p>However, Kailash Vijayvargiya, BJP national general secretary, denied the BJP&nbsp;had any&nbsp;involvement in the riots and insisted it was caused by Muslims violating lockdown who \u201cattacked Hindu dominated areas\u201d. He accused police commissioner Kabir of being biased and said he has \u201cinstigated crimes against the victims, ie Hindus.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur MPs had been there [in Telinipara] to protect Hindus,\u201d he added. \u201cThey were there to stop the riot but have been slapped with riot cases. I demand an enquiry against the accused police officials.\u201d</p> <p>Yet as Chatterjee and Singh\u2019s words began to be shared widely on social media, it appears that Hindus in the surrounding area began to mobilise. \u201cGo ahead, Arjun Singh. We are with you on your mission,\u201d one comment read. The next day, the armed mob of 100 men boarded boats to Telinipara and launched their attack.</p> <p>Mohammad Sajid, a 22-year-old Muslim resident of Telinipara who witnessed the men descend, said that most of the Hindu attackers were outsiders, not from the village, and most carried guns with them.</p> <p>\u201cThey were around 100 young men,\u201d said Sajid. \u201cAlmost all of them used <em>gamchha</em> [a thin towel] to mask their faces. Some of them carried iron rods, crowbars and hammers. Some carried bombs and Molotov cocktails. As soon as they appeared in the Muslim area they started throwing the bombs and Molotov cocktails targeting the Muslim houses and many Muslims started screaming for help. Most Muslims, including women and children, latched up their front doors from inside and slipped out through their back doors.\u201d</p> <p>Police allegedly ignored the frantic calls from victims. Sajid added: \u201cThe rioters broke open the front doors using heavy tools and entered the houses carrying jerry cans, apparently filled with petrol. Gas cylinders exploded inside most of the houses and within moments they burst aflame.\u201d</p> <p>In the aftermath of the attack, the Muslim and Hindu communities, many of whom had lived in small shacks which were now destroyed, surveyed their respective losses in grief and disbelief. 140 people, both Hindus and Muslims, have been arrested in connection with the riot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5320527ea02c65d1d7f130c3164c770f03d1e0a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5320527ea02c65d1d7f130c3164c770f03d1e0a7/0_0_3268_2178/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kanchan Chowdhury, a Hindu woman, sitting inside her kitchen that was destroyed in an attack by a Muslim mob.

  "<p>The UK\u2019s special relationship with the US may end if Donald Trump wins a second term, some of the UK\u2019s most senior retired diplomats and Conservative foreign policy specialists have said. They also say that if the Democrat Joe Biden wins, Washington may view the EU rather than the UK as its primary partner.</p> <p>The anxious assessment of what is at stake for Britain in the US presidential election in November has been made on and off the record in a variety of seminars over the past month, and underlines concerns at Trump\u2019s performance during the coronavirus pandemic. It also reflects diplomatic outreach to the UK by Biden\u2019s chief foreign policy adviser, Antony Blinken.</p> <p>UK diplomats have instead been looking to form a broader alternative alliance of democracies that dilutes dependence on the US.</p> <p>Rory Stewart, the former Conservative international development secretary, said in one assessment: \u201cIf Trump comes in for another four years that will be very challenging for the global system and for Britain\u2019s relationship with the US. If we were to move away from the US, and Trump obviously poses the challenge that that may have to happen, we are going to find ourselves in a situation in which much of our Foreign Office infrastructure had been predicated on working very closely with the US for a very long time.</p> <p>\u201cIf we have to move away from the US, it will involve a much bigger shift in national security infrastructure than we have ever experienced. Almost since Suez, they have been our default.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2000f3bb783a203f464d704123c6d5e9faa6fb5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2000f3bb783a203f464d704123c6d5e9faa6fb5f/0_21_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rory Stewart\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rory Stewart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The UK had taken for granted for years that it would fall into line with US foreign policy position,&nbsp;he said.&nbsp;Any change to that would require a rethink by the&nbsp;Foreign Office&nbsp;because it&nbsp;\u201csometimes had no idea what an independent policy would feel like\u201d.</p> <p>Sir John Sawers, the former head of M16 and a former UK ambassador to the UN, also said Trump\u2019s re-election would be problematic. \u201cThere is no doubt President Trump is the most difficult president for us to deal with,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cHe does not really feel that sense of being part of that transatlantic community, he does not really believe in alliances. He does not really believe in American leadership in the world. We are seeing in this pandemic for the first time what a crisis is like without American leadership. It is the first time in our lifetime we have experienced that.</p> <p>\u201cIf he gets elected for a second time some of the changes we have seen in the past few years will become embedded and entrenched and then, absolutely Britain will not be so much a bridge between the US and Europe. We will need to be bounding closely together with our European partners\u201d .</p> <p>Speaking before the Black Lives Matter protests, he said the election was poised 50-50, and that if Biden were elected the UK would not simply be able to get back into bed with the US as it had been in the past. He called for \u201cmiddle-level powers to come together to tackle China and climate change\u201d. Both men were speaking at Cambridge University\u2019s Centre for Geopolitics.</p> <p>In a sign of British diplomats\u2019 despair with Trump, Sir Peter Westmacott, a former ambassador to Washington, said: \u201cI would love to say, as we look to the future, would it not be nice to see political leadership also addressing old-fashioned principles such as accountability, respect for the rule of law, independent judiciary, telling the truth, institutional independence and indeed the importance of a free press?</p> <p>\u201cThat may not be what public opinion is crying out for, but they are not very far removed from the principles that \u2026 Biden believes in. Otherwise the chances of the western world retaining any sort of moral leadership and giving itself the right to call out other people when they behave badly will be gone forever.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8004f8b93131d99ec9e8b89442c215fbecc7bb99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8004f8b93131d99ec9e8b89442c215fbecc7bb99/0_134_2655_1593/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Westmacott\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Westmacott.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Debate is fierce in British diplomatic circles about whether Trump merely marks the acceleration of a pre-existing trend to a more disengaged US, and whether Biden is either willing or able to reverse the trend.</p> <p>Blinken has tried to reassure British diplomats that Biden will re-engage with multilateral institutions, and told the London thinktank Chatham House that US leadership would return. \u201cWhen Joe Biden looks at the world, one thing stands out. Whether we like it not, the world tends not to organise itself and, for 75 plus years, the US played the leading role in working to organise the world, establishing the institutions, writing the rules and setting the norms,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf we are not doing that, then one of two things happen. Either someone else is, and probably not in a way that advances our interest and values, or no one is, and that can be even worse. Then you have a vacuum which tends to be filled by malevolent things before good things. So the US has a responsibility and self-interest in leading with humility.\u201d</p> <p>Many senior former UK ambassadors are desperately hoping Washington will lead again. One said: \u201cI think that if you have a different, more internationally minded leadership in the US then a lot of what has happened over the past few years can be reversed. If we get another four years of this leadership, then some of the bonds and some of the cement that holds the west together, and holds Europe and America together will be broken forever. If things change in November then we can recapture things if we get the right sort of leadership in Europe.\u201d</p> <p>The same diplomat also said, however, that Biden might \u2013 like Barack Obama \u2013 see Europe and particularly Germany as his primary interlocutor: \u201cIf you get a Joe Biden presidency in the US, then the relationship will focus again on Europe, on Germany and France, and we may feel a little neglected.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"addb17dd8d841f04dc9d7c60f066d76b61ee4674\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/addb17dd8d841f04dc9d7c60f066d76b61ee4674/0_0_2468_1481/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama and Angela Merkel pictured in April 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama and Angela Merkel pictured in April 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kay Nietfield/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said that although Boris Johnson was closer to Trump than most European leaders, the importance of the special relationship was overrated. \u201cIf I\u2019m brutally frank it has not been that special for awhile,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Obama wanted to know what Europe thought about something his first call was to Merkel.\u201d</p> <p>Another ambassador from Tony Blair\u2019s time as prime minister said: \u201cIt\u2019s possible to imagine restored American leadership to a multilateral world. I do not think it is all over, but it does make the November election incredibly important. I cannot see that happening under a Trump II administration. It\u2019s possible, however, to imagine Joe Biden trying to lead us back to a more normative, multilateral and cohesive world.\u201d&nbsp;He pointed to Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw 9,500 US troops from Germany as a sign of the pressure likely to be placed on Nato if he is re-elected.</p> <p>In his address to Chatham House, Blinken gave the impression that the US under Biden would seek to revive the Iran nuclear deal Obama signed but which Trump abandoned. Although he was unremitting in his criticism of Iran\u2019s behaviour in the Middle East, he stressed that the original deal was designed to constrain Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and not its wider behaviour.</p> <p>Blinken was also critical of China for its lack of transparency over the coronavirus, and called on Beijing to be a responsible stakeholder, a phrase first used in 2005 by the then US assistant secretary of state Robert Zoellick.</p>",
  "<p>The Minneapolis city council has pledged to disband the city\u2019s police department and replace it with a new system of public safety, a historic move that comes as calls to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/defund-the-police-us-george-floyd-budgets\">defund law enforcement</a> are sweeping the US.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Speaking at a community rally on Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.fox9.com/news/veto-proof-majority-of-minneapolis-city-council-announces-support-for-dismantling-mpd\">a veto-proof majority</a> of council members <a href=\"https://theappeal.org/minneapolis-city-council-members-announce-intent-to-disband-the-police-department-invest-in-proven-community-led-public-safety/\">declared their intent to \u201cdismantle\u201d and \u201cabolish\u201d</a> the embattled police agency responsible for George Floyd\u2019s death \u2013 and build an alternative model of community-led safety.

The mayor of Los Angeles said he would look to cut as much as $150m from the police this week, just days after he pushed forward a city budget that was increasing it by 7%.</p> \n<p>Following days of protests and widespread accounts of police misconduct in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Sunday that some funding would be moved from the police to \u201cyouth initiatives and social services\u201d. Some council members and others, however, have been pushing for a $1bn divestment from the NYPD.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe41ca84e6d42b481c4cab865a5b8c936ff7b651\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe41ca84e6d42b481c4cab865a5b8c936ff7b651/0_0_3936_2624/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators march against racism and police brutality in Minneapolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators march against racism and police brutality in Minneapolis.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe details will be worked out in the budget process in the weeks ahead, but I want people to understand that we are committed to shifting resources to ensure that the focus is on our young people,\u201d De Blasio said. \u201cAnd I also will affirm while doing that, we will only do it in a way that we are certain continues to ensure that this city will be safe.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>De Blasio also announced that enforcement of regulations involving street vendors \u2013 many of whom are persons of color and, or immigrants \u2013 should not be handled by police. \u201cCivilian agencies can work on proper enforcement and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do going forward,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HelenGymAtLarge/status/1268893914074775552?s=20\">Philadelphia</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElectRyanDorsey/status/1268909453988020224?s=20\">Baltimore</a>, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/06/04/dc-city-council-janeese-lewis-george-election/\">Washington DC</a>, <a href=\"https://sf.curbed.com/2020/6/5/21281670/sf-mayor-defund-police-black-community-sfpd\">San Francisco</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rvp7OgYQ40zWjyhl15TLouRMCFhZ_ApjuJ5m1HmBurk/edit\">other cities</a>, local policymakers have expressed support for some form of defunding or opposing police budget increases in the last week.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For years, abolitionist groups have advocated for governments to take money away from police and prisons and reinvesting the funds in other services.

  "<p>About a month ago some of the wellness podcasts and Instagram accounts I follow started to go decidedly off-piste.&nbsp;</p> <p>Instead of recommending a retreat in Bali or new ways to cook with coconut oil, they were posting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/12/vaccines-5g-bill-gates-why-are-australians-gathering-to-spread-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories\">links about 5G, Bill Gates</a> or more coded but no less strange messages. \u201cWe\u201d shouldn\u2019t trust \u201cthem\u201d. The \u201cthem\u201d being a shadowy, authoritarian cabal that controls the media, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the government and the World Health Organization.&nbsp;</p> <p>In March one usually reasonable podcaster I listen to for health tips started talking about \u201cevil forces\u201d at work. His guest also knew about the \u201cevil forces\u201d. They spoke around it, carefully.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then in April my life coach, a man who mostly advises me about time management and creative projects, told me if a Covid-19 vaccine came along he wouldn\u2019t be taking it \u201cbecause, as you know I am very careful about what I put in my body\u201d.</p> <p>Memes turning up on Maga pages were being reposted by yoga teachers who once quoted Maya Angelou but were now quoting David Icke, while health and wellness mega-influencer <a href=\"https://www.qt.com.au/news/pete-evans-bizarre-covid-posts/4013401/\">Pete Evans was posting about Obamagate</a>, inflated Covid-19 death counts and, most bizarrely, that US race riots were \u201cinstigated by organisations affiliated with the elite\u201d \u2013 alongside recipes for ham hock soup.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/12/vaccines-5g-bill-gates-why-are-australians-gathering-to-spread-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories\">Vaccines, 5G, Bill Gates: why are Australians gathering to spread coronavirus conspiracy theories?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What was going on? How and why did the largely progressive and left-leaning proponents of wellness merge with rightwing conspiracy theorists and Donald Trump supporters?&nbsp;</p> <p>Such unlikely allegiances <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1995/06/19/the-road-to-paranoia\">were termed \u201cfusion paranoia\u201d in a 1995 New Yorker article by the journalist Michael Kelly</a>, who saw leftwing and rightwing activists coalesce around the anti-war and pro-civil liberties movements that shared common traits of anti-government views and belief in conspiracy theories.&nbsp;</p> <p>Such a tight alliance (or fusion paranoia) between the wellness industry and the far-right would have been unthinkable to me a year ago. But the connection between the alt-right, conspiracy theorists and sections of the wellness community have strengthened and bonded during global lockdowns. The messages of the different groups are remarkably the same: the virus is a cover for a plot of totalitarian proportions, designed to stifle freedom of movement, assembly, speech and \u2013 to the horror of some in the wellness industry \u2013 enforce a program of mass vaccinations.&nbsp;</p> <p>A popular, multitrillion-dollar sector, the wellness industry\u2019s huge reach and influence has the power to bring people into the conspiracy that previously would not have had any contact with the alt-right.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"294da826cb17361727fff41ced7ca687344dbfdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/294da826cb17361727fff41ced7ca687344dbfdd/0_0_4446_2964/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Conspiracy theorists protest against vaccinations and 5G at the Botanical Gardens in Melbourne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conspiracy theorists who believe Covid-19 is a scam protest against vaccinations and 5G at the Botanical Gardens in Melbourne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Dodge/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Superstars in the wellness world appear on multiple platforms and have mature, established audiences who may have first followed a wellness influencer for recipes or fitness tips, but are now scrolling through a mixture of quotes by Rumi, Trump and a nurse from Birmingham who has \u201cproof\u201d Covid-19 death certificates are fake.&nbsp;</p> <p>The ongoing and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/18/more-than-150-australian-newsrooms-shut-since-january-2019-as-covid-19-deepens-media-crisis\">now-accelerated collapse of mainstream media</a> has provided a perfect environment for the Covid conspiracies to reach millions of people unchecked and unchallenged.</p> <p>Disagreement with a conspiracy on an influencer\u2019s page could have you blocked, in dispute with other followers or, as the logic of conspiracies dictate, mocked and pitied for not <em>getting it</em> and having your mind controlled by the \u201cevil forces\u201d that you are too dumb to see.</p> <p>Like many conspiracies \u2013 or even religions \u2013 the beliefs are part of a closed system that is engineered to provide answers to our most maddening mysteries but also designed to allow no room for questioning and dissent.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/08/murdoch-media-china-coronavirus-conspiracy-trump-kevin-rudd\">The Murdoch media\u2019s China coronavirus conspiracy has one aim: get Trump re-elected | Kevin Rudd</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And there are a lot of maddening mysteries about the coronavirus. The gaps in our knowledge about the virus, combined with the speed and urgency of new social control measures that started seemingly overnight in March (essentially global home detention), panic buying and intense levels of collective fear in the community, have meant that previously fringe theories have found a broad, sticky surface.</p> <p><a href=\"https://essentialvision.com.au/belief-in-conspiracy-theories\">A poll</a> has found one in five young Australians believe that Bill Gates played a role in the creation and spread of Covid-19, and the same proportion think 5G technology is being used to spread the virus.</p> <p>In some ways the wellness community\u2019s response to the virus is not a shock.&nbsp;</p> <p>Although <a href=\"https://globalwellnessinstitute.org/press-room/statistics-and-facts/\">the global wellness industry</a> was worth an estimated $4.5tn in 2018, and pre-pandemic many practices were becoming mainstream, elements of the sector have always been under siege from the mainstream.&nbsp;</p> <p>This includes those who refuse vaccinations, those who encourage fasting for long periods of time, those who eschew chemotherapy for a raw food diet, and those who believe wifi causes tumours.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now in this current state of emergency \u2013 where almost total social control is paramount for controlling the virus \u2013 purveyors of these views feel they are having their paranoia confirmed.&nbsp;</p> <p>While herbalists, acupuncturists, yoga studios and alternative medicine practitioners were forced to close in the lockdown in some countries, conventional doctors and pharmacies remained open.&nbsp;</p> <p>Speech was also monitored, as the more fringe elements of the wellness scene migrated from platform to platform. Like a belligerent orator at Speakers\u2019 Corner, they kept getting moved on until they either wound up in the darkest corners of the web, or mumbling on podcasts in code about the \u201cdark forces\u201d they could not name.</p> <p>While some in the wellness world appear to have had a terrible time of it, the restrictions actually feed into their ur-narrative. That is:&nbsp;evil forces, including big tech (like YouTube and Facebook which have been removing content), big media and big government are intent on silencing them.&nbsp;</p> <p>This shutting down, or censorship as they call it, further fuses their experiences with figures in the alt-right (including Alex Jones and Steve Bannon), veterans of no-platforming and first amendment wars. These \u201ctrauma bonds\u201d, which strengthen and unite disparate movements, is a maturation of <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13537903.2011.539846\">the trend of Conspirituality</a>, a term coined by Charlotte Ward in 2011 in an article published in the Journal of Contemporary Religion.&nbsp;</p> <p>She noted the overlap between wellness and new age groups and the alt-right as being a \u201cbroad politico-spiritual philosophy based on two core convictions, the first traditional to conspiracy theory, the second rooted in the New Age: 1) a secret group covertly controls, or is trying to control, the political and social order, and 2) humanity is undergoing a \u2018paradigm shift\u2019 in consciousness. Proponents believe that the best strategy for dealing with the threat of a totalitarian \u2018new world order\u2019 is to act in accordance with an awakened \u2018new paradigm\u2019 worldview.\u201d</p> <p>Spending time in this Conspiritual world, it\u2019s easy to see the ecosystem. The same arguments or phrases start appearing, whether you are listening to a podcaster broadcasting from his basement in Byron Bay, or reading the Medium post of a philosopher and yoga teacher based in upstate New York.&nbsp;</p> <p>Down the rabbit hole, listening to dozens of wellness podcasts and YouTube broadcasts, the same themes keep arising: fear as a means of social control, fear as a hormone response that weakens the immune system, how social distancing and intensified hygiene practices ruin the body\u2019s natural immune response, the unhealthy body (the body with pre-existing conditions) being a body that is more reliant on and easily controlled by the state and Big Pharma.&nbsp;</p> <p>Deeply embedded and perhaps central in the connection between the wellness industry and conspiracy is the notion of sovereignty over our bodies. For believers, the sovereign body is the body in a \u201cpure\u201d state, not reliant on chemicals to heal, and trusted to fire up its own immune response when confronted with a virus \u2013 even a novel one like Covid-19.&nbsp;Believers aren\u2019t dissuaded by the facts: all the pure bodies that died because there wasn\u2019t a smallpox or polio or chickenpox vaccine.</p> <p>For many in the wellness industry, a pure body is their life\u2019s work. Don\u2019t underestimate their fight.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>\u2022 Brigid Delaney is a Guardian Australia columnist and the author of Wellmania (Black Inc)</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 June 2020 to clarify that acupuncturists, yoga studios and alternative medicine&nbsp;practitioners&nbsp;were only forced to close in some countries.</p> <p><br></p>"
