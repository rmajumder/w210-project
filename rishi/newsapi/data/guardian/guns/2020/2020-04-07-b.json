  "<p>California officials this week described a \u201cslow and steady increase\u201d in confirmed coronavirus infections, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-07/california-coronavirus-peak\">predicting</a> that the peak of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/california-coronavirus-shelter-in-place-flatten-curve\">state\u2019s outbreak</a> will occur in mid to late May.</p> <p>California has recorded more than 370 deaths due to Covid-19 and 15,800 confirmed cases, nowhere near as bad as the surge ravaging New York.</p> <p>Andrew Noymer, an associate professor of public health at the University of California, Irvine, explained what was behind the state\u2019s projections \u2013 and what Californians can expect next. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/why-california-waiting-test-results-backlog-quest-diagnostics\">Why is California still waiting for nearly 60,000 coronavirus test results?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Earlier projections estimated California would see its peak in mid-April. Why do state officials now believe the peak will occur in mid to late May?</h2> <p>It\u2019s a guess. California has been under statewide social distancing for three weeks. Social distancing works, but it takes a while to bite. A whole bunch of exposures take five to seven days to work out. And transmissions kept happening, for example every time there were weekends when people disregarded the order. </p> <p>So you have to do a reality check on the math. We\u2019re still seeing increasing numbers statewide every day, so we can\u2019t predict that it\u2019s going to end a week from now. There\u2019s also a desire not to call the peak too soon and potentially give people false hope. This is managing expectations.</p> <h2>In Los Angeles county, where there are <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-07/california-coronavirus-peak\">more than 6,000 cases</a>, officials have urged residents to <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-06/l-a-residents-told-to-stay-home-avoid-shopping-to-slow-coronavirus-here-is-what-you-need-to-know\">avoid the grocery store</a> this week, if possible. Why do they think this week will be so bad?</h2> <p>LA county officials are seeing an uptick in cases that is making them anxious. They\u2019re thinking \u2018Well, how can we improve the lockdown?\u2019 In Italy, police were enforcing the lockdown. We have a slightly less severe order here, and they\u2019re saying, \u2018We don\u2019t want anyone who needs groceries not to get them.\u2019 They\u2019re not saying we have to hunker down for the next eight weeks, but they would like to nip this little uptick in the bud.</p> <h2>What happens after we hit the peak?</h2> <p>If cases peak in mid-May, that doesn\u2019t mean the lockdown ends. It means they peak and start to decline. And although there could be declining cases in the midst of a six-week or longer lockdown, after the lockdown ends, cases could go up again. So the low in cases we see under a better and better adherence to a lockdown \u2013 that may be a mirage, not an oasis. It\u2019s really too early to say that when you see cases go down, that that means all clear to end the lockdown.</p> <h2>So how does California decide to start to reopen after we think we\u2019ve hit a peak?</h2> <p>That\u2019s going to require serological testing \u2013 looking for antibodies in the state\u2019s population. We want to do serosurveys that are scientific samples of the California population, because there\u2019s this elusive number of people who have already had it, asymptomatically. Everyone is hoping that that number is higher than we realize, that there\u2019s way more people who have already had it and have recovered.</p> <p>If these antibodies aren\u2019t widespread, then ending the lockdown is just going to bring back another wave. This virus isn\u2019t just going to vanish under lockdown and then we can all just come out. If we don\u2019t have some level of herd immunity, it will generate a second wave, because the virus is still out there in pockets.</p> <p>There\u2019s some possibility that we\u2019ll catch a break with seasonality effects \u2013 that it\u2019s just less transmissible in the summertime. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s especially likely, but I don\u2019t rule it out. It\u2019s also possible we\u2019ll open the lockdown too soon, but just catch a lucky bounce on the seasonal effects. But under that scenario, I absolutely guarantee a fall wave, a return.</p> <p>Vaccination would be a huge game-changer, but that looks 12 months away or more. So we all need to steel ourselves for doing this at least up until 1 June and potentially longer.</p>",

How much worse the situation is compared with the usual numbers of people who die in normal circumstances has been a subject of some debate in some sections of the media, and particularly on social media. </p> \n  <p>A blogpost by David Shaw, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Biomedical Ethics, University of Basel, posted on the British Medical Journal provides some much-needed context. Shaw identifies four important contextual factors that should be borne in mind to understand reports of death tolls that make headlines in the daily press. For example, he writes: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[I]n all the millions of words written about how many people have died in each country each day, no coverage appears to have given the baseline daily death rate before the outbreak began. Take Scotland: here, the death rate had averaged between 6 and 8 people per day before increasing to 16 on the 1<sup>st</sup> of April. But the <a href=\"https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/statistics/vital-events-ref-tables/2018/vital-events-ref-tables-18-publication.pdf\">typical death rate in Scotland</a> is 160 people per day, with about a quarter of them dying of cancer. This means that the virus is currently increasing the daily rate by 10% (and before that around 5%) \u2013 a substantial increase, but not as massive as many members of the public are probably assuming, given the press coverage. Reporting the increasing number of deaths in isolation without this context is likely to increase people\u2019s stress about the virus, because people are unaware of how many people normally die each day. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><a href=\"https://blogs.bmj.com/medical-ethics/2020/04/02/the-vital-contexts-of-coronavirus/\">Read more on the BMJ website: The vital contexts of coronavirus.</a></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T15:45:04.925Z\">at 4.45pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8c99548f08ec70cecec420\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T15:18:59.356Z\">4.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More people have now died from the coronavirus in New York City than perished in the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center, the <strong>Associated Press</strong> reports.<br></p> \n  <p> At least 3,202 people in the city have been killed by the virus, according to the latest figures released on Tuesday.

Non-profit food banks and food pantries rely in large part on surplus food from a range of food businesses. For example, many restaurants donate excess food. But during this time of social distancing, restaurants are closed, and many other normal channels of excess food have also shut down. To make matters worse, as supply is dwindling, demand for food bank services is going up.\u2063 \u2063 Today, I want to support those on the front lines at our nation\u2019s food banks and those who are relying on them for food with a $100 million gift to @FeedingAmerica. Feeding America will quickly distribute the funds to their national network of food banks and food pantries, getting food to those countless families who need it.\u2063 \u2063 Feeding America is the largest non-profit focused on food security. Millions of Americans are turning to food banks during this time. If you want to help, the link to Feeding America is in my bio. They\u2019d be excited and grateful for donations of any size.</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jeffbezos/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Jeff Bezos</a> (@jeffbezos) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-04-02T18:00:55+00:00\">Apr 2, 2020 at 11:00am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Bezos\u2019s donation represents less than 0.1% of his estimated $123bn fortune.</p> <p>The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has given $100m to efforts to develop a Covid-19 vaccine and to fund testing and treatments.

They are also notorious for people spitting, to rid their mouths of the bitter taste after drinking.</p> <p>In the wake of Covid-19, all kava bars are now only providing takeaway, and at the Blue Galaxy Nakamal, in Bladiniere Estate on the outskirts of Port Vila, Kelsie Java is pulling on disposable gloves to fill up plastic bottles full of the beloved drink to sell to customers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c2e494f14bf5eeab82e92366d004c9fab256c440\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2e494f14bf5eeab82e92366d004c9fab256c440/0_263_5496_3298/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Vanuatu has introduced hand-washing measures, including at food markets, as well as a curfew of 9pm and a limit on gatherings to no more than five people.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vanuatu has introduced hand-washing measures, including at food markets, as well as a curfew of 9pm and a limit on gatherings to no more than five people.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicky Kuautonga/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cUsually I open until midnight.

  "<p>Alma\u2019s mother rings her. \u201cMum,\u201d says the name flashing up on her phone. \u201cNot An Emergency Contact.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000h3mf\">Alma\u2019s Not Normal</a> (BBC Two) is written by and stars the comedian Sophie Willan. It\u2019s based on her award-winning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/23/sophie-willan-branded-review-edinburgh\">2017 Edinburgh show, Branded</a>, which drew on her chaotic childhood (some of it spent in care) as the daughter of a heroin addict and her experiences in later life as a sex worker. What was a primarily a laughter-seeking standup set has now been bulked out with a fine cast, an array of swiftly and surely drawn characters and an emotional undertow that \u2013 when the time is right \u2013 suddenly surfaces to punch you in the solar plexus and leave you breathless with sorrow.</p> <p>Alma (Willan) is a 30-ish woman who has just broken up with Anthony, the boyfriend she has had since she was 15. This is not to her detriment (we may side with Alma\u2019s grandma\u2019s succinct take on the man \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019s a fuck\u201d) but she can\u2019t quite see that yet. Anthony left her for the younger, hotter, soon impregnated Melanie, and with the rent to pay. Pink fur coat on, Alma cycles determinedly to the job centre to find that \u201csandwich artist at SubnGo\u201d is the only option available for someone who was a latchkey kid from five (\u201cThink Mowgli with a mullet,\u201d she suggests) and didn\u2019t go to school until she was seven. \u201cI was never much of an academic,\u201d says Alma, delicately, to her interrogator, over flashbacks of Mowgli stepping over unconscious adults to get to the cornflakes in a squalid kitchen. She is given an expression of interest form to take home and fill out.</p> <p>Grandma Joan, all mouth <em>and</em> leopardskin trousers, alongside an enduring love for fried Spam, is played by the mighty Lorraine Ashbourne. Joan took Alma in after social services took the child away from her mother, Lin, and placed her in foster care. Their roughly loving bond, formed and maintained in adversity, is one of the highlights of the half hour.</p> <p>Siobhan Finneran plays Alma\u2019s broken mother (once a punk, \u201cthe Iggy Pop of the psych ward\u201d), who is still confined to the Bury psychiatric hospital due to her tendency to set fire to houses whenever she is in the grip of her post-addiction psychosis. Lin has taken up painting, although Alma notes that she always liked ornamental pixies, too. \u201cIf she\u2019d discovered them before heroin, we could have had a very different life.\u201d Finneran, Ashbourne and Willan form a powerful central trio, able to pivot deftly and naturally between comedy and tragedy, hitting viewers with the hilarious or desperate truth of any moment as required.</p> <p>They are ably supported by fellow standup (and singer) Jayde Adams as Alma\u2019s best friend, Leanne, who, despite her unglamorous work as a butcher\u2019s assistant, is never short of a beau in Bury thanks to her exotic accent (she\u2019s from Bristol). It is Leanne who learns \u2013 from Winky Anne, although she\u2019s had that eye fixed now \u2013 that there is money to be made in escort work: \u201c\u00a37.50 an hour, I\u2019m on,\u201d she notes surlily to Alma over a pint. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got to wear that hat.\u201d When she gets home, Alma screws up her expression of interest form and puts in a call to Winky Anne\u2019s employer instead. \u201cYes,\u201d she says firmly before we leave her. \u201cI\u2019m aware it\u2019s sex.\u201d</p> <p>Alma\u2019s Not Normal has much in common with Daisy Haggard\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/22/back-to-life-review-daisy-haggard\">Back to Life</a> and Aisling Bea\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/08/this-way-up-review-the-worse-things-get-the-better-the-jokes-become\">This Way Up</a>. In line with the journalistic law that three of anything constitutes an official trend, I can now delightedly pronounce the birth of a new one \u2013 single-authored-by-a-female-comedian-dramas-that-capture-the-messy-imperfections-of-life-and-in-particular-the-ramifications-on-mental-health-of-previous-often-childhood-experience-and-are-brilliant-at-entwining-grief-and-laughter-and-folding-micropscopic-detail-in-with-macroscopic-coverage-of-this-crazy-thing-we-call-life.</p> <p>Some trends pass, of course. But some \u2013 especially when they are established by pioneers producing high-quality work \u2013 represent the beginning of a new way of doing or thinking about things. I would like to think that Alma is another sign that female-led shows are becoming a less fearful proposition for commissioners and audiences. That the weight of drama a half hour comedy can bear (or vice versa) is no longer carved in stone but can be left up to the creator and his or her talents to divine. That stories untold in the mainstream \u2013 about mental health, bad childhoods, prison sentences or any of a million other things \u2013 are beginning to be viewed as a rich seam to be uncovered, not an elephant trap for ratings.

The government has released modelling showing the strain that would be placed on the Australian health system without strict lockdown procedures. Some 35,000 intensive care beds could be required at the pandemic\u2019s peak \u2013<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/07/modelling-shows-the-strain-coronavirus-could-put-on-australias-health-system\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/07/modelling-shows-the-strain-coronavirus-could-put-on-australias-health-system\">well beyond capacity</a>.

  "<p><strong>Premier League player: Ryan Bertrand </strong><em>Southampton</em></p> <p>We\u2019ve heard a lot about this figure of 30% \u2013 the cuts that the Premier League would like players to accept in order to plug the financial hole should the worst come to the worst and the season not be able to finish. It has been suggested that it would prop up the lost broadcast revenues of around \u00a3750m but, quite simply, it is maths for dummies.</p> <p>You cannot prescribe a blanket approach. We might need to see a 19% cut at one of the smaller clubs, for example, and 36% at the larger Champions League ones. It\u2019s not because these clubs should pay more; it\u2019s just that their work force is greater. I\u2019m sure if you did 40% here, 20% there and 16% there, you\u2019d get to the overall 30%. I feel that once everyone makes their initial cuts, the overall football model will be saved.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/07/premier-league-chief-executive-claims-very-real-threat-of-its-clubs-going-bust-furlough\">Premier League chief defends clubs' 'restraint' in their furloughing of staff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But really we\u2019ve looked at the situation internally, with the comments of the health minister, Matt Hancock, not helping, when we would be better advised to look at it externally in terms of the Premier League as a business and raise money. You could do this via a loan, secured against future broadcast revenues, which are due to go up and up \u2013 regardless of the pandemic. Demand far outweighs supply at the moment.</p> <p>Covid-19 is a freak situation. It\u2019s got nothing to do with bad business practices at the Premier League or the clubs and I don\u2019t understand why an external short-term loan against the broadcast revenues, plugging the \u00a3750m gap, can\u2019t be done. We then save government money by not using furloughs and this can be given to the NHS. The money that players pay in tax could also be safeguarded and put towards the fight against the virus.

Even at League One level you can earn a few quid but in League Two, although we\u2019re not on bad money, it\u2019s not a situation where we can afford to say: \u201cWe\u2019ll take a 50% pay cut.\u201d We\u2019ve all got mortgages. We\u2019ve got to live.</p> <p>We\u2019re fortunate at Colchester in that the club is financially well looked after. We sold a couple of players last summer and our run to the Carabao Cup quarter-final stood us in good stead. But if you look at, say, Macclesfield, a club already in money trouble with boys not getting paid on time, you dread to think of being in their shoes. It\u2019s not just about the players getting their wages, it\u2019s whether the clubs are going to stay afloat. All of this is going to have a massive effect in League Two. We got an email saying that we\u2019d get April\u2019s pay but we\u2019ve not had an update since. I know quite a lot of clubs, especially in League Two, have used the furlough scheme and, although we haven\u2019t done that as of yet with our staff, it\u2019s just that not knowing. It\u2019s not looking like football is going to restart in May so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. We\u2019re meant to be back in for training next Tuesday but I\u2019d be amazed if that were the case.</p> <p>I\u2019m 32 next month and out of contract in June. I\u2019d like to stay on but will any offer be there now because of money? It\u2019s going to be an interesting summer and it might be hard for players to get clubs.</p> <p><strong>Premier League chairman:</strong><strong> Mike Garlick </strong><em>Burnley</em></p> <p>Our players do a great job for us as a club and for the community. They probably do their own things on top that I\u2019m not aware of. They are intelligent people. We will not be unilaterally trying to impose things on any players. If they decided to help us in any way we\u2019d be grateful but we wouldn\u2019t think any less of them if they didn\u2019t. It\u2019s as simple as that. But talks are ongoing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The absolute worst-case, doomsday scenario is that we don\u2019t finish the season and there is no new season in sight</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We\u2019ve taken the decision, certainly short-to-medium term, that we will fund non-playing staff. We will not be furloughing them. If we get to July and the season hasn\u2019t restarted, and the next season isn\u2019t looking like it is going to start, that\u2019s a different position and we might have to revisit it. But at the moment we are going to be funding that ourselves. The absolute worst-case, doomsday scenario is that we don\u2019t finish the season and there is no new season in sight.</p> <p>I personally don\u2019t think it will come to that. I think we will start when it\u2019s safe to do so. We need to start but if we didn\u2019t then we\u2019ve got some resources at the club.

There are difficulties facing the board of the EFL because depending on where you sit, you could have an opposite view \u2013 you might be at the top of the league or the bottom of the league, cash-rich or cash-poor \u2013 so trying to work out those possible scenarios, in terms of what\u2019s best for everybody, is particularly difficult.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4855fc786690237ba4e62d904f24ee55bb48d9c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4855fc786690237ba4e62d904f24ee55bb48d9c1/0_323_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exeter City chairman, Julian Tagg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Exeter City chairman, Julian Tagg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Our players take home, on average, around \u00a3800 a week and some of our senior playing staff have already deferred wages voluntarily but they are all in different situations. Nobody is going to come out of this happy but the key underneath all of this is the Premier League, who are beginning to unfold their thinking and how they intend to deal with this from a financial point of view and how that finance drips down into the leagues, and the PFA, who have given indications, but nothing definitive. They have to consult their members, which is exactly right, and those things take time, but people are becoming impatient because they are very worried.</p> <p>It is very easy to be critical but when you consider the magnitude of the issues and the problems that the EFL are facing, they are doing a good job in trying to guide us through this unbelievably difficult period. Will it have an impact? Absolutely. I have no crystal ball but I would have thought it would impact the number of players in a squad and also the wages they earn.</p> <p><strong>The agent: Dan Chapman</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/07/greg-clarke-warns-covid-19-could-force-clubs-across-country-to-collapse\">Clarke says players and owners must 'share the pain' of football's financial plight</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many clubs have quite genuine and, in some cases, serious cash\u2011flow problems caused by the unforeseeable suspension of football. Like many businesses across the country they have an urgent need to reduce their overheads and the largest is often the wage bill. Clubs will be looking at wages for both playing and non\u2011playing staff, trying to understand where they can make savings, then balancing that against the contractual and legal issues, as well as the government support available. Players, on the other hand, are finding themselves being asked to take a pay cut. Whilst in many cases the players are more than happy to do their bit, they are keen to understand whether the measures proposed are proportionate, absolutely necessary and whether they are temporary or permanent. I believe that in most cases there is a common desire to be realistic and to find solutions that are fair. There will be cases where players feel that their club is behaving opportunistically and perhaps requesting financial sacrifices that go beyond what might be reasonable. Conversely, there will be cases where clubs are in such financial hardship they genuinely risk insolvency if they cannot make urgent reductions in April\u2019s payroll, yet not all employees will be keen to facilitate that.</p> <p>These differing perspectives would likely be found in most workplaces across the country. The attention that has been brought to bear upon clubs and players, however, is unique. There is no doubt that high-profile pressure has, on the one hand, shone a spotlight on the sport but on the other it has made some parties feel they are being forced to act rather than choosing to. I suspect we will continue to see many clubs and players reaching their own resolutions at club level and I dare say we will also see disagreements prevail at certain clubs. I am not so sure that a sport-wide solution is going to be achievable. Nor, perhaps, is it desirable.</p> <p><em>Dan Chapman is a solicitor and partner at the law firm Leathes Prior</em></p>",
  "<p>The 2022 World Cup is highly unlikely to be moved from Qatar despite the latest criminal indictment by the US Department of Justice accusing three senior Fifa officials of receiving bribes for voting in favour of the Gulf state hosting the tournament.</p> <p>The indictment, the latest in the long-running US prosecution of football officials for alleged corruption, accuses Nicol\u00e1s Leoz, the Paraguayan then president of Conmebol, South American football\u2019s governing body, and the former Brazil federation president Ricardo Teixeira of being paid bribes to vote for Qatar at the decisive Fifa executive committee (exco) meeting in December 2010. A third then very senior member of the exco under the former president Sepp Blatter, who is not named but is identifiable as Julio Grondona, the then president of Argentina\u2019s FA, is also accused of being paid to vote for Qatar, but Grondona, who died in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jun/16/swiss-banker-admits-bribes-fifa-julio-grondona\" title=\"\">was never criminally charged</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/06/fox-executives-fifa-bribery-scheme-football\">Former Fox executives indicted in Fifa bribery scheme</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The indictment is also explosive for accusing the Russian authorities, for the first time, of paying bribes for votes in favour of their successful bid to host the 2018 World Cup, which was decided at the same fateful Fifa exco meeting. The document alleges in some detail that Jack Warner, then the long-serving president of the confederation for North and Central American and Caribbean football (Concacaf), \u201cwas promised and received bribe payments totalling $5m\u201d to cast his vote for Russia.</p> <p>Another then member of the Fifa exco, the former president of the Guatemala FA Rafael Salguero, is accused of being promised a $1m bribe to vote for Russia. Salguero pleaded guilty to multiple corruption charges in the US in 2016, and admitted then that he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/04/rafael-salguero-bribe-claims-2018-world-cup\" title=\"\">offered a bribe</a> to vote for a certain 2018 World Cup host, but the name of the country was redacted from his plea document and he said he never received the money. Warner, facing multiple corruption charges, has denied any wrongdoing and for years has been contesting extradition from his home island of Trinidad.</p> <p>Alexei Sorokin, the chief executive of Russia\u2019s 2018 World Cup, denied the allegations, as did Qatar\u2019s supreme committee overseeing the major stadium construction and preparations to host the tournament due to start in November 2022. Led by the ruling Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, Qatar remains determined to host the World Cup.</p> <p>In a statement, the supreme committee said it would fight any accusation that it did not win the votes legitimately. \u201cDespite years of false claims, evidence has never been produced to demonstrate that Qatar won the rights to host the Fifa World Cup 2022 unethically or by means that contravened Fifa\u2019s strict bidding rules,\u201d the statement said.</p> <p>\u201cThe supreme committee maintains that it strictly adhered to all rules and regulations for the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cup bidding process and any claim to the contrary is baseless and will be fiercely contested.\u201d</p> <p>Under Gianni Infantino, voted president after Blatter was banned from football in December 2015 for breaches of Fifa\u2019s ethics code, football\u2019s world governing body has condemned all proven previous corruption and is itself pursuing a compensation claim against its accused former officials.</p> <p>Fifa, pointing out that it had been accorded \u201cvictim status\u201d in the US criminal proceedings, said in a statement that it \u201csupports all investigations into alleged acts of criminal wrongdoing regarding either domestic or international football competitions, and will continue to provide full cooperation to law enforcement officials investigating such matters.</p> <p>\u201cShould any acts of criminal wrongdoing by football officials be established, the individuals in question should be subject to penal sanctions.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Senior officials say that Fifa will genuinely take the allegations against the organisation\u2019s old guard very seriously and consider all the implications \u2013 but it can be inferred now that moving the tournament from Qatar is highly improbable.

Teixeira, the former son-in-law of the Fifa president before Blatter, Jo\u00e3o Havelange, has not been extradited to face any of the multiple corruption charges levelled against him by the Department of Justice, so any trial must be considered unlikely.</p> <p>The indictment is also light on detail in relation to the alleged bribes for Qatar, an allegation first made in a Brooklyn court in late 2017 during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/23/fifa-trial-questions-2022-qatar-world-cup\" title=\"\">corruption trial</a> of three other former South American football officials. Alejandro Burzaco, a TV executive who had pleaded guilty to paying bribes, testified that Grondona had once told him that he was owed $1m by Teixeira because he had voted for Qatar. Grondona also said, according to Burzaco, that it was \u201cnot a private thing\u201d that he, Teixeira and Leoz, who was also accused of prodigious corruption by the US authorities, were voting for Qatar.</p> <p>Two and a half years on, the indictment alleges nothing more than: \u201cThe defendant Ricardo Teixeira, Nicol\u00e1s Leoz and [Grondona, described as Co-Conspirator #1], were offered and received bribe payments in exchange for their votes in favour of Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/20/swiss-prosecutors-charge-psg-president-nasser-al-khelaifi-in-fifa-bribery-case\">Swiss prosecutors charge PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi in Fifa bribery case</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even if this case were to reach trial, following an unpredictable delay in the court system owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, and even if Teixeira were found guilty \u2013 he has always denied corruption allegations \u2013 it would have to be shown that any bribes came from the official Qatar bid and were decisive in sending the tournament to Qatar.

The president\u2019s complaint on Tuesday was resonant of attacks on other international bodies including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/02/nato-donald-trump-second-term\">Nato</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/30/trump-world-trade-organization-tariffs-stock-market\">World Trade Organization</a>.</p> <p>Trump also attacked the office of the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/06/politics/fact-check-trump-coronavirus-briefing-april-6/index.html\">at his White House briefing on Monday</a>.</p> <p>On Twitter on Tuesday, he asked: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the IG, who spent [eight] years with the Obama administration (Did she Report on the failed H1N1 Swine Flu debacle where 17,000 people died?), want to talk to the Admirals, Generals, VP &amp; others in charge, before doing her report. Another Fake Dossier!\u201d</p> <p>The official in question, Christi Grimm, is principal deputy inspector general and has worked for the health department <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/christi-grimm/index.html\">since 1999</a>, serving under Bill Clinton, George W Bush, Barack Obama and now Trump.</p> <p>Trump has regularly attacked Obama for his handling of public health matters including the outbreak of H1N1, or swine flu, in 2009. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html\">says </a><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html\">about 12,500 Americans died</a> in that episode.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s reference to a \u201cfake dossier\u201d echoed his complaints about political opposition research work carried out by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/01/trump-russia-dossier-author-gave-evidence-to-uk-intrusion-inquiry\">a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele</a>, and subsequently at the heart of the investigation of Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow.</p> <p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/04/donald-trump-decapitating-intelligence-leadership-coronavirus-crisis-senior-democrat\">fired the inspector general for the intelligence community</a>, Michael Atkinson, on Friday night, over his role in sending to Congress a whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s approaches to Ukraine which led to the president\u2019s impeachment.</p> <p>The Navarro memos, first reported by the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/politics/navarro-warning-trump-coronavirus.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">New York Times</a> and <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/exclusive-navarro-deaths-coronavirus-memos-january-da3f08fb-dce1-4f69-89b5-ea048f8382a9.html\">Axios</a>, were written by Navarro on 29 January and 23 February. The first memo, composed on the day Trump set up a White House coronavirus task force, gave a worst-case scenario of the virus killing more than half a million Americans.</p> <p>According to the Times, it said: \u201cThe lack of immune protection or an existing cure or vaccine would leave Americans defenseless in the case of a full-blown coronavirus outbreak on US soil. This lack of protection elevates the risk of the coronavirus evolving into a full-blown pandemic, imperiling the lives of millions of Americans.\u201d</p> <p>The second memo went even further, predicting that a Covid-19 pandemic, left unchecked, could kill 1.2 million Americans and infect as many as 100 million.</p> <p>This was not the first time Trump and his White House team were warned that the virus had the potential to devastate the US and needed to be dealt with quickly and firmly.</p> <p>Senior scientists, epidemiologists and health emergency experts in the US and around the world delivered that clear message early on in the crisis, only for Trump to continue belittling the scale of the threat which he compared falsely to the dangers of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/24/trump-again-downplays-coronavirus-by-comparing-it-seasonal-flu-its-not-fair-comparison/\">seasonal flu</a>.</p> <p>But the emergence of the memos from such a senior aide within the White House will make it much more difficult for Trump to claim \u2013 as he has done on <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/03/30/trump_on_coronavirus_nobody_could_have_predicted_something_like_this.html\">multiple occasions</a> \u2013 that nobody was able to predict the severity of the disease.</p> <p>As the pandemic has swept across the country, the president has come under mounting criticism for having done too little, too late in response, leading to mass shortages of diagnostic testing, protective gear for frontline health workers and ventilators for the very sick.</p>",
  "<p>Tiny droplets of saliva that are sprayed into the air when people speak may be sufficient to spread coronavirus, according to US government scientists who say the finding could help control the outbreak.</p> <p>Researchers at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Maryland found that talking released thousands of fine droplets into the air that could pose a risk to others if the speaker were infected with the virus.</p> <p>The scientists used laser imaging and high-speed videography to show how thousands of droplets that are too small to see with the naked eye are emitted in normal speech, even in short phrases such as \u201cstay healthy\u201d.</p> <p>The work is preliminary and has not been peer-reviewed or published, but in <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051177v1\">a report</a> the scientists claim the findings may have \u201cvital implications\u201d for containing the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cIf speaking and oral fluid viral load proves to be a major mechanism of Sars-CoV-2 [the official name of the virus] transmission, wearing any kind of cloth mouth cover in public by every person, as well as strict adherence to social distancing and handwashing, could significantly decrease the transmission rate and thereby contain the pandemic until a vaccine becomes available,\u201d the researchers write.</p> <p>The results will fuel the ongoing debate over whether or not healthy people should wear face masks in public. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html\">Recent advice</a> from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called for members of the public to wear cloth face covers when they visit places where it is hard to maintain physical distancing, such as pharmacies and grocery stores.</p> <p>But the US advice contrasts with that from the World Health Organization, which reviewed its stance on face masks last week. In updated guidance published on Monday it restated that there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/no-need-for-healthy-to-wear-face-masks-says-who-after-review\">no evidence</a> wearing a mask in public prevented people from picking up respiratory infections such as Covid-19.</p> <p>The positions are not as conflicting as they seem, though. The WHO concedes that people who are infected with the virus but do not show symptoms can still spread the virus, and that a mask may reduce the number of droplets they spray into the air. Their primary argument is that wearing a mask in public is unlikely to protect the wearer from viruses, which can penetrate cloth masks, and the virus can still invade the body through the eyes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/no-need-for-healthy-to-wear-face-masks-says-who-after-review\">No need for healthy to wear face masks, says WHO after review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The US team, led by Adriaan Bax at the NIH\u2019s Laboratory of Chemical Physics, repurposed laser instrumentation to detect otherwise invisible mists of droplets that are released when people speak. In a single 17-millisecond frame they counted as many as 360 saliva droplets when the phrase \u201cstay healthy\u201d was spoken.</p> <p>The scientists have not analysed the droplets for their ability to carry coronavirus particles but said they were sufficiently large to carry a variety of respiratory pathogens including the measles and influenza viruses.</p> <p>\u201cA damp homemade cloth face mask dramatically reduced droplet excretion, with none of the spoken words causing a droplet rise above the background,\u201d the scientists said.</p>",
  "<p>The UK has experienced its highest daily number of recorded coronavirus deaths \u2013 854 \u2013 a figure beginning to approach the toll on the deadliest days so far in Italy and Spain.</p> <p>NHS England reported on Tuesday that a further 758 people who had tested positive for the virus had died in its hospitals, while the total was announced as 74 for Scotland, 19 in Wales and three in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The data is likely to draw concerns over the development of the outbreak in the UK in comparison with Europe\u2019s hardest-hit countries in the pandemic.</p> <p>Italy, which has recorded the most coronavirus-related deaths globally, recorded 971 deaths in its highest count on 28 March, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</p> <p>In Spain, which has the second highest rate across the world, 950 deaths were recorded on its deadliest day on 3 April.</p> <p>Four English trusts have recorded in excess of 150 deaths each: University Hospitals Birmingham (263); London North West University healthcare (183); King\u2019s College hospital (163) and the Royal Free London (151).</p> <p>The youngest victim reported by NHS England was 23 \u2013 one of 29 patients to die with no known underlying health conditions.

This compares to 103 fatalities, or 1% of all deaths, the previous week.There were five registered deaths in the week to 13 March. This brings the total number of coronavirus deaths registered by 27 March to 647.</p> <p>However, delays in the registration of deaths, collected by the ONS, mean it may be weeks before there is a clear tally of how many people have died in the community. These deaths will also include those suspected to have had Covid-19 in hospital at the time of death but were not tested and included in NHS England figures.</p> <p>Detailed demographic breakdowns for the 647 deaths show that, in keeping with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/men-are-much-more-likely-to-die-from-coronavirus-but-why\">initial studies</a> carried out internationally, men are more likely than women to die with the virus.

When Johnson announced the lockdown 15 days ago, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review. We will look again <a>in three weeks</a>, and relax them if the evidence shows we are able to. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The three-week deadline comes up on Monday.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In terms of the review, we are not at that stage yet. We will take any decision when the time is right, based on the facts and the scientific and medical advice.</p> \n   <p>Our number one and overriding focus right now is on conveying the key message, which is that everyone needs to keep adhering to this guidance.</p> \n   <p>There is a long Easter bank holiday weekend coming up, warm weather and we understand people are making big sacrifices to follow this guidance.

Large numbers of patients could be denied care, with those facing a poor prognosis losing the potentially life-saving equipment even if their condition is improving.</p> \n  <p>A strong-worded statement issued by Dr Jackie Applebee, chair of Doctor in Unite, challenged such guidance.</p> \n  <p>It said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We believe that all people are of equal value. </p> \n   <p>Intensive care will not work for some patients. Ventilator support will sometimes not succeed. Doctors must judge who is most likely to improve with these measures, and who is not.</p> \n   <p>These decisions have previously always been made on a case-by-case basis, where the risks and benefits to an individual patient are carefully considered. The arbitrary condemnation of one group or another is inexcusable. Being old, living in a care home, or having a pre-existing disability should not lead to an automatic exclusion from possible treatment. Blanket categorisation of large groups of people in such a way is prejudice. There is no place for it in the NHS.</p> \n   <p>There may come a time where our healthcare system is overwhelmed.

He was moved as a precaution so he could be close to a ventilator, but there has been no indication so far that he has been put on a ventilator \u2013 a process that would require hime being sedated. </p> \n  <p>The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, is currently standing in for Johnson and has vowed to follow set by the prime minister. </p> \n  <p>Johnson was understood to be conscious when he was moved to intensive care at about 7pm.</p> \n  <p>Derek Hill, professor of medical imaging at University College London , said the PM could be given a breathing aid known as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) which bridges the gap between an oxygen mask and full ventilation.</p> \n  <p>CPAP uses pressure to send a blend of air and oxygen into the mouth at a steady rate, thereby boosting the amount of oxygen that enters the lungs.</p> \n  <p>But Prof Hill said many Covid-19 patients eventually \u201cprogress to invasive ventilation\u201d. This is for people whose illness is so severe they are struggling or unable to breathe for themselves.</p> \n  <p>A mechanical ventilator either does all the breathing for the patient, or assists the patient\u2019s own breathing. The patient is heavily sedated while a device called an endotracheal tube is guided through the mouth into the windpipe.</p> \n  <p>The death rate of those admitted to intensive care in the UK with Covid-19 has topped 50%, according to the latest figures.</p> \n  <p>The figure comes from data compiled by the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre based on a sample of 2,249 coronavirus patients.</p> \n  <p>The data showed of the 690 patients in the sample whose care outcomes were known, 346 - 50.1% - had died, while 344 had been discharged.</p> \n  <p>The remaining patients, 1,559, were reported still to be in critical care.<br>The data shows that of 2,248 patients, 73% were men and 27% were women.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T07:11:42.796Z\">at 8.11am BST</time></p> \n</div>",

  "<p>John Harris asks who will speak for all of Britain in the current crisis, while questioning whether any politician can convincingly adopt the mantle of a national leader (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/boris-johnson-failed-unifying-leader-keir-starmer-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">Johnson seems unable to unify us. Who will speak for the country?</a>, 5 April). However, what is needed urgently is credible collective leadership. It is sadly ironic, in retrospect, that the Tories were gifted the December election they so desperately craved. Without a parliamentary majority, they would certainly have had to set up a government of national unity by now.</p> <p>The current administration has been lacking in clear and consistent communication. It is understandable that Labour is wary of association with policies that may prove to have been criminally negligent and wishes to be able to be critical, as well as supportive, where appropriate. However, the national interest now demands participation by all parties in a government representing the whole country.</p> <p>Keir Starmer should take up Johnson\u2019s call for the leaders of all parties to work together by calling explicitly for a national government. This will be empowered not only to take the tough decisions necessary to bring the situation under control and devise an exit strategy but also, as after the war, to prepare for the reconstruction of a more equitable society, with fully resourced public services.<br><strong>Dr Anthony Isaacs</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Unless he embraces proportional representation for the Commons and wider electoral reform, Keir Starmer will probably suffer the same fate as other Labour leaders. One wonders just how many defeats Labour will undergo before it realises that PR is in its own interest, as well as being fairer for the country. As things stand, we have a bog-standard government unwanted by most voters and neck-deep in constitutional skullduggery over Brexit. The pandemic will eventually pass, but this situation will remain as the long-term national emergency.<br><strong>Dr James C Robertson</strong><br><em>Pembury, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022 The government has been without an effective opposition for months, just as the country faces its most critical threat. The election of Keir Starmer as Labour leader should bring that to an end. Two things should happen straight away. First, he should take his place at Cobra, the committee effectively dealing with this national emergency. Second, he should demand the return of parliament in whatever form to allow MPs to question ministers and their advisers. It is not sufficient for journalists to interrogate ministers in the forum of a daily press conference. It is the job of those elected to represent us to hold the government publicly to account.<br><strong>Kate Gordon</strong><br><em>Swaffham, Norfolk</em></p> <p>\u2022 Boris Johnson\u2019s stay in hospital raises an interesting question about vulnerability to the virus. Undoubtedly he had been under severe stress for some weeks and this may have raised his stress hormone, cortisol, and possibly compromised his immune system, which may contribute to complications. This link between stress and vulnerability to viruses should also be considered in our healthcare professionals, who are often exhausted and may well be in compromised immune states. Therefore protecting them is not just a matter of providing masks etc, but also about keeping an eye on their cortisol levels and immune competence, and providing sufficient opportunities for rest and recuperation.<br><strong>Prof Paul Gilbert</strong><br><em>Centre for Compassion Research and Training, University of Derby</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"http://gu.com/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

  "<p>It was as a direct result of a newspaper article by the former Labour MP Joe Ashton, who has died aged 86, that a compulsory register of MPs\u2019 financial interests outside Westminster was first established by the House of Commons in 1974. Ashton had called for the creation of such a register in a column he wrote for the party newspaper, Labour Weekly, under the heading MPs for Hire, and two weeks after its publication the newly elected Labour government took the first steps to seek to control political corruption.</p> <p>The February 1974 general election had been held in the middle of a scandal involving the builder John Poulson, a man with many political contacts who had been imprisoned for using bribery to win lucrative public sector contracts. Labour had campaigned on a manifesto promising a compulsory register that might prevent a repeat, and Ashton had been prompted to write his article in April 1974 by a report in the Guardian suggesting that the new prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1995/may/25/obituaries\">Harold Wilson</a>, was preparing to resile from that commitment in favour of a regime of voluntary declarations of interest.</p> <p>Ashton was subsequently found (by a formal inquiry of the Commons\u2019 Committee of Privileges) to have committed a serious contempt of parliament for suggesting, in his article, that MPs were available for hire. He was obliged to apologise for being what he himself called \u201ca brave, mad whistleblower\u201d, yet it was because of the political uproar his column caused that Wilson was obliged to act so swiftly after his general election win.</p> <p>Ashton was a Yorkshireman who had a background of poverty and an instinctive populist sense of what mattered to his working-class constituents and to the Labour electorate. He was blessed with articulacy, had the ability to turn a colourful phrase and possessed a common touch \u2013 all attributes that took him into parliament and made him a punchy, popular newspaper columnist. He was an immensely active constituency MP for 33 years, but failed to progress at Westminster because of a lack of judgment that sometimes antagonised his parliamentary colleagues. He was also part of the unlucky generation of Labour MPs whose prime years at Westminster coincided with 18 years of uninterrupted Conservative government.</p> <p>Born in the slums of Attercliffe in Sheffield to teenage parents, Arthur (known as Ike) Ashton and Nellie (nee Maloney), Joe was named after an uncle who had been killed at the age of four by a runaway steamroller. His father was intermittently unemployed, although he did stand-in shifts at the local Nunnery pit and later found work in the city\u2019s steel industry. His mother was a \u201cbuffer girl\u201d, polishing nickel-plated silver cutlery. Joe passed the 11-plus to attend High Storrs grammar school, but never wore the uniform his family could not afford, something his parents were successfully advised to blame on the lack of clothing coupons under wartime rationing. At 16 he became an engineering apprentice at Rotherham Technical College and joined the Labour party.</p> <p>In 1954 he did two years\u2019 national service in the RAF, taking part in the ill-fated Suez invasion before returning to a white-collar job as a design engineer, a post he held until narrowly winning a difficult byelection in Bassetlaw in 1968. The constituency, situated in the Nottinghamshire coalfield, was at the time facing pit closures imposed by an unpopular Labour government, and Ashton\u2019s majority was reduced to 1.72%. A traditionally safe Labour \u201cred wall\u201d seat until lost to the Conservatives in December 2019, it was held by Ashton with a 36.4% majority at his last election in 1997.</p> <p>He learned politics as a shop steward and as a member of Sheffield city council from 1962 until 1969. When first elected, he was the youngest member of the council, succeeding Roy Hattersley in that distinction. Hattersley would later write, in an affectionate and forthright foreword to Ashton\u2019s first book of memoirs, Red Rose Blues (2000), that what he most admired about the author was his \u201cabsolute lack of discretion\u201d and his inability ever to moderate his support or antagonism for any cause.</p> <p>Such full-hearted enthusiasm was immediately evident at Westminster, where Ashton busily embarked on various backbench campaigns and established a high public profile as a national newspaper columnist, including briefly for the Guardian. He was parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to the sports minister Denis Howell (1969-70) and after Labour\u2019s return to government did the same job for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/14/tony-benn-obituary\">Tony Benn</a> as secretary of state for industry and then energy. He was a strong leftwing supporter of Benn, encouraging him to fight Wilson as prime minister \u2013 \u201cget into the ring like Cassius Clay and knock him out,\u201d he advised Benn in 1975 \u2013 and although he was sacked as PPS for rebelling against the government in early 1976 he continued to do the job informally. He ran Benn\u2019s campaign for the Labour leadership when Wilson unexpectedly resigned in the spring of 1976, and was surprised to be appointed as an assistant whip by the new prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/28/guardianobituaries.politics\">James Callaghan</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ab705d4697e4d4f9812da0d2c081582104bf2f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ab705d4697e4d4f9812da0d2c081582104bf2f9/31_61_4594_2757/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Ashton with the cast of his play A Majority of One, 1981.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Ashton with the cast of his play A Majority of One, 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Lomas/ANL/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He lasted only a year in the whips\u2019 office, but it was sufficient to provide material for a stage play based on the knife-edge existence of the Callaghan government. The play, A Majority of One, was well received after performances in Oldham and Nottingham in 1981; Ashton was fond of claiming that it was the inspiration for James Graham\u2019s This House at the National Theatre 30 years later. During this period he published a political novel, Grass Roots (1977), which also garnered good reviews.</p> <p>He fell out with Benn over the latter\u2019s campaigns to introduce internal constitutional reforms within the Labour party, and thereafter became increasingly antagonistic both towards Benn and the party\u2019s leftwing. He told a fellow Labour whip that he had explained to Benn: \u201cThe trouble with you, Tony, is you think the working class are noble savages when in fact there are just as many shits among the working class as anywhere else.\u201d He criticised plans for mandatory reselection of MPs at successive party conferences and was slow-handclapped in 1980 when he warned that reselection could hasten defections to a breakaway party, as indeed happened when the SDP was launched the following year.</p> <p>Ashton spent two years on the opposition frontbench as an energy spokesman from 1979. Thereafter he returned to the backbenches and sat on various select committees: trade and industry (1987-92), home affairs (1989-92), national heritage (1992-97) and on the select committee charged with modernising the House of Commons (1997-98). He chaired the all-party football committee from 1992 until he retired at the 2001 election, and was a passionate supporter of Sheffield Wednesday football club, of which he was a director from 1990 to 1999.</p> <p>In 1998 Ashton was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/mar/16/michaelwhite\">on the premises of a Thai massage parlour</a> in Northampton during a police raid for suspected immigration offences. The following year it was disclosed that he had been questioned by police, although he had committed no offence. He wrote later in his memoirs that he had acted on a \u201ccrazy impulse\u201d. The chapter was entitled All Political Careers End in Tears. In retirement he founded the Association for Former Members of Parliament in 2001. He also published a second book of Sheffield memoirs, Joe Blow \u2013 his childhood nickname \u2013 in 2014, and donated the proceeds to the Salvation Army. He was appointed OBE in 2007.</p> <p>He married Margaret (Maggie) Lee, a former secretary at the Sheffield Brightside and Carbrook Co-operative Society coal depot, in 1957. She died in 2014 and he is survived by their daughter, Lucy.</p> <p>\u2022 Joseph William Ashton, politician, born 9 October 1933; died 30 March 2020</p>",

While NSO Group licenses its signature spying technology, Pegasus, to government law enforcement and intelligence agencies and assists with \u201ctraining, setup, and installation\u201d, it said it did not operate the technology.</p> <p>\u201cGovernment customers do that, making all decisions about how to use the technology,\u201d NSO said in its legal filing. \u201cIf anyone installed Pegasus on any alleged \u201ctarget devices\u201d it was not [the] defendants [NSO Group]. It would have been an agency of a sovereign government.\u201d</p> <p>NSO Group claimed that to challenge such conduct, WhatsApp would have to declare the \u201csovereign acts\u201d of those governments to be illegal.</p> <p>\u201cFor that reason,\u201d the company said in the filing, \u201cpermitting this litigation to proceed would infringe critical national security and foreign policy concerns of sovereign governments\u201d.</p> <p>The company also highlighted the role it claimed the Israeli government played in its review of NSO Group\u2019s business. The Israeli ministry of defence, NSO Group said, could have access to information about NSO Group\u2019s customers and \u201ctheir intended use of Pegasus technology\u201d.</p> <p>In a statement, WhatsApp said NSO Group was attempting to \u201cavoid responsibility\u201d and questioned the accuracy of some of the company\u2019s claims, including an allegation in the legal filing that Facebook had wanted to procure some of NSO Group\u2019s technology in 2017.</p> <p>In a sworn statement filed to the court, Shalev Hulio, an NSO Group co-founder, said that NSO had been approached by two Facebook representatives in October 2017 and asked about the right to \u201ccertain capabilities of Pegasus\u201d, which the representatives had suggested could be used to help monitor users on Apple devices.</p> <p>NSO Group declined to comment to the Guardian\u2019s questions about the alleged meeting between Facebook and NSO, and said it would not reveal the identity of the individuals. WhatsApp said the description of the discussions were an \u201cinaccurate representation\u201d. It declined to provide further comment.</p>",

  "<h2>KEEPING 220 YARDS APART</h2> <p>There was celebration today after Liverpool decided to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/06/liverpool-reverse-decision-to-furlough-staff-after-fierce-criticism-coronavirus\">furlough the idea of furloughing their employees</a>, giving in to an outcry from fans, former players and over-opinionated media types with too many column inches to fill now there\u2019s no sport on. There has been no word yet on whether the furlough will be furloughed furlong or if it will just be a short-term outage.</p> <p>Like the virus that inspired it, it does not seem like long ago that nobody had even heard of the furlough, but having gained a foothold in the population it has swept the nation with haste. The Premier League has not been immune, with hundreds of normally-productive employees at Newcastle, Tottenham, Bournemouth and Norwich now in isolation away from their clubs. Liverpool\u2019s fans were the first to successfully fight off the infection, discovering that it is possible to combat even aggressive cases of furlough <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/05/liverpool-challenged-by-spirit-of-shankly-fan-group-over-staff-furloughs\">using the commonly-available medicine of public outrage</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe we came to the wrong conclusion last week, and are truly sorry for that,\u201d said Liverpool\u2019s chief executive, Peter Moore, in an open letter to fans. The Reds will thus continue to pay their employees using the cash bloating their own bank accounts, while other owners of top-flight clubs have concluded that they would do anything (furlough), but they won\u2019t do that.</p> <p>Tottenham Hotspur Supporters\u2019 Trust is continuing to apply a similar remedy to their own club\u2019s case of furlough, nearly a week after it exhibited its first symptoms despite pre-tax profits in the year to 30 June 2018 at a wild \u00a3138.9m. \u201cWe have been saying consistently \u2013 pause and rethink,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/THSTOfficial/status/1247238005997346821\">they said on Twitter</a>. \u201cWe are now saying it clearly and in public \u2013 do not further damage the club\u2019s reputation, listen to your fans.\u201d Former Spurs striker Gary Lineker also took to social media in an attempted to resuscitate the club\u2019s moral compass, but so far it remains unresponsive. It remains to be seen whether they and other wealthy clubs infected with furlough suffer long-term side-effects, should potential customers decide to impose some financial self-isolation upon them by steering well clear as a result.</p> <h2>LIVE (SORT OF) ON BIG WEBSITE!</h2> <p>Join Scott Murray for retro minute-by-minute coverage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Crystal Palace v Liverpool</a> in the 1990 FA Cup semi-final from midday on Wednesday, while Rob Smyth will also be on retro duty later that afternoon for the other semi-final between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Oldham and Manchester United</a>.

The number of Cross-Channel Eurostar journeys was now just 1% of those taken daily in 2019.</p> <p>Heaton-Harris said it showed that the public was heeding calls to stay home, and allowing space on rail and road for key workers and the flow of essential freight.</p> <p>He said the government was working with unions to identify where there were shortages of personal protective equipment for frontline workers, and added: \u201cWe\u2019re particularly saddened about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/colleagues-bus-drivers-died-coronavirus-better-protection\">deaths of bus drivers</a> \u2013 these tragic losses emphasise how much we owe to everyone participating in keeping essential services functioning.\u201d</p> <p>The Unite union said Transport for London had agreed that all buses in the capital would from Wednesday have additional safety measures to protect drivers, including fully sealed screens and nearby seats taken out of service.</p> <p>While most rail services have been effectively <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/covid-19-government-suspends-rail-franchise-agreements\">temporarily nationalised</a>, with the government shouldering the drop in revenues, and bus firms have been promised a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/02/bus-firms-get-400m-bailout-to-maintain-services\">\u00a3400m package of assistance</a> to cover lost fares, airlines have stepped up their calls for help.</p> <p>The International Air Transport Association (Iata) warned that up to 25m jobs worldwide depending on air travel were at risk, including 5.6m in Europe, as they urged governments to offer more loans and tax relief. Jobs relying on air links were predominantly in countries dependent on tourism, but supply chains for high-value manufacturing were also affected, Iata said.</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic is the most prominent UK carrier that has applied for direct government aid, opening its books to the Treasury as it hopes for up to \u00a3500m in loans and credit guarantees.</p> <p>Heaton-Harris would not confirm how many airlines were in contact with the government for state aid.

  "<h2>Stephen Colbert</h2> <p>It\u2019s week four of the pandemic shutdown in the US, said Stephen Colbert on Monday night\u2019s \u201cA Late Show\u201d from his home in New Jersey, and \u201cgovernment officials and health experts are warning that this is going to be the toughest week yet of the coronavirus. A lot of Americans are going to get this, and some of them are going to die. And I hope you know that you and your families are in our thoughts, and if you want them, you\u2019re in my prayers,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cBut I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s not why you tuned in tonight \u2013 you\u2019re here for the jokes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAW3qHG4_ZY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LAW3qHG4_ZY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cSo, here we go,\u201d he said, diving into a monologue on Trump\u2019s delusional optimism, though Colbert was slightly less rosy on how America is doing; after months of advising Americans not to wear masks, the CDC announced this weekend that all Americans should wear cloth or fabric face coverings when they go out in public. \u201cWe were supposed to be covering our faces this whole time? Oh my God, Billy Porter tried to warn us!\u201d Colbert said, referencing Porter\u2019s infamous retractable face shield at the 2020 Grammys.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the sudden reversal, this new guidance is a little confusing, but on Friday, the president used his daily briefing to make it even more confusing,\u201d Colbert continued. At a press briefing, Trump called the CDC recommendation \u201cvoluntary\u201d and said that he wouldn\u2019t follow it because he didn\u2019t want to wear a mask. \u201cWell of course Trump is the guy who says he doesn\u2019t want to wear protection,\u201d said Colbert, imitating Trump: \u201cMasks are just the condom of the face \u2013 it kills all the feeling. I mean, there\u2019s a reason I don\u2019t wear a raincoat in the shower or a condom during sex.\u201d</p> <h2>Seth Meyers</h2> <p>On Late Night, Seth Meyers turned his Closer Look segment on Trump\u2019s erroneous and irresponsible claims over the past month that the coronavirus would just disappear with warmer weather in April. Asked about this baseless talking point this weekend, in April, Trump dialed down, telling reporters: \u201cI didn\u2019t say a date, I said it\u2019s going away, and it is going away.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TX4fW1dD4E\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2TX4fW1dD4E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cAh, very clever,\u201d Meyers responded. \u201cAfter all, April has 24 days left, and it\u2019s down to, what, I don\u2019t know, 337,000 cases?\u201d Meyers said. (That number has, of course, gone up.) \u201cAnd you did \u2013 you literally said \u2018it goes away in April.\u2019 That\u2019s as close to specific as Trump ever gets. Usually, when you ask him a question, he waves it away like a dad promising his kids a trip to Disneyland while watching football.\u201d</p> <p>Meyers also criticized Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, for his mishandling of the federal stockpile of ventilators. Meyers described Kushner as \u201ceverybody\u2019s favorite botoxed nine-year-old\u201d, and \u201cthe real-life Jack Skellington, the fellow who\u2019s always lurking in the background of every White House photo like a stalker who suddenly appears in the mirror when you close your medicine cabinet. The only guy in the world who creeps out Stephen Miller.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/03/seth-meyers-late-night-recap-jared-kushner-coronavirus\">Seth Meyers to Jared Kushner: 'You\u2019re not qualified to do anything'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meyers focused on Kushner\u2019s comments last week at a press briefing: \u201cThe notion of the federal stockpile was, it\u2019s supposed to be our stockpile. It\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles that they then use.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Meyers deadpanned of Kushner\u2019s argument. \u201cIt\u2019s like my doorman told me: \u2018The front door belongs to the building. If you wanna go to work so bad, climb down the fire escape.\u2019 Seriously, it\u2019s <em>your</em> stockpile? Are you writing your name on them like you\u2019re leaving your lunch in the office fridge?</p> <p>\u201cThis sniveling weasel thinks everything belongs to him because he was born into a rich family, just like his father-in-law,\u201d Meyer continued. \u201cI\u2019m shocked we haven\u2019t seen something called a Kushni-lator pop up on Craigslist.\u201d</p> <p>It all leads to one conclusion, according to Meyers: \u201cOne lesson we\u2019re all learning from this is that, generally speaking, it\u2019s better to not be governed by sociopaths.\u201d</p> <h2>Trevor Noah</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1247345214978772996\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Would Trump be more open to wearing a mask if we told him it\u2019s a border wall for your face? <a href=\"https://t.co/DymBKHyhf7\">pic.twitter.com/DymBKHyhf7</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1247345214978772996?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 7, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>On the Daily Social Distancing Show, Trevor Noah addressed Trump\u2019s unproven and dangerous claim that hydroxychloroquine could treat coronavirus. \u201cHere\u2019s what I don\u2019t get: Trump is acknowledging he\u2019s not a doctor, while legitimate doctors who could answer these questions are standing right there next to him,\u201d Noah said. \u201cWhy are we getting his opinion at all? Imagine if you went in for a check-up, and there\u2019s just some random dude behind the counter giving his opinion.</p> <p>\u201cNow, before you get depressed by the fact that America is being led by someone who knows less about medicine than Dr Pepper, there is still a lot of good news out there,\u201d he continued. Numbers of coronavirus deaths in Spain, France and Italy are slowing down. South Korea, which confirmed its first case on the same day as the US, reported only 47 new cases on Sunday, and has fewer than 200 deaths out of a population of 51 million people.</p> <p>But \u201cmaybe the best news of all\u201d, Noah added, was that Netflix might drop a new episode of their hit documentary series Tiger King. \u201cI guess this is how low the bar has gotten for what counts as good news right now,\u201d said Noah. \u201cWe find out there\u2019s more episodes about deranged murderers and people being cruel to animals and we\u2019re like \u2018YES!\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZWW0S_aFIY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pZWW0S_aFIY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel reflected on Trump\u2019s combative press conferences, such as a clip of Trump lashing out at an Associated Press reporter for asking \u201cwise-guy\u201d questions. \u201cHe\u2019s right, though \u2013 they should phrase these questions in a nicer way,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cLike, \u2018Mr President, why are you doing such an incredible job of screwing this up?\u201d</p> <p>Trump also announced that he will not follow the revised guidelines from the CDC for all Americans to wear masks in public. \u201cHe said it would be odd for him to greet world leaders with a mask on,\u201d Kimmel explained. \u201cWhich may be true, but what world leaders are coming to visit right now?</p> <p>\u201cWhat is the point of telling people to do something you aren\u2019t doing yourself?\u201d Kimmel wondered. \u201cPersonally, I would love to see the president wearing a mask.

  "<p>The World Health Organization has held off from recommending people wear face masks in public after assessing fresh evidence that suggested the items may help to contain the pandemic.</p> \n<p>The WHO reviewed its position on masks in light of data from Hong Kong indicating that their widespread use in the community may have reduced the spread of coronavirus in some regions.</p> \n<p>But in <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak\">updated guidance</a> published on Monday, the organisation maintained that while masks could help limit the spread of the disease, they were insufficient on their own. There was no evidence that wearing a mask in the community prevented healthy people from picking up respiratory infections including Covid-19, it said.</p> \n<p>Prof David Heymann, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who chaired the WHO\u2019s scientific and technical advisory group for infectious hazards, said that unless people were working in healthcare settings, masks are \u201conly for the protection of others, not for the protection of oneself\u201d.</p> \n<p>The committee acknowledged the virus can be transmitted by people who do not have symptoms, but said the virus must still spread via droplets or contaminated surfaces, which physical distancing and handwashing are intended to minimise.</p> \n<p>According to the updated advice, people with coronavirus symptoms should wear a face mask, self-isolate and seek medical advice as soon as they start to feel unwell, while those caring for them should wear a face mask when they are in the same room.</p> \n<p>The WHO guidance on healthy people wearing masks in public appears to conflict with <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html\">recent advice</a> from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which urged the US public to wear cloth face coverings in pharmacies, groceries and other public places where physical distancing can be hard to maintain.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Heymann said masks could create a false sense of security that could end up putting people at greater risk. Even with the mouth and nose fully covered, the virus can still enter through the eyes.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople think they are protected when they are not,\u201d he said. \u201cHealthcare workers, in addition to the masks, wear visors too, to protect the eyes.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another concern is that people may contaminate themselves when they adjust, remove and dispose of their masks.</p> \n<p>The WHO said people who chose to wear masks in public should follow <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks\">its advice</a> to ensure they were using them safely. It said countries that recommended masks for the general population should set up studies to monitor their effectiveness.</p> \n<p>William Keevil, a professor of environmental healthcare at the University of Southampton, said governments felt under pressure to be seen to be doing something, even if it was a waste of time and valuable resources.</p> \n<p>\u201cCloth masks and poor quality surgical face masks will not filter fine respiratory droplets, and certainly not aerosols, which some are now claiming to be an infection risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThe major question that needs to be addressed is: what about protecting the eyes, a known route of entry?.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Elaine Shuo Feng, an epidemiologist at Oxford University, supports the US stance on face masks and said it would be sensible for people who may have been exposed to the virus to wear face masks outdoors because of the risk of passing on the virus.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt would be helpful if high-risk people \u2013 elderly, people with chronic conditions \u2013 wear a face mask if they can\u2019t avoid crowed areas, because these people have the highest risk of severe outcomes such as ICU/death if infected,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u2022 The headline on this article was corrected on 7 April 2020 to more accurately reflect the WHO\u2019s findings.</p>",
  "<p>In recent days, Donald Trump\u2019s closest conservative media allies have been pursuing an increasingly strident case against Dr Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , and a prominent part of the federal government\u2019s Covid-19 response.</p> <p>Critics close to the president have recently been alleging that Fauci is recklessly damaging the economy, preventing the use of supposed wonder treatments like hydroxychloroquine, and now, mid-pandemic, some of them appear to be calling for his job.</p> <p>The most prominent and stinging attack on Fauci came last Friday, when the Fox News talkshow anchor Tucker Carlson <a href=\"https://video.foxnews.com/v/6146994296001\">devoted an entire segment</a> to Fauci\u2019s recommendation for a sustained lockdown, calling it a recipe for \u201cnational suicide\u201d.</p> <p>Carlson accused Fauci of \u201cgetting it wrong on the coronavirus\u201d, and claimed that \u201cAnthony Fauci told us not to worry about this epidemic. Now he\u2019s demanding that the federal government quarantine the entire country.\u201d</p> <p>He criticized his reliance on models like those produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IMHE) which had, according to him, overestimated the scale of the crisis. As a result, the economy was shut down, and the resultant mass unemployment would be \u201ca far bigger disaster than the virus itself\u201d.</p> <p>Carlson \u2013 who unlike some others in conservative media has taken the pandemic seriously for some time \u2013 had previously interviewed Fauci on his program, and until now had seemed well disposed towards him.</p> <p>But his shifting attitude echoes the increasing criticism of Dr Fauci from other people who have been close to the president \u2013 including Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani.</p> <p>Like Carlson, Steve Bannon took the virus seriously early on \u2013 he was warning of a looming catastrophe in special episodes of his War Room broadcast from late January, when most political media was still entirely focused on impeachment and the Democratic primary.</p> <p>The former Breitbart supremo, Trump campaign director and White House staffer, still identifies his program as speaking for \u201cthe Trump movement\u201d. His team has offered bipartisan praise of figures like Andrew Cuomo and Jay Inslee, governors of New York and Washington respectively.</p> <p>On the other hand, he has offered very little criticism of President Trump, and from the beginning his broadcast has relentlessly worked to apportion blame for the outbreak to the Chinese Communist party.</p> <p>In the last week, though, just as the Trump-led federal response has become mired in scandals about preferential PPE allocations, outbidding states on equipment purchases and sacking naval officers, Bannon has begun devoting entire episodes to criticism of Fauci.</p> <p>Bannon and his co-hosts have insisted that Fauci release the federal government\u2019s own data and modeling, provide a fixed time period for closures, and step back from involvement in health communication on the virus. (For his part, Fauci has continued to give advice at odds with the president \u2013 on subjects like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/us-briefing-a-longer-lockdown-faucis-warning-and-1000-new-york-deaths\">likely duration of lockdowns</a> and the feasibility of untested treatments.)</p> <p>And there\u2019s another bone of contention: the supposed wonder-cure, hydroxychloroquine.</p> <p>Last Thursday, the War Room co-host and former Trump campaign communications director, Jason Miller, criticized a pair of Fauci TV appearances, centering the complaint that he \u201cthrew cold water on the hydroxychloroquine test that everyone\u2019s been raving about, or the study from 6,000 doctors from like 37 countries \u2026 this was like water on what we thought were very positive developments\u201d.</p> <p>Hydroxychloroquine is also the basis of the disagreement that the former New York mayor and Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani has with Fauci. On social media and on his New York City radio broadcast (also a podcast), Giuliani has tirelessly promoted the idea that the chemical is an efficacious treatment for Covid-19.</p> <p>He was briefly banned from Twitter after tweeting out a quotation of a remark that the Turning Point USA leader, Charlie Kirk, had made on his radio show, claiming that hydroxychloroquine has a \u201c100% effective rate in treating Covid-19\u201d. The social media platform counted this as disinformation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://theweek.com/speedreads/907062/trumps-fervor-unproven-covid19-drug-reportedly-fueled-by-rudy-giuliani-dr-oz\">Reportedly</a>, Trump\u2019s own, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/apr/06/coronavirus-cure-fact-check-hydroxychloroquine-trump\">increasingly bullish</a> enthusiasm for the drug is informed by Giuliani. He in turn picked the notion that it was cure-all up from a celebrity doctor, Mehmet Oz, who, like Trump, is a regular guest on Fox &amp; Friends.</p> <p>On Sunday, in a press conference, Trump once again <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/us/politics/trump-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus.html\">pushed the chemical</a> and claimed, inaccurately, that there were \u201cstrong, powerful signs\u201d of the drug\u2019s efficacy, and asked rhetorically, \u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d by taking it.</p> <p>By Monday, lesser lights in conservative media were adding to what appears to be a growing momentum against the doctor.</p> <p>On his podcast, Michael Savage <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/michael-savage/michael-savage-calls-dr-anthony-fauci-grandstander-and-pt-barnum-coronavirus\">called</a> Fauci a \u201cgrandstander\u201d and \u201ca PR man, he\u2019s a showman. He\u2019s the P T Barnum of the Covid virus,\u201d who should be pushed back \u201cinto a laboratory where he belongs\u201d.</p> <p>Political commentators have <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/fauci-target-coronavirus-trump/\">noted</a> that similar pile-ons have preceded the departures of James Mattis, Rex Tillerson and John Kelly from the administration. But experts say that much more would be at stake in the removal of Fauci in the middle of a public health crisis.</p> <p>Associate professor Ben Harris-Roxas, from the centre for primary health care and equity at the University of New South Wales, is an expert on public health. He thinks that firing public health leaders during a pandemic is a recipe for disaster.</p> <p>\u201cPublic health experience is most important during epidemics. Each epidemic is different, but having experienced and respected public health experts in charge allows quicker action and more effective communication,\u201d Harris-Roxas said.</p> <p>\u201cFiring public health managers during this pandemic would meaningfully impair the effectiveness of the response,\u201d he added.</p> <p>On hydroxychloroquine, Harris-Roxas said that \u201cthe promotion of untested treatments and cures has been a feature of almost every epidemic in history\u201d.</p> <p>He said that this led to three potential problems. Untested treatments could harm people, cause shortages of drugs for people who need them for proven treatments, and \u201ccontribute to the infodemic \u2013 the spread of misinformation\u201d.</p> <p>Should Fauci go, there will be little impediment to the misinformation which is already exerting a powerful influence on the US federal government\u2019s health policy.</p>",

Care workers are not being tested, even with outbreaks in their workplaces, or in some cases denied tests by NHS boards.</p> <p>Gary Smith, regional organiser for GMB Scotland, said some care workers were going into work ill because they could not afford to be off work on statutory sick pay. Because people who die or fall ill with Covid-19 outside hospitals are not routinely tested for the virus, it has proven hard to verify exact numbers of cases.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an utter shambles,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a programme of testing. These people need to be properly valued by the government and others; caring is built on insecure and low paid workers.\u201d</p> <p>Scottish Care, the sector\u2019s umbrella body, said the problem was exacerbated by very inconsistent supplies of PPE around the country and said it was essential that testing for care workers was rapidly increased.</p> <p>Donald Macaskill, its chief executive, said the army could be drafted in to provide logistical support and deliver supplies to ensure they were available around the clock.</p> <p>The government had ordered 70 hubs to be set up around Scotland to distribute PPE but 20 of them were not yet operating; in four areas they closed at the weekend, he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t use the military\u2019s skills in a battle for life and death, then I don\u2019t know when you would use them,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, said the Care Inspectorate, the statutory body which regulates the sector, was in close contact with care homes. It had checked Castleview care home in Dumbarton, where eight people died from the virus, and was satisfied its infection control procedures were correct.</p> <p>The government and the inspectorate were studying the sector to see if the support and policies were adequate, and the government had invested significant sums in securing and distributing PPE.</p> <p>Sturgeon confirmed that care staff, and if necessary their family members, should be treated by the NHS as key workers and prioritised for virus testing. Jeane Freeman, the health secretary, would issue a reminder to health boards that care workers were a priority for testing.</p> <p>\u201cCare workers are doing a remarkable job in the most difficult of circumstances,\u201d she said at her daily coronavirus briefing. \u201cTesting capacity is increasing with literally every day that passes.\u201d</p> <p>She said the army was already helping solve logistical challenges from St Andrew\u2019s House, the Scottish government\u2019s headquarters in Edinburgh, but did not directly answer a question from the BBC about whether the military should be used to deliver PPE supplies.</p>",
  "<p>Posted to Leman Street in the East End of London in 1964, the police detective Leonard \u201cNipper\u201d Read, who has died aged 95, was asked whether there was any reason he should not head a team to look into the activities of the Kray twins, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/oct/02/guardianobituaries.duncancampbell\" title=\"\">Reggie</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/18/ronnie-kray-death-archive-1995\" title=\"\">Ronnie</a>. He was justifiably annoyed at the implication that he might be on their payroll.</p> <p>In the event his inquiry at that stage was unsuccessful: with witnesses reluctant to give evidence and a crucial one changing his story the pair were acquitted of demanding money with menaces from Huw McCowan, a London club owner. Read\u2019s annoyance pointed to the integrity characteristic of an effective and distinguished career.</p> <p>In March 1966, he was promoted to detective chief inspector and sent to West End Central, where he formed a squad to shut down the illegal clubs and beer joints before the arrival of visitors for the football World Cup.</p> <p>The next year he was promoted to detective chief superintendent and attached to the Murder Squad with the specific brief of investigating the murders of George Cornell, shot in the Blind Beggar public house in the East End, and another Kray associate, Jack \u201cThe Hat\u201d McVitie. Read, fearful of his progress being leaked to the Krays, established his office away from Scotland Yard at Tintagel House, on the southern side of the Thames, in Vauxhall. He was wise to take precautions, because during the investigation a hired gunman was caught at Shannon airport on his way to kill him.</p> <p>He first concentrated on the twins\u2019 fraud activities, and <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/8/newsid_2518000/2518695.stm\" title=\"\">once they were in custody</a> in 1968 he was able, with infinite patience, to persuade the barmaid who had seen the Cornell shooting and the woman in whose flat the McVitie killing had taken place to give evidence. In the guise of a vicar, he visited the Krays\u2019 lieutenant Albert Donoghue in Brixton and persuaded him to give evidence about a third murder, that of Frank Mitchell, the so-called Mad Axeman, whom the twins had helped escape from Dartmoor prison and then had killed when he began to threaten them. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/4/newsid_2515000/2515103.stm\" title=\"\">In 1969 the Krays received life sentences</a> for the first two murders, but were acquitted of the murder of Mitchell.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7f1e8c281145119cabe2d03af1f634e58565b5ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f1e8c281145119cabe2d03af1f634e58565b5ea/0_0_2040_3081/662.jpg\" alt=\"Reggie and Ronnie Kray in the mid-1960s.\" width=\"662\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reggie and Ronnie Kray in the mid-1960s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William Lovelace/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Read had never been an inside man at Scotland Yard, and had refused invitations on a number of occasions to join the Flying Squad. He said he did not like sitting on observation in smoke-filled cars day in and out, but rather he was distancing himself from the corruption rife among some members of the squad. He was too much his own man for some tastes and, effectively passed over for further promotion, he returned to Nottingham in 1970 as assistant chief constable before becoming national co-ordinator of the Regional Crime Squads (1972-76).</p> <p>Born in Nottingham, Read was the son of Leonard Sr, who worked for a leather firm, and his wife, Ida (nee Morris). She died when the boy was four, and he was sent to stay with her brother. When his father remarried, he and his two sisters and brother returned home. Later Read would point out that, while in no way blaming his father, the Kray twins for all their pleading poverty had fared much better as children than he and his siblings had done.</p> <p>Read did well at school, never being out of the first three in his class in either junior or senior school. He learned to box, winning his first medal in 1937 when he weighed 29kg (4st 7lb). Later he joined the Grundy Boxing Club, which was where he was nicknamed Nipper.</p> <p>When he was 14 he left school. He had hoped to go to Nottingham high school and had passed the entrance examination, but his father could not afford the uniform and fees for books. In later life, Read resented the fact he had not been able to stretch himself academically. He took a job in a Player\u2019s cigarette warehouse in 1939, earning 10 shillings (50p) a week, giving eight to his stepmother. He was called up in 1943, joining the Royal Navy, from which he was demobbed in 1946 with the rank of petty officer and a determination not to return to the tobacco factory.</p> <p>He could not join the Nottingham police force, which then had a minimum height regulation of 6ft and in 1947 scraped into the Metropolitan police, which took men at 5ft 8in, telling the medical examiner he was still growing. It was his lack of height that propelled his career. He was taken out of the uniform branch, because his small stature did not meet its requirements.</p> <p>He became an aide to CID, and was used in disguise, on the basis that no one would believe he was a police officer. He had played the lead in David Copperfield in the school play and his acting ability came in useful as, over the years, he would, among other guises, be a painter and decorator, a GPO linesman, a racing cyclist, a chauffeur, a roadsweeper, milkman and a delivery boy. Throughout his early years in the Met he continued to box.</p> <p>As a detective constable, he was sent to Harlesden, in north-west London, where he worked under the famous officer Bert Hannam, known as Suits, a man who dressed like a banker and had an almost photographic memory, but who, with implications and hints, was able to create an atmosphere of prejudice against a defendant.</p> <p>Read was then transferred to Paddington, where the senior first-class sergeant was the highly regarded Tommy Butler, who later led the London end of the investigation of the Great Train Robbery. Unfortunately, Butler was also highly secretive and so Read learned his trade from the other first-class sergeant, Frank Gloyne. At Paddington, Read was on the periphery of the Jack Spot case, when the so-called King of the Underworld asked for protection against his rival Billy Hill.</p> <p>In 1958, Read was promoted to detective sergeant and transferred to Chelsea, where he replaced Ray Purdy, who had been killed by the burglar and blackmailer Guenther Podola. While there he was seconded to Buckinghamshire after the Great Train Robbery, from a Glasgow train in August 1963. It was an experience that introduced him to the investigation of a major crime, but also to the infighting and bickering of officers as they pressed towards the limelight. Following it, he was promoted to detective inspector at Leman Street.</p> <p>In 1977 he retired from the police, having received the Queen\u2019s Police Medal the previous year. He became national security adviser to the National Museums and Galleries Commission (1978-86), a position set up after the theft of Goya\u2019s Duke of Wellington.</p> <p>Throughout his life he had maintained his interest in boxing, and in 1976 joined the British Boxing Board of Control, serving first on the southern area council and as a steward before becoming its chair in 1996 and president in 1997.</p> <p>It was he who saw the board through its painful period of reconstruction after the action brought by <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/others/boxing-the-night-michael-watsons-career-was-ended-2358050.html\" title=\"\">the boxer Michael Watson</a> over the treatment of injuries suffered during his contest with Chris Eubank in 1991.</p> <p>Read also served as a vice-president of the World Boxing Association (1989-2001) and a senior vice-president of the World Boxing Council (1997-2001). He retired from the British Boxing Board of Control in 2000 and spent some of his leisure time lecturing on the Kray case on cruise ships.</p> <p>A neat, meticulous and often obstinate man who commanded respect and loyalty, he did not fit in well with the rough, tough and hard-drinking image of Scotland Yard of his day. One example of his obstinacy was his belief that two young children had been murdered in Enfield, north London, in 1970. He was told they had died from exposure and to close the case; but he never accepted the decision. He was vindicated when, in 1999, a paedophile already serving life imprisonment admitted the killings.</p> <p>Early in Read\u2019s career, he had suffered a blackout which was diagnosed as exhaustion. In 1989, while holidaying, he underwent a convulsive fit and it was realised that he had had epilepsy throughout his life. Had this been diagnosed earlier, he would have been retired from the force almost before his career had started. He regarded himself as a fortunate man.</p> <p>In 1951 he married Marion Millar; they divorced in 1979. In 1980 he married Pat Allen, who had worked on the Kray inquiry, and she survives him, along with Maralyn, his daughter from his first marriage.</p> <p>\u2022 Leonard Ernest \u201cNipper\u201d Read, policeman, born 31 March 1925; died 7 April 2020</p>",
  "<p>The fashion industry needs to fundamentally change in order to mitigate the environmental impact of fast fashion, experts have said.</p> <p>Clothes rental, better recycling processes, pollution control technology and the innovative use of offcuts are among measures that could help, they said.</p> <p>The researchers produced a report \u2013 pubished in the journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-020-0039-9\">Nature Reviews Earth &amp; Environment</a> \u2013 into the environmental cost of the industry, and how it needs to change to deal with some of the many associated problems.</p> <p>While the figures are debated, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has calculated the fashion industry produces 10% of global carbon dioxide emissions every year, while it is estimated to use around 1.5 trillion litres of water annually.

But he said it was unclear what proportion of the industry\u2019s environmental impact was down to fast fashion per se. A key challenge for the \u201cclosed loop\u201d industry was that different sectors, from production to retailing and recycling, must begin to work together.</p> <p>But Evans said a future where the rate of fibre production and disposal was lowered need not mean a dearth of new outfits, if garments were rented or re-sold. \u201cIt might be fast fashion from the perspective of the fashionista,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is slow from the perspective of the planet.\u201d</p>",

Stacking the money, I\u2019m pleased to say, used up a bit of quarantine time.</p> <p>A lot of art involving everyday objects can, by definition, be copied, and some artists actively encourage us to remake their work. In 1919, unable to attend his sister\u2019s wedding in the immediate aftermath of the first world war, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/apr/07/marcel-duchamp-artist-a-z-dictionary\">Marcel Duchamp</a> sent from Buenos Aires instructions for an artwork by way of a present. Suzanne Duchamp was to source a geometry textbook and suspend it by strings from her balcony overlooking Rue la Condamine in Paris. \u201cThe wind had to go through the book, choose its own problems, turn and tear the pages.\u201d</p> <p>As an art critic currently starved of art (notwithstanding online projects ), I was tempted to take Duchamp\u2019s work and regift it to myself . But sadly I do not possess any geometry textbooks (no home-schooling in this household).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a51dff6f6438825ef83543a4503d5477ee545422\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a51dff6f6438825ef83543a4503d5477ee545422/92_1342_2972_1783/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Basciano\u2019s recreation of Fernanda Gomes\u2019 coin work.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Show me the money \u2026 Basciano\u2019s recreation of Fernanda Gomes\u2019 coin work.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver Basciano</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instructional art took off in the 1960s with the advent of the Fluxus movement. Its time may have come again for the budding self-isolating artist. In 1964, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/apr/11/yoko-ono-poetry\">Yoko Ono published Grapefruit</a>, a book full of whimsical tasks that anyone might try. Originally limited to 500 copies, it was republished six years later with a foreword by John Lennon and gained cult status.</p> <p>\u201cListen to a heartbeat,\u201d read one request. \u201cMake music only with overtones,\u201d said another. \u201cImagine one thousand suns in the sky at the same time / Let them shine for one hour / Then, let them gradually melt into the sky. / Make one tunafish sandwich and eat.\u201d Sandwich-based sculpture is a medium I endorse.</p> <p>Grapefruit would go on to inspire the mother of all instructional art repositories: a website created in 2002 as part of curator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/hans-ulrich-obrist\">Hans Ulrich Obrist</a>\u2019s long-running <a href=\"http://projects.e-flux.com/do_it/manuals/0_manual.html\">Do It project</a>. Originally conceived in 1993 with artists Christian Boltanski and Bertrand Lavier, it allowed schools and artist-run spaces to stage museum-quality group shows, with each organisation making exhibits under instruction.</p> <p>Now Do It (Home Version) takes the work straight to the people: Ulrike Grossath commands us to \u201clean, shove under, force in, tilt, pile up, make fit\u201d our household furniture into a pile; Mona Hatoum lays out how to make a lamp from a colander; Shimabuku encourages us to make art that will be appreciated by our pets; Paul McCarthy suggests \u201cuse your penis as a paint brush\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"40ff4315aaba7d3fcc41db64c9fb145dcb838405\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40ff4315aaba7d3fcc41db64c9fb145dcb838405/0_0_3196_4660/686..jpg\" alt=\"Fresh moves \u2026 Yvonne Rainer with Trio A; her new work is called Passing and Jostling While Being Confined to a Small Apartment.\" width=\"686\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fresh moves \u2026 Yvonne Rainer with Trio A; her new work is called Passing and Jostling While Being Confined to a Small Apartment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Obrist says: \u201cIt\u2019s an outlet for experimentation, to bring art where it would not normally be. A few weeks ago, I suddenly heard about people in Italy revisiting Do It during the lockdown. The project changes as the world changes. Many of the original instructions incorporated activism \u2013 Eileen Myles produced a guide of how to run for president \u2013 or had a practical purpose. So now I\u2019ve started asking artists to make new instructions for how we can help each other in this moment.\u201d The curator says he will post these on Instagram over the next few weeks, for his 300,000 followers to undertake.</p> <p>US choreographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/dec/24/step-by-step-yvonne-rainer\">Yvonne Rainer</a> was another artist interested in radically rethinking authorship. In 1966, she relinquished control of Trio A which features a series of easy movements without music to be performed solo, including standing on one leg, walking and toe-tapping. Rainer allowed it to be taught by anyone who had danced the work, a high-brow precursor to TikTok memes. It was in homage to that work that last week Rainer released instructions for a new performance, called <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/arts/dance/yvonne-rainer-do-it-yourself-coronavirus.html\">Passing and Jostling While Being Confined to a Small Apartment</a>.</p> <p>If Rainer\u2019s intention was to stave off the claustrophobia of self-isolation, then Bruce Nauman\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artwork/bruce-nauman-body-pressure\">Body Pressure</a> \u2013 a set of typed instructions originally produced in 1974 \u2013 only compounds it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/bruce-nauman\">Nauman</a> encourages us to press the front of our body against a wall, as hard as possible, all the time imagining that, on the other side of the bricks, we ourselves are pushing the other way with the back of the body. This, he warns, may \u201cbecome a very erotic exercise\u201d.

He last saw James for just one hour, a few days before the lockdown, and said the boy was scared to go near him. \u201cHe would not hug or kiss or hold me, sat in the back of the car for the first time when I picked him up and it was very apparent he had been briefed in relation to seeing me, although he should be in my care twice a week,\u201d said Simon.</p> \n<p><em>Names have been changed to protect identities.</em></p>",
  "<p>I knew a pandemic was coming, but I didn\u2019t think it would be so soon. In the weeks before the outbreak of Covid-19 began in Wuhan, I was putting the finishing touches to a book about the psychology of pandemics. In my work as a clinical psychologist, I had spent years studying past outbreaks<strong> </strong>and examining what they could teach us about the psychological effects of the next virus.</p> <p>Based on the hallmarks of previous pandemics, some of my predictions about coronavirus have proved eerily correct. I imagined that we\u2019d see growing anxiety, racism, panic-buying, the proliferation of conspiracy theories, and sporadic instances of looting and theft \u2013 but also altruism and generosity, as people reached out to the physically isolated with offers of help.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As a result of Covid-19, some will become fastidious germophobes, striving to avoid touching \u2018contaminated' surfaces</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Previous outbreaks, such as the 2009 influenza pandemic and the 2003 Sars epidemic,<strong> </strong>suggest that a public health emergency can have lasting effects on the psychology of a population. In the case of Covid-19, some of these effects are obvious: many people will lose their jobs and endure financial hardship; others will suffer the devastation of losing loved ones; marriages and relationships will collapse under the pressure of lockdown.</p> <p>In an ongoing research project with fellow psychologist Gordon Asmundson, we evaluated reported levels of fear and anxiety among almost 7,000 adults from Canada and the US. While 75% of respondents seem to be coping well, 25% have developed what we\u2019ve called Covid stress syndrome. These people have intense fears about becoming infected; they worry about the social and economic impact of Covid-19; they have coronavirus nightmares and persistently check the internet for news related to Covid-19, which may further heighten their anxieties. These people also tend to be xenophobic \u2013 they are wary of foreigners, who they fear may be carriers of the virus.</p> <p>Anxiety about your own mortality, fears stoked by a deluge of online articles: these are the most obvious psychological effects of coronavirus. Others may be less obvious at first. Based on studies of disasters such as floods, hurricanes and earthquakes, an estimated<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29902711\"> 10% of people</a> affected by traumatic events go on to develop severe psychological problems such as mood disorders, anxiety disorders or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These symptoms typically arise soon after the disaster. Such findings suggest that 10% of people affected by coronavirus \u2013 possibly more \u2013 will develop psychological disorders during or after this pandemic.</p> <p>However, if coronavirus is anything like Sars, this percentage could be substantially higher among those infected with the virus. A number of people who had been hospitalised with Sars in 2003 later developed PTSD. A four-year follow-up study of 70 Sars survivors found that 44% of people <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112559/\">developed </a>the disorder. Even after recovering from Sars, 82% of these people had PTSD years later. PTSD symptoms tended to be more severe in people who had a high mortality risk, low social support, and close relatives who suffered or died from Sars.</p> <p>It\u2019s likely that even those who aren\u2019t infected with coronavirus could also develop psychological symptoms. Isolation and confinement, even if only for a few weeks, can cause lasting anxiety. People quarantined for prolonged periods in cramped accommodation, sharing a bedroom with multiple occupants, or trapped at home in an abusive or coercive relationship, may be especially vulnerable to developing PTSD symptoms during and after the outbreak.</p> <p>Other psychological effects will have more to do with environmental and social changes. Covid-19 has forced societies to trial entirely new ways of living. School lessons have moved online; work meetings take place over Zoom; groceries are delivered via Amazon. We\u2019re living through the first global pandemic in the digital age, where the internet has made it possible to withdraw from the outside world.</p> <p>Even before the outbreak, people were already working from home, shopping online, and having food delivered, rather than going to restaurants. The outbreak may have further entrenched the direction in which society was already heading. After coronavirus has passed, we may find that life never fully returns to \u201cnormal\u201d. Risk-averse, digitally connected people could continue retreating to the safety of home.</p> <p>As a result of Covid-19, some people will become fastidious germophobes, striving to avoid touching \u201ccontaminated\u201d surfaces or shaking hands. Germ phobias, which are typically symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorders, arise from a combination of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26630089\">genetic and environmental factors</a> that <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22024245\">interact</a> with one another. In other words, when a person with a particular genetic makeup has a traumatic experience with infections (such as developing a severe case of Covid-19), they are likely to develop a germ phobia. Such phobias are <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24084621\">typically chronic</a>, although milder phobias may be short-lived.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/six-in-10-people-in-uk-have-felt-anxious-about-coronavirus\">Six in 10 people in UK have felt anxious about coronavirus \u2013 poll</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Still, there is some cause for optimism. The many people who volunteered to help others during the pandemic will experience renewed purpose and meaning in their lives. And those who <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29789087\">adjusted better</a> to self-isolation \u2013 that is, people who are open to new experiences, optimistic and emotionally stable \u2013 are more likely to fare well during and after the pandemic. Not everyone possesses these characteristics, but people can improve their resilience by learning new coping strategies, through practices like cognitive behavioural therapy (a valuable resource for this is the <a href=\"https://bouncebackbc.ca/what-is-bounceback/\">BounceBack</a> programme, which is freely available online).</p> <p>The future implications of coronavirus are still uncertain. But based on what we know from previous outbreaks, we can predict that this pandemic will have profound psychological effects on the people living through it.</p> <p>\u2022 Steven Taylor is a professor and clinical psychologist in the department of psychiatry, University of British Columbia, and the author of <a href=\"https://cambridgescholars.com/the-psychology-of-pandemics\">The Psychology of Pandemics</a> </p>",
  "<p>When Michelle Paver won the Guardian children\u2019s fiction prize in 2010 for the final book in her bestselling Chronicles of Ancient Darkness series, she was done with the stone age adventures of the boy Torak, his wolf companion, and the girl Renn. \u201cAs soon as you write that last line and finish the book they are gone,\u201d she told the Guardian at the time, \u201cand they don\u2019t come back.\u201d</p> <p>Ten years later, Torak, Renn and Wolf are, in fact, back, <a href=\"https://www.thebookseller.com/news/michelle-pavers-legendary-wolf-brother-be-adapted-tv-1198319\">both in an upcoming TV adaptation of the first six books</a> and in Paver\u2019s latest novel, Viper\u2019s Daughter. Now Torak is on the trail of Renn, who has disappeared without a word. \u201cTracking was what Torak did best, and even by starlight he found Renn\u2019s three-day-old trail. To his alarm, it didn\u2019t lead towards the valley where the clan was camped, but down to the River Blackthorn where he and Renn kept their canoe. The canoe was gone,\u201d Paver writes, before sending her stone age boy and his wolf on a quest to the far north, where they\u2019ll be hunted by ice bears, and face their most evil enemy yet. It\u2019s wonderful \u2013 sheer escapism, for children and adults alike.</p> <p>\u201cI missed them acutely when I finished Ghost Hunter,\u201d says Paver now, who has spent the interim years publishing a handful of critically acclaimed novels for adults, from the terrifying ghost story Dark Matter and Thin Air, where five Englishmen set out to climb Kangchenjunga and which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/20/thin-air-michelle-paver-review\">was described as a \u201ca heart-freezing masterpiece\u201d by the Observer</a>. \u201cIt was immersive and great fun to be writing an adult gothic, or a ghost story, but even when I was writing them, Torak and Renn and Wolf didn\u2019t go away. They\u2019d pop into my head at odd moments, and that is very different to other books.\u201d</p> <p>On a trip to the Malangen fjord in northern Norway, she went out into the snow one night and the northern lights appeared: \u201cNot the massively lurid ones you see in documentaries, but it was like a twisted arrow or arch pointing north, and it gave me an idea. What if one of the trio leaves? And that\u2019s when the ideas started fizzing.\u201d</p> <p>Paver was in the middle of research for another adult novel \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/07/wakenhyrst-by-michelle-paver-review\">Wakenhyrst</a>, about a lonely child growing up in the middle of the marshes in Edwardian Suffolk \u2013 so she had to put the germ of an idea for what would become Viper\u2019s Daughter aside. But she\u2019s no stranger to letting ideas percolate until they find their time: while studying biochemistry at Oxford in the late 70s, she found herself getting increasingly interested in writing and attempted a Mills &amp; Boon. \u201cIt was absolute rubbish. I was so arrogant. I had complete contempt for Mills &amp; Boon and thought it must be easy, so wrote it in three weeks and sent it in. Of course it got rejected.\u201d</p> <p>The next thing she wrote was set in Viking-age Norway about a boy, a wolf and a large bear. That got rejected, too \u2013 but 23 years later, while looking through her old manuscripts she realised there was something there. She shifted the story to the stone age and wrote Wolf Brother, the first book in the Chronicles of Ancient Darkness, which opens as Torak and his father are attacked by a demon bear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"06412b4be71e0f143daedf46ff3796eec8151f98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06412b4be71e0f143daedf46ff3796eec8151f98/0_273_2884_1732/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Paver with a wolf in 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paver with a wolf in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Upton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the interim, she \u201ctook a bit of a wrong turn\u201d, becoming a biotechnological patents lawyer for 13 years. \u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019m quite good at exams, why don\u2019t I do law for a couple of years and maybe I\u2019ll be published by then?\u2019\u201d After years of trying to write in the evenings and at weekends, and not really wanting to be a lawyer at all, she \u201chad to jump off the treadmill\u201d.

  "<p>Like many people, I was trying to use my phone a bit less this year, and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> came along and added some pretty essential phone-based tasks to my day \u2013 among them listening to podcasts about the failings of the UK government, hanging out with friends on video app du jour <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/royals-ministers-or-even-boy-george-houseparty-isolation-app-coronavirus\">Houseparty</a>, and even doing therapy via FaceTime.

He\u2019s a comedian who is insanely good at social media, and who specialises in Limmy-ish, David Brent-esque visions of terrible middle-Englanders. His coronavirus content has been particularly impressive, offering light relief by sending up prejudice and delving into farce. Highlights include a woman whose husband won\u2019t eat Chinese food any more, though carbonara is fine; a mock press conference where the PM zones out to think about hot buttery toast; and parental video call fails, all filmed solo and fuss-free in Green\u2019s living room.</p> <p>After briefly trying to get into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok\">TikTok</a> \u2013 which I have decided is mostly just videos of footballers I\u2019ve not heard of doing viral dance challenges \u2013 I\u2019m back with everyone else over the age of 14 on YouTube. In particular, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbpMy0Fg74eXXkvxJrtEn3w\">Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen</a> has reeled me in. The US food magazine\u2019s content seems to have become A Thing in the past year, but I\u2019d never really got it. I love cooking, I read cookbooks when I\u2019m bored, and Nigel Slater\u2019s programmes are among the only shows I can rewatch endlessly, but did I need to get into a cultish online cookery channel, too?</p> <p>The answer was yes, especially when you\u2019ve got strands such as It\u2019s Alive, in which lovely, laid-back Brad ferments things \u2013 perfect for our own new normal, where making your own mustard is a great way to kill a few hours \u2013 or Reverse Engineering, in which perfectly uptight Chris tweaks and retweaks recipes in order to replicate a mystery dish.

It is both accessible and wildly experimental, and, for a record that spawned a hit as massive as her cover of It\u2019s Oh So Quiet, it is resolutely unique and strange, always existing at the intersection of art and pop.</p> <p>She wrote the record after moving to London, and, while it shares some of its predecessor\u2019s affection for trip-hop and house music, it has a harder edge and hints at darker nights. In the techno-tinged pop sludge of Army of Me and Enjoy, you can see the origins of what would become an enduring fascination with digital technology.</p> <p>But it carries itself lightly in places, too, and is frequently gorgeous and glorious, particularly when it comes to the storytelling. Hyperballad is a folk tale of anxiety and love; Isobel ushers itself along string-laden beats to weave a wonderful fable of a clash between the ancient and modern; and Possibly Maybe is as sparse and minimal as Bj\u00f6rk gets, stripped to its bare bones, and astonishingly beautiful with it.</p> <h2>The three to check out next</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/19/bjork-homogenic\">Homogenic</a> (One Little Indian, 1997)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxL1rw6cw-E\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WxL1rw6cw-E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Bj\u00f6rk: Hunter \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>This masterpiece remains Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s greatest and most cogent record to date. Her first two albums had hopped around sounds, trying things on and shrugging them off, but Homogenic settles into an epic orchestral feel that marries itself to skittering, aggressive beats. Encountering a Bj\u00f6rk record for the first time always leaves the feeling of never quite having heard anything like it before, but that is never more true than here, where the music pulls between icy and warm, robotic and natural. It is also drily funny at times, for which Bj\u00f6rk rarely gets credit. \u201cI thought I could organise freedom / How Scandinavian of me,\u201d she belts out, on the pounding military march of Hunter.</p> <p><strong>Vespertine (One Little Indian, 2001)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54LQ_AO1gDI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/54LQ_AO1gDI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Bj\u00f6rk: Hidden Place \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>After Homogenic came a softening, and Vespertine, dealing with love and desire, is Bj\u00f6rk at her most beautiful. She finds new textures in her voice, and its acrobatics are less flashy and more delicate, against an intricate world conjured up out of harps, music boxes and the clavichord. Among non-fans, there can be a perception that Bj\u00f6rk is, at times, hard work, that her experiments in sound can be a chore to listen to, but this is simply sublime.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/06/bjork-biophilia-cd-review\">Biophilia </a>(One Little Indian, 2011)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ADS-VUHSEM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6ADS-VUHSEM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Bj\u00f6rk: Virus \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The interplay between nature and technology, a longstanding concern, became explicit on this album \u201cabout the universe\u201d, which was also released as a series of apps and turned into an educational programme to help teach schoolchildren about science. Bells and whistles aside, this is underrated in the Bj\u00f6rk canon, and is packed with gems, from the dubstep-ish banger Crystalline, to the majesty of Virus, all wrapped around mind-bending, otherworldly time signatures.

Some of it hasn\u2019t aged well, but, as a portrait of Bj\u00f6rk in the early stages of her solo career, it has the curiosity factor, and it is a reminder of just how rapid her rise to fame was with Debut. \u201cI guess I was lucky in that I became a public property in Iceland when I was 11, so I had 15 years of hardcore rehearsals before all of this hullabaloo,\u201d she said.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/features/interview/9582-the-invisible-woman-a-conversation-with-bjork/\">The Invisible Woman: A Conversation with Bj\u00f6rk, by Jessica Hopper</a><br></strong>In this wide-ranging interview around the devastating yet restorative 2015 album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jan/21/bjork-vulnicura-first-listen-review\">Vulnicara</a>, Bj\u00f6rk broached the personal loss that inspired the record, and once again addressed the issue of male collaborators being credited with her arrangements and production. \u201cI want to support young girls who are in their 20s now and tell them: <em>You\u2019re not just imagining things</em>.

  "<p>This was taken in 1981 or 1982, right at the beginning of my career. All my clothes at that time were secondhand \u2013 a hangover from being at art college.

As I walked along the pavement, I carried with me the knowledge that the police could not stop me for no reason and demand to know what I was doing, why I was doing it or where I was going. It seems obvious, when you see it in black and white, but I suspect most of us take for granted this simple principle, which underpins our basic rights in what I believe to be the country with more real personal liberty than any other.</p> <p>But in a matter of days parliament legislated away fundamental human rights that were hard won over centuries \u2013 freedom of movement, freedom of assembly, rights to family life, even the right to refuse consent to medical treatment when of sound mind.</p> <p>The motivation is surely sound: the need to practise social distancing to ensure that we control the coronavirus pandemic and save as many lives as possible. But I strongly disagree with the means of achieving it.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/350/pdfs/uksi_20200350_en.pdf\">Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020</a> came into force at 1pm on 26 March, with minimal parliamentary debate and scrutiny. It is important to understand what the regulations actually say, rather than what the prime minister and the government have been telling us. \u201cNo person may leave the place where they are living without reasonable excuse\u201d is the most important and central provision.</p> <p>Contrary to some of the myths around, there is no definition of \u201creasonable excuse\u201d to be found anywhere. The regulations merely give some examples of excursions that are presumed to be reasonable, including \u201cto obtain basic necessities\u201d, \u201cto take exercise\u201d, \u201cto seek medical assistance\u201d, \u201cto provide care or assistance\u201d and various other activities.</p> <p>Importantly, there is no legal limit on the number of times a day that even these activities can be undertaken, no matter how many references are made to the \u201conce a day rule\u201d for exercise, shopping or anything else.</p> <p>The police have no power to stop you and demand an explanation as to why you are away from your home, although common sense would dictate a courteous and cooperative response if asked such questions by an officer. Still less can officers insist on searching your shopping bags to decide whether any given item is a basic necessity or not (another undefined term but which specifically includes food and medical supplies).</p> <p>There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/uk-police-use-drones-and-roadblocks-to-enforce-lockdown\">no power to mount roadblocks</a> or to stop vehicles at will, as has been made crystal clear in guidance issued in recent days by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/uk-police-reissued-with-guidance-on-enforcing-coronavirus-lockdown\">National Police Chiefs Council</a>, which coordinates policing procedures across the country. The NPCC has helpfully stressed the need for \u201cpolicing by consent\u201d, now as much as ever, but stories of overzealous officers unlawfully demanding explanations from the public have multiplied day by day.</p> <p>I was against the use of the police to enforce social distancing from the outset. Not only did I object to the ripping up of basic freedoms, with no proper thought, but I had real concerns that the bond of trust between the public and the police service would come under intolerable strain.</p> <p>Sadly, everything I have seen since has increased my concern. For the first time I can remember, last week I saw no fewer than three police cars on the high street of the small town where I live. Officers were standing by the road, eyeing vehicles and pedestrians alike with suspicion.</p> <p>Had the government\u2019s communications strategy been more coherent from the start, including with the use of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/07/inside-a-uk-coronavirus-intensive-care-unit-on-the-frontline-video\">frontline medical personnel</a> to explain the need for social distancing, I do not believe that so many people would have ignored the guidance in the early days.

  "<p>New figures reveal that the number of large industrial-sized pig and chicken farms in the UK continues to rise, with close to 2,000 across the country.</p> <p>In 2017, the then environment secretary Michael Gove <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2017-07-20/debates/B316CA20-A222-4EDE-9089-5A0553926CD0/OralAnswersToQuestions\">told MPs</a>: \u201cOne thing is clear: I do not want to see, and we will not have, US-style farming in this country.\u201d However, the number of industrial-sized pig and poultry units in the UK has risen by 7% from 1,669 in 2017 to 1,786 this year.</p> <p>Chicken farms are classed as \u201cintensive\u201d if they have capacity to house at least 40,000 poultry birds, while pig farms must have 2,000 pigs raised for meat or 750 breeding sows. Intensive pig and poultry facilities require a permit from the Environment Agency to operate, which is not the case at present for intensive beef and dairy units, so their numbers are not monitored.<br><br>In England alone, according to 2020 data obtained by the Guardian and Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the number of permitted intensive livestock facilities in England has risen 7% since 2017 to 1,313 as of February this year. Of these, 1,092 are poultry and 221 are pig units, up from 1,016 and 210 respectively. Scotland has seen a rise of 10% and Wales has seen the highest rise, up 21% since 2017.

  "<p>Britain\u2019s supermarkets have been warned against holding on to NHS data about vulnerable patients which they will receive as part of the government\u2019s efforts to combat Covid-19 once the crisis has abated.</p> <p>The retailers will this week begin contacting customers whose names are on a list of medically vulnerable individuals, handed over by the government.</p> <p>But they must delete the data they have received when the coronavirus crisis has abated, the information commissioner warned. Until then, the information, which covers at least 1.5 million people, may be kept and used by the supermarkets to help prioritise deliveries to those most in need.</p> <p>Handing over the data is allowed under measures in the Data Protection Act that enable public authorities to share relevant information to provide essential support services.</p> <p>An ICO spokesperson said: \u201cData protection law enables organisations to share personal data when it is appropriate to do so. In a national emergency such as the Covid-19 pandemic, sharing information between organisations can make a real difference to protecting vulnerable individuals.</p> <p>\u201cWhere it\u2019s necessary, public authorities are able to share relevant information to help provide essential support services, as long as they share only the minimum amount of information required and ensure that it is not retained for longer than needed.

  "<p>Natalie Portman once described Jared Kushner \u2013 a former classmate of hers at Harvard \u2013 as \u201c<a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2018/06/15/natalie-portman-calls-jared-kushner-a-supervillain/?utm_medium=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=P6Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow\">a supervillain</a>\u201d. This seems unwarranted: while the president\u2019s son-in-law is certainly a joker, he lacks the charisma needed for supervillain status. Indeed, the man lacks any charisma whatsoever; he has the presence of a piece of plywood.</p> <p>In many ways, Kushner\u2019s wooden demeanour has been his greatest strength: it has helped him fly under the radar. Politics has become a reality TV show and quiet Kushner is often too boring to bother with; it is far more interesting to focus on his glamorous wife, Ivanka Trump, or his garrulous father-in-law. Yet over the past few years Kushner has managed to insert himself into the highest levels of decision-making while largely remaining behind the scenes.</p> <p>That changed last week. On Thursday, Kushner, who has taken on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/jared-kushner-coronavirus-aid-trump-governors\">vast responsibilities in the Trump administration\u2019s response to Covid-19</a>, made his first public appearance at the White House daily coronavirus briefing. His moment in the spotlight seemed to serve as a wakeup call for the US. All of a sudden, it was glaringly obvious how dangerous Kushner\u2019s hubris is. \u201cI for one became even more fearful of [Covid-19] when I saw how inept\u201d Kushner is, said <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/meghan-mccain-says-trump-coronavirus-briefings-are-valuable-to-expose-administration-they-show-how-inept-jared-kushner-is/\">the Republican pundit Meghan McCain</a> on Monday.</p> <p>McCain\u2019s fears were widely shared. Kushner was supposedly at the press briefing to explain the work he has been doing. However, despite him repeating the word '\u201cdata\u201d <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/04/jared-kushner-coronavirus-conference-appearance.html\">13 times</a>, it quickly became clear that he has no idea what he is doing. He doesn\u2019t even seem to know what the purpose of a federal stockpile of medical equipment is. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be our stockpile,\u201d he explained haughtily to reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles that they then use.\u201d</p> <p>Kushner\u2019s bizarre statement stunned people. Who did the guy think that the federal stockpile belongs to if not the United States of America? The first family and their friends? Kushner may as well have stood up there and said: \u201cWe\u2019re not in this together \u2013 you\u2019re on your own.\u201d An opinion column in the New York Times the following day declared: Jared Kushner Is Going to Get Us All Killed. (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/nyt_diff/status/1246077505703985152?s=20\">The headline was later changed</a>, for reasons unknown, to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/opinion/jared-kushner-coronavirus.html\">Putting Jared Kushner In Charge Is Utter Madness</a>.)</p> <p>During his 39 years on Earth, Kushner has continuously failed upwards. Despite being an unremarkable student, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/18/jared-kushner-harvard-donald-trump-son-in-law\">he got a place at Harvard</a>; according to spokespeople for Kushner Companies, this was unrelated to his dad giving $2.5m to the university. After buying a skyscraper at the very top of the real estate market, Kushner was miraculously bailed out by a company with links to the government of Qatar \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/qatar-666-5th-ave-jared-kushner\">just months before a potentially ruinous $1.4bn</a><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/qatar-666-5th-ave-jared-kushner\"> mortgage was due</a>. Wherever Kushner is, questionable deals, questionable ethics and a crowd of yes men seem to follow. The world is constantly remade to reflect the reality that he wants to see. Indeed, shortly after the backlash to Kushner\u2019s comments about the federal stockpile, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/04/04/826922646/jared-kushners-role-in-coronavirus-response-draws-scrutiny-criticism\">the government\u2019s website appeared to change</a> to more closely reflect Kushner\u2019s assertions. According to a spokesperson, this change had been in the works for ages; it was nothing to do with Kushner\u2019s ego.</p> <p>There is a management concept called the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/10/burkeman-work-incompetence-skills-wellbeing\">Peter principle</a>. The world is full of inept managers, this theory postulates, because people are promoted until they rise to \u201ctheir level of incompetence\u201d. Bearing that in mind, let me introduce the Kushner corollary: the idea that a handful of mediocre middle managers, through a combination of privilege and luck, manage to rise way beyond their level of incompetence to a point where their hubris poses a serious threat to the world. It is becoming increasingly clear that Kushner is not just a doofus \u2013 he is dangerous. </p> <ul> <li><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>",

The accused, like Mitchell, had been caught stealing from clothes left in the dressing room while their owners played cricket, and his lawyer argued that he could not be held responsible for his actions. \u201cThe prisoner had, for some time past, been worried and harassed in a way which it was almost impossible for a man to bear,\u201d he argued, according to a report in the Cheltenham Mercury of a case that took place in that town in June 1886. \u201cHe had latterly suffered from an attack of erysipelas in the head and, unfortunately, had also resorted to drink in order to try and drown his troubles; and the medical man who attended him said that the effect of the two things combined would be such that at times he would not be responsible for his actions. On Saturday last he was in such a state of mind that he hardly knew what he was doing.\u201d The defendant was sentenced to 28 days\u2019 hard labour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The judge in that case had also been asked to consider \u201cthe position which the prisoner had occupied in the past\u201d and the fact that: \u201cHe could never hold up his head again in this country. Never again could he mix with his friends, and any punishment which the Bench might inflict would not be equal to that which he had inflicted on himself.\u201d Indeed, so deep was the shame associated with this theft that the guilty man, once released, left the country and moved to Canada. His name was Walter Gilbert.</p> <p>Both by birth and marriage Gilbert was of the finest cricketing stock. He was the cousin and county teammate of WG, EM and GF Grace and the husband of Sarah Lillywhite, whose family included William, cricketing great and founder of the sporting equipment business, John, who opened the first Lillywhite\u2019s shop on Haymarket in London, and James, England\u2019s first Test captain. He was a fine all-rounder himself, but not a great businessman. The seed of his downfall was sowed in 1882, when a series of 21 cricket matches he had arranged was massively affected by bad weather. Instead of making \u00a3600 he ended up with only \u00a370, and the following year he filed for bankruptcy. As one report of his miserable situation put it: \u201cThe liabilities amount to about \u00a3800 and the assets were estimated at \u00a34, and consisted of four cricket bats, which had seen good service.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"07585f4afbfbd98164b2e25403de4e11c88eadab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07585f4afbfbd98164b2e25403de4e11c88eadab/0_0_4800_3354/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Walter Gilbert (sixth left) is included in a lithographic portrait entitled \u2018Famous English Cricketers, 1880\u2019.

In 1886 Gilbert made the unusual step of renouncing his amateur status and turning professional, and in addition to playing for Gloucestershire he made a bit of extra money by playing for East Gloucestershire.</p> <p>Some of the East Gloucestershire players noticed that money had a habit of disappearing from the clothes they left in the changing room while they played and eventually they contacted the police. Together, they arranged for an officer, Sergeant Woolford, to hide in the changing room while the team played Stroud on Saturday 5 June 1886, while one of the players marked some coins and left them in his waistcoat. At approximately 12.10pm that afternoon Gilbert came into the dressing room, rummaged around a few unguarded pockets, and took half a sovereign and a shilling from the waistcoat. He was confronted, admitted everything, and was swiftly spirited by taxi to the local police station.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/05/kapil-dev-tavare-and-me-bollywood-brings-india-1983-world-cup-film\">Kapil Dev, Tavar\u00e9 and me: Bollywood brings India\u2019s 1983 triumph to life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gilbert immediately knew that his life in England was over, and he ended up in Calgary, where he quietly rebuilt his reputation.

  "<p>Republican senator Kelly Loeffler\u2019s financial disclosures show that millions of dollars in stocks were sold on her behalf right after Congress received briefings about the forthcoming coronavirus crisis. The transactions in question occurred on three separate occasions, and involved <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/loeffler-reports-more-stock-sales-denies-wrongdoing/YFPDT3pChO873nuzNKa44K/\">selling International Exchange stocks</a>, as well as for retail companies that were likely to be hard hit during the pandemic. The Georgia senator also <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/sen-kelly-loeffler-dumped-millions-in-stock-after-coronavirus-briefing\">purchased stock for a company that provides teleworking software</a>. There have been <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/4/1/21202900/kelly-loeffler-stock-sales-coronavirus-pandemic\">accusations of insider trading</a> in some media reports, although there is no indication Loeffler has been the subject of a criminal investigation over the allegations.</p> <p>But the accusations may have an impact on not just her political career, but on the WNBA. That\u2019s because, since 2011, Loeffler has been one of the <a href=\"https://dream.wnba.com/about-the-owners/\">owners of the Atlanta Dream</a>. This has the potential to put the WNBA and its players into a terrible position. Her political views \u2013 and the recent allegations \u2013 seem to be in contrast to everything the league itself stands for.</p> <p>Loeffler is a businesswomen with no previous political experience. She was not elected to office, but <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/inside-how-kemp-picked-loeffler-for-the-senate/ftgH6xSI2Lnl0QLgqSQu8O/\">appointed by Georgia\u2019s governor, Brian Kemp</a>, in what some political insiders have referred to as \u201ca joke,\u201d after her predecessor, Johnny Isakson, resigned due to health problems last year. Loeffler\u2019s background is in finance and she made her money mostly through bitcoin \u2013 the Atlanta Journal Constitution <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/inside-how-kemp-picked-loeffler-for-the-senate/ftgH6xSI2Lnl0QLgqSQu8O/\">referred to her as</a> \u201ca deep pocketed marketing whiz\u201d \u2013 making her capable of understanding the market well enough that her current actions look even more suspect, though she has maintained that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenatorLoeffler/status/1240856941435502592\">her portfolio is handled by a third party</a> (Loeffler\u2019s office did not return request for comment for this story).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/us-senators-accused-coronavirus-insider-trading-are-a-symbol-moral-bankruptcy\">US senators accused of coronavirus insider trading are a symbol of moral bankruptcy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Loeffler took a page out of the Donald Trump playbook and boasted of her status as a \u201cpolitical outsider.\u201d She was originally thought to be on the more moderate side (probably because she heads up the first women-owned professional sports team in Georgia) and rightwing publications lambasted her as having \u201cties to the abortion industry\u201d (due to the fact that the WNBA has partnered with Planned Parenthood). But she has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kloeffler/status/1202261112684761089\">made it clear</a> that she is \u201cpro-2nd Amendment, pro-military, pro-wall, pro-Trump\u201d and \u201cstrongly pro-life.\u201d</p> <p>Loeffler <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/blog/politics/the-jolt-atlanta-dream-owner-kelly-loeffler-saddened-politicized-sports/I1qXA7xZ1ydBFo3hX9ztEL/\">has said</a> she is \u201csaddened\u201d by the \u201cpoliticization\u201d of sports. This puts her at-odds with not only most of the players, but the league itself. It\u2019s not uncommon for professional sports teams to be owned by wealthy white people with views that contrast greatly with those of their players \u2013 just <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/05/25/nfl-owners-white-kaepernick-protest-rule/\">look at the NFL</a>. What makes this feel different is that, in the case of the WNBA, it has rebranded itself in recent years to be more explicitly progressive as a league.</p> <p>It\u2019s more than just individual players speaking out \u2013 though that happens, too. <a href=\"https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/wnba-players-on-the-frontlines\">Entire WNBA teams</a> took a knee to protest racial injustice and <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/punished-by-the-league-for-black-lives-matter-activism-wnba-players-fight-back-11abb0006d33/\">held media blackouts</a> where they only talked about police violence against black people; last year, superstar players like Breanna Stewart and Elena Delle Donne spoke out publicly <a href=\"https://archive.thinkprogress.org/wnba-players-speak-out-reproductive-rights-a359dcd1584f/\">against the heartbeat bills</a> that were sweeping the nation. A large number of players <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dc-sports-bog/wp/2016/05/13/the-wnba-is-so-progressive-that-a-player-came-out-as-gay-and-no-one-even-blinked/\">are openly gay</a> and support LGBTQ causes.</p> <p>But 2018 saw an intentional pivot on the part of the league to be more reflective of the players on the court and the fans, who tend to skew more progressive. The league announced a <a href=\"https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/wnba-take-a-seat-take-a-stand-initiative\">\u201cTake A Seat, Take A Stand\u201d initiative</a> that supported six different organizations, which included one that supports LGBTQ youth and Planned Parenthood. The league\u2019s commissioner, Cathy Engelbert was proud to support the players as they announced their new collective bargaining agreement this off-season \u2013 which boasted some of the <a href=\"https://www.instyle.com/news/wnba-cba-salary-increase-maternity-leave-benefits\">most progressive family planning benefits</a> in the nation.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s sad to see her so openly display things that counteract the very core and mission of the WNBA,\u201d a former Dream player <a href=\"https://www.powerplays.news/p/we-need-to-talk-about-kelly-loeffler\">told Power Plays</a>. \u201cBut hey, does the person who funds the show\u2019s ideals permeate throughout? Can she believe in both?\u201d</p> <p>Most players did not want to comment for this story, which is generally not the case when reporting on political topics and the WNBA. \u201cIt\u2019s not my place to talk about something I know nothing about,\u201d one Dream player said via Instagram DM. Angel McCoughtry, who was with the Dream for 10 years before being traded to the Las Vegas Aces this off-season, initially put out a statement to the Guardian and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/angel_35/status/1245744329366425606\">then on social media</a> saying, \u201cI will never judge a person on their political views \u2026 we get so caught up on what\u2019s going wrong. But I remember the million things Kelly has done right.\u201d After pushback, McCoughtry then backtracked, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/angel_35/status/1245876189719396352\">tweeting</a> that she is \u201cobviously not an expert on federal securities laws\u201d and she \u201cwasn\u2019t trying to weigh in on that aspect of Kelly\u2019s life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe has been a tremendous supporter of the WNBA and the Atlanta Dream,\u201d McCoughtry said of Loeffler, \u201cand helped inspire young women in this city throughout her involvement with the team.\u201d</p> <p>But that\u2019s the sticking point right there. Loeffler may have helped inspire young women, but she is also supporting policies and a government that actively harms those women, particularly young black girls. Girls who look a lot like the majority of the players in the WNBA. Now, though, the WNBA\u2019s Loeffler problem is not just that her views as a politician contrast so greatly with the ones espoused by the league and its players. Now it has to grapple with the reality and optics of the owner of one of its teams potentially using an impending pandemic and the inside information she was granted as a result of her government position to line her pockets.</p> <p>\u201cThe Atlanta Dream is not a political entity, and we are in the business of sports and entertainment,\u201d a spokesperson for the Dream said in a statement. \u201cWe are focused on building a successful team on the court and creating a top fan experience.\u201d</p> <p>But that fan experience could be put into jeopardy by Loeffler\u2019s alleged behavior. \u201cI\u2019m a relatively new WNBA fan and was already wary of supporting a team owned by Loeffler,\u201d said Dream fan Janee Ronca, who added that the accusations concerning stock trading against Loeffler made her particularly uncomfortable.</p> <p>Another fan echoed these sentiments, telling Power Plays that \u201cthe Atlanta Dream won\u2019t get a dollar from me moving forward unless Loeffler were to part with her stake in the organization.\u201d For a league that has struggled with ticket sales and fan attendance but is finally on an upswing, a controversy like this is the last thing it needs.</p> <p>Loeffler herself may have expressed sadness at the fact that sports are political, but whether she wants to admit it or not, she\u2019s contributed to exactly that. As a politician who owns a sports team, her political views and the actions she takes as a US Senator now reflect on the basketball team she owns. It\u2019s going to be up to the league how they handle it, and they should decide sooner rather than later. Because for as long as Loeffler remains both a politician and the owner of a WNBA team, it will be impossible to separate the two things. And ultimately, the only thing it hurts are the players, who didn\u2019t ask for any of this.</p> <p>\u2022 Cathy Engelbert and the WNBA did not return requests for comment for this story.</p> <p><br></p>",

It\u2019s a really good skill because you can get all your clothes to fit you perfectly.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Hanging pictures</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29630b335a71ceba2c8e4cf7a229bc0c07316c1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29630b335a71ceba2c8e4cf7a229bc0c07316c1e/0_0_5304_3182/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Couple hanging a picture together\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All you need for smaller, lighter pictures is a hammer and a nail.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hinterhaus Productions/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a basic skill, requiring only the most basic tools. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a hammer and a nail, it will be enough,\u201d says Jay Blades, a furniture restorer and the presenter of the hit BBC series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/26/the-repair-shop-we-can-fix-anything-but-a-broken-heart-and-brexit\">The Repair Shop</a>. \u201cHammer a nail into the wall, being mindful that there are no wires around. And you should only be going through the plaster. You don\u2019t need to hammer the nail all the way through to your next-door neighbour.\u201d This should be sufficient for smaller pictures, he says, \u201cas long as it\u2019s not a Picasso that weighs quite a lot\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Affixing other things</strong></h2> <p>If you want to stick anything heavier to the wall \u2013 a shelf, a towel rail, a Picasso \u2013 you will need a drill, screws and some kind of fixing plug. Jo Behari, one of the authors of Beginner\u2019s Guide to DIY &amp; Home Repair, says you first need to determine what kind of wall you are dealing with \u2013 a stud wall or a solid wall.</p> <p>\u201cStud walls are just partition walls that cut off rooms,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you knock on them they\u2019re really hollow sounding \u2013 they\u2019re made of wood and plasterboard. You don\u2019t want to hang anything really heavy on those.\u201d To put up a flat-screen TV or a big mirror, you need a solid wall made of brick, plus a masonry drill bit.</p> <p>\u201cA masonry bit has a wide spiral and a little arrow at the tip, which is made of tungsten carbide,\u201d she says. A wood bit, preferable for stud walls, has a sharply pointed tip. Once you\u2019ve drilled your hole, tap in a suitable plug with a hammer. Stud walls require butterfly fixings that \u201cpoke through the hole and grab at the back of the wall\u201d. Brick walls take a more bullet-shaped plug.</p> <h2><strong>Resealing your bath</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bea6a335aa617b170c7883c897a19e83c88e2569\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bea6a335aa617b170c7883c897a19e83c88e2569/0_0_3872_2592/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Resealing a bath\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Resealing your bath is easier than it sounds \u2013 but be sure to practise using the cartridge gun on a piece of card.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MyrKu/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Behari makes this sound easy. \u201cTo remove the old sealant you just need a Stanley knife,\u201d she says. Slice through the top and bottom edges of the seal at one end. \u201cThen you dig a little bit out and just start to pull, and it will all come out quite nicely.\u201d Remove any extra old sealant with a scraper and clean down with white spirit.</p> <p>\u201cBefore resealing, fill your bath up with water, because then it\u2019s at its heaviest point.\u201d That way the gap between tub and tile is at its widest. If you have never applied sealant with a cartridge gun, Behari recommends practising on a bit of cardboard, until you get the hang of it.</p> <p>\u201cTry to keep a consistent run all round the bathtub. To smooth it off, you can use a bit of washing-up liquid on your finger or water and a teaspoon. It will dry within 24 hours. You can\u2019t wash for that period of time, but, you know, who\u2019s washing these days?\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Bookshelves</strong></h2> <p>Makeshift shelves can be produced with no tools, from scrap wood. \u201cYou can probably still find random bits of wood on your state-sanctioned walk,\u201d says Berry. \u201cBits of wood and bricks make a lovely, sort-of-temporary bookshelf. At a pinch, you could use books for the uprights.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>A dripping tap</strong></h2> <p>First: shut off the water. If you do nothing else during lockdown, Behari strongly recommends you locate your stopcock and make sure it is operable. \u201cIt\u2019s normally under the kitchen sink, or in the hallway, or in a cellar.\u201d</p> <p>Another vital tip: put the plug in the sink or the bath before you start, so that if you drop anything small it doesn\u2019t disappear down the drain.</p> <p>A dripping tap probably needs a new rubber washer. More modern taps have ceramic washers, which don\u2019t tend to fail. \u201cTo work out if it is the washer,\u201d says Blades, \u201ctake apart another tap that\u2019s not dripping and swap the washers over.\u201d</p> <p>How do you get at the washer in the first place? \u201cThere will be a way to access the screw that allows you to take apart the tap,\u201d says Behari. \u201cIt might be under the little caps that say hot and cold, they might lever off, or there might be a tiny little hex screw at the back of the tap which you can undo.\u201d Seek out a YouTube demonstration of the repair for your specific type of tap.</p> <p>No matter what, you will need to secure a new washer, but this is not impossible. \u201cYou can actually still get stuff delivered.\u201d says Behari. A pack of washers of mixed sizes can be had for as little as a quid online.</p> <h2><strong>Cracks or holes in walls or furniture</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s best to fill cracks that are going to move \u2013 doorways, windows, those kind of areas \u2013 with something called caulk,\u201d says Behari. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit more flexible.\u201d Otherwise, ordinary filler \u2013 powdered or pre-mixed \u2013 will do, but if it is a deep crack you need to apply the filler in thin layers, so the stuff at the back gets a chance to dry.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For a really big hole, scrunch up bits of newspaper and fill it, so the filler has something to grab on to</p> <footer> <cite>Jo Behari</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For a really big hole in a wall, there is another solution. \u201cThis sounds like a massive bodge, but it\u2019s not,\u201d says Behari. \u201cScrunch up bits of newspaper and fill the hole, so the filler has something to grab on to. And always fill your hole slightly proud of the surface so you can sand away the excess.\u201d</p> <p>If you have got a crack in a wooden surface and nothing to hand, you can make your own filler. \u201cIf you saw a piece of wood, you then create some sawdust,\u201d says Blades. \u201cYou can put that sawdust into the crack, mix it up with some glue on top, and then that will create your kind of wood filler. You can sand it back, you can even stain it, because it\u2019s basically wood shavings with glue.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>A blocked drain</strong></h2> <p>\u201cReally simple \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t even need any tools,\u201d says Behari. \u201cIt\u2019s just a case of putting bicarbonate of soda down the drain, flushing it through with vinegar. That really clears all the blockages out of your kitchen sink. That\u2019s a really simple thing that people should be doing on a regular basis, but probably aren\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>If your shower drain is blocked, however, it\u2019s probably hair, according to Blades. \u201cWhat I do is take the drain cover off and pull out whatever\u2019s in there with a metal hanger \u2013 unravel it obviously. Hair being hair, if you twist it around it will latch on to it normally \u2013 nine times out of 10.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>A stuck door</strong></h2> <p>A door that catches in its frame could have loose hinges, so check that. If the screws are loose and refuse to tighten, Behari and Blades offer the same solution: plugging the screw hole with matchsticks. \u201cStuff as many as you possible can in there,\u201d says Blades, \u201cthen cut them off so the hole is flush, and when you screw your screw back in that will be unbelievably tight.\u201d</p> <p>If the door is still catching against the frame or the carpet below, then you\u2019ve got to check where it makes contact, and mark it with chalk. After that, there is only one solution: \u201c This is good exercise for your triceps,\u201d says Blades. \u201cIt\u2019s rubbing down with coarse sandpaper.\u201d And don\u2019t stop when your sandpaper becomes clogged with dust and you haven\u2019t got any more. \u201cI hoover my sandpaper,\u201d says Blades. \u201cThen it becomes new sandpaper again. I haven\u2019t bought sandpaper in years.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Tackling draughts</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ea10b4766bc19e2df43017f8b4b22a98b5cf2cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ea10b4766bc19e2df43017f8b4b22a98b5cf2cc/0_0_2681_2825/949..jpg\" alt=\"Sian Berry\u2019s sausage dog draught excluder\" width=\"949\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Si\u00e2n Berry\u2019s sausage dog draught excluder.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Si\u00e2n Berry</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Repairing or rehanging a draughty door may be beyond the skills of a DIY initiate, but making a patchwork draught excluder isn\u2019t, according to Berry. She favours a dog design (hers is pictured). \u201cYou can do a snake,\u201d she says. \u201cSnakes are easier. But the dog\u2019s face is just one of the nicest things; you just start filling it with old socks or tights, or whatever you\u2019re using, and it gains a personality immediately.\u201d</p> <p>To make the snake excluder, you will need a piece of fabric 40cm wide and 5cm longer than the width of your door. \u201cFold the material over inside-out, sew the long edge together into a tube and close off one end of the tube,\u201d says Berry. \u201cThen turn it inside-out again so the hem is inside and the best side of the fabric is facing out.</p> <p>\u201cUse the leg of an old pair of tights as the inner lining and fill with stuffing. You can use rice, lentils, sand or similar \u2013 just make sure you sew it up tightly, so no bits can escape. Then drop the stuffed tights into your material tube.\u201d After that, you can sew up the mouth end, including a red ribbon for a tongue, and add buttons for eyes.</p>",
  "<p>In 2011, when the pain of the 2008 economic crisis was still being acutely felt, grassroots activists began fighting for debt abolition. Since then, we have consistently been told by public officials from both parties that our demands were unrealistic and impractical, but we\u2019ve kept organizing.</p> <p>Coronavirus has changed the calculus. With a global pandemic and economic depression looming, the case for cancelling debt, especially student debt, has taken on a new urgency. The economy is entering freefall and millions are unable to pay their bills. With a fourth stimulus package on the horizon, now is the time for debtors to get organized and fight for what\u2019s right \u2013 full student loan abolition.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/28/us-debt-collection-wage-garnishment-coronavirus\">'I have no money': debt collection continues despite pandemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Overnight the Democratic party has undergone a tectonic shift in regards to debt relief. The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, has paused all medical and student debt owed to the state. The other week, representatives Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley introduced a coronavirus-timed piece of legislation <a href=\"https://www.theroot.com/reps-ilhan-omar-and-ayanna-pressley-propose-massive-st-1842458123\">that would forgive at least $30,000</a> of student debt per borrower. Similarly, Democrats in the House and Senate, led by Elizabeth Warren, pushed for a suspension of student loan payments and a $10,000 \u201cpayoff\u201d for all federal student loan borrowers to be included in the stimulus package, but were blocked by the opposition.</p> <p>Yet even Republicans, who just used a public health crisis to pull off a <a href=\"https://prospect.org/coronavirus/unsanitized-bailouts-tradition-unlike-any-other/\">staggering corporate cash grab</a>, have been forced to give some ground. The Department of Education announced that most student loan borrowers will be able to suspend payments for <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahmimms/coronavirus-bill-ends-student-loan-payments-interest-6\">six months</a> without accruing interest and they are also halting collection on defaulted federal student loans <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/exclusive-devos-halts-collection-of-defaulted-federal-student-loans-146929\">\u201cuntil further notice</a><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/exclusive-devos-halts-collection-of-defaulted-federal-student-loans-146929\">\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Around the world, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51814481\">mortgage and bill collections are being paused</a>, utility shutoffs for overdue accounts are being prevented, and foreclosures and evictions halted. It turns out that changing the rules that dictate our daily financial agreements <em>is</em> possible after all, and can happen with remarkable speed. The challenge moving forward is ensuring that some of these changes stick. This crisis offers a chance to not just hit the pause button and offer temporary relief for those who are in distress, but to permanently change the rules so that untold millions of people aren\u2019t so vulnerable to begin with.</p> <p>Completely eliminating student debt would be a good place to start. All federal student debt can be erased in an instant using authority Congress has already vested in the Department of Education. But it will take a movement to push public officials to actually do it.</p> <p>We can\u2019t repeat the mistakes of 2008, when the bank bailout program left the financial sector stronger than ever while millions of families lost their homes and jobs. This time around we need a <a href=\"https://thepeoplesbailout.org/\">\u201c</a><a href=\"https://thepeoplesbailout.org/\">people\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://thepeoplesbailout.org/\">bailout\u201d</a> that includes a far-reaching program of debt cancellation to help those who are not just physically vulnerable but financially precarious better weather the coming storm.</p> <p>The fact that Joe Biden is currently the Democratic frontrunner only underscores the need for grassroots pressure. Unlike Bernie Sanders, who made student and medical debt cancellation a core part of presidential candidacy long before the coronavirus hit, Biden is no friend of debtors \u2013 unsurprising for a politician from Delaware, the credit card capital of the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05d11b63b7d44a9a336eda0830711051f2638f9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05d11b63b7d44a9a336eda0830711051f2638f9c/0_15_6240_3744/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A person walks down Wall Street in New York.

With a pandemic under way and a depression looming, the case for cancelling debt has taken on a new urgency.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Don\u2019t forget that the famous chant that rang out at Occupy Wall Street \u2013 \u201cbanks got bailed out, we got sold out\u201d \u2013 was a rejoinder to the fact the Obama-Biden administration left millions of homeowners in the lurch, with black families hit hardest of all. We can\u2019t afford to let our leaders make the same mistakes again.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s track record on student debt offers another indication that he is ill-equipped to meet the moment. Consider, for example, the fact that Obama blocked tens of thousands of defrauded for-profit college borrowers who were legally entitled to relief, leaving them at the mercy of Trump\u2019s secretary of education, Betsy DeVos. They also ignored the activists who pleaded with them to stop social security garnishment on the growing number of senior citizens in default on their student loans.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s higher education platform is a hodge-podge of measures including increased grant funding, some adjustments to income-based repayments and public service loan forgiveness, and to allow those with private student debt to discharge their debt in bankruptcy\u2013in other words, undoing the very 2005 bill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/02/joe-biden-student-loan-debt-2005-act-2020\">he fought long and hard to pass</a>. Since then the nation\u2019s total student loan burden has spiked from approximately $500m to over $1.7tn. Recently, in an attempt to appeal to younger voters, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1239280175826731010?s=20\">Biden has boasted</a> about having adopted aspects of Sanders\u2019 higher education plan, but his proposals still pale in comparison to those of the senator from Vermont.</p> <p>Even under normal circumstances, Biden\u2019s half-measures would be inadequate. But at a time when the economy is going haywire and life is about to get much more difficult for poor and working people, they are unconscionable.</p> <p>Just as they did after 2008, working people need and are entitled to assistance \u2013 including, but not limited to, student debt relief. Public officials should cancel all student debt immediately. Every cancelled payment would turn into cash used to purchase things like rent and food instead. Research shows that eliminating all student debt could <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/27/opinions/cancel-college-debt-smarter-richer-taylor/index.html\">potentially boost GDP</a> by an estimated $108bn a year for 10 years. That\u2019s one reason calls to pause collection or fiddle with interest aren\u2019t enough. Everyone will <a href=\"https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/2020/03/factsheet-cancel-federal-student-loans-to-provide-short-and-long-term-stimulus-amid-pandemic/\">benefit from the economic stimulus</a> provided by a full jubilee, not only the approximately 45 million borrowers who would see their balances disappear. Now that\u2019s a bailout regular people can get behind.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The vast majority of Americans should demand debt relief as an essential part of a sane response to the coming downturn</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Unfortunately, most politicians rarely do the right thing of their own accord. That\u2019s why <a href=\"http://www.debtcollective.org/\">the Debt Collective</a>, a union for debtors I helped found, has launched a <a href=\"https://strike.debtcollective.org/\">scaled-up student debt strike</a> to push for a full jubilee. Over half of all student debtors are already not paying their loans in one form or another (because they already defaulted, are in forbearance or deferral, or because their income level lets them lower their payments to $0 a month) and many more will be unable to pay next month. Instead of struggling alone and being ashamed, debtors need to come out of the shadows and declare themselves on strike.</p> <p>Corporate interests are well organized and have secured trillions of dollars of no-strings-attached public money for their efforts. The vast majority of Americans are indebted, and they should make their voices heard, demanding debt relief as an essential part of a sane and just response to the coming downturn.</p> <p>We must recognize that the coronavirus outbreak is a dual crisis. It is a biological and medical emergency that exposes a deeper political and economic disaster. For millions of Americans, life was difficult even before the disease hit and now things are untenable. With jobs and income lost people will take on more debt, and huge numbers will spiral into default.</p> <p>Ultimately, we need way more than debt write-downs or even debt abolition to heal what ails us. We need to rewrite the rules of the economy so that people don\u2019t have to live in perpetual financial peril. The vast majority of working people are not indebted because they live beyond their means, but because they are denied the means to live. The case for things such as paid sick leave, universal healthcare, guaranteed housing, a public banking system, cross border-cooperation and debt abolition has never been stronger.</p> <p>These days, the words \u201ccrisis\u201d and \u201capocalyptic\u201d couldn\u2019t be more apt. The first term comes from the ancient Greek and means the turning point in an illness \u2013 death or recovery, two stark alternatives. The root of \u201capocalypse\u201d means to reveal or uncover. This is the truth this apocalyptic moment unveils: to truly cure ourselves and survive this crisis we are going to need way more than a vaccine. We need to think big and completely transform our economy from the ground up, prioritizing public welfare and ecological stability over private profit, before the next big disaster hits.</p> <ul> <li><p>Astra Taylor is the author of Democracy May Not Exist, but We\u2019ll Miss It When It\u2019s Gone, an organizer with the Debt Collective, and the Puffin Foundation/Economic Hardship Reporting Project fellow</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>As a professional film-maker and lifetime movie buff, I have quite a collection of films, so in times of distress, my wife and I turn to the classics \u2013 our cinematic equivalent of comfort food.

  "<p> Joe Biden was not their <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/entrance-and-exit-polls/california/democratic\">first choice.</a> In some cases, he wasn\u2019t even their <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/state/nevada\">second</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/state/iowa\">third</a>. Now, as the all-but-certain nominee, Biden is aggressively courting a critical constituency of younger and leftwing Democrats who have so far rejected his presidential bid.</p> <p>Last month, Biden stitched together a wide range of support from African Americans, suburbanites and working-class white voters to rack up wins across the country and amass an almost indomitable lead over his rival, democratic socialist senator Bernie Sanders. Yet missing from that coalition is the young and more liberal voters who overwhelmingly prefer Sanders\u2019 call for political revolution to Biden\u2019s promise of a return to \u201cnormalcy\u201d.</p> <p>Determined not to repeat the mistakes of 2016, when the party struggled to unify after a divisive primary battle that stretched into the summer convention, Biden is now amplifying his appeals to the party\u2019s left.</p> <p>According to campaign officials, his team has for weeks quietly engaged top progressive organizations and movement leaders representing a range of Democratic causes from climate change to racial justice. The effort, spearheaded by senior Biden advisers, includes outreach to legacy organizations such as Planned Parenthood as well as newer, youth-led groups like the Sunrise Movement.</p> <p>Biden has also made overt gestures. He recently adopted a plan by his former rival, Elizabeth Warren, to overhaul the consumer bankruptcy system and embraced elements of Sanders\u2019 tuition-free college proposal.</p> <p>\u201cLet me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by senator Sanders: I hear you,\u201d Biden said after sweeping three major primary contests last month. \u201cI know what is at stake. And I know what we have to do.\u201d</p> <p>There is a delicacy around the engagement, especially with Sanders still claiming his campaign has a \u201cnarrow path\u201d to the nomination despite calls to bow out of the race. The left came tantalizing close to nominating a presidential candidate they hold up as a progressive champion only to watch in dismay as Biden, who is unquestionably more moderate, all-but vanquished those hopes, and with startling speed.</p> <p>There is a mutual understanding that the party must unify to defeat Donald Trump in November. But progressives also believe they have built sufficient leverage to press for sweeping policy concessions from Biden, particularly given the potentially worrisome <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-consolidates-support-trails-badly-enthusiasm-poll/story?id=69812092\">lack of enthusiasm</a> for his candidacy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ddfa99eed81e26204158c3c340e4fa2f16f1c60a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddfa99eed81e26204158c3c340e4fa2f16f1c60a/0_36_2918_1751/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Democratic US presidential candidates Senator Bernie Sanders and former vice-president Joe Biden at the 11th Democratic candidates debate in Washington on 15 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Democratic US presidential candidates Senator Bernie Sanders and former vice-president Joe Biden at the 11th Democratic candidates debate in Washington on 15 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cJoe Biden, as the moderate frontrunner, has to convince progressives to support him,\u201d said Julian Brave NoiseCat, who directs Green New Deal strategy at the progressive think tank Data for Progress. \u201cHe needs more enthusiasm behind his campaign, and it\u2019s been a bruising campaign cycle.\u201d</p> <p>In interviews with progressive organizers, climate change has emerged as a key area where activists believe they can \u201cpush\u201d the former vice-president, in part because combatting global warming draws broad support from every corner of the party. Several <a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2020/02/13/as-economic-concerns-recede-environmental-protection-rises-on-the-publics-policy-agenda/\">polls</a> this cycle have found that Democratic voters rank climate change among their top three issues, often second only to healthcare.</p> <p>Data for Progress, along with climate staff from Washington governor Jay Inslee\u2019s former presidential campaign, are among those urging the Biden team to prioritize climate change.</p> <p>In a recent six-page memo, the group laid out five policy areas where he could issue new proposals or emphasize existing ones. They are: stronger clean energy standards with clearer targets, investments in green infrastructure, a dedicated 40% of climate money going to disadvantaged communities, restrictions on Wall Street financing of fossil fuels and a commitment to high-quality union jobs. NoiseCat said the Biden campaign is engaging the authors at a high level.</p> <p>Some progressives believe Biden, who spent decades in the Senate before serving as vice president, would have a better shot at moving climate legislation through Congress because of his longstanding relationships and pragmatic approach. Biden also has strong ties to labor unions that are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/5/22/18628299/green-new-deal-labor-union-2020-democrats\">skeptical</a> of ambitious proposals to tackle climate change.</p> <p>Already Biden has suggested Democrats should push for \u201cGreen Deal\u201d spending in the next aid package responding to the economic downturn spurred by the coronavirus pandemic. Though he is unlikely to endorse policies to significantly curb drilling for oil and natural gas \u2013 like a fracking ban \u2013 which could alienate supporters in swing states like Pennsylvania.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more that can be done to have the full-scale mobilization of the federal government that is needed to defeat climate change,\u201d said Jamal Raad, former aide to Inslee\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s the task at hand here for the next president.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b079b23e74cfb602451d78bb9601d9ebba060775\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b079b23e74cfb602451d78bb9601d9ebba060775/0_0_4392_2928/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Biden speaks during a campaign rally at Renaissance High School in Detroit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Biden speaks during a campaign rally at Renaissance High School in Detroit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Progressive activists say their overriding priority in 2020 is to defeat Trump. But they warn that antipathy for the president is not enough to win in November. And how Biden engages the left and what concessions he is willing to make could determine the nature of their electoral efforts on his behalf.</p> <p>\u201cWill enough people be willing to volunteer for the nominee? Or send text messages for the nominee? Or overcome the barriers of voter suppression that we know are coming to vote for the nominee,\u201d said Jennifer Epps-Addison, the network director at the Center for Popular Democracy, which endorsed Sanders. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s at stake.\u201d</p> <p>Epps-Addison echoed many Democratic activists in urging Biden to put a progressive standard-bearer on the ticket with him. Biden has said he would choose a woman as his running mate, an overture to Democrats deeply disappointed that two white men in their 70s emerged from a historically diverse and female presidential field.</p> <p>Both Democratic contenders have vowed to actively support whoever becomes the party\u2019s nominee.</p> <p>Yet Biden, confined to his home in Delaware amid the coronavirus outbreak, has so far struggled to re-create the grassroots excitement that has powered Sanders\u2019 presidential bid, with packed rallies and an endless stream of small-dollar donations. Meanwhile, Sanders has continued to criticize his opponent\u2019s record.</p> <p>Asked during the last Democratic debate how he might appeal to Sanders\u2019 supporters if he became the nominee, Biden quipped: \u201cHe\u2019s making it hard for me right now.\u201d</p> <p>Though Sanders\u2019 chances of clinching the nomination have faded, the progressive proposals he championed on healthcare, climate change and student debt remain widely popular among Democratic voters \u2013 a point the senator has made explicitly as he defends his continued presence in the primary race. His ideas, the senator has asserted, are winning the \u201cideological\u201d and \u201cgenerational\u201d debate\u201d \u2013 even if he is not.</p> <p>Biden may be the eventual nominee, said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which endorsed Warren, but \u201ctens of millions of people who supported Warren and Sanders nonetheless wanted a president who advocated for bold, progressive policy ideas.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b2f597d7003396166e97b1512b3bf3da1527dbbb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2f597d7003396166e97b1512b3bf3da1527dbbb/0_0_6192_4128/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden addresses the media and a small group of supporters with his wife Dr Jill Biden during a primary night event on 10 March in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden addresses the media and a small group of supporters with his wife Dr Jill Biden during a primary night event on 10 March in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Makela/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alexis Confer, executive director of March For Our Lives, which was founded by survivors of the Parkland high school shooting in Florida, said the best way for Biden to reach young voters is to address their priorities with a shared sense of urgency.</p> <p>\u201cWe see our daily work as fighting the largest epidemic in our country,\u201d Confer said, referring to the scourge of gun violence that <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/16/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/\">claims</a> more than 36,000 American lives each year. But they also view their activism as part of a wider movement for social, racial and economic justice, she added, emphasizing that \u201cpeople don\u2019t live single-issue lives.\u201d</p> <p>In discussions with Biden\u2019s team, March for Our Lives is advocating for a 10-day waiting period on all firearm purchases, a federal gun licensing program and the creation of an administration role dedicated to combating gun violence.</p> <p>Pro-choice organizations are also eager to see Biden elevate his support for reproductive rights, especially in light of <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-04-02/red-states-block-abortion-coronavirus-outbreak\">efforts</a> in conservative states to restrict abortions during the pandemic.<br><br>Early in the primary season, Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/06/abortion-joe-biden-hyde-amendment\">abandoned</a> his support for the Hyde Amendment, which bans the use of federal funds for abortion with some exceptions. But he has a shifting voting record on the issue and some advocates have called on him to release a standalone plan outlining his commitment to defending reproductive rights.<br><br>\u201cVoters need to know that addressing this crisis is top of mind for our next president and that our nominee understands that reproductive freedom is fundamental to achieving meaningful equity in society,\u201d NARAL President Ilyse Hogue said in a statement.</p> <p>Immigration is a particularly thorny issue for Biden. Throughout the primary season, he has faced fierce criticism from immigration activists over the Obama administration\u2019s deportation policy, which resulted in the removal of roughly three million people. At campaign events and even during Democratic debates, Biden was met with protests and interruptions from activists shouting: \u201cNot one more deportation.\u201d</p> <p>Cristina Jim\u00e9nez, executive director of United We Dream Action, a youth-led immigrant rights network, said Biden has work to do to \u201cbridge the trust gap\u201d with Latino voters, a powerful Democratic constituency that tends to be younger. In the primary, many of these voters flocked to Sanders, who proposed a sweeping overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration system.</p> <p>Her group, which jointly endorsed Sanders and Warren, expects to meet with Biden\u2019s team in the coming weeks. In those discussions, they intend to press him to commit to using executive authority to expand programs like Daca, which shields certain immigrants from deportation and to repeal a 1996 law that increased penalties for crossing the border illegally.</p> <p>Biden has acknowledged the \u201cincredible pain\u201d caused by deportation and recently pledged to halt nearly all removals in the first 100 days of his administration, a move activists believes is a testament to their advocacy.</p> <p>Still, many progressives remain skeptical.</p> <p>\u201cRight now it still feels like more of the same,\u201d said Erika Andiola, chief advocacy officer at the immigration services organization Raices Action and a former staffer on Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have to keep pushing him.\u201d</p> <p>In a virtual fundraiser on Friday, Biden was optimistic that he could find common ground with the Democrats most leery of his campaign in time to bring the party together in November.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good ideas they have \u2013 I disagree with many of them,\u201d Biden said. But he continued: \u201cThere\u2019s lot of significant change that can take place \u2013 both structurally and practically \u2013 that can bring everybody along.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Four days ago, Boris Johnson was heralding a ramp-up of testing as \u201cthe way through the coronavirus puzzle\u201d. His health secretary, Matt Hancock, was even floating the idea of immunity passports for people who could be confirmed as having recovered from the virus, so that they could return to work.</p> <p>But on Monday the government\u2019s message was very different, following multiple reports that antibody tests were showing poor reliability. One government adviser, Prof Sir John Bell of Oxford University, said testing was <a href=\"https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/uk-news/2020/04/06/covid-19-antibody-test-at-least-a-month-away/\">at least a month away</a>.</p> <p>Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, said it was too early yet to be talking about an exit strategy from the lockdown. Even discussing ways out could \u201cconfuse the messaging\u201d about the importance of sticking to physical distancing rules, he added.</p> <p>While ministers and their advisers might not want to discuss exit strategies openly, the Guardian here explores four options. </p> <h2><strong>Mass testing and contact tracing</strong></h2> <p>When coronavirus first reached Britain, each suspected case was tracked down and tested. Those found positive self-isolated while their recent contacts were traced and asked to do the same. The strategy was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-moves-to-delay-phase-of-coronavirus-plan\">abandoned in early March</a> when the government changed tack from containing to delaying the outbreak. The move unleashed a wave of criticism. The World Health Organization has stressed throughout that testing, contact tracing and quarantine are vital steps towards bringing the pandemic under control. \u201cWe have got to be able to show that we can go after the virus, because lockdowns alone will not work,\u201d Dr Michael Ryan, the WHO\u2019s director of emergencies, said last week.</p> <p>Hancock has talked of scaling up tests to 100,000 a day, but there has been no official commitment to contact tracing. Despite this, both are more than likely to feature in the exit strategy. Prof Neil Ferguson, whose outbreak modelling team at Imperial College London is advising the government, said this weekend that if the lockdown sufficiently reduced new cases then mass testing and contact tracing would \u201calmost certainly\u201d be introduced to try to keep a lid on the pandemic.</p> <p>The strategy has its challenges. The UK is desperately building up its testing capacity but the expansion needed is unprecedented and other countries are competing for the same equipment and chemicals. Contact tracing is labour intensive, and scientists have called on Public Health England to recruit a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/recruit-volunteer-army-to-trace-coronavirus-contacts-now-urge-top-scientists\">volunteer army</a> to help identify potential cases. One hope is that an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/31/nhs-developing-app-to-trace-close-contacts-of-coronavirus-carriers\">NHS contact tracing app</a> can help by sending alerts to users who come into contact with infected people. But the app has already raised privacy concerns: to be effective it would require about 40 million people in the UK to sign up and share their health and location data.</p> <h2><strong>Herd immunity and cocooning the vulnerable</strong></h2> <p>In the absence of a treatment or protective vaccine, the UK\u2019s initial approach to weathering the outbreak was to keep the most vulnerable people \u201ccocooned\u201d while managing the spread of infections in the rest of the population. This would build the kind of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-uk-expert-advice-wrong\">herd immunity</a>\u201d that is normally created through vaccination. If more than 60% of the population developed immunity, the outbreak could be brought under control.</p> <p>One of the problems with the strategy is that no one knows who is vulnerable. As the deaths of doctors, nurses and young children have shown, it is not only older people or those with underlying conditions who fail to recover from the virus. This means acquiring herd immunity by letting the virus sweep through puts a staggering number of lives at risk.</p> <p>With the lockdown and physical distancing in place, the number of new infections should steadily fall, and unless millions of infections have gone undetected, herd immunity is unlikely to develop in the current outbreak. According to Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University, one way out of the lockdown is to beef up protection around those who are known to be at risk. With intense testing of NHS workers, care home staff and others, the most vulnerable could be better shielded from the infection, drastically cutting the number of people who end up in intensive care. \u201cThat is where testing could really help get us out of this,\u201d Woolhouse said.</p> <h2><strong>Alternating between tighter and looser lockdowns</strong></h2> <p>The lockdown and physical distancing are intended to spread the epidemic out so that hospitals do not face thousands of sick patients at once but rather a steadier stream over time. This \u201cflattening of the curve\u201d can save lives if intensive care units can treat and discharge the most seriously ill patients before new cases arrive. The Imperial College team that is modelling the outbreak found that the government may need to alternate between lockdown and looser rules, relaxing and then imposing the restrictions again if case numbers rebound as expected. This could potentially go on for months, depending on whether new antiviral drugs are found or a vaccine becomes available. \u201cThere is not going to be a cure for this, but if we can find a drug that works, and if we can give it to people early enough, you can stop them progressing to serious disease and needing a critical care bed,\u201d said Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia. </p> <h2><strong>Antibody tests and immunity passports</strong></h2> <p>The government has ordered 17.5m antibody home-testing kits, but none have yet proved reliable. Some senior scientists say the tests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/coronavirus-testing-kits-could-be-unreliable-uk-scientists-say\">may pick up only half</a> of those who have had the virus, in part because people with milder infections tend to have lower levels of antibodies in their blood. The poor performance appears to scupper hopes for using the tests soon to issue \u201cimmunity passports\u201d so that the immune can return to work \u2013 an idea under active consideration in the UK and Germany. Even if accurate tests can be obtained, they may not be the \u201cgame-changer\u201d that Johnson has claimed. No one knows whether antibodies in the blood mean full or only partial protection against the virus, nor how long any protection would last, making immunity passports a shaky reassurance.</p> <p>But while antibody tests might not be that useful for individuals, they could still be extremely valuable for tracking the outbreak and deciding on the best way to exit the lockdown, according to Prof Eleanor Riley, of Edinburgh University. \u201cIf antibody testing suggests that, say, 40 or 50% of the population has already been exposed, any relaxing of the social distancing rules is less likely to lead to a second wave of serious infections than if only 1% of the population has been exposed,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>Dismantling mass incarceration in the United States is not a question of possibility or costs, but a matter of imagination and will. Take the relationship between the criminal legal system and the Covid-19 outbreak. Families and activists have demanded the release of people currently detained in jails, prisons and immigrant detention facilities, and in some cases, they have won. New York has released 300 elders from Rikers Island \u2013 not enough, but a start. Massachusetts courts, under pressure from activists, are considering whether to release anyone. When California released an additional 3,100 people from prison, a media outlet was sure to note that Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s order included sentence commutations for \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-gov-newsom-commutes-sentences-21-including-killers-n1170976\">killers</a>\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/united-states-numbers-dead-unemployed-trump-smaller\">As the numbers of dead and unemployed grow, Trump looks and sounds smaller | Richard Wolffe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What changed? The easy answer is that Covid-19 became a pandemic. Globally, more than 1.2m people have contracted the virus and upwards of 70,000 have succumbed. In the United States, the figures are over 336,000 and 10,000, respectively. Suddenly, student loan deferments, suspended mortgages, calls against evictions, direct cash payments to families and releasing portions of the incarcerated population have all become not only politically possible, but desirable.</p> <p>But these political gains have already faced serious setbacks.</p> <p>First: despite the urgent need for cities and states to decrease their prison populations to protect inmates and staff from Covid-19, and despite the general inability of carceral facilities to offer adequate treatment and protection, the political winds have already shifted in a more regressive direction. Federal prisons are now requiring a <a href=\"https://www.wvnstv.com/top-stories/federal-prisons-to-require-inmates-to-quarantine-in-cells-for-2-weeks/\">two-week quarantine</a> instead of release.</p> <p>Second: the public battle against Covid-19 has had the effect of empowering another pillar of the prison industrial complex \u2013 policing. Thirty states have issued stay-at-home orders enforceable by law enforcement and stacked with fines, citations and even jail time. We cannot let the confusion of the crisis further entrench mass incarceration.</p> <p>Through the Arab spring, Occupy Wall Street, and the Ferguson uprising, a full generation of activists have used street protests and social media to resist state repression, violence and policing. Those options are now limited. Notwithstanding the pandemic, American police have still killed at least 57 people since 1 March. Last year, the police killed 253 during the first quarter; this year, it is 227, a difference of 26 people.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What would have happened if a Chicago officer had shot Laquan McDonald in the back, 16 times, while we were all under quarantine?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But so much is lost in the numbers. Television coverage is almost exclusively on the rapidly spreading Covid-19. Public approval of the police is increasing because the police are considered first responders to the pandemic. Police victims are most likely poor, people of color, or First Nations. Taken together, reporting on police violence, and the lives of their victims, would be unpopular. What would have happened if a Chicago officer had shot Laquan McDonald in the back, 16 times, while we were all under quarantine?</p> <p>We are at risk of police violence generally, and now specifically through this pandemic. In Los Angeles, police are reportedly stopping drivers to inquire about their destinations and issuing <a href=\"https://apnews.com/afs:Content:8700400221\">$400 citations</a>. Rhode Island\u2019s governor ordered state troopers to profile and stop cars <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-29/rhode-island-ends-policy-of-stopping-cars-with-new-york-plates\">with out-of-state license</a> plates. Maryland and Washington DC have issued enforcement orders that are punishable by arrest, a fine up to $1,000 and six months in jail. Even Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers are still conducting raids to destroy lives, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/ice-raids-coronavirus-n95-masks\">wearing N95 masks</a> that could be used to save lives.</p> <p>All these additional surveillance tools are added on top of broken windows policing, racial profiling and stop-and-frisks. If this path continues, people newly freed from jails could find themselves returning to the increasingly occupied communities from where they were arrested, only to be replaced by new waves of arrestees vulnerable to contracting Covid-19 in jail.</p> <p>State divestment from poor neighborhoods, black communities and immigrant circles inevitably means that these groups will be policed the most aggressively and suffer the worst burden of enforcement. \u201cStaying home\u201d \u2013 in overcrowded and sometimes dilapidated housing \u2013 is much easier <a href=\"https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/chicago-politics/lightfoot-shares-hilarious-psa-urging-people-to-stay-home-save-lives/2247859/\">s</a><a href=\"https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/chicago-politics/lightfoot-shares-hilarious-psa-urging-people-to-stay-home-save-lives/2247859/\">ung</a> in a PSA than practiced. Some states permit families to hike together for fresh air yet still outlaw families standing together outside as \u201cloitering\u201d. Near my neighborhood, the police monitor a group of black teenagers who stand at the traffic light with squeegees and window spray. I\u2019m used to chatting with the kids on weekends. Now, t-shirts and hoodies hug their faces. They nod and smile with their eyes for any pocket change to clean cars before the signal switches. I fear for their safety from the coronavirus. And also from the police.</p> <p>As I watch, I think: <em>this is dangerous. They should be inside. They should be learning. Where are their parents?</em> Then, I remember: the teenagers who have adequate safe space and food and activities and quality educational options would probably not be standing outside during a global pandemic for hours for one dollar in the first place.</p> <p>What should we do? How will we enforce social distancing without police? As activists, lawyers, organizers and artists build resources to show us the way, one important step is recognizing what police cannot do. Law enforcement cannot stop the coronavirus. They cannot even stop it among their own ranks. And because politicians refuse free and widely accessible testing and treatment, they risk the lives of police officers, their families and the rest of us by putting sick officers on the street. More than <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/01/more-than-1000-new-york-city-police-officers-are-infected-with-coronavirus.html\">1,000 officers</a> in the New York police department reportedly have coronavirus, as well as <a href=\"https://time.com/5812113/new-jersey-police-coronavirus/\">160 New Jersey</a> officers, and at least<a href=\"https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/almost-500-detroit-police-officers-quarantined-for-possible-coronavirus\"> 500 Detroit officers</a> have been quarantined for possible sickness and exposure.</p> <p>Another important step is to learn what communities are doing right now. Activist organizations are urging police to give warnings to people who violate coronavirus curfews, rather than coming into contact for arrests and citations. This effort would limit contact and decrease transmission between police and residents. Many people are joining or building <a href=\"https://itsgoingdown.org/c19-mutual-aid/\">mutual aid groups</a> to share resources so that people can limit their exposure to Covid-19.</p> <p>In all of this we must continue to fight for a more egalitarian society in the future. In a country with universal healthcare, perhaps people with regular access to quality care would have stronger immune systems to fight the virus. Workers would own the factories that produce our goods and would have better working conditions because they are vested in their own health. Artists would have a basic income and would not worry how to pay for rent or bills. Hotels would not sit empty while homeless people<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/las-vegas-parking-lot-homeless-shelter\"> sleep in concrete squares on parking lots</a> \u2013 we would have universal housing. Addictions, relapses and overdoses would subside because people are not stressed from economic and climate catastrophe. Property would be communal so that anyone, regardless of neighborhood, could have fresh air and sunlight. People would not be forced to stay in domestic violence relationships because their partner is the breadwinner or has health insurance. Families could rotate neighborhood garden visits for fresh food instead of hoarding groceries and tissue from their neighbors.</p> <p>Through strengthened social relationships, people would have less incentive to leave their homes, and we could solve problems without cages and guns.</p> <ul> <li><p>Derecka Purnell is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

Maison Modulare has sold out of their <a href=\"https://modulare.us/products/ivory-lace-mask\">French lace mask</a>, a more expensive item priced at $60. Los Angeles Apparel, the successor to American Apparel, is offering FACEMASK3, a three-pack of masks made of French Terry fabric, available in nine colors.</p> <p>\u201cI felt like this is what I\u2019d been training for,\u201d says Grisel Lopez, a <a href=\"https://www.papermag.com/possessed-covid-masks-2645574726.html\">designer for Possessed</a>, fetishwear line which produces neon-colored PVC masks that can be sanitized.</p> <p>\u201cThe government is not stepping up,\u201d adds MI Leggett, founder of Official Rebrand, which uses upcycled materials. \u201cMaking masks is something I had to do.\u201d</p> <p>Major brands such as <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-and-off-the-avenue/how-christian-siriano-turned-his-fashion-house-into-a-mask-factory\">Christian Siriano</a>, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2020-03-24/fashion-brands-face-masks-medical-surgical-gowns-coronavirus\">Zara, H&amp;M and Prada</a> are using their factories to produce necessities solely for medical staff. Some smaller companies have one-for-one initiatives: for each mask sold, they donate another to essential workers. After the CDC released its new guidelines, Naomi Mishkin, owner of Naomi Nomi, says she has received 5,000 orders for her cotton masks, meaning the same number will go to first responders. Like many indie designers, she has been able to re-open her factory and get her team back to work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"da38513f100aefb33a4340e1d964b0fd801bb62d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da38513f100aefb33a4340e1d964b0fd801bb62d/0_415_1529_1495/1000..jpg\" alt=\"One of the Maison Modulare masks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"978\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the Maison Modulare masks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maison Modulare</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFashion brands who have been able to pivot to making masks right now are crucial,\u201d says Marie Lodi. \u201cEveryone benefits: the brands who are losing money, the healthcare workers, and the civilians who are in need of masks.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, as is the case when any moral effort is commodified, some who are familiar with the fashion industry have concerns.</p> <p>\u201cAs the pandemic continues to spread, I anticipate that some high-end brands might charge higher prices [for masks] and capitalize on the fact that people are scared,\u201d says Gianluca Russo, a style reporter for Teen Vogue.</p> <p>There are also sustainability issues plaguing fast fashion manufacturers, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/18/fast-fashion-environmental-audit-committee-polluting-industry\">environmental harm</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jun/05/female-garment-workers-gap-hm-south-asia\">labor abuses</a>.

  "<p>Coronavirus isn\u2019t just a public health crisis, it\u2019s an economic one. However, the financial impact of the pandemic hasn\u2019t been evenly distributed. While a record <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economy\">6.65 million Americans filed for unemployment</a> last week, others are working from their homes. Others, from their vacation homes. Here, eight people from different walks of life tell us how the current crisis is (or isn\u2019t) affecting them financially.</p> <h2><strong>Mallory Foreman, 20, Oklahoma City, barber</strong></h2> <p>I recently started my career as a barber and we were all just laid off due to Covid-19 and told to file for unemployment. I live in a one-bedroom apartment with my boyfriend in Oklahoma City. He graduated in December and has been looking for a job since. Job postings have closed but luckily he just got hired at Target.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-jobs-work-staff-pandemic\">'I'm praying we'll be back to work:' what it's like to lose your job in a pandemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We\u2019re very worried about making rent, which is $620 a month and due on the third. The only thing my landlord has said is payments are due online. So we\u2019ve been doing Postmates and I\u2019ve been making and delivering pies, trying to make a little money. Postmates pays $6 or $7 a delivery; I\u2019ve made $130 selling pies so far. I don\u2019t have savings. I\u2019m honestly just going day by day hoping people buy pies and I don\u2019t have to beg my parents for money.</p> <h2><strong>Matt (name changed), 37, New York, lives off stock portfolio</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve got a background in fashion and hospitality, but for the past year and a half I\u2019ve been living off the returns of bond funds and equities. So, for example, in the beginning of January I got disbursements that yielded $45,000. And I get payouts like that every few months. Not always for that amount, but it\u2019s extremely livable.</p> <p>The current situation hasn\u2019t really made me more worried about money. But getting a statement from my financial advisers outlining my losses for February was not an easy pill to swallow. When the market tanked because of coronavirus the value of my investments decreased by nearly $100,000 in value. I almost cried. OK, that\u2019s a lie, I did cry.</p> <p>My spending habits haven\u2019t really changed. I mean, I\u2019m not dropping $600 on dinners at the Grill or the Beatrice. However, I\u2019ve probably spent the same amount I usually do on other \u201cnecessities\u201d ranging from Caviar, to online shopping, to Ubers. Also, I say this from a beachfront resort in St Thomas \u2013 so I guess it hasn\u2019t really changed my spending much.</p> <h2><strong>Caty Simon, 38, Massachusetts, sex worker, co-editor of <a href=\"http://titsandsass.com/\">Tits and Sass</a> (a national media site by and for sex workers), activist</strong></h2> <p>Coronavirus is the second devastating blow in two years to the sex work market. The first was in 2018 with the passing of Fosta-Sesta (the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act and the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act). Those bills meant online publishers would be liable if sex workers posted ads on their platforms and, as a result, websites banned sex workers, and scores of our ad platform sites shuttered themselves. Vulnerable workers were pushed on to the streets. Pimps were texting us en masse saying: \u201cThe game has changed, you need us baby.\u201d It destroyed the independence of many sex workers, and left us exposed to more trafficking. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In-person sex work has been decimated</p> <footer> <cite>Caty Simon</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So what\u2019s happening now has to be seen in the context of an already flagging market. I\u2019ve been a sex worker since 2002 and was escorting in 2008 and 2009. Back then we were told that vice is inelastic, right? That actually had some level of truth to it at the time. I was able to survive well enough through that recession. But this time, because in-person contact has become hazardous, it\u2019s different. In-person sex work has been decimated.</p> <p>I have about $80 in my bank account now and I have no idea where the next money is coming from. I\u2019m surviving financially by upcharging a few regular clients for sexting or phone sex, and luckily at this point I haven\u2019t been existing purely on sex work. I think I might be able to pay my rent. Also, non-criminal evictions are not proceeding in Massachusetts, so there\u2019s that. But even so, back rent would destroy me. I\u2019m just trying to take things day by day. I can\u2019t afford to stockpile food. I just have enough for the next two or three days. (Though I have got cat food for a week because priorities!) So I\u2019m planning really early morning trips to the local dollar store because I live in a food desert in a tiny, economically depressed ex-mill town. But still, I want to say, if I say nothing else, that my position is really privileged as compared to other low-income sex workers. At least I have a home to isolate myself in.</p> <p>On paper I don\u2019t make enough for the government stimulus to help me at all. And I wouldn\u2019t be eligible for unemployment; it\u2019s all part and parcel of being in a criminalized profession. There are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marginalutilite/status/1239699723277172736?s=20\">relief funds</a> that have been started for sex workers. But \u2013 as is common with any crisis hitting the sex work market \u2013 all the people giving to these funds are other sex workers. We have no political allies. We have no allies except each other.</p> <h2><strong>Debbie (name changed), 65, North Carolina, X-ray technician</strong></h2> <p>I just turned 65 in March and was planning to retire next July. There was a countdown calendar on my phone and everything. I was putting 20% of my pay into my 403(b) for retirement; it was doing great and everything was on track. I talked to my financial adviser less than eight weeks ago about it and he said: \u201cLet\u2019s just sit on it for a while, you might want to move some things around in April.\u201d Well, then everything came crashing down. In the course of a week I lost a quarter of my investments. I met with my adviser immediately and told him to move everything to a savings account. Then I went to work and said: \u201cGuess what? I\u2019m not retiring next year after all.\u201d</p> <p>My body hurts, my brain is tired. I\u2019ve been working in healthcare for 45 years. As much as I enjoy what I do, I\u2019m ready to be done. It\u2019s incredibly disheartening having all your plans whipped out from under you. I\u2019ll never make back the money that I lost. My friends are in similar positions.</p> <p>I understand that I\u2019m better off than a lot of people in that I have anything set aside for retirement. And there\u2019s really no one to blame for what happened. But I will tell you I really wish that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/republican-senators-sold-stocks-before-markets-plunged-on-coronavirus-fears-reports\">Richard Burr</a> [a Republican senator who sold off his investments at a very opportune moment] had called me and told me to change my stock portfolio.</p> <h2><strong>Katherine Newman, 39, London, freelance creative</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019m a freelance actor and writer, and juggle lots of other jobs such as tutoring to pay the bills. Pretty much all my creative work has disappeared overnight. I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to have some tutoring jobs via Zoom still, but that\u2019s not very much money. I\u2019m probably going to get about \u00a3600 ($743) a month from the government, which is based on 80% of how much I was earning over the past three years. Some of my freelance friends who have been on maternity leave aren\u2019t getting anything.</p> <p>I live hand-to-mouth generally. I have roughly about a month buffer. My foolproof plan was that I could always just make extra money working in a bar or as an usher. But all of that\u2019s gone. Creatives know we\u2019ve chosen a financially risky life. But you graft and you are prepared to do other things to make it work. I just didn\u2019t realize I had to make my career virus-proof.</p> <p>Rent is one of the biggest worries. I\u2019m really fortunate that my landlady is lovely. She\u2019s said she won\u2019t evict me but I\u2019m still worried that I\u2019m going to accrue lots of months of rent debt.</p> <p>The current situation has highlighted which budgeting habits I\u2019ll change when this is over. There will be less grabbing coffee and food on the run. I\u2019ve been going through subscriptions I have and seeing if I really need them. Obviously the gym has been canceled; I can do workouts at home. I\u2019ve started to re-evaluate how I\u2019ve lived my life. Do I really need to be in London to do what I do?</p> <h2><strong>Wendi Muse, 36, Baltimore, PhD student</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019m finishing up my PhD dissertation and have to find a job soon. Interviews would normally happen in August and September but I don\u2019t see that happening now. I\u2019m also worried about what will happen with the nature of the university itself \u2013 I worry that they will stick with virtual learning because it will lower costs. I foresee academia being shaped by this for the long term.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The main scare for me is that there\u2019s no prospect of my husband getting a job that\u2019s safe</p> <footer> <cite>Wendi Muse</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Grants are also up in the air right now - which we depend on as academics. I\u2019ve already received a finishing grant which means my income from the year is $28,000. My husband is in logistics and he was laid off at the start of the panic. We rely primarily on him for the mortgage. We are OK for the next few months but talking to the mortgage provider and seeing if we can reduce payments is on my list of things to do. The main scare for me is that there\u2019s no prospect of my husband getting a job that\u2019s safe. We have a new baby who just came out of NICU; she was there for respiratory problems. I also have asthma. So it\u2019s not safe for my husband to do Uber work or work in a grocery store. It\u2019s a really unsure future for all of us.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always been type A about budgeting because I\u2019ve not always been financially secure \u2013 my single mom was always trying to make ends meet. However, I\u2019ve started planning even more; particularly around food. I wasn\u2019t one of the types running out to get toilet paper, I just wanted to have enough food in the house. When it comes to utilities that can be negotiated up to a point; food can\u2019t.</p> <h2><strong>Eddie McNamara, 33, New Hampshire, server and bartender</strong></h2> <p>Until recently I was employed at the Outback Steakhouse in Massachusetts as a server and bartender. My wife worked there as well and was also laid off. There were some grants available but I didn\u2019t qualify for because I was under the hour minimum because I supplement my income driving part time for Uber, Lyft and DoorDash. We were still catching up on bills from the birth of our daughter, and this pandemic put a hard halt to our momentum. We\u2019ve basically had to go into panic mode and pay only the bills that are most time-sensitive or urgent.</p> <h2><strong>Haley</strong><strong>, 25, Iowa, creative coordinator</strong></h2> <p>I work at the University of Iowa as a creative coordinator. One of my main responsibilities is designing marketing materials for events. Well, there are no longer any events to market! I am lucky to still be receiving paychecks but there\u2019s a chance I could lose my job in the next year. I am one of the most recently hired staff, so I could be the first to let go if they need to save money.</p> <p>My husband lost his job on 11 March. He managed a cafe in one of the buildings on campus. We live in a small yet expensive apartment near the downtown area. He is not able to pay for his share of rent, utilities or groceries until he can find another job. And right now \u2026 no one is hiring.</p> <p>I am lucky to have a large audience on Twitter and Instagram; my accounts became popular after I began writing horoscopes every Sunday. So I have the opportunity to market my skills to my audience and receive a small income. Which is something I have not considered until now. Once the reality of our situation set in I asked my followers how they would feel about paying $5 for a three-card tarot reading. After receiving about 150 requests via email, I closed the service temporarily to ensure I had time to get to all of them. So, for now, I am not too worried about money. This has given me the opportunity to make a little money on the side as a safety net.</p> <h2><strong>Maureen Beran, 38, Iowa, </strong><strong> fitness studio owner</strong></h2> <p>I own barre3, a fitness studio in Iowa; we opened exactly one year ago. We\u2019re doing the best we can and have transferred a fraction of our classes over to live stream. But the equipment needed to set up other instructors to teach from their homes is cost-prohibitive. We\u2019re down about 60% in revenue this month and I\u2019m unsure how long I can keep my current members with this setup. Without the revenue from members\u2019 recurring payments, I\u2019m not sure how long we will last. I\u2019m thankful for the aid packages for small businesses just passed but understanding it and how to receive it is overwhelming. And I\u2019m unsure if it will be enough for my business.</p> <p>My husband is a software developer; his work hasn\u2019t been affected. Having a steady income through this is letting me sleep at night. We recognize that while we are taking a hit other people are worried about their next meal. So we\u2019re spending a lot more on money on takeout than we would normally to try and help the local community. We\u2019re also trying to get our groceries from a small grocer rather than the big brands.</p> <p>I have two boys, ages eight and four. We\u2019re saving about $800 this month in childcare as my parents watched my younger one when he wasn\u2019t in preschool but we\u2019d much prefer to pay the money. We don\u2019t feel prepared to teach them nor do we have the time to do it. We purchased both of them iPads so we could work with fewer interruptions \u2013 we\u2019re concerned about the amount of screen time they are getting but we just don\u2019t know how to make it all work. I feel pulled in a million directions and that I\u2019m doing none of my roles (mother, business owner, boss, wife, friend, daughter, sister) well.</p>",

The White House infectious disease expert warned Trump that evidence for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/apr/06/coronavirus-cure-fact-check-hydroxychloroquine-trump\">the drug was only anecdotal</a> and far from proven.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e299a7f3-c36b-4565-aeb3-0f89c8c5cbf5\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZTXpRNIDpy0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A health department spokesman said the inclusion of the medicine in the national medical stockpile was based on not only its proven clinical uses, but on its potential clinical utility in the absence of a well-documented treatment.</p> \n<p>While \u201cclinical trials are critical for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of potential treatments, before they are made available through the health system\u201d, the spokesman said, the drug would be made available not only for clinical trials but \u201cfor use in hospitals for ill patients\u201d.</p> \n<p>The government said under an emergency exemption to therapeutic goods registration requirements the drug would be sourced from overseas and imported, including intermediates and other raw materials so that<strong> </strong>local manufacturing could occur.</p> \n<p>The department confirmed that the former federal politician Clive Palmer, who has said he will produce 1m doses of the drug, has a prior written arrangement with the commonwealth and so his plan aligned with the emergency exemption.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is anticipated that medicines containing hydroxychloroquine sulfate will be made available to the national medical stockpile from a number of pharmaceutical companies,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cSome of these include generous donations funded by Mr Clive Palmer.\u201d</p> \n<p>Novartis Pharmaceuticals Australia has also confirmed that it will provide doses. And the government is investing $1.5m to support guidance for clinicians to ensure they are given the best possible advice on managing Covid-19 patients.</p> \n<p>An infectious diseases expert and former World Health Organization adviser, Prof Peter Collignon, said he was concerned the stockpiling was being driven by hype and panic.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt a very bad idea to have panic driving drugs we are going to give to people and chloroquine is just an example of panic,\u201d Collignon said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is very important to look at and evaluate these drugs around the world but to only issue these drugs after that evaluation. Or we run the risk of killing people.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/hydroxychloroquine-trump-coronavirus-drug\">Hydroxychloroquine: how an unproven drug became Trump\u2019s coronavirus miracle cure</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI would be worried about it being made available in the absence of strong trials and doctors make panicked decisions.

At the moment we don\u2019t have any antivirals that we can use against the virus, so I can understand the move to acquire a drug that has preliminary evidence as possibly effective. However, I think we still need to be careful and observe our usual protocols of clinical trials, albeit at a more accelerated rate than usual.\u201d <br></p>",

  "<p>School closures are likely to have a relatively small impact on the spread of Covid-19 and should be weighed against their profound economic and social consequences, particularly for the most vulnerable children, according to <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(20)30095-X/fulltext\">a UK review</a>.</p> <p>The research, led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/universitycollegelondon\">University College London</a> (UCL), is the first to look at evidence behind many governments\u2019 decision to shut schools and keep pupils at home.</p> <p>According to the UN\u2019s education body, Unesco, more than 90% of the world\u2019s pupils have been affected by closures.</p> <p>The UCL-led survey concludes that the evidence to support the closure of schools to combat Covid-19 is \u201cvery weak\u201d, and statistics from influenza outbreaks suggest school closures \u201ccould have relatively small effects on a virus with Covid-19\u2019s high transmissibility and apparent low clinical effect on schoolchildren\u201d.</p> <p>The research team reviewed 16 studies of recent outbreaks of other coronaviruses, including the 2003 Sars epidemic in mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore, and found that school closures did not help control the epidemic.</p> <p>\u201cWe know from previous studies that school closures are likely to have the greatest effect if the virus has low transmissibility and attack rates are higher in children. This is the opposite of Covid-19,\u201d said thereview\u2019s lead author, Prof Russell Viner, of UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health.</p> <p>\u201cData on the benefit of school closures in the Covid-19 outbreak is limited but what we know shows that their impact is likely to be only small compared with other infection-control measures such as case isolation and is only effective when other social isolating measures are adhered to.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/06/uk-councils-face-lawsuits-over-access-to-education-in-lockdown\">UK councils face lawsuits over access to education in lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Viner, who is president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the benefit gained from closing schools had to be weighed against the costs. \u201cChildren\u2019s education is damaged and their mental health may suffer, family finances are affected, key workers may need to stay home to look after children and vulnerable children may suffer most.\u201d</p> <p>He also highlighted the need to start working out how to return students to education and keep them in school safely.</p> <p>\u201cCountries that have closed schools, such as the UK, have to now ask hard questions about when and how to open schools. Interventions in schools, such as closing playgrounds, keeping students in constant class groups/classrooms, increasing spacing between students in classes, reducing the school week and staggering school start and break times across years or classes should be considered if restrictive social distancing policies are to be implemented for long periods of time.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, who is one of the key epidemiologists advising the government, said: \u201cWhile school closure as a measure on its own is predicted to have a limited effectiveness in controlling Covid-19 transmission, when combined with intense social distancing it plays an important role in severing remaining contacts between households and thus ensuring transmission declines.\u201d</p> <p>Robert Dingwall, a professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, said the UCL survey suggested the public health benefits of school closures were not proportionate to the social and economic costs imposed on children and their families.</p> <p>\u201cIt also underlines how the assumptions used in modelling the Covid-19 pandemic may rest on very flimsy foundations in terms of scientific evidence. This work suggests that UK schools could and should begin to reopen as soon as practicable after the initial wave of cases has passed through.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The review team included researchers from UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, UCL Institute of Education, London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, University of Cambridge and University of Sydney. The review is published in the <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/home\">Lancet Child and Adolescent Health</a> journal.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe decision to close schools was taken in line with scientific advice on how to limit the spread of the coronavirus. We asked most children to stay at home in order to protect the NHS and save lives.</p> <p>\u201cSchools will remain closed until further notice, except for children of critical workers and the children who are most vulnerable. We will reopen schools when the scientific advice indicates it is safe to do so.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, welcomed the review but said it did not warrant any change of policy. \u201cThe review indicates that school closures are effective as part of a combination of tactics of social distancing and testing. This is the evidence from China, from Hong Kong, and from a modelling study carried out in the UK,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone wants schools to be reopened as soon as is safely possible. This can only happen on the basis of sound scientific reasoning that school closure is no longer necessary for the suppression of Covid-19. We are a long way from this point.

the Easter holidays.</p> \n  <p>Ministers said last week that qualifying families could claim shopping vouchers of \u00a315 a week per child in term time only. But over the weekend Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the vouchers would continue to be paid over the two-week Easter break, benefiting an estimated 1.3 million youngsters in England.</p> \n

needs and disabilities - are provided for is a top priority for councils and schools.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThere are over 1.3 million young people entitled to free school meals and the number of families in need is likely to be much greater as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic has forced thousands of families into financial insecurity, meaning parents who did not previously qualify for free school meals may be eligible for them.</p> \n  <p>Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: \u201cMany struggling families will be finding it even harder than normal to make ends meet in the current emergency and with children at home for a long period.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe extension of the voucher scheme will make a real difference in helping

hospital</strong></p> \n  <p>Boris Johnson has tweeted that he is in \u201cgood spirits\u201d but No 10 has stopped describing his symptoms as \u201cmild\u201d. As the prime minister continues to be observed by doctors, Downing Street said it was too early to say whether he would be staying for another night and did not deny that he had been given oxygen treatment.</p> \n  <p><strong>Tuesday\u2019s cabinet meeting postponed </strong></p> \n  <p>Dominic Raab chaired Monday\u2019s coronavirus meeting, while a cabinet meeting planned for Tuesday has been postponed. The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, has reportedly returned to work after self-isolating with coronavirus symptoms. Dominic Cummings is yet to return to work in Downing Street but remains in communication with officials, a spokesman said.</p> \n  <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon warns of \u2018worse to come\u2019</strong></p> \n  <p>Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon has warned \u201cthere is almost certainly worse still to come\u201d after Scotland\u2019s death toll increased to 222. Among the latest two deaths were a home care worker from West Dumbartonshire. Sturgeon stressed that this would not be a \u201ctrue figure\u201d and would be \u201cartificially low\u201d as officials change the way deaths are reported.</p> \n  <p><strong>Sturgeon defends initial decision not to sack Scotland\u2019s CMO</strong></p> \n  <p>Earlier Sturgeon defended her decision not to sack Catherine Calderwood as soon as it emerged that Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer had twice visited her second home while fronting the stay at home campaign. But she said by Sunday evening it became clear the Calderwood\u2019s behaviour was \u201cundermining\u201d the message that people should stay at home.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Deaths in England increase by 403 </strong></p> \n  <p>The number of people who have died from coronavirus in the England has increased by 403 to 4,897. NHS England said the latest victims were aged between 35 and 106 years old. Of the 403 patients (aged between 52 and 94 years old), 15 had no known underlying health condition.</p> \n  <p><strong>Deaths in Wales increase by 27 to 193</strong><br></p> \n  <p>The death toll in Wales from coronavirus has increased by 27 to 193. A Covid-19 testing centre at Cardiff City\u2019s stadium is due to open on Tuesday. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has said he believes the lockdown will have to continue beyond Easter.</p> \n  <p><strong>Antibody test \u2018at least a month away\u2019</strong><br></p> \n  <p>A mass antibody test is at least a month away, a leading government scientific adviser has said. Professor Sir John Bell, from Oxford University, who advises the government on life sciences, said the search was on for an antibody test that would prove effective, but those tested so far had failed. He also warned the test was at least a month a way. </p> \n  <p><strong>Labour frontbencher taken to hospital</strong></p> \n  <p>Tony Lloyd, 70, the Labour MP for Rochdale, has been taken to hospital in Manchester with coronavirus. Lloyd is the shadow Northern Ireland secretary. Richard Burgon, the former shadow justice secretary, has been sacked by Labour\u2019s new leader Keir Starmer Andrew Gwynne has stepped down as shadow communities secretary, complaining of being sidelined as election coordinator under Jeremy Corbyn.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Jenrick warns councils against park closures<br></strong></p> \n  <p>The communities secretary warned councils to only close parks as a \u201clast resort\u201d. South London\u2019s Brockwell Park was reopened after closing on Sunday a day after thousands appeared to ignore physical distancing measures in the park.</p> \n  <p><strong>Surge in domestic abuse calls</strong></p> \n  <p>There was a 25% surge in calls to the National Domestic Abuse Helpline in a five-day period during the coronavirus lockdown, according to the charity Refuge. There was also increase of about 150% in visits to nationaldahelpline.org.uk compared with the last week in February. The warning came after dozens of organisations helping domestic violence victims reported an increase in their caseload since the start of the UK\u2019s outbreak.</p> \n  <p><strong>Debenhams set to go into administration</strong><br></p> \n  <p>The department store chain Debenhams is on the brink of collapse after bosses confirmed it has filed a notice of intent to appoint administrators affecting around 22,000 workers. The majority of its employees in the UK are currently being paid under the government\u2019s furlough scheme, after its stores closed following the shutdown of non-essential stores.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T14:03:43.839Z\">at 3.03pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8b31cf8f08c9eaf0daf6ec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/severincarrell\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T13:43:11.885Z\">2.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Nearly 13,000 retired health professionals and students have offered to work in <strong>Scotland</strong>\u2019s health service to help cope with the extra demands of the coronavirus crisis, Jeane Freeman, the Scottish health secretary, has said.</p> \n  <p>Freeman said that by Monday morning 12,725 people had answered an appeal for retired staff and students to come forward, including more than 2,600 former nurses, more than 3,000 nursing students, 1,272 retired doctors and more than 1,650 with social care experience.</p> \n  <p>The remainder were physiotherapists, biomedical students, occupational therapists; dentists and midwives, paramedics. Students would be fully paid, and be able to complete their studies, while all the recruits would be entitled to sick pay equivalent to an employee with five years\u2019 experience, she added.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThat response in a relatively short period of time shows the incredible dedication of our health care community, current, retired and future, to give us all their skills and expertise to help us meet the challenge ahead,\u201d Freeman said.</p> \n  <p>They had registered directly with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, NHS Lothian or via a national \u201caccelerated recruitment portal\u201d. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, said on Monday about 6% of NHS staff in Scotland were off work with coronavirus-related illnesses or responsibilities.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T13:52:23.375Z\">at 2.52pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8b2ecd8f08c9eaf0daf6d6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rowena-mason\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T13:42:32.757Z\">2.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson\">Boris Johnson</a> is still in hospital suffering from coronavirus and had a \u201ccomfortable night\u201d but No 10 has dropped the description of his symptoms as mild.</p> \n  <p>As the prime minister continues to be observed by doctors, Downing Street said it was too early to say whether he would be staying for another night and did not deny that he had been given oxygen treatment.</p> \n  <p>The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said he was in St Thomas\u2019 hospital in south London and was in \u201cgood spirits\u201d, while continuing to work on his red box of government papers.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/06/boris-johnson-can-run-country-from-hospital-bed-says-uk-minister-coronavirus\">Boris Johnson remains in hospital after 'comfortable night'</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8b2cb38f080bdb9f535228\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T13:25:52.842Z\">2.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A dairy farmer in Wales says he has been forced to dump 11,500 litres of milk because of the pandemic.</p> \n  <p>Llyr Griffiths provides milk to Freshway, which supplies a number of high-profile companies including Starbucks and British Airways. </p> \n  <p>In a post on Facebook, he wrote: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I am not blaming Freshways, however this is only happening due to the affect of the pandemic.

It was busy in the park \u2013 but this is a densely populated area, home to tens of thousands of people, many of whom have no outside living space. I saw no large groups; I remember seeing one group of three teenagers and noting that everyone else was on their own or in pairs, or parents with young children.</p> \n   <p> Some people were sitting on the grass or on benches but at a distance from others. Most people were on the move and many were visibly taking care to stay away from other people as best as they could. It can be difficult to stay two metres away from other people at all times in a busy park. No one that I saw was gratuitously ignoring social distancing guidance.</p> \n   <p>Closing parks would in my view be appallingly damaging to people\u2019s physical and mental health at a time when they are dealing with unprecedented strain and anxiety. It will force people into smaller open spaces or on to roads where it will be harder to practise social distancing. If there is an irresponsible minority \u2013 and I didn\u2019t see them \u2013 surely they should be spoken to, asked to change their behaviour and then if necessary sanctioned. Why should the responsible majority suffer? </p> \n   <p>Perhaps more could be done to promote responsible use of parks. This is very important because we don\u2019t want to get into a situation where urban populations can no longer tolerate the lockdown.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Another reader, who did not want to be named, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I live in a small flat with no garden and walked to the park with my husband and baby. I ran around the park while my husband let our baby crawl on the grass. I saw no large groups, many people exercising, and everyone I encountered was assiduously respecting two-metre distance. There were some people sitting on the grass alone or in household or family groups.

Thus the older age group, starting from above 60 years old, they seem to show much more severe illness.

  "<p>With the coronavirus crisis forcing us to confront profound questions about care priorities and the relative worth of citizen\u2019s lives, Donald Macaskill has emerged as a doughty and passionate advocate for older people. \u201cThey are not disposable,\u201d he insists. \u201cThey are the best of us \u2013 and we have a duty to be the best for them.\u201d</p> <p>Macaskill is chief executive of <a href=\"https://scottishcare.org/\">Scottish Care</a>, the main umbrella body for care homes and homecare providers in Scotland, and has long argued for a human-rights approach to care and support. The crisis has rushed the issue to the fore, with growing reports of older and disabled people being earmarked automatically for palliative care only, should they contract Covid-19.</p> <p>To Macaskill, the emergency represents the biggest human-rights challenge since the second world war. \u201cI have never been, nor would I want to be, in a situation where I needed to make that life-or-death decision,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if I was, what I would want is very clear guidance so I knew that somebody had my back. What concerns me is that some of the guidance already beginning to appear around the country is misplaced, immoral and illegal.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Politicians \u2013 with one or two glorious exceptions \u2013 have been remarkably quiet around all this</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Advice for doctors published last week by the British Medical Association says that patient age, \u201cwhere clinically relevant\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/01/ventilators-may-be-taken-from-stable-coronavirus-patients-for-healthier-ones-bma-says?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">could be a factor in predicting survival</a> in decisions about extending or withholding more intensive treatment, including access to ventilators to support breathing.</p> <p>\u201cAge cannot be the sole proxy [for worth], indeed it should not be the primary proxy,\u201d says Macaskill. \u201cThere are many active people in their 70s who would have more beneficial clinical outcomes than, say, somebody in their 50s living with multiple co-morbidities.\u201d</p> <p>The extent of any underlying chronic health conditions, as well as<strong> </strong>frailty \u201cshould have greater significance than simply age when you have that hellish decision to make\u201d, he adds.</p> <p>Macaskill is calling for an immediate initiative to draw up agreed national guidance, with a process involving not just acute-care doctors and ethicists but also geriatricians, gerontologists and social-care leaders. He believes it could be completed, virtually, within 48 hours. But he says the leadership of politicians would be crucial.</p> <p>\u201cWe should not be leaving this to the clinicians. Critically, they are the ones who are going to have to make and action the heavy choices. We need greater political intervention in the debate and politicians \u2013 with one or two glorious exceptions \u2013 have been remarkably quiet around all this.\u201d</p> <p>At Scottish Care, Macaskill \u2013 who has a background in further and higher education and faith studies \u2013 seeks to apply a human-rights test to all policies and practice. He says he is dismayed by those who wish to scrap the <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/human-rights/human-rights-act\">Human Rights Act</a> and dilute the UK\u2019s commitment to the <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/what-european-convention-human-rights\">European convention on human rights</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s a historical failure to realise where the modern system of human rights came from, which inescapably was the horrors of the second world war.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df4309bff26fc826eb975beac9027c90da25a43d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df4309bff26fc826eb975beac9027c90da25a43d/0_139_4256_2554/1000..jpg\" alt=\"SILHOUETTED OLD AGE PENSIONER\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Macaskill believes the traumatic events of the past few weeks have helped social care belatedly start to earn proper recognition in policy circles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rosemary Roberts/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the coronavirus crisis broke, Macaskill has attracted attention not only for his <a href=\"https://scottishcare.org/ceo-statement-on-coronavirus-age-shall-not-limit-them/\">forceful stance on older people\u2019s right to life</a>, but also for <a href=\"https://www.homecareinsight.co.uk/exclusive-scottish-care-ceo-calls-on-uk-supermarkets-to-support-social-care-staff/\">taking on the leading supermarket chains</a> for not giving social-care workers the same access to protected shopping time that they have made available to NHS staff.</p> <p>\u201cWe have staff coming off 12-hour shifts, struggling to get into the local Tesco because at that very time it\u2019s the shopping hour for the NHS,\u201d he says. Smaller care homes that have always shopped locally for supplies, supporting their high street, have also found themselves unable to get what they need. \u201cThey have tried to do the right thing, rather than buy from big multinational chains, and it\u2019s come back to bite them.\u201d</p> <p>Does he think the health and care sector can withstand the crisis? Scotland, he believes, is slightly better placed than the rest of the UK thanks to its relatively small size, greater past investment \u2013 with <a href=\"https://www.indeed.co.uk/salaries/care-assistant-Salaries,-Scotland\">social-care pay higher</a> and <a href=\"https://data.sssc.uk.com/images/StaffVacancies/Staff_vacancies_in_care_services_2018.pdf\">vacancy rates lower</a> than in England \u2013 and earlier planning for the emergency.</p> <p>But coronavirus is already in what he terms \u201ca good number\u201d of care homes, including <a href=\"https://www.glasgowtimes.co.uk/news/18360553.three-elderly-residents-crisis-hit-burlington-court-care-home-die---bringing-death-toll-16/\">Burlington Court</a> in Glasgow where 16 deaths in just over a week have been linked to the disease. \u201cPeople are frightened that this virus will strike the most vulnerable and strike in the heart of their care home communities,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/04/why-are-we-gambling-with-the-lives-of-elderly-people-and-their-carers\">Why are we gambling with the lives of elderly people and their carers? | Nick Cohen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He thinks availability of personal protection equipment (PPE) has so far been better than in England, owing to a coordinated distribution model across social care and the NHS.

We must make sure frontline care workers have all the PPE they need.\u201d</p> <p>Macaskill warns that health and care will get through only if social care is treated on a par with the health service when it comes to such issues as PPE distribution. \u201cWhat I am very clear on is that if social care remains the handmaiden of the NHS, rather than being seen as an equal sister, then we will not achieve the positive outcomes we all want to see,\u201d he says. \u201cSocial care has to be valued in its own right because it is critical to us beating the virus in the community generally, but in care homes in particular.\u201d</p> <p>The increasingly traumatic events of the past few weeks have helped social care belatedly start to earn proper recognition in policy circles, he thinks. But he fears there remains \u201ca huge distance to travel\u201d in winning it equal status with the NHS in the public mind.</p> <p>\u201cThis crisis will certainly help that,\u201d Macaskill says. \u201cBut will it completely change things?

  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/11/lesbos-coronavirus-case-sparks-fears-for-refugee-camp-moria\">spectre of coronavirus </a>striking severely overcrowded refugee camps in Greece has hovered menacingly for months.</p> <p>International aid organisations, human rights groups and doctors have sounded the alarm.

Detection of the disease in camps in Malakasa and Ritsona \u2013 among 30 refugee facilities on the mainland \u2013 has put them in uncharted territory. Malakasa was placed in quarantine on Sunday, hours after an Afghan refugee began displaying symptoms of the virus; Ritsona, 75km north-east of the capital, was sealed off after 23 African asylum seekers tested positive on Thursday.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian after ordering the first lockdown, Manos Logothetis, the migration ministry\u2019s general secretary in charge of asylum seekers\u2019 reception, said: \u201cIt\u2019s the first case of coronavirus in a reception centre and, yes, we are testing our responses. We\u2019ve quarantined the entire area and taken steps to isolate those with the virus. It\u2019s not been easy, there\u2019ve been protests.</p> <p>\u201cFood has been brought by the International Organization for Migration, which is running the site, along with translators and cultural mediators. Testing will continue.\u201d</p> <p>The outbreak was traced to a 19-year-old Cameroonian woman found to be infected after giving birth in an Athens hospital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b9d3897f71e6bfc39efb033709d4b901010fc80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b9d3897f71e6bfc39efb033709d4b901010fc80/0_0_3543_2362/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Members of the IOM and refugees unload boxes with food and medical supplies at the camp in Ritsona.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ritsona is relying on food handouts from the International Organization for Migration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yannis Kolesidis/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAll the rest who have tested positive are asymptomatic,\u201d said Logothetis, a doctor himself. \u201cI found that surprising, but as in all the camps Ritsona\u2019s population is young. Most are under the age of 40 which is why we believe they\u2019ll be able to ride this out.\u201d</p> <p>However, many disagree. A surge in migrants from Turkey, even before the epidemic arrived in Europe, had increased concerns over the cramped and unsanitary conditions of reception centres in Greece.</p> <p>Increasingly, NGOs have voiced fears over lack of access to testing, medical facilities and basic services, including water stations and taps. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/eu-urged-to-evacuate-asylum-seekers-from-cramped-greek-island-camps-coronavirus\">Calls for the evacuation</a> of refugees to other EU countries have also soared amid evidence of the devastating effect coronavirus is likely to have on an already vulnerable population.</p> <p>Holding facilities on the mainland are generally managed better; refugees are accommodated in containers and pre-fab houses, in stark contrast to the tent cities on the Aegean isles that have long borne the brunt of the migrant and refugee crisis.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not a matter of \u2018if\u2019 but \u2018when\u2019 coronavirus strikes the camps,\u201d said Sanne van der Kooij, a Dutch gynaecologist who has similarly volunteered in Moria multiple times. \u201cI do not have a good feeling. I was last in Lesbos in February and worked at the local hospital where pregnant refugee women are moved to give birth. There were only six ICU beds and the care was very poor. The bed linens were filthy and the Greek doctors and nurses were clearly overwhelmed by the extra work.\u201d</p> <p>Although so far confirmed coronavirus cases have been reported only among local people on Lesbos, refugees requiring emergency medical help run the risk of contracting the virus, she said. \u201cIn the hospital for example. That\u2019s where so many will be at threat of coronavirus infection. And then the spread inside [the facility] will be very difficult to stop.\u201d</p> <p>Most asylum seekers in the island camps are from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Africa. Unable to leave because of a <a href=\"https://www.msf.org/eu-turkey-deal-continues-cycle-containment-and-despair-greece-refugees\">containment policy </a>determined by the EU, they have found themselves in limbo, trapped on the outposts opposite the Turkish coast until their asylum requests are processed.</p> <p>Almost 35,000 European health workers and other citizens have also backed the doctors\u2019 petition calling on EU governments to comply with an accord struck with Turkey in 2016 under which each member state agreed to take in a fixed number of refugees. Although it is central to a pact aimed at curbing migratory flows, the resettlement pledge was never fulfilled.</p> <p>Greece has, so far, had relative success in keeping transmission of the disease under control, announcing fewer than 2,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and a death toll of 76.</p> <p>But health officials warn that the coming weeks are critical.</p> <p>\u201cThe EU will have blood on its hands if it continues to look away,\u201d warned De Vijver, speaking from Amsterdam where most of his patients in the city\u2019s main hospital are now suffering from coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cThere are 22,000 people in Moria: men, women and children all packed into an area that is a fraction of the size of Hyde Park. Scabies, pneumonia, diarrhoea are rife,\u201d he said, adding that conditions had deteriorated markedly since NGOs and volunteer medics had left the island following violent attacks by far-right vigilantes last month.</p> <p>\u201cI was astounded to see that this terrible situation had caused 80% of the complaints we were dealing with. Politicians in the EU have a moral obligation to take these people in,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Greece\u2019s centre-right government has described the camps as \u201cticking health bombs\u201d.</p> <p>So far this year about 10,000 asylum seekers have been moved from the islands to the mainland \u2013 including 1,785 to closed, pre-deportation centres \u2013 according to the UN refugee agency. Plans are afoot to transfer another 600 people \u2013 300 elderly refugees and their dependents \u2013 to hotels in Athens. </p> <p>Reflecting restrictive measures enforced across Greece to combat Covid-19, authorities have allowed ATMs to be installed in the island facilities, as part of a wider lockdown on the camps.</p> <p>But Logothetis accepts that in the event of a \u201cmass coronavirus outbreak\u201d, health officials on Lesbos would be hard pushed to cope. \u201cIn an ideal world we would rent a big venue, keep it warm and kit it out with beds. That I hope will be the next phase of our emergency operational plan because with so few ICUs on the island we don\u2019t have the capacity to withstand the pressure if a lot of people were to get sick at the same time.\u201d</p> <p>The pandemic has effectively stopped any prospect of voluntary returns of migrants under a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/eu-to-offer-2000-to-migrants-willing-to-go-home-from-greek-islands\">EU-funded scheme </a>announced last month. Citing coronavirus concerns, the asylum service is also sputtering. Though operational again following Athens\u2019 suspension of applications in response to Turkey\u2019s abrupt decision to relax border controls and allow refugees to head to Europe, the service is not receiving new requests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf6542e2b976148209439af962c2e67d6f913056\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf6542e2b976148209439af962c2e67d6f913056/0_0_4928_3280/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Migrants and refugees queue in a makeshift camp next to the Moria camp on the Greek island of Lesbos on 2 April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doctors have warned about the consequences of a widespread outbreak in the island camps.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manolis Lagoutaris/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hopes of resettling around 1,600 unaccompanied children to other parts of Europe have also dwindled.

But that, says Greece\u2019s migration minister Notis Mitarachi, is practically impossible without adequate accommodation.</p> <p>Addressing the EU parliament\u2019s home affairs committee as police moved to lock down Ritsona, he reiterated what prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has said repeatedly: Europe should do more to help because Greece \u201ccannot resolve this crisis instantly and alone\u201d.</p> <p>It is a refrain echoed by Logothetis. \u201cWe need support and we need to share the burden,\u201d he said. \u201cIf each of the other 26 EU member states agreed to take in 2,000 people, our problem would be more than settled.

  "<p>\u201cInitially, I considered masking some of my queerness for appeal,\u201d says the artist and online dominatrix Noelle Buckhorne. A self-described queer femme goddess and disabled domme, Buckthorne sells photos and videos of herself wearing strappy lingerie and spiky jewelry and casts virtual \u201cwitch domme spells\u201d on her willing fans.</p> <p>\u201cBut quickly I realized not only could I be open about my gender and sexuality, but it would attract more interesting, better matched customers. With OnlyFans, I can be exactly as queer, femme, eccentric and unabashed as I want,\u201d says Buckhorne, whose offerings range from sex education and relationship advice to financial domination.</p> <p>Free porn sites and live-streaming platforms don\u2019t typically have search categories for non-binary genders, which can be limiting to performers\u2019 creativity and self-expression. On sitessuch as PornHub, performers who upload their own content often have to choose between just two gender categories, or a third trans category sometimes identified by a pejorative term. OnlyFans, however, lets creators self-identify and cultivate a viewership on their own terms. Non-white and gender non-conforming performers with loyal followers through their social media accounts can entice their followers to also engage with them on an adult platform and pay for a more intimate look at their lives (and bodies).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I find it magical to make porn with someone who is on the same path as me</p> <footer> <cite>X\u00f6e Nova</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe are not a marketplace and therefore every creator has the opportunity to self-identify as they wish and build a space that\u2019s focused on their content for their fans,\u201d founder Tim Stokely told me.</p> <p>The Pittsburgh-based adult performer Luna Luz, who identifies as \u201ca BBW Latina\u201d, or big, beautiful woman, launched her OnlyFans page a few months ago to supplement her income from phone sex services and other sex work. She says the platform helps facilitate cross-promotion.</p> <p>\u201cI think that within queer, non-binary, trans, black and POC communities there is a really cool culture of promoting each other, which can pull in more people that are used to surfing the mainstream porn platforms,\u201d said Luz. \u201cPeople lift each other up by retweeting new models, giving shoutouts and creating content together to sell on our clips sites or to post on OnlyFans.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/06/filth-in-a-time-of-handwashing-why-lockdown-erotica-is-the-hottest-trend-in-publishing\">Filth in a time of handwashing: why lockdown erotica is the hottest trend in publishing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At just $5 per month for a subscription to her page, Luz can make her content accessible to more of her fans. For newer, less experienced content creators hoping to build a following on OnlyFans, lower prices allow for more potential subscribers and more exposure. Others, like the adult industry veteran Jessica Drake, charge up to $20 for a monthly subscription.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the biggest benefits to platforms like OnlyFans is that I think it\u2019s definitely taken some of the power away from porn companies\u2019 hands and placed all the control with the performer,\u201d Drake, who looks much like the epitome of \u201cporn star\u201d, told me.</p> <p>Drake got her start the way many adult performers did two decades ago \u2013 as a stripper. She danced at a club in El Paso, Texas, that regularly booked featured dancers for themed shows and competitions that attracted porn industry professionals. There, Drake hit it off with an in-demand adult film director and his crew. \u201cThat is very much how people got into the industry, was by being recruited by people in person,\u201d Drake told me over coffee at a Starbucks in Granada Hills, California.</p> <p>Eventually, they brought her to an adult film set in LA. \u201cI was the condom and lube girl,\u201d Drake said. \u201cI literally was standing there with a box of baby wipes, a bowl of condoms. There were some bottles of lube, paper towels, bottled water.\u201d It wasn\u2019t glamorous work, but Drake loved it. \u201cI stood next to one of the most popular performers at the time, Jill Kelly, and I just couldn\u2019t believe I was there,\u201d she said. \u201cI was feet away from someone that I had seen in movies, who I had masturbated to and had sex to. I really thought I was the luckiest girl in the world.\u201d</p> <p>Back when Drake got her start over 20 years ago, new porn actresses typically made their debut with a solo masturbation scene, then girl-on-girl, then boy-girl, before eventually ramping up to multiple scene partners. Drake jumped in with a boy-girl scene. The rise of a platform like OnlyFans turns that traditional ladder-climbing on its head by putting more power in the hands of performers who no longer need the approval of overwhelmingly white cis male industry scouts and gatekeepers to launch their careers.</p> <p>Greater representation of queer performers and performers of color isn\u2019t just good for audiences. In an industry where racism, fatphobia, and transphobia are common, the adult performer X\u00f6e Nova believes it\u2019s just as important for performers themselves to feel seen.</p> <p>\u201cI love showcasing raw and honest queer sexuality in all its forms. I truly enjoy the connections I have with the friends I perform with, and love showing the myriad of ways two (or more) people can have sex and express intimacy,\u201d said Nova, who uses \u201cthey\u201d or \u201che\u201d pronouns. Nova creates an intimate atmosphere with clear, natural lighting, and every scene is unique. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019m told often is that my work feels really fluid and real, like they just happened to be in the room to see me and my scene partner fuck. That\u2019s what I generally aim for.\u201d</p> <p>While he enjoys working with performers of all genders, Nova said scenes with trans partners were especially meaningful. \u201cIt\u2019s always extra special to work with other trans performers,\u201d Nova said. \u201cI personally find it magical to make porn with someone who is on the same path as me in that way, it\u2019s healing.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>OnlyFans is like the Uberization of porn. Anyone can be their own porn star</p> <footer> <cite>Avery Jane St Germaine</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After becoming a single parent about eight years ago, Nova started performing on the live-streaming site MyFreeCams. There, Nova said he felt creatively stifled by the lack of trans-affirming content and \u201ccookie cutter\u201d performances. \u201cFor a long time, I just didn\u2019t really see anybody that looks like me in porn, and I remember feeling that I\u2019m not a sexual being for myself. I felt like my image and my body are not for me, sex was not for me. This is something that\u2019s just for other people,\u201d said Nova. \u201cBeing able to see people who are my size and my color, my ethnic background in these things, it makes you feel like you and your desires are valid, and your image is valid.\u201d</p> <p>The Los Angeles-based performer Avery Jane St Germaine is queer and black. \u201cOnlyFans is like the Uberization of porn. Anyone can be their own porn star and collect their own fans. Anyone can make a living off of content creation,\u201d said St Germaine.</p> <p>Originally from Louisiana, St Germaine started her career in adult retail and later began sugar dating, or dating in exchange for financial support, and working as a cam model, stripper, escort and fetish performer. St Germaine started uploading videos to OnlyFans because it was easy \u2013 she didn\u2019t need special equipment and earned an 80% commission on subscription sales from the platform. \u201cA lot of marginalized folks don\u2019t have access to nice filming equipment, so a site where phone-quality videos and day-to-day life content is preferred is <em>huge</em> for us,\u201d said St Germaine.</p> <p>St Germaine points out that platforms for independent creators won\u2019t necessarily solve porn\u2019s industry-wide problems with racism, homophobia and transphobia. \u201cCisgender and white content creators will always be the default to support, and will rake in big bucks more often,\u201d she said. However, she believes OnlyFans is \u201ca saving grace\u201d for queer and trans performers of color, disabled performers, and non-traditional content creators. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely the beginning of the future of adult content creation, in my opinion.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There is a \u201cterrible fight\u201d going on in Kirstie Allsopp\u2019s kitchen. Her two sons, who are 11 and 13, are making a chocolate cake. Allsopp, speaking on the phone, takes a pause to listen out. At least they\u2019re not on screens \u2013 she has been trying, and not always succeeding, to implement a no-screens-before-6pm policy. How is that even possible? \u201cScreaming. Threats. I haven\u2019t resorted to physical violence yet,\u201d she says with a laugh. (In 2018, Allsopp became notorious, briefly, for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/15/kirstie-allsopp-defends-decision-smash-childrens-ipads\">saying she had smashed her children\u2019s iPads</a> because they were spending too long on them.)</p> <p>Allsopp, 48, has presented the property show Location, Location, Location since 2000. And there are other TV shows, including a property renovation programme, Love It Or List It. She has also become known for shows about home crafts, and is about to begin filming a lockdown crafts special for Channel 4, with a team of 11 who are arriving at her house this week. They have all been in self-isolation for a couple of weeks in preparation \u2013 the channel believes the team can travel and work safely \u2013 and Allsopp has turned her tennis court into a kind of field canteen, where they will all eat together twice a day. She is putting them all up, and somehow, she says, will all observe the physical-distancing rules (yes, her house must be huge).</p> <p>\u201cThat means we\u2019re able to make 10 shows with family crafts that people can do with the stuff they have in their homes,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople should know by now to save the inside of their loo rolls.\u201d She is expecting a bit of a backlash \u2013 making a TV show about crafts may not be considered essential \u2013 but for some, it can relieve some of the pressure of this time, she says. \u201cWe just want to do fun stuff, which people can do with their kids or grandparents \u2013 they can FaceTime or Zoom while doing it. They can make things that they will link together when they meet up, and get through a couple of hours of the day doing something fun together. When you use your hands to make something, you have a sense of achievement. This is a really important thing for mental health \u2013 it gives us some control over an increasingly uncontrollable environment. It\u2019s very therapeutic.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e5e9cb987eec0e38a3b35a78abd24481ae44ecb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e5e9cb987eec0e38a3b35a78abd24481ae44ecb/0_183_5120_3072/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Allsopp filming in 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allsopp filming in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Hill/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What else is keeping Allsopp sane? \u201cI\u2019m not sure I am staying sane,\u201d she says. Watching Call the Midwife is helping (\u201cIt just reminds us how hard life was\u201d), as is Friends and Frasier. \u201cCooking, tidying and our daily walk at the end of the day. Daffodils and Evan Davies. Knowing I have some work to do next week. Mascara.\u201d She says she knows she has much to be grateful for. \u201cThere\u2019s no point pretending Covid-19 is a great leveller because \u2013 look at me \u2013 I\u2019m not on a par with other people, shut up.\u201d She has a big house and garden, she points out, and no financial problems. \u201cAnyone saying we\u2019re all in this together \u2026 we\u2019re bloody not. There are people who are shut up who have acute money worries, as well as being in small spaces.\u201d But, mentally, Allsopp is finding it a struggle. \u201cPeople think I\u2019m quite a robust, gung-ho type of person \u2026 that I would be responding really well, but I\u2019m not,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She worries about women trapped in abusive homes and children who were already living in deprived circumstances. \u201cAt the moment, I\u2019m feeling completely overwhelmed by the misery that this is causing \u2013 the loss of work, the loss of relationships. People are going to be saying things to each other in their lockdown that they\u2019ll never be able to take back. I worry far more about the economic impact and the effect on those with Aids, TB or malaria in places where those conditions are overwhelming. And the impact on children. In places where life is hard, it will be harder.\u201d</p> <p>It is this that has given her some perspective while dealing with a week of abuse on social media. Her partner, Ben Andersen, a property developer, was diagnosed with Covid-19, and she was criticised online and in the press for taking her family to their house in Devon. She does have a house in London, but insists the family is based in Devon, and that they weren\u2019t escaping the capital for their \u201csecond home\u201d. It blew up on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019ve had some of the most unpleasant things said to me on social media that have ever been said to me.\u201d Devon, she says, \u201cis our home, 100%. It\u2019s the house that Ben had when I met him, and it\u2019s the only place that has been consistent in the lives of my stepchildren.\u201d Andersen has two sons from a previous relationship. \u201cWhen national newspapers use the internet to generate activity \u2013 when they go and look for negative things tweeted about people \u2013 they are bullying and they are generating hatred. Every single day on social media, people have said things to me. It\u2019s becoming less now, but yesterday somebody asked: \u2018Are you dead yet? You brought your vile, infected family to Devon.\u2019\u201d On the whole, she says, she can\u2019t allow herself to indulge in self-pity \u2013 her partner has recovered, the children are healthy, they have money and a home with outdoor space. \u201cI am in a far, far, better situation than 99.9% of the population. It\u2019s just that there will always be people out there who think I did something wrong, and I won\u2019t be able to change that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"27db60e1669cbd4f12209e9c971b19a93f84c99f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27db60e1669cbd4f12209e9c971b19a93f84c99f/32_54_2002_2500/801..jpg\" alt=\"Allsopp with her partner, Ben Andersen.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allsopp with her partner, Ben Andersen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later, she sends me a text apologising for being \u201cso gloomy\u201d. One thing that has changed for the better during this period, she says, is people\u2019s relationships with their neighbours. \u201cI\u2019m seeing stories every day about neighbourhood relations, and if that is the one thing that comes out of this \u2013 people knowing their neighbours \u2013 then that\u2019s enough for me.\u201d</p> <p>I interviewed Allsopp about 15 years ago, and I couldn\u2019t help but like her. She often gets herself into trouble with her pronouncements (that washing machines in the kitchen were \u201cdisgusting\u201d, that women should think about putting off going to university to have children earlier), but I admire her willingness to say what she thinks. If she is privileged in the extreme \u2013 she is the daughter of Charles Allsopp, the sixth Baron Hindlip, and former chairman of Christie\u2019s \u2013 at least she is aware of it. Her late mother, Fiona, an interior designer, was diagnosed with breast cancer when Allsopp was 17, an illness she would live with, on and off, for 25 years until her death in 2014. That shaped Allsopp\u2019s early adulthood, and alongside her experience of being a step-parent \u201cmeans that I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m completely lost in my privilege\u201d. Her job, she thinks \u2013 making TV shows about people looking for their next home \u2013 \u201calso enables me to both relate and be relatable. What my job has given me is something that I would never have had otherwise.\u201d Without spending 20 years seeing how more ordinary people lived, or at least those in a position to buy a house, \u201cI\u2019d have lived in my bubble. It would have been the life of an upper-middle-class country housewife. Who knows? Maybe not. Maybe I\u2019m doing myself an injustice. Maybe I would always have been interested in other people and other people\u2019s lives. I think that going all around the country, seeing houses, it would be good if more members of parliament did what I did.\u201d</p> <p>Allsopp is conspicuously posh \u2013 as in she has never pretended not to be \u2013 and well-connected. Her brother\u2019s godmother is the Duchess of Cornwall, who was a childhood friend of their mother\u2019s. She is careful not to talk about the royal family (\u201cMy mum was always very strict about never talking of any connection\u201d), but says Camilla is \u201ckind and straightforward in a way I appreciate more and more as I get older. I know quite a lot of women who are like her \u2013 they get things done.\u201d She has known David Cameron since they were young, and memorably described a dinner party once at which Michael Gove did some rapping. She has met Boris Johnson \u201cand I do know his sister Rachel\u201d. Are there too many privileged people in public life? She talks instead about education. \u201cMy children are in the independent school sector. I wish that we had [one universal form of] education; I wish that we could sort that out. The headteacher of my stepson\u2019s school wrote an article saying if they made it become a state school, he would rather close it because he felt that the school was independent and could do different things. I absolutely get that, but at the same time I recognise the divide.\u201d She doesn\u2019t make much of an effort to justify her own decision to send her children to private school beyond saying their father hated the London comprehensive they would have gone to (although the school is now rated outstanding). Should private schools be abolished? \u201cI think we should try to find a way,\u201d she says. \u201cThe problem is, it is a divide. It isn\u2019t a good thing, but it is so low on the list [of priorities] and after this it\u2019s going to be even lower.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c3c350fa77f1e9034751260fd04f3cdb40e5f6a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3c350fa77f1e9034751260fd04f3cdb40e5f6a6/30_0_2314_2891/800..jpg\" alt=\"With Phil Spencer in Location, Location, Location in 2004.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Phil Spencer in Location, Location, Location in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Allsopp grew up in Berkshire, the eldest of four, although for a long time it was just her and her younger brother. \u201cMy parents worked very hard to give us what they thought was an idyllic childhood. We lived in the middle of the country; we didn\u2019t have any friends whose house we could walk to. It was me and my brother, and I think I was more gregarious than that. I had forgotten about that until this week, and now I feel like I did when I was a child, longing for visitors to come.\u201d</p> <p>She went through several schools, never really settling. \u201cI was a pain in the arse,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cChildren are very conventional, and I wasn\u2019t. Now I probably seem much more conventional than I was as a child, but I\u2019m not a conventional person. And school didn\u2019t work for me.\u201d She has dyslexia, and has seen one of her own children deal with a similar issue. \u201cThe London independent day-school system doesn\u2019t want dyslexics \u2013 it\u2019s all about the academics. And the focus on academic stuff, and the lack of craft, art, drama and music. I struggle with it.\u201d</p> <p>Allsopp\u2019s mother had ME before being diagnosed with breast cancer and so Allsopp had always helped out at home a lot, particularly with her sisters. \u201cI wasn\u2019t dragged kicking and screaming out of a rave to look after my sisters,\u201d she says. \u201cI liked looking after them. I was always very maternal and housey. I went through a stage of thinking maybe if my mother hadn\u2019t been ill, I\u2019d have gone to raves and done lots of E, and had the early 20s that a lot of my contemporaries did, but I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s true any more.\u201d One of her sisters has had a preventive mastectomy, but Allsopp decided against it (\u201cShe was younger and it\u2019s very tough surgery\u201d), even though she says she believes there is between a 50% and 80% chance of her developing breast cancer. It\u2019s not something she worries too much about, she says. \u201cI don\u2019t do health anxiety. I never have, not about myself, Ben or the kids. It may be that there was a lot of it around when I was a teen or I may be missing a chip.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve always put a caveat on all my predictions for property: \u2018aside from an unforeseen world event\u2019.

I wasn\u2019t interested in a career. And then what happened to me was incredibly lucky. And also it was my very domesticity which led to my job.\u201d It was the Guardian journalist Jonathan Freedland who inadvertently kicked off Allsopp\u2019s television career \u2013 she was running a property-finding company and found him a flat. He wrote about her in the paper, and a TV production company contacted her and gave her a screen test opposite Phil Spencer, another property agent it had already hired to present the show. She didn\u2019t expect to get the job long-term, but agreed to film the pilot. \u201cThey were paying me \u00a3600 a day! Can you imagine? I was self-employed, and I was paid for three days, plus travel, and they put us in a hotel. Of course I was going to say yes to that.

Well, that is this.\u201d One of the things this crisis is highlighting, now we are forced to stay at home, is the vast divide in housing. \u201cThere are so many homes that are not fit for purpose,\u201d says Allsopp. \u201cWhat housebuilders have been allowed to get away with \u2026 they just built substandard homes and it will come back to haunt all of us.

What have they done? They\u2019d have to make quite a mess to voluntarily get the Hoover out.\u201d Another pause to listen. \u201cIt\u2019s good, they\u2019re learning. There are some benefits to the lockdown. In my lighter moments I can see those.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A year ago, hoax theories about the dangers of 5G had barely pierced the public\u2019s consciousness, largely remaining confined to serious conspiracy theorists such as David Icke.</p> <p>In recent weeks, baseless claims about risks associated with the next-generation mobile technology have gone mainstream. Claims linking 5G to the coronavirus pandemic have led to petrol bomb attacks on phone masts and rebuttals from the government.</p> <p>Industry insiders and factchecking experts point to a perfect storm of conditions that have helped the theory \u2013 described as \u201cdangerous nonsense\u201d \u2013 to take hold.</p> <p>They cite the rapid growth of neighbourhood social media groups, a failure by networks to promote scientific evidence about 5G, and a terrified population looking to make sense of a world turned upside down.</p> <p>The government and mobile networks have been left scrambling as the some members of the public have turned on telecoms engineers and carried out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/06/at-least-20-uk-phone-masts-vandalised-over-false-5g-coronavirus-claims\">arson attacks</a> on masts that in many cases do not yet have 5G equipment, as the rollout has been so slow.</p> <p>Tom Phillips, the editor of the factchecking organisation Full Fact, said it warned last summer about the growing prevalence of 5G health claims. But in recent weeks debunked claims about 5G had been transformed, potentially aided by the creation of new local Facebook and WhatsApp groups to help support neighbours during the pandemic. Google Trends data suggests British interest in 5G theories exploded in the final days of March, shortly after the lockdown was imposed.</p> <p>Phillips said one of the difficulties in battling the various claims was that it is <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/5G-not-accelerating-coronavirus/\">hard to pin down exactly what is being suggested</a>. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen theories that the virus is real but 5G is making it worse, we\u2019ve seen theories that the symptoms are not the result of the virus but purely the result of 5G, and we\u2019ve seen theories that there are no outbreaks at all but it\u2019s all a hoax to cover up the installation of 5G,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A senior member of staff at one UK mobile network blamed the rapid spread of a map that purported to show an overlap between countries that had coronavirus cases and countries that had rolled out 5G. The map was not accurate on either measure.</p> <p>Other viral claims emphasised other supposed coincidences. A popular claim that Wuhan was the first city in the world to receive 5G took hold. But Wuhan received 5G coverage in August 2019, almost 18 months after O2 <a href=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/02/22/o2_jumps_on_5g_bandwagon/\">launched its first London testbed for the technology</a> on the Greenwich peninsula. Iran, meanwhile, has seen an incredibly high number of coronavirus cases despite not having any 5G coverage.</p> <p>The International Commission on Non\u2010Ionizing Radiation Protection, which sets guidelines on the output of mobile masts, says there is not a single scientifically substantiated adverse health effect that can be attributed to a normal 5G installation.</p> <p>\u201cWe know parts of the community are concerned about the safety of 5G,\u201d Dr Eric van Rongen, the chair of the ICNIRP, told the Guardian. \u201cThe guidelines have been developed after a thorough review of all relevant scientific literature, scientific workshops and an extensive public consultation process.\u201d</p> <p>As social media interest in the topic grew, some less scrupulous news outlets latched on to it as a potential source of clicks. The press regulation campaign group Hacked Off has noted that the Daily Star published an article on 24 March \u2013 the day after Boris Johnson ordered Britons to stay inside \u2013 with the headline \u201cCoronavirus: Fears 5G wifi networks could be acting as \u2018accelerator\u2019 for disease\u201d. The story, labelled as an exclusive, relied entirely on quotes from non-scientists.</p> <p>Celebrities who often have larger audiences on Twitter and Instagram than many mainstream news outlets also boosted the theory, although some have since backed down. After the Britain\u2019s Got Talent judge Amanda Holden was mocked for tweeting a link to a petition about the theory, her representative told media outlets that she had accidentally shared the link and did not endorse conspiracy theories.</p> <p>Facing pressure from the government and a showdown with ministers, Facebook announced on Monday that it would start to actively remove false claims that linked Covid-19 to 5G and could lead to physical harm. However, its policy on other scientifically unjustified claims about 5G remain unclear.</p> <p>Users on one of the biggest anti-5G Facebook groups in the UK mix pictures of apparently burnt-out mobile phone equipment with anti-vaccine material and baseless claims that coronavirus wards on hospitals are empty. </p> <p>One prominent anti-5G group in Bristol defended itself from critics by adopting the language of those who distrust mainstream media and scientific voices, claiming that rejecting authoritative voices was the only way to find what is really going on.</p> <p>Direct action in the UK against telephone masts is nothing new. When 3G equipment was being installed across the country in the mid-2000s there was similar outbreaks of concern about supposed health risks, with some resorting to direct action. </p> <p>A long-running protest campaign against a mobile phone mast in the North Yorkshire village of Sheriff Hutton, partly on health grounds, culminated in a <a href=\"https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/1850920.controversial-village-mast-hit-in-40000-vandal-attack/\">mysterious incident in 2007</a> in which concrete was poured into the base station. </p> <p>Similar claims have been made for decades about the <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nuke-of-earl/\">impact of microwave ovens</a> and home wifi connections.</p> <p>Yet despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/26/how-baseless-fears-over-5g-rollout-created-a-health-scare\">warnings that public fears about 5G were growing</a> before the pandemic, networks did little large-scale outreach work to counter the concerns. \u201cI think as an industry we could have been quicker and clearer about what 5G is,\u201d one network insider said. \u201cAs in, it\u2019s basically the same as 4G in terms of how it uses mobile spectrum. We tend to get a bit bogged down on the technology and miss the wider picture.\u201d</p> <p>Tom Phillips, the factchecking journalist, said it was always tough to convince people to change their minds on such topics once they had decided a theory was true. He also said people who believed the theories needed to be treated with compassion. </p> <p>\u201cIt is not enough to try and stamp out the poor quality information, you do have to put good information in its place,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as soon you try to provide information, you run the risk of becoming part of the conspiracy theory \u2013 \u2018you would say that, wouldn\u2019t you?\u2019\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Unity has not lasted long \u2013 and the rebellion is breaking out from the right. What started as carping about police officiousness is grumbling its way to deep dissent on the entire coronavirus lockdown policy. Reported conflict between Matt Hancock at Health and Rishi Sunak at the Treasury on its costs and benefits leak into the rightwing press in what begins to be a profound culture war \u2013 your money or your life.</p> <p>It rises up in the Mail, Times and Telegraph.

As Swedish corona cases rise they too may swerve, though if they stayed as they are they would act as the world\u2019s control.</p> <p>This attitude has spread from the usual rightwing exhibitionists and contrarians into comments by those such as Luke Johnson, chair of Risk Capital Partners and the Institute of Cancer Research. In the <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/were-staring-at-a-great-depression-6xklb6pv7\">Sunday Times</a><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/were-staring-at-a-great-depression-6xklb6pv7\"> </a>he says that with \u201can exaggerated fear of falling ill from coronavirus and dying \u2013 we have idled the nation and all become hypochondriacs\u201d. He fears for the moral fibre of the nation: \u201cThe shutdown is helping to erode the work ethic of a generation.\u201d</p> <p>Expect this low rumble to build into a libertarian crescendo, despite polls showing the country massively in favour of life-saving isolation, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/queen-praises-the-people-if-not-the-government-and-pulls-off-a-tough-gig\">the Queen</a> catching the national mood. The opposition questions the delays, dithering, disastrous lack of testing and the austerity-stricken unpreparedness of the public sector \u2013 but crucially not the lockdown itself. When it\u2019s all over, when costs have been reckoned against deaths and the long-term social and economic damage assessed, we may know who was right, though with life-and-death stakes in this cultural rift, we cannot expect either side to admit defeat.</p> <p>Before going to hospital, <a href=\"https://vote.conservatives.com/news/party-leaders-tackle-coronavirus\">Boris Johnson asserted</a> he had \u201ca scientifically led, step by step action plan\u201d. He didn\u2019t, he has zigzagged, but at least that sounds sensible. Yet it\u2019s hard to follow \u201cthe science\u201d when epidemiologists fall out. Who\u2019s right on the numbers and death toll, the Imperial College London alarmist or the Oxford University moderate? We do have a baseline for acceptable UK flu deaths: there was no outcry over the winter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/07/number-deaths-england-wales-12-year-high-life-expectancy\">2014-15 flu toll of 28,189</a>. Any wise government would have been petrified by <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\">Imperial\u2019s worst case warning</a> of 510,000 dead if no action was taken. Now watch each side pick their scientists to suit their own cast of mind.</p> <p>On the great question, the public wants no price put on lives: if asked, they want every cancer drug at any price even if it delays death for just a few months. People prefer everyday political decisions weighing life against money to be done through a glass darkly. Less money for the homeless, social care, poor families or maternity services leads directly to deaths, as has been forensically measured by <a href=\"https://www.health.org.uk/publications/reports/the-marmot-review-10-years-on\">Michael Marmot of the Institute of Health Equity</a>. Poverty kills, infant deaths are rising for the first time in decades, and poorer women are dying younger \u2013 though that never worries the right. This economic shutdown will kill and harm: the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Resolution Foundation show that the youngest, lowest paid and women will be most damaged. Cancer Research UK\u2019s chief clinician, Professor Charles Swanton, warns that curable cancers <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/coronavirus-lockdown-will-cost-the-lives-of-cancer-patients-6p78hlrbt\">will become inoperable</a> as treatments stop. There is no avoiding trade-offs, though they can always be hidden. Casting off the lives of the old to save young futures looks brutal \u2013 but for the poorest old, lack of social care and day centres already curtails lives.</p> <p>It is not just in a crisis that healthcare is rationed. Labour set up the admirable National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) to make that explicit: in treatment costs, one quality-adjusted life year (a qaly) is worth \u00a330,000. Professor Gill Leng, the institute\u2019s new head, was asked to produce rapid Covid-19 guidelines but, uniquely, \u201cwe were advised cost was not an issue\u201d, she says. \u201cOnly what\u2019s best for the service.\u201d For adult critical care, Nice\u2019s algorithm uses the clinical frailty scale, \u201ca holistic approach\u201d. Dementia is rightly included as an adverse frailty in the score card. </p> <p>Will Nice ever evaluate in qalys whether the losses from a stricken economy were worth the gains in life years saved in the lockdown? That all depends, Leng says, on the quality of the data: she hopes someone is trying to evaluate it. For now, \u201cthe key question is exit, how do we get out of this?\u201d Testing is vital, but she opposes releasing the lucky ones who are immune first. \u201cIn the end only solidarity, all in this together, will see us through.\u201d</p> <p>How odd that it\u2019s the usually \u201cpatriotic\u201d voices, the \u201cblitz spirit\u201d nostalgists on the right who are first to break that solidarity.</p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>Disasters begin suddenly and never really end. The future will not, in crucial ways, be anything like the past, even the very recent past of a month or two ago. Our economy, our priorities, our perceptions will not be what they were at the outset of this year. The particulars are startling: companies such as GE and Ford retooling to make ventilators, the scramble for protective gear, once-bustling city streets becoming quiet and empty, the economy in freefall. Things that were supposed to be unstoppable stopped, and things that were supposed to be impossible \u2013 extending workers\u2019 rights and benefits, freeing prisoners, moving a few trillion dollars around in the US \u2013 have already happened.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/27/rebecca-solnit-impossible-has-already-happened-coronavirus-hope-podcast\">'The impossible has already happened': what coronavirus can teach us about hope' \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The word \u201ccrisis\u201d means, in medical terms, the crossroads a patient reaches, the point at which she will either take the road to recovery or to death. The word \u201cemergency\u201d comes from \u201cemergence\u201d or \u201cemerge\u201d, as if you were ejected from the familiar and urgently need to reorient. The word \u201ccatastrophe\u201d comes from a root meaning a sudden overturning.</p> <p>We have reached a crossroads, we have emerged from what we assumed was normality, things have suddenly overturned. One of our main tasks now \u2013 especially those of us who are not sick, are not frontline workers, and are not dealing with other economic or housing difficulties \u2013 is to understand this moment, what it might require of us, and what it might make possible.</p> <p>A disaster (which originally meant \u201cill-starred\u201d, or \u201cunder a bad star\u201d) changes the world and our view of it. Our focus shifts, and what matters shifts. What is weak breaks under new pressure, what is strong holds, and what was hidden emerges. Change is not only possible, we are swept away by it. We ourselves change as our priorities shift, as intensified awareness of mortality makes us wake up to our own lives and the preciousness of life. Even our definition of \u201cwe\u201d might change as we are separated from schoolmates or co-workers, sharing this new reality with strangers. Our sense of self generally comes from the world around us, and right now, we are finding another version of who we are.</p> <p>As the pandemic upended our lives, people around me worried that they were having trouble focusing and being productive. It was, I suspected, because we were all doing other, more important work. When you\u2019re recovering from an illness, pregnant or young and undergoing a growth spurt, you\u2019re working all the time, especially when it appears you\u2019re doing nothing. Your body is growing, healing, making, transforming and labouring below the threshold of consciousness. As we struggled to learn the science and statistics of this terrible scourge, our psyches were doing something equivalent. We were adjusting to the profound social and economic changes, studying the lessons disasters teach, equipping ourselves for an unanticipated world.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The first lesson a disaster teaches is that everything is connected. In fact, disasters, I found while living through a medium-sized one (the 1989 earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area) and later writing about major ones (including 9/11, Hurricane Katrina and the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/24/the-school-beneath-the-wave-the-unimaginable-tragedy-of-japans-tsunami\" title=\"\">Fukushima nuclear catastrophe</a> in Japan), are crash courses in those connections. At moments of immense change, we see with new clarity the systems \u2013 political, economic, social, ecological \u2013 in which we are immersed as they change around us. We see what\u2019s strong, what\u2019s weak, what\u2019s corrupt, what matters and what doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>I often think of these times as akin to a spring thaw: it\u2019s as if the pack ice has broken up, the water starts flowing again and boats can move through places they could not during winter. The ice was the arrangement of power relations that we call the status quo \u2013 it seems to be stable, and those who benefit from it often insist that it\u2019s unchangeable. Then it changes fast and dramatically, and that can be exhilarating, terrifying, or both.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"da770de80664c79144b58547c01984bf1a40bb45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da770de80664c79144b58547c01984bf1a40bb45/0_34_2000_1200/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Flooding in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in September 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flooding in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in September 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those who benefit most from the shattered status quo are often more focused on preserving or reestablishing it than protecting human life \u2013 as we saw when a chorus of US conservatives and corporate top dogs insisted that, for the sake of the stock market, everyone had to go back to work, and that the resultant deaths would be an acceptable price to pay. In a crisis, the powerful often try to seize more power \u2013 as they have in this round, with the Trump Department of Justice looking at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/donald-trump-coronavirus-emergency-powers-abuse\" title=\"\">suspending</a> constitutional rights \u2013 and the rich seek more riches: two Republican <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/republican-senators-sold-stocks-before-markets-plunged-on-coronavirus-fears-reports\" title=\"\">senators</a> are under fire for allegedly using inside information about the coming pandemic to make a profit in the stock market (although both have denied wrongdoing).</p> <p>Disaster scholars use the term \u201celite panic\u201d to describe the ways that elites react when they assume that ordinary people will behave badly. When elites describe \u201cpanic\u201d and \u201clooting\u201d in the streets, these are usually misnomers for ordinary people doing what they need to do to survive or care for others. Sometimes it\u2019s wise to move rapidly from danger; sometimes it\u2019s altruistic to gather supplies to share.</p> <p>Such elites often prioritise profit and property over human life and community. In the days after a huge earthquake struck San Francisco on 18 April 1906, the US military swarmed over the city, convinced that ordinary people were a threat and a source of disorder. The mayor issued a \u201cshoot to kill\u201d <a href=\"http://www.sfmuseum.org/1906.2/killproc.html\" title=\"\">proclamation</a> against looters, and the soldiers believed they were restoring order. What they were actually doing was setting inexpert firebreaks that helped fire spread through the city, and shooting or beating citizens who disobeyed orders (sometimes those orders were to let the fires burn down their own homes and neighbourhoods). Ninety-nine years later, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans\u2019s police and white vigilantes did the same thing: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/19/new-orleans-reaches-settlements-for-police-shootings-after-hurricane-katrina\" title=\"\">shooting black people</a> in the name of defending property and their own authority. The local, state and federal government insisted on treating a stranded, mostly poor, mostly black population as dangerous enemies to be contained and controlled, rather than victims of a catastrophe to be aided.</p> <p>The mainstream media colluded in obsessing about looting in the aftermath of Katrina. The stock of mass-manufactured goods in large corporate chain stores seemed to matter more than people needing food and clean water, or grandmothers left clinging to roofs. Nearly 1,500 people died of a disaster that had more to do with bad government than with bad weather. The US Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 levees <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/us/decade-after-katrina-pointing-finger-more-firmly-at-army-corps.html\" title=\"\">had failed</a>; the city had no evacuation plans for the poor, and President George W Bush\u2019s administration failed to deliver prompt and effective relief. The same calculus is happening now. A member of the Brazilian opposition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/tp-captain-corona\" title=\"\">said</a> of Brazil\u2019s rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro: \u201cHe represents the most perverse economic interests that couldn\u2019t care less about people\u2019s lives. They\u2019re worried about maintaining their profitability.\u201d (Bolsonaro claims he is trying to protect workers and the economy.)</p> <p>The billionaire evangelist who owns the arts and crafts chain Hobby Lobby claimed <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hobby-lobby-reportedly-leaving-stores-open-message-from-god-2020-3\" title=\"\">divine guidance</a> in keeping his workers at their jobs when businesses were ordered to close. (The company has now <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/hobby-lobby-closes-stores-defying-coronavirus-stay-home/story?id=69975963\" title=\"\">closed</a> all its stores.) At Uline Corporation, owned by billionaire Trump backers Richard and Liz Uihlein, a <a href=\"about:blank\" title=\"\">memo</a> sent to Wisconsin workers said: \u201cplease do NOT tell your peers about the symptoms &amp; your assumptions. By doing so, you are causing unnecessary panic in the office.\u201d The billionaire founder and chairman of payroll processing corporation Paychex, Tom Golisano, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/bankers-trump-economy-coronavirus-deaths\" title=\"\">said</a>: \u201cThe damages of keeping the economy closed as it is could be worse than losing a few more people.\u201d (Golisano has since said his comments were misrepresented, and has apologised.)</p> <p>Historically, there have always been titans of industry who prized the lifeless thing that is profit over living beings, who paid bribes in order to operate unhindered, worked children to death or put labourers in mortal danger in sweatshops and coal mines. There were also those who pressed on with fossil fuel extraction and burning despite what they knew, or refused to know, about climate change. One of the primary uses of wealth has always been to buy your way out of the common fate, or, at least, it has come with a belief that you can disassociate from society at large. And while the rich are often conservative, conservatives more often align with the rich, whatever their economic status.</p> <p>The idea that everything is connected is an affront to conservatives who cherish a macho every-man-for-himself frontier fantasy. Climate change has been a huge insult to them \u2013 this science that says what comes out of our cars and chimneys shapes the fate of the world in the long run and affects crops, sea level, forest fires and so much more. If everything is connected, then the consequences of every choice and act and word have to be examined, which we see as love in action and they see as impingement upon absolute freedom, freedom being another word for absolutely no limits on the pursuit of self-interest. Ultimately, a significant portion of conservatives and corporate leaders regard science as an annoyance that they can refuse to recognise. Some insist they can choose whatever rules and facts they want, as though these too are just free-market commodities to pick and choose from or remake according to one\u2019s whims. \u201cThis denial of science and critical thinking among religious ultraconservatives now haunts the American response to the coronavirus crisis,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/opinion/coronavirus-trump-evangelicals.html?fbclid=IwAR1ChJXKIYTvBcrDKcjwU3UJJ6Dj1SeAbA82KPoTvRlYR2IphLKj8qZ_dzQ\" title=\"\">wrote</a> the journalist Katherine Stewart in the New York Times.</p> <p>Our rulers showed little willingness to recognise the ominous possibilities of the pandemic in the US, the UK, Brazil and many other countries. They failed in their most important job, and denying that failure will be a major focus for them. And while it may be inevitable that the pandemic will result in an economic crash, it is also turning into an opportunity for authoritarian power grabs in the Philippines, Hungary, Israel and the US \u2013 a reminder that the largest problems are still political, and so are their solutions.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>When a storm subsides, the air is washed clean of whatever particulate matter has been obscuring the view, and you can often see farther and more sharply than at any other time. When this storm clears, we may, as do people who have survived a serious illness or accident, see where we were and where we should go in a new light. We may feel free to pursue change in ways that seemed impossible while the ice of the status quo was locked up. We may have a profoundly different sense of ourselves, our communities, our systems of production and our future.</p> <p>For many of us in the developed world, what has changed most immediately is spatial. We have stayed home, those of us who have homes, and away from contact with others. We have withdrawn from schools, workplaces, conferences, vacations, gyms, errands, parties, bars, clubs, churches, mosques, synagogues, from the busyness and bustle of everyday life. The philosopher-mystic Simone Weil once wrote to a faraway friend: \u201cLet us love this distance, which is thoroughly woven with friendship, since those who do not love each other are not separated.\u201d We have withdrawn from each other to protect each other. And people have found ways to help the vulnerable, despite the need to remain physically distant.</p> <p>My friend Renato Redentor Constantino, a climate campaigner, wrote to me from the Philippines, and said: \u201cWe are witness today to daily displays of love that remind us of the many reasons why humans have survived this long. We encounter epic acts of courage and citizenship each day in our neighbourhoods and in other cities and countries, instances that whisper to us that the depredations of a few will eventually be overcome by legions of stubborn people who refuse the counsel of despair, violence, indifference and arrogance that so-called leaders appear so eager nowadays to trigger.\u201d</p> <p>When we are no longer trying to unlink ourselves from the chain of a spreading disease, I wonder if we will rethink how we were linked, how we moved about and how the goods we rely on moved about. Perhaps we will appreciate the value of direct face-to-face contact more. Perhaps the Europeans who have sung together from their balconies or applauded together for their medical workers, and the Americans who came out to sing or dance on their suburban blocks, will have a different sense of belonging. Perhaps we will find a new respect for the workers who produce our food and those who bring it to our tables.</p> <p>Although staying put is hard, maybe we will be reluctant to resume our rushing about, and something of the stillness now upon us will stay with us. We may rethink the wisdom of having much of our most vital stuff \u2013 medicine, medical equipment \u2013 made on other continents. We may also rethink the precarious just-in-time supply chains. I have often thought that the wave of privatisation that has characterised our neoliberal age began with the privatisation of the human heart, the withdrawal from a sense of a shared fate and social bonds. It is to be hoped that this shared experience of catastrophe will reverse the process. A new awareness of how each of us belongs to the whole and depends on it may strengthen the case for meaningful climate action, as we learn that sudden and profound change is possible after all.</p> <p>\u201cGetting and spending, we lay waste our powers,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45564/the-world-is-too-much-with-us\" title=\"\">Wordsworth wrote</a>, a little more than 200 years ago. Perhaps this will be the moment that we recognise that there is enough food, clothing, shelter, healthcare and education for all \u2013 and that access to these things should not depend on what job you do and whether you earn enough money. Perhaps the pandemic is also making the case, for those who were not already convinced, for universal healthcare and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/17/universal-basic-income-ideas-are-part-of-emergency-coronavirus-plan.html\" title=\"\">basic income</a>.

What she told me about the aftermath of the 1972 earthquake in Managua \u2013 that, despite the dictatorship\u2019s crackdown, it helped bring on the revolution \u2013 was unforgettable. She said: \u201cYou had a sense of what was important. And people realised that what was important was freedom and being able to decide your life and agency. Two days later you had this tyrant imposing a curfew, imposing martial law. The sense of oppression on top of the catastrophe was really unbearable. And once you had realised that your life can be decided by one night of the Earth deciding to shake, [you thought]: \u2018So what? I want to live a good life and I want to risk my life, because I can also lose my life in one night.\u2019 You realise that life has to be lived well or is not worth living. It\u2019s a very profound transformation that takes place during catastrophes.\u201d</p> <p>I have found over and over that the proximity of death in shared calamity makes many people more urgently alive, less attached to the small things in life and more committed to the big ones, often including civil society or the common good.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>I have mostly written about 20th-century disasters, but one analogy a bit further back comes to mind: the Black Death, which wiped out a third of Europe\u2019s population, and, in England, later led to peasant revolts against war taxes and wage caps that were officially quashed, but nevertheless led to more rights and freedoms for peasants and labourers. In the emergency legislation passed in the US in March, many workers gained new sick-leave rights. Lots of things we were assured were impossible \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/coronavirus/oakland-hotels-housing-the-homeless-during-coronavirus-pandemic/2264355/\" title=\"\">housing the homeless</a>, for example \u2013 have come to pass in some places.</p> <p>Ireland nationalised its hospitals, something \u201cwe were told would never happen and could never happen,\u201d an Irish journalist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/newschambers/status/1242518486150197248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1242518486150197248&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.commondreams.org%2Fnews%2F2020%2F03%2F26%2Fireland-nationalizes-hospitals-duration-coronavirus\" title=\"\">commented</a>.

In the US, we have seen powerful labour agitation, and results. Workers at Whole Foods, Instacart and Amazon have protested at being forced to work in unsafe conditions during the pandemic. (Whole Foods has since offered workers who test positive two weeks off on full pay; Instacart says it has made changes to safeguard workers and shoppers, while Amazon said it is \u201cfollowing guidelines\u201d on safety.) Some workers have gained new rights and raises, including almost <a href=\"https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/coronavirus/kroger-grocery-worker-in-texas-receive-pay-raises-new-benefits-during-coronavirus-outbreak/2343540/\" title=\"\">half a million Kroger</a> grocery store workers, while 15 state attorneys-general <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/state-ags-tell-amazon-to-boost-paid-sick-leave-during-coronavirus-crisis/\" title=\"\">told Amazon</a> to expand its paid sick leave.

The 2008 financial collapse led to 2011\u2019s Occupy Wall Street uprising, which prompted a new reckoning with economic inequality and a new scrutiny of the human impact of exploitative mortgages, student loans, for profit-colleges, health-insurance systems and more, and that in turn amplified the profiles of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, whose ideas have helped pull the Democratic party to the left, towards policies that will make the US fairer and more equal. The conversations stirred by Occupy and its sister movements across the globe incited more critical scrutiny of ruling powers, and more demands for economic justice. Changes in the public sphere originate within the individual, but also, changes in the world at large affect our sense of self, our priorities and our sense of the possible.</p> <p>We are only in the early stages of this disaster, and we are also in a strange stillness. It is like the Christmas truce of 1914, when German and English soldiers stopped fighting for a day, the guns fell silent and soldiers mingled freely. War itself paused. There\u2019s a way that our getting and spending has been a kind of war against the Earth. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, carbon emissions have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-pandemic-leading-to-huge-drop-in-air-pollution\" title=\"\">plummeted</a>. Reports say the air above Los Angeles, Beijing and New Delhi is miraculously clean. Parks all over the US are shut to visitors, which may have a beneficial effect on wildlife. In the last government shutdown of 2018-2019, elephant seals at Point Reyes National Seashore just north of San Francisco <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-elephant-seals-point-reyes-20190523-story.html\" title=\"\">took over a new beach</a>, and now own it for the duration of their season of mating and birthing on land.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s another analogy that comes to mind. When a caterpillar enters its chrysalis, it dissolves itself, quite literally, into liquid. In this state, what was a caterpillar and will be a butterfly is neither one nor the other, it\u2019s a sort of living soup. Within this living soup are the imaginal cells that will catalyse its transformation into winged maturity. May the best among us, the most visionary, the most inclusive, be the imaginal cells \u2013 for now we are in the soup. The outcome of disasters is not foreordained. It\u2019s a conflict, one that takes place while things that were frozen, solid and locked up have become open and fluid \u2013 full of both the best and worst possibilities. We are both becalmed and in a state of profound change.</p> <p>But this is also a time of depth for those spending more time at home and more time alone, looking outward at this unanticipated world. We often divide emotions into good and bad, happy and sad, but I think they can equally be divided into shallow and deep, and the pursuit of what is supposed to be happiness is often a flight from depth, from one\u2019s own interior life and the suffering around us \u2013 and not being happy is often framed as a failure. But there is meaning as well as pain in sadness, mourning and grief, the emotions born of empathy and solidarity. If you are sad and frightened, it is a sign that you care, that you are connected in spirit. If you are overwhelmed \u2013 well, it is overwhelming, and it will take decades of study, analysis, discussion and contemplation to understand how and why 2020 suddenly took us all into marshy new territory.</p> <p>Seven years ago, Patrisse Cullors wrote a sort of mission statement for Black Lives Matter: \u201cProvide hope and inspiration for collective action to build collective power to achieve collective transformation. Rooted in grief and rage but pointed towards vision and dreams.\u201d It is beautiful not only because it is hopeful, not only because then Black Lives Matter set out and did transformative work, but because it acknowledges that hope can coexist with difficulty and suffering. The sadness in the depths and the fury that burns above are not incompatible with hope, because we are complex creatures, because hope is not optimism that everything will be fine regardless.</p> <p>Hope offers us clarity that, amid the uncertainty ahead, there will be conflicts worth joining and the possibility of winning some of them. And one of the things most dangerous to this hope is the lapse into believing that everything was fine before disaster struck, and that all we need to do is return to things as they were. Ordinary life before the pandemic was already a catastrophe of desperation and exclusion for too many human beings, an environmental and climate catastrophe, an obscenity of inequality. It is too soon to know what will emerge from this emergency, but not too soon to start looking for chances to help decide it. It is, I believe, what many of us are preparing to do.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>This weekend, Donald Trump used his daily White House coronavirus briefings to again urge Americans to take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/coronavirus-us-ventilators-new-york-trump-touts-unproven-cure-malaria-drug\">hydroxychloroquine</a>, an anti-malaria drug that has not been shown to be safe or effective against Covid-19.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat do you have to lose? Take it,\u201d the president said on Saturday as he boasted that the US had amassed 29m doses of the drug. On Sunday, facing questions from the press about his aggressive promotion of an unproven treatment, he argued against waiting for the completion of clinical trials. \u201cIn France, they had a very good test,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have time to go and say, \u2018Gee, let\u2019s take a couple of years and test it out, and let\u2019s go and test with the test tubes and the laboratories.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Dr Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s top infectious disease doctor, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/coronavirus-us-ventilators-new-york-trump-touts-unproven-cure-malaria-drug\">repeatedly warned</a> that there is no conclusive evidence to support using the drug.

Belief in the drug\u2019s potential to cure patients infected with the virus followed an extraordinary trajectory from a small study conducted in France (Trump\u2019s \u201cvery good test\u201d) to Silicon Valley social media influencers, Fox News and the largest bully pulpit: the White House.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Epidemics are dangerous to rulers</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Aaron Shakow, Harvard Medical School</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But it\u2019s also a story as old as medicine itself. When an epidemic killed thousands in ancient Rome, said Aaron Shakow, a research associate at Harvard Medical School and historian of medicine, the chief physician of the emperor Nero circulated a recipe for an old miracle cure.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was an attempt by Nero to sustain his legitimacy in the midst of this catastrophic event,\u201d Shakow said. \u201cEpidemics are dangerous to rulers.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>A deeply flawed study</strong></h2> \n<p>In early March, as the coronavirus pandemic accelerated its spread around the globe, a group of scientists in Marseille, France, launched an experiment to see whether hydroxychloroquine, a well-known old malaria drug, could be what everyone was searching for: a cure.</p> \n<p>Most small scientific studies live and die within the rarified domain of academic journals, but the French trial had a much more auspicious debut. Before the study was even <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300996#bib0012\">published</a>, in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents (IJAA), a lawyer falsely claiming an affiliation with Stanford University appeared on Fox News\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/media/3860681\">Tucker Carlson Tonight</a> to declare the results: a \u201c100% cure rate against coronavirus\u201d. From Fox News, it was only a matter of time (hours, in fact) before the drug was being hailed as a \u201cgame changer\u201d by the president of the United States.</p> \n<p>Trump made his first endorsement of hydroxychloroquine on 19 March. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/25/can-chloroquine-really-help-treat-coronavirus-patients\">Export controls</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/vital-drug-people-lupus-coronavirus-covid-19-link-hydroxychloroquine\">shortages</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-cure-kills-man-after-trump-touts-chloroquine-phosphate\">overdoses</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/insane-many-scientists-lament-trump-s-embrace-risky-malaria-drugs-coronavirus\">scientific recriminations</a> rapidly ensued, but the controversy could not extinguish the power of presidentially endorsed hope. Across the globe and throughout diverse communities on the internet, hydroxychloroquine had been anointed the miracle cure for Covid-19.</p> \n<p>The only problem? The study that all this fervid hope is based on doesn\u2019t show what its authors claim it does.</p> \n<p>The gold standard for a clinical trial is a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT). What this means in plain English is that the study has been designed to reduce biases that would render its results meaningless. Neither the physician nor the patients knows whether they received the drug (\u201cdouble-blinded\u201d), a safeguard that reduces the possibility that the doctor will treat the two groups differently. The researchers also do not get to choose which patients go into which group (\u201crandomized\u201d) and the makeup of the two groups is roughly equivalent (\u201ccontrolled\u201d).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c95599ea2c0b5dae6272361950eb3cdc01c1b1ff\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c95599ea2c0b5dae6272361950eb3cdc01c1b1ff/0_0_4000_2666/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at a White House press briefing on Monday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at a White House press briefing on Monday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The French hydroxychloroquine study did not follow any of these rules.</p> \n<p>The treatment group and the control group were drawn from separate populations: the treatment group were all patients at the institution where the researchers worked, the M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection University Hospital Institute in Marseille, while the control patients came from other hospitals in the south of France. The treatment group (mean age 51.2) was significantly older than the control group (mean age 37.3), introducing another variable that could undermine the meaning of the results. The study was \u201copen label\u201d, meaning the physicians and patients knew which treatment they were receiving. The French researchers also treated some but not all of the treatment group patients with azithromycin, a common antibiotic, another complicating factor that was not randomized.</p> \n<p>But even more important than these shortcomings in the design of the study is how the researchers chose to measure and report their results. Forty-two patients were initially included in the study. Three were transferred to the intensive care unit; one died, one left the hospital, and one stopped taking the treatment due to nausea. The other 36 eventually recovered, and those who received the drug cleared the virus from the system faster than those who did not.</p> \n<p>If you had only heard about this study from the Fox News assertion of a \u201c100% cure rate\u201d, you might assume that the four patients with poor clinical outcomes (the three ICU visits and one death) had been unlucky enough to be in the group that did not receive the \u201ccure\u201d.</p> \n<p>And yet, those four patients, as well as the patient with nausea and the one who left the hospital early, were all part of the treatment group. They were excluded from the topline results of the study because of the way that the researchers chose to measure and report the results: strictly based on the measurable presence of viruses in nasal swabs taken each day of the study. Since the patients were in the ICU or dead, their samples could not be taken and they were left out of the final analysis. Based on the nasal swabs of just the 36 patients who completed the study, those who received the drug cleared the virus from their systems faster than those who did not.</p> \n<p>This is how an experiment in which 15% of the treatment group and 0% of the control had poor clinical outcomes could end up being reported as showing a \u201c100% cure rate\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6daee2422b4580ffef4e3864e9ec27a2d84b5a74\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6daee2422b4580ffef4e3864e9ec27a2d84b5a74/0_124_6335_3803/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Didier Raoult, corresponding author for the French study.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Didier Raoult, corresponding author for the French study.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: G\u00e9rard Julien/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On 3 April, two weeks after the study was first published online, the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, which publishes the IJAA, said in a <a href=\"https://www.isac.world/news-and-publications/official-isac-statement\">statement</a> that the group\u2019s board \u201cbelieves the article does not meet the Society\u2019s expected standard, especially relating to the lack of better explanations of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety\u201d.</p> \n<p>Didier Raoult, the corresponding author for the French study, did not respond to questions from the Guardian.</p> \n<p>Andrew Noymer, a professor of public health at the University of California, Irvine, described the results of the French study as \u201cmeaningless\u201d. \u201cThey should have done an RCT,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis idea that we\u2019re all manning the lifeboats and there\u2019s no time for that is just absurd,\u201d Noymer added. \u201cThey could have already done it.

It was shared on Twitter by a number of influential investors before it hit the virality motherlode: on 16 March, the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk tweeted the link to the document to his nearly 33 million followers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1239650597906898947\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Maybe worth considering chloroquine for C19 <a href=\"https://t.co/LEYob7Jofr\">https://t.co/LEYob7Jofr</a></p>\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1239650597906898947?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 16, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWhen someone who is newsworthy or notable that has an enormous network on social media tweets about something that could be as path-breaking as a medicine that could treat coronavirus, everyone is going to pay attention no matter if that person has expertise or not,\u201d said Joan Donovan, director of the technology and social change research project at Harvard\u2019s Shorenstein Center. \u201cElon Musk elevating and giving voice to this Google doc does act as a validating mechanism. Elon Musk is a tech entrepreneur best known as a car salesman, but nevertheless people look to him for what\u2019s new, what\u2019s next.\u201d</p> \n<p>Musk\u2019s tweet received more than 13,000 retweets. (He did not respond to questions from the Guardian about his promotion of the document.) Search interest in chloroquine soared. Mainstream media outlets <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-16/elon-musk-thinks-malaria-medicine-could-help-treat-coronavirus\">covered</a> his apparent endorsement of the drug. An 85-year-old medication was well on its way to becoming a Covid-19 meme.</p> \n<h2><strong>America\u2019s right wing piles on</strong></h2> \n<p>Once Trump declared himself a proponent of hydroxychloroquine, the scientific debate over the drug was drowned out by a decidedly partisan one.</p> \n<p>Rightwing media outlets have followed Fox News\u2019s lead (an <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/over-three-days-week-fox-news-promoted-antimalarial-drug-treatment-coronavirus-over-100\">analysis by Media Matters</a> found that the cable news channel promoted using the drug 109 times between 23 and 25 March) to become staunch proponents of the drug, from digital outrage factories such as the Daily Caller and the Daily Wire to the opinion pages of the Wall Street Journal.</p> \n<p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/these-drugs-are-helping-our-coronavirus-patients-11584899438\">These drugs are helping our coronavirus patients</a>,\u201d declared the headline of the Journal op-ed, which was written by two physicians from Kansas, Jeff Colyer and Daniel Hinthorn. The pair wrote that they had been treating patients with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, and encouraged others to do so too \u201cas a matter of clinical practice\u201d once a patient tests positive. They also recommended using the drug prophylactically for healthcare workers.</p> \n<p>The doctors did not provide any data from their own patients, but referenced the French study, writing: \u201cResearchers in France treated a small number of patients with both hydroxychloroquine and a Z-Pak, and 100% of them were cured by day six of treatment.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hinthorn, the director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Kansas medical center, responded to queries from the Guardian about the op-ed\u2019s mischaracterization of the French study: \u201cYou are correct. Any patient left out of any analysis makes us suspicious. But what this study told us was that this was a combination that might merit further evaluation.\u201d</p> \n<p>He acknowledged that it is unknown whether the drug is beneficial or harmful for Covid-19 patients, but said that since no drug has as yet been proven effective, \u201cif there is any medication that might give hope, we prefer to try it\u201d as long as it is safe. \u201cWe should know in the next few weeks whether such a regimen was a wise decision or not.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hinthorn did not respond to a follow-up question about whether the op-ed should be corrected to more accurately reflect the degree of uncertainty around hydroxychloroquine. Colyer, the former governor of Kansas and a plastic surgeon, did not respond to requests for comment. He has since written a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-update-on-the-coronavirus-treatment-11585509827?mod=e2two\">second op-ed</a> for the Journal, also promoting hydroxychloroquine.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6cca4705e05e76d4d522b115db94bedbb9ec3cd1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cca4705e05e76d4d522b115db94bedbb9ec3cd1/0_0_3500_2368/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Researchers at the University of Minnesota Genomics Center investigate the drug.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"677\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Researchers at the University of Minnesota genomics center investigate the drug.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Lassig/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The idea that hydroxychloroquine is \u201cthe cure\u201d has taken off within certain online communities, including among anti-vaxxers and followers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/30/qanon-4chan-rightwing-conspiracy-theory-explained-trump\">QAnon</a>, a rightwing conspiracy theory. The drug has also found support from the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a small, ultra-conservative organization that advocates against government involvement in medicine. The group launched a texting campaign to bombard physicians with demands to sign a petition against \u201cred tape\u201d that might prevent them from prescribing the drug, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-text-messages-idUSKBN21E367\">Reuters</a> reported.</p> \n<h2><strong>Calls for further research</strong></h2> \n<p>Away from the rancor of the partisan media, scientists and physicians continue to study the effects of the drug. In some states, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/26/trump-keeps-touting-an-unproven-coronavirus-treatment-its-now-being-tested-thousands-new-york/\">including the hard-hit New York</a>, hospitals are following Hinthorn\u2019s rationale and using the drug since no proven therapy exists.</p> \n<p>A group of French researchers published a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X20300858\">refutation</a> of the Raoult study in M\u00e9decine et Maladies Infectieuses on 30 March. The researchers, at Saint Louis hospital in France, followed the same regimen of hydroxychloroquine for 11 patients, and did not have similar results. \u201cWe found no evidence of a strong antiviral activity or clinical benefit of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for the treatment of our hospitalized patients with severe Covid-19,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOngoing randomized clinical trials with hydroxychloroquine should provide a definitive answer regarding the alleged efficacy of this combination and will assess its safety.\u201d</p> \n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758v2\">another study</a> \u2013 this time a randomized controlled trial \u2013 out of Wuhan, China, has sparked hope since it was circulated ahead of publication on 31 March. The trial of 62 patients found that patients with mild cases of Covid-19 who were treated with hydroxychloroquine recovered faster than those who did not \u2013 and none of them progressed to \u201csevere\u201d illness. The study has not yet been peer-reviewed.</p> \n<p>The authors of the study urged further research and large-scale clinical trials to better understand how the drug operates and how best to use it.</p> \n<h2><strong>The danger of presidential misinformation</strong></h2> \n<p>The hype around hydroxychloroquine has not been without casualties.</p> \n<p>Heightened demand for the drug has left longtime patients \u2013 including <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/lupus-patients-cant-get-crucial-medication-after-president-trump-pushes-unproven-coronavirus-treatment\">lupus patients</a> who have long used it as an anti-inflammatory \u2013 forced to go without. Overdoses have also been reported in the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/health/arizona-coronavirus-chloroquine-death/index.html\">US</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/africa/chloroquine-trump-nigeria-intl/index.html\">Nigeria</a> as frightened individuals attempt to self-medicate.</p> \n<p>Social media companies, who have been proactive about policing misinformation about coronavirus, have taken some steps to counter the spread of false claims. Google took down the Google document by Rigano , though the company has not responded to numerous requests for an explanation. Twitter has also <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/twitter-deleted-tweets-brazil-president-coronavirus\">deleted tweets</a> by the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, Trump attorney <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rudy-giuliani-covid-19-drugs-twitter-delete_n_5e801cafc5b661492268e789\">Rudy Giuliani</a>, and the Fox News personality Laura Ingraham that touted the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>When the president of the United States does something, it\u2019s quite the endorsement</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Andrew Noymer, UC Irvine</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But it\u2019s hard to see how these small enforcement actions by internet platforms can have much of an impact when the president of the United States continues to use his platform to promote the drug, as he did during his daily briefings on Saturday and again on Sunday.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s promotion of the drug has raised questions about his motivation, and on Monday the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-malaria-drug.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">New York Times</a> reported that the president holds \u201ca small personal financial interest\u201d in Sanofi, the company that makes a brandname version of hydroxychloroquine. (The drug\u2019s patent has expired so other pharmaceutical companies can manufacture generic versions.)</p> \n<p>As a piece of viral misinformation, the hydroxychloroquine meme has amassed an extraordinary list of validators, starting with its placement in a respectable peer-reviewed journal. (Though misinformation stemming from academia is not without precedent; the paper that touched off the false belief in a link between autism and the measles vaccine was published in one of the most respected publications in medicine, and only retracted 12 years later.) It\u2019s also very difficult to refute, because none of the hydroxychloroquine narrative\u2019s critics can or will say anything definitive about its efficacy. Uncertainty and a call to await further study is a weak sword to bring to a fight against an overly confident propagandist.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s unscientific embrace of hydroxychloroquine is not common, but there are historical examples of heads of state spreading misinformation during pandemics. One recent, tragic example is the HIV-denialism of the South African president Thabo Mbeki, who rejected the use of antiretroviral drugs for his country\u2019s citizens and instead promoted nutritional remedies such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/16/dr-beetroot-dies-south-africa\">beetroot juice and garlic</a>. Researchers at the Harvard school of public health ultimately placed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/27/south-africa-aids-mbeki\">death toll</a> of Mbeki\u2019s policies at approximately 330,000.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"af3e3a161fceb4436eecaea71dda99027ad003f7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af3e3a161fceb4436eecaea71dda99027ad003f7/0_0_5996_3665/1000..jpg\" alt=\"President Gerald Ford receives a swine flu inoculation from his White House physician, Dr William Lukash.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"611\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Gerald Ford receives a swine flu inoculation from his White House physician, Dr William Lukash.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Hume Kennerly/Courtesy Gerald R Ford Library</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Noymer, the UC Irvine epidemiologist, said that the two situations were not quite analogous, since hydroxychloroquine has a \u201cplausible mechanism\u201d to combat the coronavirus, while beetroot juice never did.</p> \n<p>Still, Noymer said that the influence that a president can have over a population\u2019s attitude toward a medicine or drug is significant.

As has been its practice lately, the high court dug right down into the evidence. The unanimous judgment delivered this morning involves more than a hundred paragraphs of meticulous reconstruction of the rituals of the cathedral, of doors opened and closed, of robes and processions.</p> \n<p>The judges do not accuse the young man of being a liar or a fantasist. They do not find his evidence contained discrepancies or displayed inadequacies \u201cof such a character as to require the jury to have entertained a doubt as to guilt\u201d.</p> \n<p>But they have done what the jury and the Victorian court of appeal did not do: they have trusted absolutely the evidence of Pell\u2019s master of ceremonies Monsignor Charles Portelli.

So far there are five known cases in Dharavi, while 25 people have been taken into special quarantine facilities and another 3,500 placed under home quarantine.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are doing everything we can to make sure it does not explode and that there is no community spread, but it is a big challenge to contain this,\u201d said Kiran Dighavkar, the assistant municipal commissioner for G-North ward of Mumbai.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba2be1defdd52183595a75d2b04647a379089342\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba2be1defdd52183595a75d2b04647a379089342/0_140_3500_2100/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A man ties a rope outside his home in Dharavi to prevent his children from going outside, and other people from coming inside.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man ties a rope outside his home in Dharavi to prevent his children from going outside, and other people from coming inside.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francis Mascarenhas/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It appears that the 56-year-old garment worker who was the slum\u2019s first victim had made two trips to the local Lokmanya Tilak municipal general hospital over the course of a week, presenting first with a fever and then severe respiratory problems, before he was tested by doctors. With no foreign travel history, he had not been considered high risk. But on 29 March, he tested positive for the virus and died four days later.</p> \n<p>There was initial confusion over how this man, who had never been abroad and lived with seven family members in a small flat adjacent to Dharavi, could possibly have contracted the virus. Yet while his family were initially uncooperative, it later emerged he had hosted several men who had attended a religious gathering of the Tablighi Jamaat, an Islamic movement, in Delhi several weeks ago, which has since been linked to hundreds of coronavirus cases across India.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/asia\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The response by the authorities was swift. The area where the victim had lived was sealed off and remains so, and his family was taken into quarantine and all those in the building, or who were considered high risk, have been tested. A new 51-bed hospital in the Dharavi area, specifically to treat coronavirus patients, has also been acquired, with eight intensive care beds, though it is feared if the virus takes hold this will not be nearly enough.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4dbafd2394350b327c36012a472d73c6eac64b21\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4dbafd2394350b327c36012a472d73c6eac64b21/0_161_2822_1694/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Health workers carry a man with suspected coronavirus into an ambulance in Dharavi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Health workers carry a man with suspected coronavirus into an ambulance in Dharavi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Prashant Waydande/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Other cases in the slum include a 30-year-old woman with no foreign travel history, and authorities are searching for the dozens who attended her birthday party a week ago.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are already many health issues in Dharavi,\u201d said Dighavkar, who added that one of the main obstacles in tackling the spread of coronavirus was a social stigma that prevented people from coming forward with symptoms.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut we are hopeful that they have good immunity because they have been exposed to many viruses, especially through using the community toilet, so we are hoping that if we find the high-risk contacts and put them in quarantine, we will be able to control it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Babbu Khan, a municipal councillor in Dharavi, said he feared many more people were already infected and warned that undetected cases could \u201cwreak havoc\u201d in the slum, where the disease was likely to \u201cspread like wildfire\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47b5746ec02d88553559eaca596af812ff8b9e84\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47b5746ec02d88553559eaca596af812ff8b9e84/0_130_5410_3247/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Barriers on a road leading to a quarantined area inside the Dharavi slum\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barriers on a road leading to a quarantined area inside the Dharavi slum.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Indranil Mukherjee/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cFor the slum-dwellers it is very difficult to stay safe from a coronavirus-infected neighbour in this incredibly congested slum of Dharavi,\u201d said Khan. \u201cWhen five people have already tested positive for the virus, there must be many more people around who are already infected. We know that many people carrying the virus remain asymptomatic, but still continue to spread the infection.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cIn Dharavi, 99% of the residents do not have their private toilets and they use public toilets. One seat of a public toilet is used by 50 or 60 slum-dwellers daily. There is a very high possibility that the infection of coronavirus is spreading or has already spread through these public toilets.\u201d</p> \n<p>Overall Mumbai has one of the highest concentrations of coronavirus cases in the country and on Monday, three doctors and 26 nurses of Wockhardt hospital in Mumbai tested positive, bringing the total number of cases in the state of Maharashtra to 809.</p> \n<p>Within Dharavi, fear has already begun to take hold. Mohammad Shafi Alam Shaikh, 53, who trades in school bags and lives in the MP Nagar area of Dharavi along with his wife and four children, said many people were very scared about the \u201cnew disease\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"393c947357a74d631594dfa00b07550526606205\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/393c947357a74d631594dfa00b07550526606205/0_348_5118_3072/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Shanty-town homes in Dharavi during the quarantine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shanty-town homes in Dharavi during the quarantine.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rajanish Kakade/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cMany of my neighbours are very nervous and staying indoors,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are coming out of their homes only to use public toilets. All of them say that it is very difficult to escape the infection in such congested slums. They all are afraid of being infected.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many mosques in the slum are using their public announcement system to spread awareness about Covid-19. But Shaikh said most of the advised measures for hand-washing and social distancing were an impossibility for the people of Dharavi.</p> \n<p>\u201cMany people do not have food at home and so in search of provisions and food handouts, people are being forced to stay outside their homes for a long time. At places like ration shops and free food delivery points people are still gathering in big numbers,\u201d said Shaikh. \u201cSo we are very afraid of a fast spread of the virus.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>An Irish prime minister, a French film director and a Hungarian MEP are among the public figures who are resurrecting their medical careers to fight the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>They are part of a small, growing group of people in politics, the arts and sports who are becoming doctors again to help health care systems under unprecedented strain.</p> <p>Leo Varadkar, Ireland\u2019s taoiseach, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/irish-taoiseach-leo-varadkar-to-work-a-day-a-week-as-a-doctor\">offered to work</a> one day a week as a doctor as his country braces for a surge in the number of infections, it emerged this week. \u201cMany of his family and friends are working in the health service. He wanted to help out even in a small way,\u201d said a spokesperson.</p> <p>Varadkar, 41, worked as a junior doctor in Dublin and qualified as a GP in 2010 before quitting medicine to become a full-time politician, and later becoming premier.</p> <p>His return to medicine adds him to an eclectic group of public figures who have dusted off credentials to work as nurses and doctors in Europe\u2019s battle against the pandemic.</p> <p>Coronavirus has made thousands of frontline health care workers ill and left many others unable to work because they need to stay at home to care for children or self-isolate because of potential infection. Health services across the continent have appealed to trainees, retirees and expatriates \u2013 anyone with useful skills \u2013 to help fill the gap.</p> <p>For Thomas Lilti, 43, a film director and showrunner, was filming the French medical TV drama Hippocrate in a hospital when the pandemic struck. He suspended filming and a few days later started working as a doctor \u2013 a profession he had quit in 2014 \u2013 in the same hospital.</p> <p>\u201cI volunteered in casualty to try and help in a small way so the more competent doctors, those who really know what they are doing, can have a rest even if just for a few hours,\u201d he told<a href=\"https://www.lejdd.fr/Culture/Series/le-realisateur-de-la-serie-hippocrate-thomas-lilti-pourquoi-je-redeviens-medecin-3958264\"> Le Journal du Dimanche</a>.</p> <p>French sports figures have also reverted to former professions. St\u00e9phanie dos Santos, 28, a basketballer, and Julien Mathieu, a ju-jitsu champion, are working as nurses. Thomas Carabas, 31, a rugby referee, has returned to work at Bayonne hospital.</p> <p>Politicians across Europe \u2013 and the political spectrum \u2013 have also responded.</p> <p>Katalin Cseh, 31, an MEP for Hungary\u2019s opposition Momentum party, has returned from Brussels to Budapest and is to start her first shift as a volunteer medic on Tuesday.</p> <p>Cseh expressed concern about Hungary\u2019s low level of testing and potential abuse of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/hungarian-journalists-fear-coronavirus-law-may-be-used-to-jail-them\">new law against misinformation </a>but volunteered \u201cto show a good example\u201d, she said. She will work part-time and unpaid while continuing to serve as an MEP.</p> <p>In France, Thomas Mesnier, 34, an MP for the governing La R\u00e9publique en Marche, has returned to hospital work. Caroline Fiat, 43, an MP for La France Insoumise, has returned to work as a nurse. Bernard Jomier, 56, a Socialist party senator, and V\u00e9ronique Guillotin, 57, a Radical Movement senator, have returned to the medical profession as doctors.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a>, Kathryn Owen, 42, a Democratic Unionist party (DUP) councillor, is to resume working as a nurse this week at a hospital site that treats coronavirus patients. John Kyle, 68, a Progressive Unionist party (PUP) councillor, has come out of retirement as a GP despite being close to an at-risk age group.</p> <p>\u201cFear and powerlessness reinforce each other and I thought that taking action to join the army of healthcare workers combating the virus would help me handle those feelings,\u201d Kyle said via email. \u201cMy medical instincts of wanting to help the ill and suffering were also reactivated and so volunteering seemed a natural response.\u201d</p> <p>His family is supportive but worries given his age, he said. \u201cI think it is the right thing to do \u2026 But fears can raise their ugly head in the middle of the night.\u201d</p> <p>Varadkar rejoined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland\">Ireland</a>\u2019s medical register last month and has offered to help in areas within his competence, said a spokesperson for the taoiseach\u2019s office.</p> <p>Brendan O\u2019Shea, a doctor who trained Varadkar as a medical student, remembers him as competent and effective in his hospital jobs, training practices and GP co-operative work. \u201cHe got on very well with patients and colleagues, and was regarded as a good team player.\u201d</p> <p>Varadkar, said O\u2019Shea, once remarked that as a doctor people believed everything you said, but as a politician nobody believed a word.</p>",
  "<p>Crises have a habit of accelerating changes that were already in train.</p> <p>Some of the trends being pushed along by the pandemic are benign, or neutral, like the <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-coronavirus-may-accelerate-the-future-of-work/\">evolution of better protocols</a> around remote work and telecommuting.</p> <p>Others are more sinister, like the fast-track evolution of factions in the political right whose message may be seductive to unwary or embittered progressives.</p> <p>Coronavirus has very quickly expanded existing fissures on the right. We can see influential actors lighting out on three main paths.</p> <p>The first path is denying, minimising or deliberately courting the public health danger.</p> <p>Some from particularly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/04/america-rightwing-christian-preachers-virus-hoax\">conspiratorial or religious segments</a> of the right have claimed outright that the emergency is a \u201cpsyop\u201d intended to institute tyranny.</p> <p>Maga loyalists like the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mitchellvii/status/1246623932767141890\">ineffable Bill Mitchell</a> have been playing it down, seeing a threat to President Donald Trump\u2019s political interests.</p> <p>And locally, Andrew Bolt has <a href=\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/a-real-pandemic-would-look-more-deadly-than-the-coronavirus/video/edfd4dca3f0b8f1a823cdcdf72a4a08d\">plumbed new depths</a> in his campaign to end the various levels of social isolation now in place and get everyone back to work. It\u2019s not clear whether he derives this opinion from simple contrarianism or from his discussions with <a href=\"https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/coronavirus/2020/03/23/gerry-harvey-coronavirus/\">big business figures</a> whose fortunes, and prospects, are ebbing by the day.</p> <p>In the US, the denialists and minimisers \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/trump-is-killing-his-own-supporters-coronavirus-covid-19\">including the president</a> \u2014 are about to be confronted with the grim reality of the coronavirus death toll. Even then some will find ways to keep lying to themselves and their audiences. The rightwing e-celeb Candace Owens, for example, is forestalling her own reckoning by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/1246475201115758592?s=20\">putting about the idea</a> that the deaths themselves are hoaxes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/04/australia-can-be-a-better-fairer-place-after-the-coronavirus-if-were-willing-to-fight-for-it\">Australia can be a better, fairer place after the coronavirus, if we're willing to fight for it | Lenore Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The second main line of the right\u2019s response is a kind of reluctant realism. This (with some prominent exceptions) has been the path taken by many governing conservatives in liberal democracies.</p> <p>Scott Morrison and Boris Johnson botched their initial responses, with Morrison in particular giving <a href=\"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/coronavirus-scott-morrison-slammed-encouraging-footy-attendance-232028748.html\">stunningly bad public health advice</a> as the pandemic gathered steam overseas.</p> <p>But it gradually dawned on these leaders that they urgently needed to abandon habits of thought developed over a lifetime in order to save their societies\u2019 furniture.</p> <p>Both have been shoveling out money out to individuals, businesses, daycare centers, and health systems. As much as the individual welfare of their citizens, these men were looking to save their economies.</p> <p>But partial, poorly implemented and uneven their measures were, they constituted a practical admission that late capitalist systems are simply not resilient enough to withstand a crisis of these dimensions.</p> <p>The inevitability of further disasters and public health crises as our climate crisis unfolds will everywhere force the admission that the neoliberal, managerial state simply doesn\u2019t cut the mustard.</p> <p>The question is: what will take its place?</p> <p>In answering we should note that as usual in Australian politics, governments confronted with a political problem reached for authoritarianism.</p> <p>Police were issuing fines, and the army was in parks and streets before people were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/we-need-to-live-restricted-lives-for-at-least-six-months-police-enforced-lockdowns-are-unnecessary\">given a decent chance</a> to cooperatively adhere to a shifting and confusing set of rules.</p> <p>Ships were denied access to ports of entry. Returning travelers were subject to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/hotel-quarantine-a-disaster-and-vulnerable-people-should-be-allowed-home-doctor-says\">mandatory confinement</a>. The Pacific solution had come home.</p> <p>This authoritarian instinct has been even more pronounced in rightwing leaders elsewhere.</p> <p>In Hungary Viktor Orb\u00e1n has <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/31/hungary-orban-coronavirus-europe-democracy/\">swept away the vestiges of liberal democracy</a> in the country. He has used this crisis to lock the population down, control information and scapegoat his enemies.</p> <p>These responses define the disease as a national emergency rather than a global humanitarian crisis. They are answered, to some extent, by popular authoritarianism \u2013 in Facebook groups and comment threads you\u2019ll find people baying for mass arrests of social-distancing violators and cheering for sealed borders.</p> <p>Not everyone has reacted this way \u2013 this is also a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/covid-19-mutual-aid-how-to-help-the-vulnerable-near-you\">golden age of community-level mutual aid</a> and cross-border empathy.</p> <p>But there is enough nasty sentiment around to create an opportunity for a third kind of rightwing response to coronavirus.</p> <p>This response seeks to retool conservatism, reverse liberal internationalism and globalization and use the pandemic as a springboard for global conflict.</p> <p>Its avatar is Steve Bannon, whose pandemic-focused podcast has been a rightwing standout in a sea of corona content.</p> <p>Bannon took the outbreak seriously, and he did so early. He was devoting special episodes of his War Room podcast to the pandemic from late January. He perceived it as a looming disaster, even as most other news outlets were entirely focused on impeachment and the Democratic primaries.</p> <p>And he immediately sought to blame the entire outbreak on the Chinese Communist party. A 27 January episode called it \u201cChina\u2019s Chernobyl\u201d in its title. He regularly describes the party as demonic or satanic.</p> <p>He has, in the face of small government orthodoxy, urged sweeping welfare payments and an all-out effort to smother the virus.</p> <p>He has rhetorically adopted a certain bipartisanism, praising New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, and other Democrats, while also avoiding any discussion of Trump\u2019s murderous incompetence. But all of this is framed by an unyielding nationalism focused on the evil of the CCP.</p> <p>His apparent prescience on the story, and his enduring populist opposition to neoliberal orthodoxies in rightwing politics, appear to have some attraction for leftists at a time when leftwing populism appears stalled, at least in electoral politics.</p> <p>Bannon was a guest on a prominent leftwing podcast last week (that show shall remain nameless \u2013 it\u2019s had more than enough attention as a result of this).</p> <p>It\u2019s not an important development in itself but it signals a danger.</p> <p>Bannon\u2019s nationalism, anti-Chinese aggression, and his western chauvinism should deter anyone who claims to be on the left. But in a moment of frustration, his populism, relaxed attitude to government spending, and his robust approach to the pandemic may be a lure for the politically unsophisticated.</p> <p>Indeed, this is his political project.</p> <p>This goes double for the right. In Australia, too, prominent voices are <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/it-s-certain-covid-19-will-change-everything-but-this-needs-to-change-most-of-all-20200331-p54fk3.html\">making it their business</a> to ensure that this pandemic is blamed entirely on the PRC, and that this leads to a posture of conflict with that country. This will inevitably worsen the scapegoating of Asian immigrants which is being reported in majority-white countries.</p> <p>Progressives need to start forcefully making their own arguments about the meaning of the crisis. They need to offer a response that emphasises social solidarity, equity, justice and peace.</p> <p>Otherwise we may exchange neoliberalism for something even worse.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jason Wilson is a columnist for Guardian Australia</p></li> </ul>",

It was a nice conversation. We talked about pretty much this [coronavirus].</p> \n  <p>\u201cHe gave me his point of view, and I fully understood that, and we just had a very friendly conversation. It lasted probably 15 minutes and it was really good, really nice. So I appreciated his calling.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump was asked by Jon Karl of ABC News if Biden offered any specific advice on handling the crisis. \u201cWe agreed that we weren\u2019t going to talk about what we said,\u201d he said. \u201cHe had suggestions. It doesn\u2019t mean that I agree with those suggestions.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The soft tone was all the more striking because Trump was on irascible form with reporters. At one point he lambasted Karl, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/04/front-row-at-the-trump-show-jonathan-karl-book\">whom he has known for 26 years</a>, \u201cYou\u2019re a third rate reporter \u2026 You will never make it!\u201d</p> \n  <p>The president was asked if he would now make contact with predecessors Barack Obama or George W Bush to seek their advice. He will not.</p> \n  <p>And the d\u00e9tente did not last. Later in the briefing, Trump made spurious claims about the Obama-Biden\u2019s handling of swine flu and failure to stockpile equipment. Biden, meanwhile,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1247296778095005696?s=20\"> tweeted:</a> \u201cFor months, I called on President Trump to step up and take the action necessary to combat COVID-19.

The deadline for election officials to receive the ballot is 13 April. The decision, which came shortly after the <a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2020%2Fapr%2F06%2Fwisconsin-primary-election-in-person-voting-coronavirus\">state supreme court</a> ordered the election to move forward on Tuesday, ends days of legal fighting over the deadline for receiving absentee ballots in the state. </p> \n  <p>State law requires them to be received at election offices by 8pm on election night in order to count, but a federal judge extended that deadline to 13 April amid an unprecedented surge in requests for mail-in balloting. There was such a surge in requests that state Democrats argued thousands would be disenfranchised because they wouldn\u2019t even get their ballot until after election day. As of Monday morning, a little over 11,000 voters who had requested a ballot in the state had yet to be issued one. In an unsigned opinion, the five conservative justices on the court said it was ruling on a \u201cnarrow, technical question\u201d, and that the lower court\u2019s decision to extend the ballot deadline without requiring a postmark went beyond what plaintiffs had asked for.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe court\u2019s decision on the narrow question before the court should not be viewed as expressing an opinion on the broader question of whether to hold the election, or whether other reforms or modifications in election procedures in light of Covid\u201319 are appropriate,\u201d the majority wrote. Writing for the court\u2019s four liberal justices in dissent, Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote that the majority did not understand the scope of the case: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>While I do not doubt the good faith of my colleagues, the court\u2019s order, I fear, will result in massive disenfranchisement.
