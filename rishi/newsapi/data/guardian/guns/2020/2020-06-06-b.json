The total number of infections in Herat is 3,621 with 64 deaths.</p> \n  <p>In the capital, Kabul, 161 new cases have been recorded. In the remote province of Kunar, five patients tested all returned positive results, as seven patients died of Covid-19 overnight. In Helmand, two patients tested in the last 24 hours both were positive and the province recorded its first death.</p> \n  <p> Meanwhile, amid continuing conflict, at least 20 Afghan security forces personnel were killed in two incidents in the last 24 hours.

confirmed infections.</p> \n  <p>The health ministry reported 9,887 new cases on Saturday, bringing the total to 236,657.</p> \n  <p>Most of the new cases are in rural areas following the return of hundreds of thousands of migrant workers who left cities and towns after the lockdown in late March.</p> \n  <p>The lockdown is now largely being enforced in high-risk areas while authorities have partially restored train services and domestic flights and allowed shops and manufacturing to reopen. </p> \n  <p>Shopping malls and religious places are due to open on Monday with restrictions to avoid large gatherings.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-06T05:11:33.182Z\">at 6.11am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div

  "<p>A prominent First Nations chief in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada\">Canada</a>&nbsp;has said he and his wife were assaulted by police officers over an expired licence plate, an incident that came as the country grapples with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/justin-trudeau-takes-a-knee-but-is-silent-on-reforms-to-policing\">continued violence against ethnic minorities</a>&nbsp;at the hands of police.</p> \n<p>Chief Allan Adam of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation, a well-known businessman whose community has extensive operations in Alberta\u2019s oil sands, said he and his wife, Freda Courtoreille, had a violent encounter with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on 10 March that has left the community in anguish.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re used to seeing this, time and time again, when our young people are mistreated and put in jail,\u201d Adam told the Guardian. \u201cNow, we\u2019re not even witnesses to it any more: we\u2019re victims.\u201d</p> \n<p>On 6 June, at an emotional press conference Adam released video footage of the assault, which Chief Vern Janvier Chipewyan Prairie Dene First Nation bluntly described as a \u201cshit-kicking\u201d at the hands of Wood Buffalo RCMP.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As they waited in their truck for a friend, Adam\u2019s wife spotted an RCMP nearby. The officer\u2019s vehicle then blocked their truck from leaving.</p> \n<p>Adam identified himself to police as chief of Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation and got out of the vehicle to tell the officer he didn\u2019t realise the vehicle\u2019s licence tag had expired. The vehicle had previously been impounded by police on an unrelated matter and released back to Adam a few days before.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Adam said his wife, who suffers from late-stage rheumatoid arthritis, was then put in an arm hold and slammed against the vehicle.</p> \n<p>At one point during the press conference, both Courtoreille and Adam broke down into tears and hugged.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe had to see all of this. In all the years I\u2019ve been in leadership \u2026 my wife has supported me 100 per cent. She gave me the support I needed,\u201d said Adam. \u201cThe ordeal that she goes through when we sit at home and talk about this \u2026 all of this was for an expired licence plate.\u201d</p> \n<p>After she was allowed back in the truck, an argument ensued and the officer put Allan in the same restraint hold used on Courtoreille. Soon after, a second police officer arrived and struck Adam multiple times.</p> \n<p>\u201cI could feel that I was going unconscious and all I can remember is the blood gushing out of my mouth,\u201d said Adam. He then felt the officer striking him multiple times. Video shows Courtoreille and bystanders pleading for the officers to stop.</p> \n<p>Adam was taken to the RCMP detachment, where he was charged with resisting arrest and unlawful assault of a police officer. Courtoreille was arrested for obstruction, but never charged.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The RCMP has said that Adam resisted arrest, and said in a statement to the Globe and Mail that the actions of the two officers were \u201creasonable\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Photographs of the chief\u2019s face, swollen and crusted with dried blood, were provided to the Guardian.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis could have ended in 10 minutes. But, it escalated,\u201d said Adam\u2019s lawyer, Brian Beresh, addingthat most people would be let off with a warning. \u201cHere we have an Indigenous man, challenging someone with a uniform and a gun.\u201d</p> \n<p>Beresh has called for the RCMP to publicly release the on-board video footage from the police car.&nbsp;Beresh has also requested an independent investigation of the incident, the suspension of the officer and a requirement that all RCMP officers wear body cameras.</p> \n<p>The police have said because the matter is before the courts, they cannot release any video documentation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Assembly of First Nations regional chief, Marlene Poitras, said the event was appalling.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need to know what happened here. We deserve answers,\u201d she said, calling for transformative change to policing. \u201cThe system that is in place right now is inherently racist.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chief Mel Grandjam of Fort McKay First Nation told reporters he believed the incident would have unfolded differently if Adam had been a white political leader.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cA lot of times, [the tendency of law enforcement] is to provoke us to react,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>While the assault occurred in March, those close to the chief said the video wasn\u2019t released at the time because the community was in the midst of developing its Covid-19 preparations. Colleagues of the chief said they pressed Adam to release the video but he initially refused.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Footage of the assault is likely to provoke further outrage in Indigenous communities across the country, which are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/canada-police-under-scrutiny-after-two-women-die-after-encounters-with-officers\">already in disbelief and anger</a>&nbsp;after Chantel Moore, a 26-year old woman suffering from mental health issues, was gunned down by police.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m pissed, I\u2019m outraged. There needs to be a full accounting of what has gone on,\u201d said Marc Miller, the country\u2019s minister of Indigenous services.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Earlier in the week, video footage surfaced of an Inuk man rammed by the door of a police vehicle as he walked down a road.</p> \n<p>\u201cA car door is not a proper police tactic. It\u2019s a disgraceful, dehumanising and violent act,\u201d said Miller.</p> \n<p>Adam remains in disbelief that the whole incident was over an expired licence plate.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cBecause we are a minority, no one speaks up for us. Every time our people do wrong, the RCMP always seems to use excessive force,\u201d he said. \u201cThis needs to stop. Enough is enough.\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking to the Guardian after his press conference, Adam expressed fear that if police were willing to use violence against a well-known chief, young men and women in his community might fare worse.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been on the edge since this happened. I always have to look over my shoulder. I have to protect my family,\u201d he said. \u201cAm I scared? Yeah, I\u2019m scared. That\u2019s probably the feeling victims of police brutality have. But I\u2019m not going to back down.\u201d</p>",

When he met the New Zealand-born Trish in Kathmandu in 1974, he\u2019d found his match. He was driving an overland bus across Europe, dropping off one group in Nepal before picking up a new batch of tourists heading back the other way. Among them was Trish, a nurse from Dunedin, who\u2019d grown up on a sheep farm and was now exploring the world.&nbsp;</p> <p>She was intrigued by the Londoner who made her laugh, but remembers thinking: \u201cGosh, he\u2019s a bit of a know-all sometimes.\u201d With a smile, she continues: \u201cI did admire his confidence and competence because the longer I got to know him, I realised how important it was to be confident in the position he was in. We were literally putting our lives in his hands. So as a pretty unsophisticated group, it was good to have somebody that knew how things worked.\u201d</p> <p>Trish caught Mike\u2019s eye but initially he feigned disinterest, hoping to make her jealous (\u201cYou don\u2019t show interest straight away!\u201d he laughs now),&nbsp;but Trish was oblivious: \u201cI was not jealous [although] I was wondering why he was ignoring me.\u201d</p> <p>When they arrived in Delhi, he asked her to dinner. \u201cWe talked a lot. Mike had this romantic idea of sheep farming and life in New Zealand and had had thoughts of going to New Zealand well before he met me. So he was very interested in my background, which was flattering.\u201d Mike was intrigued too: \u201cI always wanted to get away from London, away from Europe, and see other things. So it was exciting to meet someone from New Zealand.\u201d</p> <p>From there, \u201cthings developed\u201d, they say.&nbsp;\u201cIt was very easy to experiment a bit more when you\u2019re on holiday away from the constraints of your peers or your family,\u201d&nbsp;Trish says drily, with Mike adding: \u201cI think the romance bubbled away in the background.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edee5c35a4cce3c6045c58923e03b0af24ce31fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edee5c35a4cce3c6045c58923e03b0af24ce31fc/0_55_2592_1786/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike on the seas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Londoner Mike Buky at home on the high seas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike  Buky and Trish Soper</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Disaster struck when they stopped in Yugoslavia. Trisha had developed an abscess behind her knee and Mike thought she should fly to London for medical attention. When no one else would go with her, he decided to go himself to deliver her into the care of his doctor father. In two days, he got her to London, then returned to the group. A few weeks later, he arrived back in London to find Trish recovering slowly. \u201cI\u2019d been worried that she was going to lose her leg, but my father said that wasn\u2019t the problem, she\u2019d probably have lost her life from septicemia.\u201d</p> <p>Although Mike insists he\u2019s not romantic or \u201cthe gooey sort\u201d, there was a strong connection between them. </p> <p>\u201cAs things turned out I had met the right person,\u201d says Trish. \u201cBecause Michael was incredibly thoughtful and loyal and he lost his job with the driving firm because of flying me back to London and leaving his passengers. So I felt very happy that I\u2019d met him but also very grateful.\u201d</p> <p>The couple stayed at Mike\u2019s parents house while she recovered.

Although Mike says there were no great declarations, they decided to do their adventuring together. \u201cIt\u2019s good fun to be with someone who you\u2019re a soulmate with and have adventures with them. You both have your pluses and minuses \u2026 you\u2019re learning.\u201d</p> <p>Trish\u2019s conservative parents hoped the pair would get married, but Trish made it clear they weren\u2019t planning to do so. \u201cYears later when I rang up and said, \u2018Michael and I are getting married\u2019, my mother said at the time, \u2018What for? You\u2019ve been together so long.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>And they made the decision not to have children: \u201cNeither of us wanted children and have never regretted it,\u201d says Mike, adding: \u201cOur lives as lived would not have been possible with children.\u201d</p> <p>They settled in Queenstown until 1980, then returned to the UK.

Being able to work in each others\u2019 home countries was also a perk. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that there was no romance [but] there wasn\u2019t much romance in it.\u201d</p> <p> Life at sea required adaptation. \u201cIt\u2019s a learning curve and I think what enthuses us both is new experiences and learning whatever it is,\u201d says Mike. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve got to learn about yourself. What you can cope with. Learning about the boat, learning about the weather, learning about everything and you make mistakes, but hopefully not serious ones.\u201d</p> <p>They got on well together on the boat, dividing the labours of sailing equally. \u201cThere was always a lot to do on the boat with just the two of us,\u201d says Trish. \u201cIf we were doing a passage, you\u2019d be either on watch and keeping everything going, or you\u2019d be sleeping or resting or cooking or fishing or something. I mean, there was no time to really get upset and argue with each other much.\u201d</p> <p>They were together constantly yet maintained their individuality. \u201cI think you can have a separate existence even when you\u2019re together,\u201d says Mike. \u201cIt happened on the boat.

Initially they lived aboard the yacht on the Mooloolah River. Trish went back to nursing, while Mike studied.</p> <p>Eventually it came time to sell the boat that had been their home for so long. It was another challenge: \u201cI realised I couldn\u2019t stay on the boat any longer. It was too small. There was no space left and I never felt that when we were sailing,\u201d says Trish. While Mike was very attached to the boat and not keen to sell, he agreed. They moved into a home in Queensland but eventually decided to move to rural Tasmania, where they now live.</p> <p>Their time together, particularly on the boat, has meant they\u2019re good at making decisions. \u201cThe next big decision, as we age, is moving out from this property, but we\u2019ll get there eventually.

She later received a $20,000 grant from the charity, and $30,000 from other grants.</p> <p>\u201cI spoke to a person on the phone saying this is ridiculous, your house is burning down the last thing you think is to grab a utility bill, and they got really annoyed with me and it wasn\u2019t a pleasant conversation,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d27bc8f6596aa628ac373db0e6ba43226629df90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d27bc8f6596aa628ac373db0e6ba43226629df90/0_371_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Dunn Road fire on 10 January 10 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Dunn Road fire on 10 January 10 2020.

She tells the inquiry that there is \u201cconfusion\u201d in the community about different payments available at state and federal level, all with a different application process and different waiting times.</p> <p>\u201cSo in my opinion, there may be some benefit to looking at whether those arrangements are consolidated in some way, or reviewed in some way, to consider whether it might be beneficial for individuals, and more efficient, to have one entity administer the payments,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a91153352a9dabfff31cfe64faf1c9682f84fb88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a91153352a9dabfff31cfe64faf1c9682f84fb88/0_0_3506_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"National Bushfire Recovery Agency chief Andrew Colvin during a tour of the Hawkesbury fire control centre in January\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">National Bushfire Recovery Agency chief Andrew Colvin during a tour of the Hawkesbury fire control centre in January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Carrett/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Centrelink has been proposed as best-placed to do that work, but it\u2019s a hard sell to convince proud farmers and small business owners to join queues they associate with welfare payments, even when they are in dire need of welfare payments.&nbsp;</p> <p>The day she and her partner lost their house, Townsend was told by the local police officer to go to Centrelink and sign up as being \u201cdestitute\u201d. For a woman who had worked her way out of poverty, it was devastating.</p> <p>\u201cFor me not being welfare dependent is a really big thing because I grew up welfare dependent,\u201d she says.&nbsp;</p> <p>The average waiting time for the $1,000 disaster relief payment, distributed by Services Australia to 216,000 people between 16 September 2019 and 17 May 2020, was six days, even with a fast-track payment process and the use of facial recognition software to identify those who had lost or could not access identification documents. The total value of recovery funds distributed between those dates was more than $270m.</p> <p>Charities that helped distribute the emergency relief payments, including the Red Cross and St Vincent de Paul, agree. They also distributed donated funds: the Red Cross received $226m in donations during the bushfires and had, as of early May, distributed $86m. St Vincent de Paul raised $23m and as of April had distributed $12.4m.</p> <p>Toby oConnor is the chief executive of the St Vincent de Paul Society national council. He tells Guardian Australia, before the royal commission begins, emergency relief payments should be larger and delivered more quickly.</p> <p>St Vincent de Paul was one of the not-for-profits charged with distributing $1,000 payments for people in immediate financial distress.</p> <p>He says the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/15/bushfire-grants-not-enough-and-take-too-long-to-approve-st-vincent-de-paul-society-says\">administrative burden placed on distributing the payments made the process slow, causing some people to blame charities for withholding funds.</a></p> <p>OConnor says there was a tension between meeting that administrative burden, which not-for-profits need to meet in order to comply with their regulatory requirements, and distributing funds as quickly as possible. Often, he says, people who applied through St Vincent de Paul for the $1,000 emergency relief payment immediately received a $3,000 payment from the charity itself while they waited for the federal funds to clear.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cYou want this out quickly but the process means that we can\u2019t give this out quickly,\u201d he says.</p> <h2>\u2018It was absolutely bedlam\u2019</h2> <p>OConnor says the emergency relief fund should be increased to $3,000 \u2013&nbsp;the same as the drought relief payment.</p> <p>\u201cIt becomes pretty difficult when you are talking to someone whose house has burned down and you can give them $1,000, but if you are in drought and you have still got your house you can get $3,000,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He also says the process should be in place before a disaster occurs, so there is capacity to respond quickly. The scale and ferocity of the fires this summer meant \u201cthings were changing hour by hour\u201d, increasing the pressure on those providing emergency relief. \u201cIt was absolutely bedlam,\u201d he says.</p> <p>For some, the difficulty of applying for a payment outweighs the benefit, even if they are in dire need of assistance. David Jochinke, the president of the Victorian Farmers Federation, says the application process should match the level of funds on offer.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIf you are asking to know an nth of a detail about financial statements, then make it a worthwhile exercise,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it\u2019s a $20,000 fund, then fair enough that you want that detail. But if it\u2019s only $3,000, probably less detail.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Jochinke tells Guardian Australia that everyone affected by bushfire should have to undergo two mandatory assessments: one in the immediate aftermath of the fire, to determine access to emergency relief, and one a few months later, to determine access to recovery payments. Those assessments should be done by one agency and shared with state and commonwealth agencies and relevant NGOs, he says.&nbsp;</p> <p>Colvin tells the royal commission that there would, ideally, be a way to have trained staff ready to respond in the event of a bushfire, but organising that kind of localised surge capacity was difficult.</p> <p>One hundred and 11 local government areas across five states and territories were declared disaster zones for the purpose of disaster relief payments as a result of the 2019-20 bushfires. Across Australia, about 35m hectares, or 4.5% of the country, burned.</p> <p>\u201cLatent capacity doesn\u2019t exist in governments very often and it gets soaked up and absorbed into other thing, but you\u2019re right,\u201d he tells one of the royal commissioners, Dr Annabelle Bennett. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where the next bushfire will be and we don\u2019t want to have to retrain a new set of people.\u201d</p> <p>Hearings for the royal commission will recommence on 16 June.</p>",

At the base, the fattest part, are the people who will vaccinate. Then there are increasingly smaller, but increasingly resistant layers. There are the \u201ccautious acceptors\u201d. Then there are the \u201chesitant acceptors\u201d, followed by the \u201cselective vaccinators\u201d who might accept certain vaccines but will reject others. At the sharp peak of the pyramid are the decliners, those who won\u2019t vaccinate. Part of that small group are the anti-vaccination activists.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Being informed.

  "<p>Downing Street has been accused of reopening the door to imports of chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef, after a leaked memo instructed ministers to have \u201cno specific policy\u201d on animal welfare in US trade talks.</p> <p>The letter from No 10 states that the ministerial mandate for the US negotiations was \u201cbeing updated to reflect\u201d the fact that the UK was to have no policy position on animal welfare. The revelation will raise more concerns about the government\u2019s commitment to upholding \u201chigh environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards\u201d.</p> <p>The note, seen by the <em>Observer </em>and dispatched at the start of last month, gave approval for the US trade talks to go ahead and set out the conditions of engagement. It reveals serious cabinet unrest over the shape of a US deal and appears to suggest UK regulations could be changed to accommodate an agreement. It also makes clear that talks were to be used to \u201cmaximise leverage\u201d in trade negotiations with the EU.</p> <p>\u201cConsultation and agreement from relevant colleagues is sought before agreeing to change domestic policy or regulations as part of the negotiations,\u201d it states. \u201cIn the context of preserving the integrity of UK domestic law, any decisions taken in sensitive areas \u2026 must take into account the potential legal implications for the UK and be agreed by the relevant ministers.\u201d</p> <p>The memo reveals how contentious the US trade talks are regarded as being within the cabinet. Issues were raised by 11 cabinet ministers, including health secretary Matt Hancock, environment secretary George Eustice and Mark Spencer, the chief whip.</p> <p>\u201cWritten responses were received from the health secretary, foreign secretary, the chief whip, the business secretary, the environment secretary, the chancellor of the exchequer, the justice secretary, the defence secretary, the culture secretary, the Welsh secretary and the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,\u201d it states. \u201cAll other members of the committee were content.\u201d</p> <p>The briefing also states that a cabinet committee would return to the animal welfare issue \u201cin June to settle all outstanding agriculture issues\u201d, suggesting an unresolved split. Meanwhile, it demands that \u201cministers receive regular progress reports of concurrent EU and US negotiations to help maximise leverage and allow policy tensions to be resolved as they emerge\u201d.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said that it had been \u201cvery clear since the outset that we will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards\u201d.</p> <p>Campaigners want legal guarantees on those standards to be enshrined in an agriculture bill currently being debated in parliament. The issue has already prompted a Tory rebellion in the Commons.</p> <p>It comes after reports last week that the government was proposing a \u201cdual scheme\u201d that would see higher tariffs on US foods with lower animal welfare standards. It is not clear whether higher tariffs would also be linked to environmental standards.</p> <p>Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesperson, said: \u201cPeople can now see that promises made by Johnson and Gove were worthless.\u201d</p> <p>Luke Pollard, the shadow environment secretary, said: \u201cIt is unacceptable for the government to allow our high food standards to be compromised and our farmers undercut in any future trade deals. Attempts by ministers to use tariffs and tax rates to get around their manifesto commitment on food standards won\u2019t wash.\u201d</p> <p>Nick von Westenholz, director of EU exit and international trade for the National Farmers Union, said: \u201cThe government made a manifesto commitment not to compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards in trade negotiations, and this commitment is explicitly stated in the government\u2019s specific objectives for the US negotiations. We would expect UK trade negotiators to be rigorous in upholding these commitments.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokesman said: \u201cWe will always stand up for British farming and are determined to use trade negotiations to secure new opportunities for farmers.</p> <p>\u201cHaving left the EU, we will get to decide how we set and maintain our own laws, standards and regulations, upholding our food, environmental and animal welfare standards. Our food regulators will continue to provide independent advice to ensure that all food imports into the UK comply with those standards.\u201d</p>",

Actually, perhaps it also explains the miracle that is, surely, Wakefield\u2019s professional survival, her reputation only lightly tarnished, to date, by revelations about the London breakout.

Both, preferably. Introduce a partner and his/her droll/saintly ways and, next thing, people will not just spot a sudden absence but remark, online, that they don\u2019t blame her/him for doing a runner. A columnist will open up about, say, disabling depression and somebody with disabling depression will point out acidly that it never seems to stop them working. So make out, if only by evasion, that your sick family stayed in \u201cLondon lockdown\u201d, instead of ignoring rules being observed by truly desperate and grieving people, and some busybody is sure to take it upon themselves to look up Kant on the distinction between lying and deception.</p> <p>Was Wakefield wrong to write as she did? Or should readers blame themselves for drawing, from the information available, the wrong conclusions? Hopefully Ipso will soon let us know.</p> <p>\u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist</p>",
  "<p>Isabel Colegate, 88, is the author of 13 novels, most famously&nbsp;<em>The Shooting Party</em>&nbsp;(1980), which is set on a country estate in 1913 and was made into a film starring James Mason. Born in 1931, Colegate\u2019s first job was as an assistant to the literary agent Anthony Blond. She then became a writer, and for 45 years lived with her husband, Michael Briggs, the chairman of the Bath Preservation Trust, at Midford Castle in Somerset, where they brought up their three children. (Briggs died in 2017.) The trilogy of novels that began with&nbsp;<em>Orlando King&nbsp;</em>(1968) is now to be republished in a single volume. A reworking of the Oedipus myth, their hero arrives in London in the 1930s, where he begins his rapid rise to power\u2026&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Are you pleased that </strong><em><strong>Orlando King</strong></em><strong> is coming back into print?&nbsp;<br></strong>I\u2019m perfectly pleased. If you write books, on the whole you want them published. I started in 1958 with&nbsp;<em>The Blackmailer</em>, and wrote one every few years until 2002. Altogether, there are 14 [her last book was a nonfiction study of hermits and solitaries]. But once they started being published, I stopped worrying about them, really. I was just thankful someone wanted them, and was going to give me a tiny bit of money for them.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Why do you think </strong><em><strong>Orlando King</strong></em><strong> might have particular resonance now, half a century after it first came out?</strong>&nbsp;<br>I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s not a very interesting answer, but it\u2019s the truth. I did put a lot of emotion into those three books, though. I found myself possessed by the story. I was extraordinarily interested in the history of that time \u2013 the period after the war \u2013 and with all the ways in which life changed. Perhaps it\u2019s that as time goes on, people seem to get more interested in that period, not less. This is curious. It\u2019s possible that its importance is still sinking in.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Were you rather in love with your hero, Orlando?&nbsp;<br></strong>A little bit. But it\u2019s more that I was so interested in him as a man: with the way that his views changed, and the mistakes that he made.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Did you always want to be a writer?&nbsp;<br></strong>I sort of just always was. I was the youngest of four girls, and because of the war, we didn\u2019t have much social life at all, which was a disadvantage because it made me terribly shy and awkward as a young woman. It was easier to turn away, and read and write. We moved about a bit. We started off in Lincolnshire, then we were evacuated and went to stay with our cousins in Yorkshire, and then my father [Sir Arthur Colegate] became a member of parliament, so we went to live in his constituency, The Wrekin, in Shropshire. The war was on, and he was at a lot of debates with Churchill. He was absolutely enchanted by it all. I\u2019m sure that my interest in everything that was happening then came from him. One was aware of the drama of it, though he was a fairly distant father in many ways. He started off passionately Labour; he joined the Fabians and was a friend of Beatrice and Sidney Webb. But he ended up as a Conservative, which is something that happens to a lot of people.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What about after the war? Did you go to university?&nbsp;<br></strong>No. I\u2019ve no education at all. Girls didn\u2019t go to university as a matter of course. I learned to drive a car, so I could move about, and then I went to work for my great friend Anthony Blond. He\u2019d been at Oxford with Michael, who I married. He was very amusing. My family were rather serious; we didn\u2019t joke much. So when I met him and all his friends, I thought they were brilliant. It was lovely to work in the little back room where he set up. Off we went. The agency was called Anthony Blond (London) Ltd. The brackets were my invention, to make sure everyone knew we were important. There were only two of us, but we had a lovely time. We picked up [as authors] a number of eccentric people who\u2019d been prisoners of war and escaped \u2013 that sort of thing.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Did he trust your taste and judg</strong><strong>ment?&nbsp;<br></strong>I have to admit that he did.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Many of your books are preoccupied with social class. Why?&nbsp;<br></strong>It was so powerful, then. If you were the wrong class, that wouldn\u2019t do. I believe this has gone now, and I\u2019m glad. There is still all sorts of snobbery, in all sorts of directions, but not like in those days.&nbsp;</p> <p><em><strong>The Shooting Party</strong></em><strong> was made into a film. Was that thrilling?&nbsp;<br></strong>I wasn\u2019t involved in it, and I didn\u2019t expect to be. But I was extraordinarily lucky. On the first day of shooting, there was an accident. Paul Scofield\u2019s horse ran away with him, which was a terrible drama \u2013 and that was the end of that, everyone thought. But the director [Alan Bridges] wrote to James Mason, and he said: \u201cI\u2019ve read the book, and I really enjoyed it.\u201d So he took over.&nbsp;</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPvF88suY1Q\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nPvF88suY1Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the trailer for The Shooting Party.</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Who are the writers you admire?&nbsp;<br></strong>One book that I read as a young woman, and recently reread, is&nbsp;<em>The Garden of the Finzi-Continis</em>&nbsp;by Giorgio Bassani [published in 1962, Bassani\u2019s novel chronicles the lives of two Jewish families in Ferrara from the rise of Mussolini until the start of the second world war]. What a strong atmosphere it has. But I read less fiction now. I\u2019m happy with a nice, fat history book like&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/06/silk-roads-peter-frankopan-review\">The Silk Roads</a></em>&nbsp;by Peter Frankopan.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>In your novel </strong><em><strong>Statues in the Garden</strong></em><strong>, someone says: \u201cWe have to cling to love. Our one talent, the shaping spirit of our imagination, our one hope.\u201d Is this something you would go along with?</strong>&nbsp;<br>That sounds very over the top. But fundamentally, yes, that is what I believe.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Are you proud of your books?<br></strong>Oh, no. Come on. I don\u2019t think you go about feeling proud of your own books. You just hope for the best. Then again, you don\u2019t want to start thinking: I wonder if I could have done it better.

I\u2019m thinking about a history of racial issues and my own experiences that didn\u2019t always sing of liberty and equality.\u201d</p> \n<p>Brown spoke bluntly about his own experiences of racism in the military.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about my air force career, where I was often the only African American in my squadron or as a senior officer, the only African American in the room,\u201d Brown said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about wearing the same flight suit, with the same wings on my chest as my peers, and then being questioned by another military member: \u2018Are you a pilot?\u2019</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about the pressure I felt to perform error-free, especially for supervisors I perceived had expected less from me as an African American.

She refused, and walked away from negotiations. She plans to sue TI for unfair dismissal, and wants to see her bullying complaints properly investigated by an independent party.\u201d</p> <p>TI said: \u201cPatricia Moreira\u2019s position as managing director ended following intensive discussions with the board of directors on the operating structures of the TI secretariat, during which it turned out that the two parties had different visions for the effective management of the organisation.\u201d</p> <p>The Taylor Wessing report found that many of TI\u2019s staff \u201cperceived a lack of transparency\u201d within the secretariat when it was being run by Moreira.

  "<p><em>Tiger King</em> was released in the early stages of the pandemic in the UK. When it came out on Netflix at the end of March, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/04/insane-intoxicating-tale-of-big-cats-is-perfect-lockdown-tv-tiger-watch-james-mcavoy-greta-gerwig\">the series was a smash</a>, making household names out of its exotic-animal-loving cast of villains, wrong \u2019uns and suspiciously chirpy people alike.</p> <p>It was a punchline, a talking point, a meme, and its appeal seemed to reach almost everyone, no matter how cheap or how easy it felt to be gripped by the sorry saga at the centre of it.</p> <p>I think this was because, at every turn, viewers were made to believe that what was happening in the world of big cats could not get any more ludicrous or distressing. Surely an arm ripped off would be as gruesome as it gets; surely a bid for political office by a gun-toting, gay, misogynistic polyamorist was as silly, as wild.</p> <p>And then, in the next episode, it always got worse and went further. In many ways, it makes sense that this was the hit of lockdown: we are growing familiar with a cycle of being shocked and appalled by ridiculous antics and then shocked and appalled by them again.</p> <p>Even though the series lasted only eight episodes, the human beings who fed the <em>Tiger King</em> industry continue to offer plot lines that unspool outside the documentary, turning this into an all-day, all-you-can-eat buffet of operatic tragedy. In the latest instalment, Carole Baskin was handed control of the zoo previously owned by Joe Exotic, taking it away from Jeff Lowe, who, in a labyrinthine tangle of legal issues and dodgy dealings, took it away from Exotic.</p> <p>With an eye for <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/tiger-king-jeff-lowe-joe-exotic-carole-baskin-zoo-a9547576.html?amp\">a dramatic exit</a>, Lowe has said this of Baskin: \u201cI wish her all the luck in the world and she can have these 16 acres of haunted memories.\u201d Meanwhile, from prison, where he is serving a long sentence for trying to arrange to have Baskin killed, as well as animal abuse, Exotic has called for her \u201ctreachery\u201d to be examined.</p> <p>Whatever you think of Baskin, and viewers have thought absolutely everything about her, this victory is a symbolic one and hard won. She claims that when she originally agreed to take part in the documentary she thought it would be about conservation and the big cat trade, but she called the end result \u201csalacious and sensationalised\u201d, which seems like a fair point. Last week, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8384819/Florida-sheriff-says-Carole-Baskins-missing-husbands-forged.html\">a Florida sheriff suggested</a> that her missing ex-husband\u2019s will was forged. On it goes, the <em>Tiger King</em> machine.

Her voice cracked as she talked of seeing \u201cyet another brutalised black body\u201d on the news and the mass consumption of black culture. \u201cYou cannot enjoy the rhythm and ignore the blues,\u201d she said, <a href=\"https://djmag.com/news/clara-amfo-%E2%80%9Cyou-cannot-enjoy-rhythm-and-ignore-blues%E2%80%9D\">quoting Amanda Seales</a>. \u201cI feel it deeply.\u201d</p> <p>It was honest and personal and raw, specific as well as broad, truly phenomenal. The sheer power of what she said highlighted the fact that these points are rarely, if ever, heard on mainstream radio. They should be, more, and again. Amfo spoke her truth, as did many others: as John Boyega said, he was putting his career on the line when he spoke at the Black Lives Matter protest in London\u2019s Hyde Park.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this. Let\u2019s all be anti-racist,\u201d Amfo concluded, before playing Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Alright. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/entertainment-arts-52890697/radio-1-dj-clara-amfo-s-emotional-speech-about-george-floyd-s-death\">Listen to it</a>, if you missed it.

Since Afghanistan, there has only been one RAF Reaper mission of this type \u2013 the killing of the Isis recruiter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/26/briton-killed-in-drone-strike-on-isis-posed-serious-threat-to-uk-reyaad-khan\">Reyaad Khan</a> in Syria in 2015.

RAF personnel are embedded with US Air Force\u2019s 432nd Wing which flies Reapers. </p> <p>\u201cIt is more vital than ever that there is increased transparency over UK drone operations and UK-US joint working,\u201d Cole said. \u201cThis would provide evidence to demonstrate that the UK is operating an independent military drone programme which complies with international law.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Watching the violent chaos <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">night after night in the US</a>, I keep thinking of what Benjamin Franklin said to the woman who asked him, as he emerged from the constitutional convention in 1787: \u201cWell, Doctor, what have we got, a republic or a monarchy?\u201d To which he famously replied: \u201cA republic, if you can keep it.\u201d What\u2019s happening on the streets there at the moment suggests that they could be coming close to losing it.</p> <p>When Trump was elected, I was assured by my American friends that the republic\u2019s democratic institutions, conventions and constitution were strong enough to rein in the narcissistic despot. Sure, it might be a rollercoaster ride, they conceded, but the republic would pull through. Well, if my transatlantic email is anything to go by, some of that cheery confidence seems to have evaporated.</p> <p>The thing that keeps my friends going, though, is the fact that Trump, despite his frantic, violent flailings, and despite his apparently rock-solid hold on a third of the electorate, is <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_biden-6247.html#!\">trailing Joe Biden in the polls</a>. So, the thinking goes, if we all hold our nerve, the nightmare will end on 20 January 2021, when Trump has to hand over power to his victorious opponent.</p> <p>At which point my mind goes back to this time in 2016, when similar sentiments were the conventional wisdom about the chances of Trump defeating Hillary Clinton. And one of the most agonising questions in the aftermath of that election was: how could <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nate-silver/\">Nate Silver and co</a> have got it so wrong?</p> <p>The answer is simple: nobody, including opinion pollsters, knew about the Trump campaign\u2019s astonishing <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/11/facebook-won-trump-election-not-just-fake-news/\">mastery of social media</a>, especially Facebook. Trump may not have known much about that at the time \u2013 he really only understood Twitter \u2013 but <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/09/the-man-behind-trumps-facebook-juggernaut\">Brad Parscale</a><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/09/the-man-behind-trumps-facebook-juggernaut\"> and his team</a> sure knew how to make use of Facebook\u2019s micro-targeting machine. And they did.</p> <p>Spool forward to now. Trump knows that if things continue as they are \u2013 with no party conventions or mass rallies and if the election is held in November (a sizable \u201cif\u201d IMHO) \u2013 then Biden will win. The only thing that could change that is \u2013 you guessed it! \u2013 Facebook.</p> <p>This thought is now informing everything he does. In particular, it explains his response to having his tweets labelled by Twitter by issuing a fatuous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/donald-trump-social-media-executive-order-twitter\">executive </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/donald-trump-social-media-executive-order-twitter\">order</a> (EO) threatening changes in Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. This is the clause that shields social media companies from legal liability for stuff that users post on their platforms. It\u2019s what underpins the business models of Twitter, Facebook and Google, among others.</p> <p>Legally, the executive order is a farce and may be unconstitutional. Most of the media thought it was aimed at Twitter but in fact, as the academic <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/05/trumps-executive-order-isnt-about-twitter/612349/\">Zeynep Tufekci</a> spotted immediately, its real target was Facebook, which has much more to lose if Section 230 were to be radically amended. And, as a warning shot, it worked a treat. No sooner had news of the EO emerged than who should turn up \u2013 on Fox News, Trump\u2019s favourite TV channel \u2013 than Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook boss, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/28/zuckerberg-facebook-police-online-speech-trump\">solemnly intoning his view</a> \u201cthat Facebook shouldn\u2019t be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online. Private companies probably shouldn\u2019t be\u2026 in the position of doing that.\u201d</p> <p>Evidence that the strategy of ensuring that Facebook was onboard for the Trump ride quickly emerged. When Trump, addressing \u201cthose THUGS\u201d demonstrating in Minneapolis, tweeted \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">Twitter flagged the tweet</a> as violating its policy against \u201cglorifying violence\u201d. Over at Facebook, however, Mark Zuckerberg made a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/facebook-trump-twitter-social-media-us?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">personal decision</a> to leave the equivalent message up on Facebook.</p> <p>What it all comes down to is this: only one man \u2013 Mark Zuckerberg \u2013 now stands between Joe Biden and the US presidency. If he were to decide (and in these matters his controlling stake in Facebook means he is unchallengeable) that the company\u2019s famed micro-targeting engine were to be off-limits to both Trump and Biden and their various supporting organisations, then Trump\u2019s candidacy would be toast.</p> <p>He won\u2019t do it, of course, for the simple reason that there\u2019s a lot of money to be made from politics in the 150 days between now and the presidential election. And if Trump wins, Zuckerberg will have that \u2013 and its grisly aftermath \u2013 on what is laughingly called his conscience. But so too will a former deputy prime minister of the UK who happens to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/19/facebook-hires-nick-clegg-as-head-of-global-affairs\">his </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/19/facebook-hires-nick-clegg-as-head-of-global-affairs\">consigliere</a></em> and was once, I believe, a liberal and a democrat.

In the early hours of 13 March Taylor, a certified EMT who hoped to become a nurse, was shot to death by plainclothes police officers while asleep in her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky. The officers were executing a no-knock search warrant and broke down a door to get in; Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, says he didn\u2019t hear officers announce themselves and thought it was a home invasion. Walker, a licensed gun owner, responded by shooting an officer in the leg; they fired more than 20 rounds in return and Taylor was hit at least eight times.</p> <p>Taylor would have turned 27 on Friday. She should have been celebrating. She should have had many decades of life ahead of her. Instead she is a hashtag. Meanwhile, the officers involved in her shooting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/us/breonna-taylor-birthday-charges-arrests-case-trnd/index.html\">haven\u2019t been charged with any crimes</a>.

Taylor\u2019s family have filed a wrongful death lawsuit and the FBI\u2019s Louisville office announced that it would be opening an investigation into Taylor\u2019s death on 21 May; since then, however, there&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/us/breonna-taylor-birthday-charges-arrests-case-trnd/index.html\">doesn\u2019t seem to have been much movement in the case</a>.</p> <p>Taylor hasn\u2019t gotten justice yet, but she hasn\u2019t been forgotten: protesters around the world are chanting her name. Nevertheless, the public outrage over Taylor\u2019s death has been somewhat belated. Had it not been for the massive protests sparked by George Floyd\u2019s murder, it\u2019s unlikely that Taylor would have received much, if any, mainstream attention.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/04/869930040/as-the-nation-chants-her-name-breonna-taylors-family-grieves-a-life-robbed\">NPR notes</a>&nbsp;that the earliest news stories covering Taylor\u2019s death didn\u2019t mention her name; they referred to her and Walker as \u201csuspects\u201d and focussed on the injured police officer.</p> <p>Writing for Time, author and professor Brittney Cooper notes black women and girls are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://time.com/5847970/police-brutality-black-women-girls/\">often an afterthought in our outrage over police violence</a> \u2013 which is why the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aapf.org/shn-campaign\">#SayHerName</a>&nbsp;campaign, which draws attention to female victims of state violence, was created in 2015. Cooper posits that one reason outrage over the police killing of black women is often a secondary concern is because many of these deaths have happened out of the public eye: \u201cAnd in a world where the pains and traumas that black women and girls experience as a consequence of both racism and sexism remain structurally invisible and impermeable to broad empathy, these killings recede from the foreground quietly.\u201d</p> <p>Black women, Cooper explains, also don\u2019t easily fit into \u201cthe lynching script, what with its accreting black male victims, overzealous cops and devious white women,\u201d which helps us understand why black men keep getting killed. \u201cFemininity is a weapon only if you\u2019re white,\u201d she writes. \u201cBlack women have no such protections.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe most disrespected person in America, is the black woman,\u201d&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/heres-malcolm-x-speech-black-021500517.html\">Malcolm X said in 1962</a>. The most unprotected person in America is the black woman. The most neglected person in America, is the black woman.\u201d Over half a century later, not much has changed. Black women are rarely centered in narratives about police violence; they are rarely the catalysts for mass outrage; their&nbsp;deaths are often an afterthought. Which is why we must keep fighting for justice for Breonna Taylor; we must keep saying her name.</p> <h2>Egyptian father \u2018used coronavirus\u2019 to trick daughters into FGM</h2> <p>An Egyptian man&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-52922079\">has been charged</a>&nbsp;for allegedly having a doctor carry out a female genital mutilation (FGM) procedure on his three daughters.

  "<p>What a relief: the \u201creal\u201d Lady Gaga is gone. For a while, it looked like pop\u2019s high priestess of serious silliness was being sucked into the Slough of Authenticity \u2013 first with her supposedly stripped-back, country-inspired 2016 album <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/23/lady-gaga-joanne-album-review-a-yo-million-reasons\">Joanne</a></em> (in truth, about as stripped back as Universal Studios is when compared with Disney World), then with her garlanded turn in <em>A Star Is Born</em> and its painfully earnest soundtrack album.&nbsp;</p> <p>Being real is a look every artist has to try on at least once, but it was never going to become Gaga\u2019s signature style. <em>Chromatica</em>, her sixth album, brings back the spectacle, manifesting a parallel reality she\u2019s had one foot in since childhood, centred on colour, kindness and connection. \u201cEarth is cancelled,\u201d she declared. \u201cI live on Chromatica.\u201d Coronavirus temporarily put a halt to the world-building begun in the <em>Star Trek</em>-flavoured video for lead single Stupid Love, forcing her to delay the album (she curated the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/20/one-world-together-at-home-concert-lady-gaga-raises-127m-coronavirus-relief\">One World: Together </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/20/one-world-together-at-home-concert-lady-gaga-raises-127m-coronavirus-relief\">at Home</a> concerts in the meantime) and leaving her summer tour up in the air. The songs, though, are more than vivid enough to conjure Planet Chromatica by themselves: Gaga\u2019s always tended to overstuff her records, but the hit rate on these 16 tracks is her highest since the gothic techno cabaret of 2011\u2019s <em>Born This Way</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Where that album was all glossy black, blood red and chrome, <em>Chromatica</em> is rainbow-bright, its colours lovingly painted with US producer BloodPop and a <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/listen-to-lady-gagas-new-album-chromatica/\">host of bit players</a>. The opening track, Alice, takes her down a new rabbit hole, recalling the best of 90s chart house \u2013 Ken Doh\u2019s Nakasaki, Ultra Nat\u00e9\u2019s Free \u2013 as she promises: \u201cI\u2019ll keep looking, keep looking for Wonderland.\u201d In the past, she\u2019s generally gravitated more towards techno, beats rigid and clunking; her surrender to the exhilarating, erotic pulse of funky and handbag house feels like a delicious release. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAm4om0wTs\">Rain on Me</a> exults in radiant piano stabs, her throaty roar and Ariana Grande\u2019s airy flourishes bouncing off each other beautifully, while Plastic Doll takes the classic pop conceit of woman-as-mannequin to new heights, with a paradigm of a chorus that recalls the roots of world-conquering 00s pop in Swedish clubland. The rush only wears a tiny bit thin on 1,000 Doves, Enigma and Replay, which are fine but no more, and Sour Candy, a bubbling collaboration with Korean group Blackpink which, though probably the most modern sound here, seems a little too anodyne for Gaga.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Chromatica</em>\u2019s burst of light is set off all the more vividly by a darker backdrop. Gaga has spoken about how making the album helped her begin to deal with the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8iNYY7YV04\">post-traumatic stress disorder</a> that resulted from being raped repeatedly at 19, and also with the dissociative, objectifying double-edged sword of celebrity (\u201cyour monsters torture me\u201d, she wails on Replay \u2013 hard not to read that as an allusion to her most fervent fans, the Little Monsters, much as she undoubtedly loves them). Meanwhile, 911, a tribute to her antipsychotic medication, conjures the claustrophobia of compulsive thoughts with a more familiar technoid throb and a nervy robotic vocal: \u201cTurning up emotional faders/Keep repeating self-hating phrases.\u201d The beat jackhammers, driving her up to a Donna Summer trill, then slows to a more comfortable groove as she regains perspective and control: \u201cmy biggest enemy is me, pop a 911\u201d.&nbsp;</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAm4om0wTs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AoAm4om0wTs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/AoAm4om0wTs\">Watch the video for Lady Gaga\u2019s Rain on Me</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p><em>Chromatica</em>\u2019s frank grappling with the vagaries of Gaga\u2019s brain \u2013 and the way fame exacerbates them \u2013 ends up feeling much more real than touring dive bars with a guitar and a Stetson ever did. Healing through music is a common enough theme, but here and now, especially, it\u2019s genuinely euphoric to hear Gaga dancing out of her head and back into life. Sine from Above, its plucked strings and trancey pulse expanding on the album\u2019s classy instrumental interludes, spells it out, Gaga picturing a restorative sound wave beaming down from the sky as Elton John (whom she credits with helping her see that creativity needn\u2019t mean self-destruction) bellows, \u201cWhen I was young, I felt immortal\u201d, like <em>Flash Gordon</em>\u2019s Prince Vultan across the vistas of her imaginary world.</p> <p>Babylon sees her strutting off into the sunset with&nbsp;splashy catwalk piano, sax with attitude and a half-rapped vocal so reminiscent of Madonna\u2019s Vogue that the <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/elton-john-brands-madonna-ungracious-and-nasty-over-lady-gaga-feud-2560434\">two stars are likely to have public words again</a>.

If anything, local shops and other retailers have been reducing the number of opening hours in their business to keep their staff safe whilst restocking and cleaning stores, and we expect non-essential retailers to operate with limited hours when they reopen later this month.</p> <p>\u201cThere are many measures that have been recommended through high street reviews and task forces in recent years that could support the recovery of high street businesses, but at no point has a change to Sunday trading regulations been considered and with good reason.

  "<h2>Chris McGreal, Guardian US reporter, in Minneapolis</h2> <p>This has been by far the most serious unrest I\u2019ve covered in the US.&nbsp;<br>I was in Ferguson six years ago where the protests looked more dramatic on the television than they actually were, with a few buildings looted and burned, and confrontations with the police a staged nightly ritual over the same few blocks.&nbsp;<br>Minneapolis was on a different scale, both in the depth of anger and the levels of protest and destruction. Many thousands turned out to lay siege to the police station in the precinct where George Floyd was killed before they stormed and burned it. Many thousands more marched in different parts of Minneapolis and St Paul before the protests spread across the country.&nbsp;<br><br>For two nights in a row, the police evaporated \u2013 leaving a huge area around about three miles of a main shopping thoroughfare, Lake Street, under the control of protesters, looters and arsonists. Hundreds of businesses had their windows smashed, were looted, or were burned.&nbsp;<br><br>The scale of the demonstrations and destruction reflected the scale of the anger.&nbsp;<br>That seemed to me in part because of the video of George Floyd\u2019s death was so clear-cut and painful. It\u2019s telling that so few people have tried to justify the former police officer Derek Chauvin\u2019s kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes as the life drains out of him, unlike the many who spoke up in support of the officer who shot Michael Brown in Ferguson.&nbsp;<br><br>But that video also added to a sense of the frustration at yet another killing of an African American man by the police, and that so little seems to change even with the rise of Black Lives Matter. The way that Chauvin looks into the phone cameras, knowing he is being filmed, and kept his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck regardless of his pleas and cries for his mother seemed to symbolise the contempt of the police for the movement.&nbsp;<br><br>As a result, the more peaceful demonstrations drew people who do not normally protest. I even met a few Republicans who were horrified by what they saw on the video and thought the time had come to stand up.<br><br>Through all of this, social distancing broke down completely. Riots in different times usually meant protesters tied bandanas or T-shirts around their faces to shield their identities. In 2020 everyone had a mask readily to hand. There were times when it looked as if the local medical school was charging the police accompanied by particularly fashionable rioters in designer masks.<br><br>In a sign of our times, reporters found themselves not only hit with baton rounds and teargas by the police when it was clear they were shooting at journalists, but facing physical threats from some among the protesters. These tended to be young men, both white and black, who see the media as part of the conspiracy.&nbsp;<br><br>And if you look like me (ageing, no hair), there\u2019s the occasional person who imagines you are a police spy and lets you know with varying degrees of hostility. Although this was pretty easily dealt with the moment they heard my accent.<br></p> <h2>Aamna Mohdin, Guardian reporter, in London</h2> <p>The killing of George Floyd took place thousands of miles from the UK, but the anger and pain that sparked mass protests in the US has resonated deeply across the Atlantic.&nbsp;</p> <p>Last weekend, protests sprung up sporadically in Cardiff, London, Manchester, and Nottingham to state clearly that \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d in the UK as well. The protesters, the vast majority of whom were under 30, chanted: \u201cNo justice, no peace, no racist police\u201d and \u201cthe UK is not innocent\u201d, in a demonstration that was largely organised through word of mouth and social media away from established anti-racism groups. Teenagers, who said they had grown up with videos of black people dying on their timelines, shouted: \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d<br><br>They carried hundreds of handmade signs and called out the names of those in the UK that have died at the hands of the police, including Mark Duggan. Though coronavirus is invisible, the disproportionate impact the pandemic has had on the black and minority ethnic community in the UK was another source of anger and frustration among demonstrators. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f16239b77b1aa146f73647233c11e497eb45914\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f16239b77b1aa146f73647233c11e497eb45914/0_135_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Black Lives Matter protest near the Home Office in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Black Lives Matter protest near the Home Office in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Julian Borger, world affairs editor, in Washington DC</h2> <p>There were different currents inside the crowds outside the White House.&nbsp;The great majority were there for a protest, but there were small groups weaving in and out looking break and burn things.&nbsp;As long as they were in the body of the crowd, they were mostly contained, shouted down when they threw water bottles at the police. </p> <p>The discipline only really collapsed when the police started to break up the protest, with short charges, flash-bang grenades and gas canisters. There is some doubt about what kind of gas it was. The police deny using CS (tear gas) but canisters of OC gas (Oleoresins Capiscum) were found at the scene, and that has very similar effects - a burning sensation&nbsp;in the eyes and throat.&nbsp;</p> <p>When&nbsp;the crowd scattered things really fell apart.&nbsp;One group started to smash the entrance to the AFL-CIO union federation headquarters, while a handful tried to talk them out of it, but the vandals carried the day. They set light to one car and ran along I Street, a thoroughfare running through the commercial centre, with baseball bats, smashing every car they came to.&nbsp;There were no police to be seen: they and the National Guard were all massed in front of the White House with the sole focus of breaking up the demonstration. Looters were left to their own devices. The result of those tactics was angrier protesters, a licence for looters and more destruction.&nbsp;</p> <p>In similar situations of civil unrest I have witnessed elsewhere in the world, there was a sense that being a journalist with credentials around your neck afforded some personal protection. Journalists in the melee outside the White House knew that wasn\u2019t true here. Reporters have been targeted all over the country. It was an unnerving feeling, that a line had been crossed in the relations between the police and press. It seemed to me that the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d rhetoric of the president had been internalised. I think it will be hard to change that back.</p> <h2><br>Joanna Walters, Guardian US news editor, in New York</h2> <p>It\u2019s unprecedented to be covering mass protests during a pandemic that has also cratered the economy - a combination of factors that has had a massively disproportionate impact on urban communities of colour in America. But it has also made reporting in the field extremely difficult. We\u2019ve been taking a safety first approach. Despite my time being mostly taken up with editing, in the non-Covid world I would have rushed out with my notebook and phone to talk to protesters and gauge the mood in person, jostling alongside everyone. But many protesters, and police, are not wearing masks. Social distancing at the heart of the action is a hopeless aspiration and the risks of coronavirus for everyone are acute, so I\u2019m being more cautious than usual. <br><br>Conservatives call for forceful restoration of law and order, progressives call for listening and reform. It\u2019s hard to see a healing of divisions and any progress away from historical systemic racism and inequality in this fraught, weird election year in lockdown, infected by both a virus and violence. But there are powerful voices and ideas for change out there and we\u2019ll make sure to elevate them and bring some hope in these tough times, too.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0c43c49acaadd385ffde1ee72d57b59ca4b53da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0c43c49acaadd385ffde1ee72d57b59ca4b53da/0_0_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters in Sydney earlier this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters in Sydney earlier this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Milnes/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Naaman Zhou, Guardian Australia reporter, in Sydney</h2> <p>In Sydney, hundreds gathered in solidarity on a cold Tuesday night. We have our own issues with policing, and the deaths of Indigenous Australians in custody. They chanted for George Floyd, but also for David Dungay Jr. \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/family-of-david-dungay-who-died-in-custody-express-solidarity-with-family-of-george-floyd\">who said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 12 times in a Sydney jail before he died in 2015</a> \u2013 and against the statistic that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/deaths-in-our-backyard-432-indigenous-australians-have-died-in-custody-since-2008\"> 432 Indigenous Australians have died in custody since 1991</a>.</p> <p>There was a real sense of tension. I have covered many, many protests in this exact place before. The annual Invasion Day rallies, the climate strikes. In comparison, this event had been more swiftly, and more confusingly organised. The main protest was planned for Saturday; this was more of a snap action. Police permission had been granted, we were told, an hour before the protest. Many were not sure whether it actually had been. There was a natural worry among the crowd, having seen so many people gassed and shot by police in the US. Just the day before, a local police officer had<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/02/video-shows-nsw-australia-police-officer-slamming-indigenous-boy-face-first-onto-pavement\"> slammed an Indigenous teenager onto the ground</a>.</p> <p>But police on Tuesday were restrained, all unarmed (as most Australian police are), and the presence relatively small. The event officially concluded after an hour, but most people stayed put, wanting to be there, unsure if it was over, intent on it continuing. Impromptu speakers stood and spoke. People knelt in Sydney\u2019s Martin Place and chanted \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Ankita Rao, Guardian US reporter, in New York</h2> <p>Over the course of the last week, I\u2019ve watched the tense interactions between the NYPD, a veritable $6bn army, and the people of New York. The protests, often dozens happening simultaneously across the boroughs, follow the same arc: a large, passionate mass of people with signs and chants who mobilize down the streets and bridges, occupying spaces normally left to cars. And then at some point, a standoff with the police. It takes so little for these to get violent -- a plastic water bottle chucked in the wrong direction, or someone on the sidewalk stepping onto the street. And then an officer will bear down, push back, pull out a baton. After that, it\u2019s hard to say what will happen that night -- we\u2019ve seen everything from teargas to beatings to the arrests of minors.&nbsp;<br><br>In New York, no one in power is held sacred -- not the mayor, not the governor. And these past few days, I\u2019ve seen the most powerful solidarity I\u2019ve ever witnessed on the streets of the city. People handing out food, masks and water bottles. Protestors calming each other down, burning sage and palo santo, speaking poems. Over the days the protests become more intentional, with more direction, and more conversation about what to do when the night falls. More children, more dogs, more doctors. Yesterday I spoke to some protesters who had decided, at midnight, to head home. They said they needed to save their energy. They planned to be out on the streets every day for a long time.<br></p>",
  "<p>Most modern teenagers have a discreet, thumbed-aside corner of their smartphones where they stash away the apps they are most ashamed of using. In 2018, this was where a 17-year-old US high school student called Dixie D\u2019Amelio kept an odd little social media app called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok\" title=\"\">TikTok</a>. From what Dixie could make of it, TikTok expected users to record and post ultra-short, ultra-energetic videos of themselves that were soundtracked with pre-made audio clips. Songs. Snatches of dialogue. Users danced to these clips or lip-synced along. They copied each other\u2019s moves and riffed on references and in-jokes that were starting to slosh around <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/en/\" title=\"\">TikTok</a>\u2019s expanding global network.</p> <p>More and more, Dixie enjoyed scrolling through the endless feed of hectic TikTok videos, but in private.

How did a Chinese app step in from the fringes to take such an awesome bite out of a social media market traditionally dominated by powerhouse Americans (Facebook, Twitter)? Dixie and Charli tell me their half of the story from their bedroom, speaking over each other in that fluent, seamless way of close siblings. They both have shoulder-length brown hair, freckles and the reedy physicality of young athletes.

The app had been around in some form or another for years, first gathering momentum in 2016 after Twitter closed down its short-form video service <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/vine\" title=\"\">Vine</a>, leaving a small but exploitable hole in the social market. In summer 2018, it merged with the US lip-syncing app <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/04/musical-ly-lip-synch-video-app-turns-pop-fans-into-stars\" title=\"\">Musical.ly</a>, increasing its reach, and by the end of that year it had crept to the top of Apple\u2019s US app charts.</p> <p>TikTok\u2019s strategy of appealing to Gen Z\u2019s need for release, somewhere for them to not be Insta-perfect, was working. It was adding tens of millions of new users every month; in January 2019, the influential technology blog TechCrunch published an editorial headlined \u201c<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/its-time-to-pay-serious-attention-to-tiktok/\" title=\"\">It\u2019s time to pay serious attention to TikTok</a>\u201d \u2013 advice that Facebook and Twitter, now hurriedly preparing copycat products, had been uncharacteristically slow to heed. When ByteDance celebrated the new year by <a href=\"http://www.fgreatstudio.com/portfolio/tiktok-burj-khalifa-projection-mapping\" title=\"\">projecting its TikTok logo</a> on to the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, it was a statement of arrival.</p> <p>Charli\u2019s perky, precise dance videos caught on in 2019 and grew in popularity as TikTok did. It hadn\u2019t exactly become cool in her friend circle, Dixie explains, but few people would have thought of pretending they didn\u2019t use the app, or understand its references and in-jokes. TikTok culture had spilled over into the school corridors.</p> <p>What is that culture? You could think of it like YouTube (beauty how-tos, cartoony science experiments, impressive athletic feats, pets being cute, domestic accidents filmed by chance, monologues to camera, goofy lip-syncs, breathless dances), only on TikTok such videos have to be severely truncated in order to be uploaded. Users get 15 seconds to express themselves, and this brevity helps to create a staccato, no-explanations, absurdist flavour to much of the content. Comedy skits benefit from the tight edit, for instance. If some of the monologues are over-earnest, at least they don\u2019t run on too long. TikTok has made capsule celebrities of young magicians, fashion mavens, political campaigners. It has also elevated people to notoriety by accident (my favourite being a young woman known as <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/laurenstrapagiel/tiktok-heres-the-motherfucking-tea\" title=\"\">The Motherfucking Tea Girl</a>, after a rant of hers that went viral in 2019).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We were out one night and noticed kids staring. We thought, there\u2019s no way they know Charli from that weird app</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a TikTok novice, I didn\u2019t fully grasp its peculiar culture until I started thinking of the app as if it were my old playground at school. When I was a kid in the 90s, everyone had seen the same TV shows, listened to the same songs, had heard about the same laugh-out-loud acts of cheek against the teachers. To listen in on our playground conversation as an outsider (Simpsons references, Britpop lyrics, hyper-local gossip) would have been like hearing a gabbling alien language. But to be in the thick of it, <em>getting</em> it, was wonderful. So now I think of TikTok as one big secondary-school playground, with 800 million people crammed in. All babbling, all getting it.</p> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d says Dixie, when I pitch her my comparison.</p> <p>It was more or less why she cracked and started posting videos herself, she explains. \u201cEvery conversation was about TikTok. \u2018Oh my God, Charli has 100,000 followers. Oh my God, she has 200,000.\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m done! If Charli hits 1 million followers, I\u2019ll start posting because I\u2019m done being left out like this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Charli: \u201cShe never thought I was gonna hit one million followers.\u201d</p> <p>Dixie: \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Charli: \u201cAnd then I hit one million.\u201d</p> <p>Dixie: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>This was October 2019. The D\u2019Amelio family celebrated Charli\u2019s milestone with a cake and Dixie kept up her end of the agreement, popping up in Charli\u2019s videos and then shooting her own knockabout solo efforts, fooling around in the family home. Dixie\u2019s presence supercharged both sisters\u2019 popularity. By now, their parents had accounts of their own, initially to keep an eye on the girls, but soon with millions of curious followers of their own.</p> <p>\u201cWe were kind of on autopilot as a family at the time,\u201d recalls Marc, who is 51 and works in sportswear. \u201cDixie was about to go to college. She was driving Charli to school in the mornings. Me and Heidi were kind of looking at the finish line of parenting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCoasting,\u201d agrees Heidi, 48. \u201cAnd then we were out to dinner one night and we noticed kids at the other table staring. We both thought, there\u2019s no way they know Charli from that weird app\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Before long, there were mobbings at the mall and at airports. Managers and marketers contacted the house, hoping the sisters would sign deals. Marc and Heidi first met in the 90s in New York, where Marc ran his sportswear business and Heidi was a model and personal trainer. They both had some experience at the crossover point of consumer and celebrity culture, but still \u2013 that their teenage daughters had become lucrative stars, in a matter of weeks and without leaving their bedrooms, was a bit of a surprise. Marc recalls: \u201cWe really thought we\u2019d figured out how to have two kids. Then this was thrust on us. We had to regroup. Huddle together as a family and figure out all this new stuff.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e08ad1ed455a8576743f713a864ca5a62a5123c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e08ad1ed455a8576743f713a864ca5a62a5123c1/143_87_2733_1872/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charli on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charli on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In November 2019, Charli was invited to go on holiday with a collective of young TikTokers based in Los Angeles (<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@thehypehouse?lang=en\" title=\"\">the Hype House</a>, a kind of 21st-century <a href=\"https://variety.com/gallery/the-mickey-mouse-club-famous-members/nikki-deloach-mickey-mouse-club/\" title=\"\">Mickey Mouse Club</a>) and though the affiliation did not last, it was a move that helped nudge her further into the millions of followers. There were other, more random boosts to her popularity. Before Christmas, she copied a TikTok dance that was doing the rounds \u2013 the audio was the clip of a track by the rapper <a href=\"http://www.kcamp427.com/about\" title=\"\">K Camp</a> \u2013 and a lot of people gravitated to<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8OctG2KWX0\" title=\"\"> Charli\u2019s version</a>. The video was watched more than 150m times, mostly by users trying to copy and perfect the dance. The suburban high school girl, still 15, suddenly had the market reach of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\" title=\"\">Knowles-Carter</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/kim-kardashian\" title=\"\">Kardashian.</a></p> <p>In early 2020, Charli was signed by the powerful Hollywood agency UTA, along with the rest of the D\u2019Amelio family. By then, <a href=\"https://theface.com/culture/charli-and-dixie-damelio-chase-hudson-derek-hough-tiktok-social-media-interview\" title=\"\">The Face magazine</a> felt comfortable describing her as \u201cthe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jul/01/pina-bausch-obituary-dance\" title=\"\">Pina Bausch</a> of TikTok\u201d. In February, Dixie joined the cast of a YouTube drama made by the tween production company Brats and, meanwhile talks began about constructing a TV reality show around the entire family. In April, Charli was invited to dance for a national TV audience <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3xbnumiS0E\" title=\"\">on The Jimmy Fallon Show</a>, by which point she was the most-followed person on TikTok\u2019s platform. As Heidi describes this period: \u201cThings. Went. Crazy.\u201d</p> <p>***<br>It\u2019s worth pausing here to consider a question often asked in the comment-threads under Charli\u2019s TikTok videos. Why her? What made this particular teenager\u2019s breezy, professionally dapper, but ultimately innocuous dance videos take off in such an enormous way?</p> <p>To properly understand a community and its whims, there\u2019s little point zeroing in on the gilded few who have risen to the top. <em>They</em> don\u2019t know. To understand Charli\u2019s mass appeal, I would need to speak to representatives of the masses, users who were stuck in the foothills of the app with tens or hundreds of followers and who nevertheless kept the network churning with content and comments and follows. Several of my teenage nieces and nephews are dogged TikTokers and after a quick call-out on the family WhatsApp group, I was able to assemble a brain trust of Charli obsessives who could answer any question about her.</p> <p>Why Charli, I ask?</p> <p>Niece #1: \u201cShe\u2019s funny. Upbeat.\u201d</p> <p>Nephew #1: \u201cShe\u2019s very smiley and positive.\u201d</p> <p>Niece #2: \u201cA major thing with Charli is her age. The general TikTok audience is younger than on Facebook or Instagram, so the influencers need to be younger.\u201d</p> <p>Niece #3: \u201cShe\u2019s a good dancer.\u201d</p> <p>Niece #2: \u201cWhenever we want to learn a dance, we\u2019ll look for Charli\u2019s video because she\u2019s so good, we think of hers as the best version to copy.\u201d</p> <p>Nephew #1: \u201cHer having an older sister helps. They can do videos together.\u201d</p> <p>Niece #1: \u201cThey can do synchronised moves.\u201d</p> <p>Niece #2: \u201cA lot of families across the world use TikTok and it\u2019s a bond people recognise.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re offered deals all the time that we turn down. Charli will not promote something she doesn\u2019t like</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I ask the D\u2019Amelio family the same question \u2013 why them? \u2013 Marc puts it down to luck. An app came along that prized a certain style of dancing (just this side of practised) and a certain style of personality (just this side of sarcastic) and Charli and Dixie happened to fit the mould. They benefited from \u201cthe lightning in a bottle effect\u201d, Marc says, of being relatable to a generation.</p> <p>Charli has long professed bafflement about her rise. TikTok, though noticeably friendlier in tone than most of its social media competitors, is by no means an online utopia. People can be cruel. Towards the end of last year, Charli had to post a captioned video in response to a common observation that her popularity did not make sense. \u201cI don\u2019t understand [it] either,\u201d Charli wrote in the video, \u201cbut that\u2019s not my problem.\u201d This slightly flinty statement has softened over time into a kind of mantra for dealing with both the attention and the questions about whether she deserves it. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d it now says on Charli\u2019s TikTok profile page, \u201cI don\u2019t get the hype either.\u201d</p> <p>Dixie says: \u201cI wish I could protect her a little bit more from the haters.\u201d</p> <p>I ask them how the worst of the negativity manifests itself. Comments? Direct messages? Actually, on TikTok it tends to be a little more roundabout than that. A popular collaborative feature on TikTok allows users to take a stranger\u2019s video and \u201cduet\u201d with it. (The original video appears on one half of a split-screen, the responding one on the other half.) Credited by some tech observers as a key innovation that helped TikTok create a sense of ongoing collaboration, \u201cduets\u201d are also a quick and easy vehicle for mockery. \u201cYou can\u2019t really avoid them,\u201d Dixie explains, adding that if you\u2019re the subject of someone\u2019s duet (well-intentioned or otherwise), that video is invariably pushed into your feed. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think people\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Charli finishes her sentence: \u201c\u2026understand that. They think you\u2019ll never see. But it\u2019s just not true.\u201d \u201cLearning how to deal with hate,\u201d Dixie says, \u201cthat\u2019s the part we\u2019re still working on it. It gets very frustrating.\u201d</p> <p>As for the numbers, Charli says, \u201ceven 100,000 pairs of eyes is a <em>lot</em>. So it\u2019s been, since very early on, that the numbers stopped making sense to me. I try to think, \u2018I don\u2019t know how these people found me, and this is all crazy, and I\u2019m just gonna keep doing what I\u2019m doing.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>***<br>We break off the interview so Charli and Dixie can make some TikTok videos. Charli\u2019s creative process for this is not much of one at all. She scrolls through her \u201cFor You\u201d page (a sort of welcome-to-the-app splash screen full of videos algorithmically generated for each user) and chooses an audio clip she likes. Otherwise, she thumbs through a list of saved, favourite clips that have caught her ear before and earmarked for possible use. Today it\u2019s a crunchy, low-quality recording of a couple of bars from a 2011 track by rapper J Cole called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWlibNTrg80\" title=\"\">Work Out</a>.</p> <p>For reasons of not looking as if you\u2019re trying too hard, another convention of TikTok is that the music clips often sound secondhand, slightly distorted, as if taxing the limits of a smartphone speaker. Charli hits the button that says \u201cUse this sound\u201d and she\u2019s ready to shoot. Now, and not before, she\u2019ll think about what to do. \u201cThere\u2019s no planning. The thing about making a TikTok is, whenever you\u2019re making it, that\u2019s when the ideas come.\u201d She props her smartphone against a water bottle in her bedroom and, with Dixie, films a brief dance. It ends in a comic tumble as Dixie collides with her sister and loses her balance. Good enough: the footage is edited down to seven seconds, ending on a smeared closeup of Dixie as she collapses forward towards the camera lens. \u201cUpload.\u201d</p> <p>Dixie goes downstairs to make a solo video of herself dancing on the kitchen counter while Charli stays in her room and, choosing a clip of an old song by Drake, lip-syncs along. Her follower count has just ticked over 54 million, so she appends a comment: \u201cTHANK YOU GUYS SO SO MUCH FOR 54 MILLION!!!!\u201d Meanwhile I track the progress of the J Cole dance that ended with Dixie falling over. It goes online in the early afternoon and by teatime it has been seen 4m times. Within a day the number is up past 20m. After a week it\u2019s 45m and still tick-tocking up, up, up. These are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/adele\" title=\"\">Adele</a> numbers. Sports broadcast numbers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"29800fab943fbc174bdfe0be24ba7d23305fe346\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29800fab943fbc174bdfe0be24ba7d23305fe346/0_43_3961_5818/681.jpg\" alt=\"The D\u2019Amelios in their garden in Norfolk, Connecticut.\" width=\"681\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The D\u2019Amelios at home in Norfolk, Connecticut.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Lane/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt <em>is</em> a business now, 100%,\u201d Marc tells me. \u201cWhen kids have millions of followers, it\u2019s kind of hard to put the brakes on it. So, for lack of a better term, we\u2019ve kind of decided to double down. We\u2019re seeing where all this goes.\u201d The sisters currently have a range of endorsement deals, including with a skincare company, though Marc stresses \u201cwe\u2019re offered deals all the time that we turn down. Charli will not promote something she doesn\u2019t like.\u201d Heidi adds: \u201cI\u2019ve seen her sit in a room full of executives and say no. I couldn\u2019t have done that at her age.\u201d</p> <p>TikTok as a service has been deliberately slow to monetise, creators ByteDance deploying the softly-softly startup strategy of growing a base of devotees before trying too obviously to sell them things. In spring 2019, early video ads were allowed on to the network. A few months later, a feature was added called Hashtag Challenges: sponsored marketing campaigns, by any other name, in which TikTokers push certain products. In February, the D\u2019Amelios were involved in some hectic promotion of a Hashtag Challenge in aid of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/02/j-lo-shakira-super-bowl-half-time-show-review\" title=\"\">Jennifer Lopez\u2019s half-time performance at the Super Bowl</a>. The family were flown to Miami, where <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@charlidamelio/video/6788733687660956933?lang=en\" title=\"\">Charli filmed a dance with Lopez</a>.</p> <p>It probably says a lot about TikTok culture (and maybe older media\u2019s hesitant grasp of it) that some videos Charli made of herself <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@charlidamelio/video/6788516032416877829?lang=en\" title=\"\">dancing to a Sean Paul track in her Miami hotel bathroom</a> got more eyeballs than the J-Lo collaboration. For now, at least, there\u2019s distrust in TikTok land of any stars who too brazenly sell out. On Charli\u2019s 16th birthday, the D\u2019Amelio family recorded videos of themselves wearing matching Charli-branded hoodies in celebration. Marc put out a message directing fans to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcdamelio/status/1256076779615399936\" title=\"\">Charli\u2019s online shop</a> where the hoodies were on sale (\u201ctoday only\u201d). I noticed, though, that he kept the salesmanship to his Twitter account, away from TikTok.</p> <p>In the same way the young users of the app seem to resist many of the aesthetics of the Instagram age (the D\u2019Amelios will often make videos while wearing pimple cream, to the amazement of their mother), there\u2019s evidently a squeamishness about echoing the mistakes of older Insta-stars who will haphazardly sell followers anything \u2013 teabags, eScooters, obscure holiday destinations, whoever\u2019s paying. Heidi, trying to explain why Charli would face down a room full of advertising execs and refuse lucrative offers, gives a compelling reason: \u201cCharli doesn\u2019t want to get crushed for it online. She doesn\u2019t want to be called out.\u201d</p> <p>***<br>One of Charli and Dixie\u2019s most popular TikToks, made in the days after our interview, lasts just four seconds. It\u2019s a compact, gnomic expression of Gen Z mores and tics \u2013 an initially inexplicable duet between the sisters and three strangers that takes me a good half an hour to decode when it pops up on my \u201cFor You\u201d page. Here\u2019s what I think is happening in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQReyNiuV84\" title=\"\">the video</a>.</p> <p>A random TikToker, feeling sentimental, has a thought about Charli and decides to express it by filming themselves curled up in bed with a pensive look on their face. \u201cI know for a fact,\u201d it says on an overlaid caption, \u201cthat Charli D\u2019Amelio would wait for me to tie my shoe while everyone else kept walking.\u201d Another TikToker takes the prompt and \u201cduets\u201d with this video, adding the lightest touch of snark about too-good-to-be-true Charli. \u201cI just know [she] would ask me if I was feeling OK after the rest of the group laughed at my self-deprecating joke.\u201d This goes on a bit, with more pensive expressions and more \u201cI just know\u201ds, until Dixie sees the video and gets involved. She videos herself curled up in bed and appends the caption: \u201cI just know Charli D\u2019Amelio.\u201d</p> <p>The coup comes from Charli herself, who breaks the chain of melancholy faces by filming herself clenching her fists, jiggling from side to side with a deadpan, shit-eating grin, under a caption that reads: \u201cI Charli D\u2019Amelio.\u201d The whole thing plays out, without explanation, to a looping clip of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltrMfT4Qz5Y\" title=\"\">Kenny Loggins singing the 1984 soundtrack to Footloose</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/14/tiktok-is-the-social-media-sensation-of-lockdown-could-i-become-its-new-star\">TikTok is the social media sensation of lockdown. Could I become its new star?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em>This</em> is TikTok. The ad hoc collaboration between distant strangers. The tonal blend of earnestness and irony. The unbothered bed-head aesthetics and the incongruous soundtrack. Watching the video, trying to unravel it, gets me thinking about Gen Z as a whole \u2013 what a confused and sad world we\u2019re bequeathing them. We\u2019ve thrust cameras in their faces for as long as they can remember, making them twitchily aware of their appearance from all angles. No wonder they have begun to congregate, away from all the stumbling grownups, in a place they can be silly, arch and sweet, and look a mess, and think at microprocessor speed \u2013 all in a format that registers as gibberish to outsiders.</p> <p>As Dixie explains, \u201cIf someone has never used TikTok before and they come on it, they\u2019ll have no idea what\u2019s going on. Things go viral and then disappear right away. It comes and goes, and comes and goes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s fun,\u201d Charli says. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be on-your-best all the time. Things keep passing. There isn\u2019t some impossible thing you can be, that you\u2019re shooting for, that you have to maintain.\u201d</p> <p>Dixie: \u201cThings can last one day and then nobody talks about them ever again. And that\u2019s\u2026 \u201d</p> <p>Charli: \u201cThat\u2019s super-cool.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It is hard to believe now, even harder when you are shoehorned into one of the most cramped and restrictive press boxes in England, but Goodison Park was a World Cup stadium once.</p> <p>That was in 1966 and on many occasions it has been remarked that to all intents and purposes the ground has hardly changed since. If physical distancing is to arrive in the media areas it will certainly not be before time. Yet people are fond of Goodison, it will be missed when Everton move out to their shiny new home by the docks. It is not just the Archibald Leitch architecture, the boxy stands or the pub across the road where Bill Kenwright has a habit of fraternising with his public after famous victories, it is the way the place sits, like Arsenal\u2019s Highbury used to, in the middle of a community. \u201cTurn a corner and there\u2019s a football ground,\u201d as Ars\u00e9ne Wenger said when introduced to the odd concept (for a Frenchman) of a stadium surrounded on all sides by housing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/04/premier-league-project-retstar-five-substitutions-nine-players-on-bench\">Premier League plans fixture list with Everton-Liverpool set for first Sunday</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These thoughts came to mind through consideration of why Goodison might be unsuitable for its next scheduled fixture, the long-delayed Merseyside derby that could still \u2013 assuming local authority permission and Manchester City losing against Arsenal \u2013 see Liverpool collect the league title on their neighbours\u2019 patch. Some of the concerns to be raised at the Safety Advisory Group meeting on Monday apparently include the difficulty of throwing a no-go zone around a stadium when people live in the streets that require closing off, the relative pokiness of the changing rooms and that the players\u2019 tunnel is too narrow to allow proper physical distancing if the teams are to emerge together. In which case, you might think, let the teams emerge one after the other. Or from different sides of the ground. This is an empty stadium we are talking about, after all.</p> <p>Heck, if Liverpool wanted to they could get changed in their own dressing rooms at Anfield and stroll through Stanley Park to the game.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2576f45c08773557490a3e4dda59a2d2e874d857\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2576f45c08773557490a3e4dda59a2d2e874d857/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Everton\u2019s Tom Davies touches the club crest in the Goodison Park tunnel before the Premier League match against Burnley in December 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Everton\u2019s Tom Davies touches the club crest in the Goodison Park tunnel before the Premier League match against Burnley in December 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony McArdle - Everton FC/Everton FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just about anything is possible if the game is going to be played behind closed doors and while the television companies must be excited now they have been granted their wish to place cameras in tunnels, one hopes they, too, will realise safety considerations must come first.</p> <p>It will be interesting to see what objections are raised to a match taking place at a venue that has been hosting them for the past 128 years. Granted, Goodison might not be ideal in every way for lockdown football, but none of the above considerations seem weighty enough to warrant taking the game elsewhere. If the past few months have taught us anything it is how to be adaptable. The local police have said they are happy for a game to go ahead at a ground designed for the purpose, so surely physical distancing measures inside the stadium are secondary to the fact that once on the pitch the players will be in full contact with each other. The congestion in the tunnel or changing rooms will be nothing compared to the congestion in the penalty box at the first corner, in other words, and it is important to remember that games are being sanctioned in the first place only because there is confidence that players have been tested often enough to deem the restart safe.</p> <p>Without wishing to pre-empt the SAG meeting\u2019s conclusion, it would be a shame were a neutral ground to be recommended. Goodison will not host many more derbies and it will certainly never be included in another World Cup. Even were Fifa to grant England the privilege tomorrow Goodison would fail to meet most of the modern criteria for staging games, mostly for the same reasons of compactness that make it such a coronavirus risk. When Fifa chooses World Cup venues it tends to go for the ones that are as far away from human habitation as possible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"12b4e06b4cbbd992395a73691ee38558c0d9da29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12b4e06b4cbbd992395a73691ee38558c0d9da29/0_0_4340_2994/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pele surges forward during Brazil\u2019s 2-0 win over Bulgaria in their 1966 World Cup group game at Goodison Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"690\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pele surges forward during Brazil\u2019s 2-0 win over Bulgaria in their 1966 World Cup group game at Goodison Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Art Rickerby/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It prefers stadiums built in parkland, or at least in open space at the extreme edge of cities. That way it can throw its own no-go zone around the games, pitch its tented villages for corporate guests and provide plenty of car parking, while fans with tickets come by train or bus from miles away. Quite often Fifa World Cups go to countries willing to build new stadiums in out-of-the-way places that conform to such guidelines, even in the knowledge that after the tournament their usefulness and practicality will be limited. The idea that England deserves a World Cup because it has modern and capacious stadiums already in place, venues that are seen around the world full to capacity most weeks of the year, is not the sort of argument that sways Fifa committees, as might be guessed from this country\u2019s lack of bidding success in recent years and the fact that the next World Cup will be played in a country not remotely famous for football.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/03/everton-offer-leighton-baines-one-year-contract-goodison-park\">Everton offer Leighton Baines one-year contract to remain at Goodison Park</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At least, with any luck, the coronavirus pandemic will be under control by the time the Qatar World Cup takes place. By then Goodison will be 130 years old and possibly staging its last season of football, hopefully with the necessity of playing games behind closed doors just an unpleasant memory. Many more years hence, when everyone is playing on trading estates or brownfield sites, the notion of football clubs operating on streets with pubs and houses is going to seem equally strange and unlikely. One trusts that when fans are allowed back into grounds, after this weirdly unnatural interlude, a few minutes will be spent fully appreciating what we have long been taking for granted.</p>",
  "<p>The government has extended its ban on evictions in England and Wales by a further two months, prolonging the breathing space for thousands of tenants who have struggled to pay the rent during lockdown.</p> <p>\u201cEviction hearings will not be heard in courts until the end of August and no one will be evicted from their home this summer due to coronavirus,\u201d the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobertJenrick/status/1268937937300922368\">tweeted</a> on Friday evening.</p> <p>Campaigners had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/04/thousands-of-uk-tenants-face-losing-home-when-eviction-ban-ends\">warned</a> that hundreds of thousands of tenants in the private and social sectors faced court action from the end of this month because they had gone into rent arrears after losing work or shielding during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-law-to-ban-uk-landlords-from-evicting-tenants\">original eviction moratorium</a>, announced in March, was due to end on 25 June, at which point landlords would have been able to continue or institute legal proceedings to remove tenants.</p> <p>The government said it was working with the judiciary to draw up new legal guidance which would ensure the courts were \u201cbetter able to address the need for appropriate protection of all parties, including those shielding from coronavirus\u201d.</p> <p>The extension \u2013 which will take the moratorium to five months in total \u2013 means eviction proceedings will in effect not be able to start up before 1 September.</p> <p>The government said it wanted court to be a last resort; it wanted landlords to \u201cexhaust all possible options\u201d, such as agreeing flexible rent payment plans with tenants, to minimise the likelihood of eviction proceedings.</p> <p>The housing charity Shelter said the extension merely delayed the eviction problem until the end of August, and that the government should act quickly to change the law to prevent a \u201ctidal wave of homelessness after the end of August\u201d.</p> <p>Polly Neate, Shelter\u2019s chief executive, said:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\u201cThe government has reset the clock on the evictions ban, buying the families who were only weeks away from losing their homes, a vital stay of execution. But it\u2019s only a stop-gap.\u202f</p> <p>\u201cThe ban hasn\u2019t stopped people who\u2019ve lost their jobs during this pandemic from racking up rent arrears. Even if they have a plan to pay them back, these debts will throw struggling renters straight back into the firing line of an automatic eviction as soon as the ban does lift.\u201d</p> <p>Amina Gichinga, of the London Renters Union, said: \u201cUnless it takes action to cancel the debt that hundreds of thousands of renters are in because of the coronavirus pandemic, today\u2019s announcement simply kicks the can down the road.</p> <p>\u201cWe are still heading for a chaotic rent debt and eviction crisis this summer unless the government cancels rent debt and makes the eviction ban permanent.\u201d</p> <p>Dame Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the pause was a welcome breathing space, but added: \u201cSimply extending the pause of repossession is a sticking plaster not a cure. People who have fallen behind on rent arrears and those who have been furloughed or lost their jobs will need the security of proper reform to the rules governing evictions.\u201d</p> <p>Dan Wilson-Craw of the campaign group Generation Rent said: \u201cThe government must use the time it has bought itself to develop a long term solution to provide rent relief and end unfair evictions for good.\u201d</p> <p>Campaigners are sceptical that many landlords will voluntarily agree to rent renegotiations with tenants in arrears. Some surveys show approximately half of tenants who asked their landlord for a rent holiday in recent weeks&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/coping-with-housing-costs-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/\">have been refused</a>.</p> <p>There are about 8 million renters in the UK, of whom 4.5 million have private landlords, with the remainder renting from social landlords such as councils and housing associations.</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 6 June 2020 to make clear that the story refers to England and Wales, not the whole of the UK.</p></li> </ul>",

The 57 officers will still by employed by BPD but will no longer serve on the emergency response team.

He labelled the argument \u201cfutile\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Justice Fagan also acknowledged the right to protest and the importance of the Black Lives Matter protest in drawing attention to the treatment of Indigenous Australians at the hands of police, but reasoned that many Australians had had to forfeit rights during the pandemic, including to attend church and forfeiting their livelihoods.</p> \n  <p>Organisers had previously indicated they and supporters would attend the protest regardless of the legal decision, and it has been noted that last week in Sydney some 3,000 people gathered to join a protest based on conspiracy theories over 5G and police took no action.</p> \n  <p>Amnesty International UK had called for the protest to be allowed, saying that \u201cPeaceful protest is a fundamental human right, and the New South Wales police should work with organisers to ensure that attendees can social distance, and protests can be carried out in a safe manner.

Reporters uncovered a spent canister of oleoresin capsicum (OC) gas \u2013 which harnesses oils from chili peppers to make the air sting and burn. In many other incidents across the country, police departments used the teargas compound CS \u2013 short for 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile. Most studies of these chemicals, according to Jordt, have looked at how they affect police and military personnel \u2013 most of whom are young men in peak physical health.

It plans to reopen its borders with France and Portugal no later than 1 July and create selective air corridors to the Canary and Balearic islands</p> <p>However, these corridors will only be opened with countries or regions that appear to have the virus under control and at present Britain is unlikely to be one of them.</p> <p>Another factor is the UK\u2019s current policy of imposing a two-week quarantine on anyone arriving from another country. In effect, people going on a one-week holiday would have to take three weeks off work.</p> <p>Antonio P\u00e9rez, the mayor, says he\u2019s optimistic but realistic. \u201cI think Benidorm will be full in August, not full like it was, because of social distancing, but full in so far as circumstances allow,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In the meantime, Benidorm\u2019s towering hotels and apartment blocks are empty. It\u2019s like a ghost town, said Baker. \u201cYou keep seeing the same people over and over, like extras in a low-budget movie, because once you strip out the tourists there are very few people here.\u201d</p> <p>The sudden disappearance of tourists has prompted many popular destinations to rethink how and to whom they market themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time for us all to think outside the box and perhaps aim our businesses at a different type of market and not depend on low-cost tourism,\u201d said Cowles.</p> <p>So is it time for a Benidorm makeover?</p> <p>\u201cThe town hall would say yes because they\u2019ve battled for decades against what they see as Benidorm\u2019s negative image,\u201d said Baker. \u201cHowever, Benidorm\u2019s bread and butter is the Brits and the Brits love, love, love Benidorm just the way it is.\u201d</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",

  "<p>My four-year-old twins went back to nursery on Monday, so lockdown ostensibly ended for them this week. Thrilling for them and, let\u2019s be honest here, thrilling for me: I take the easing of the pandemic restrictions incredibly seriously, of course, but I\u2019ll admit, there may have been some quiet crowing about my rediscovered freedom, albeit one in which I\u2019m still unable to see my friends or parents. Whole <em>hours</em> when I can work \u2013 work! \u2013 without being interrupted by someone asking why Snoopy doesn\u2019t talk, or why they aren\u2019t allowed to drink Toilet Duck. The great wide open stretching in front of me is positively giddy-making. Time to rewatch the whole of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/parks-and-recreation\" title=\"\">Parks</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/parks-and-recreation\" title=\"\">And Recreation</a>\u2026 I mean, write that novel!</p> <p>But this kind of talk does not go down well with two demographics who make up the majority of my friends: people whose kids are not back to school and those who don\u2019t have kids, and so take such crowing as an implied suggestion that lockdown has been a nonstop box set binge for them. Although really, you\u2019d think my friends would know by now that I\u2019m not talking about them: it\u2019s always all about me.</p> <p>The beginning of lockdown already feels more distant than my school days, but I distinctly remember there was a hope \u2013 an expectation, even \u2013 that we would feel some kind of collective unity during this. We\u2019re all in it together! After all, why else were we doing this, if not to protect one another? But the cracks started to appear pretty quickly. There was anger (justified) at those who fled to their second homes, and a general feeling (less justified) that everyone had to acknowledge what is now known as their \u201cprivilege\u201d any time they spoke about how they were finding lockdown. Rare was the text I received in April and May that didn\u2019t include some kind of embarrassed apology for complaining when the sender had a garden/food/functioning lungs. I\u2019m not sure when the memo went out that unless you were on your deathbed you weren\u2019t allowed to find living through a global plague an ordeal, but I haven\u2019t kept up with the daily briefings.</p> <p>I\u2019m a great fan of venting. Unless people feel free to vent, their dusty complaints turn into corrosive resentments. This, I think, lies behind a tendency I increasingly noticed in myself and others this spring, which was not to complain about one\u2019s own lockdown situation, but instead to point to others who have it so much easier. Gardens were the first battleground, with people rightly pointing out that limits on outdoor activity weren\u2019t such a hardship if you have a 20ft garden out back. Then parenthood became a flashpoint, with arguments raging online about whether being locked down with children was <a href=\"https://unherd.com/2020/05/lockdown-is-a-miserable-time-for-parents/\" title=\"\">as much of an ordeal as parents said</a>, or just a grownup temper tantrum.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominic-cummings\" title=\"\">Dominic Cummings</a> blew all this skywards when he claimed that it was totally reasonable for him and his family to go to Durham, because of his \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d, which turned out to be being a parent. Suddenly, the whole of Britain, from newspaper letters pages to people on Cummings\u2019 own street, was shouting about their own circumstances \u2013 single parenthood, loneliness, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/boris-johnsons-support-for-dominic-cummings-is-a-slap-in-the-face-for-us\" title=\"\">looking after toddler triplets while sick with the virus</a> \u2013 as the frustrations of the past months burst forth in an outraged gush.</p> <p>Cummings unleashed it, but this frustration had been building; the lockdown has been a slog for all. If Cummings had just acknowledged that in the first place when asked about his trip, instead of suggesting his struggle was \u201cexceptional\u201d, he\u2019d have saved himself a lot of bother. Yes, some people have had it easier than others, but engaging in lockdown hardship top trumps is only going to hurt you, as you lie awake at 4am, feeling your anxiety headache morph into a rage.

  "<p>Max Brooks is getting a little tired of being proved right. An author with cult appeal and massive sales, he is regularly referred to as \u201ca soothsayer\u201d and \u201ca genius\u201d. His 2006 novel, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/world-war-z-9780715653739.html\">World War Z</a></em>, was about a deadly virus originating in China that causes global devastation, and his compulsive new one, <em>Devolution: A Firsthand Account of the Sasquatch Massacre</em>, is about people forced into self-isolation, huddling in terror from an unimaginable threat outside. But Brooks, 47, is dismissive of the hyperbole: \u201cEverything I write about has already happened. The history of pandemics tends to come in extremely predictable cycles. So if I\u2019m the smartest guy in the room, we\u2019re in big trouble,\u201d he tells me over Skype from his home in Los Angeles (our interview was in May, before the national protests after the killing of George Floyd, but well after lockdown started.). He has the jittery energy of the chronically anxious, and the easy confidence of one who has been thoroughly validated.</p> <p>He certainly saw the coronavirus coming long before most politicians, and was making preparations in January. On 16 March, when most people in the western world were barely getting to grips with the lockdown, he made <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40yPXcMaOw\">a video</a> about the importance of social distancing to protect the elderly. He enlisted the help of the oldest person in his life, his father, comedy god, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/mel-brooks\">Mel Brooks</a>. \u201cIf I get the coronavirus, I\u2019ll probably be OK. But if I give it to him, he could give it to Carl Reiner, who can give it to Dick Van Dyke, and before I know it, I\u2019ve wiped out a whole generation of comedic legends,\u201d says Brooks, pointing to his father behind a glass door and listing his closest friends. The video has been watched more than 16m times. \u201cI wasn\u2019t given some secret information. I got my information from the news. Really deep state: turning on CNN and watching Wuhan getting locked down,\u201d he says dryly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I thought World War Z was a really cool movie that happened to have the same title of a book I once wrote</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nonetheless, he even scared himself when he predicted a day in his own life. Despite its title, <em>Devolution</em> has nothing to do with Scottish political independence, \u201cand I\u2019ll do a Scottish apology tour if it\u2019s a problem, from the Outer Hebrides to Hadrian\u2019s Wall,\u201d he says. It tells the story of an eco-community that is cut off from the outside world after a volcano erupts, and that is only the start of their problems. The novel is largely told through the journal of Kate, one of the community\u2019s inhabitants, and in one scene she warns her partner, Dan, against cleaning the solar panels on their roof, because she\u2019s worried he\u2019ll hurt himself. \u201cInjury turns you from a giver to a taker,\u201d another inhabitant adds.</p> <p>Cut to spring 2020 and Brooks is in lockdown at home with his wife, Michelle Kholos (\u201cthe greatest playwright in the world!\u201d) and their teenage son, Henry. He heads up to clean out the gutters on the roof. \u201cAnd my wife said: \u2018Oh no you don\u2019t! If you fall, you can\u2019t cook, you can\u2019t clean, you just consume resources,\u2019\u201d he recalls. Does it freak him out to live in his own books? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t freak me out, it saddens me. Because I would much rather be wrong,\u201d he says</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"692456b7031b29eae1c48141a6a3275ae8315866\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/692456b7031b29eae1c48141a6a3275ae8315866/0_102_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brad Pitt, left, and Daniella Kertesz in the 2013 film adaptation of World War Z.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brad Pitt, left, and Daniella Kertesz in the 2013 film adaptation of World War Z.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jaap Buitendijk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>World War Z,</em> which uses zombies as a metaphor for the Sars virus, with the infected turning into killer creatures, takes a geopolitical perspective of a pandemic, with each country responding to the crisis in characteristic style: Israel makes brutally pragmatic choices to save itself; the US is overconfident about its exceptionalism. The parallels with today are breathtaking.</p> <p>\u201cBut on a personal level, the day-to-day life of what we\u2019re all going through now, that\u2019s played out in <em>Devolution</em>. And that I did not expect,\u201d says Brooks. And that\u2019s no surprise, given <em>Devolution</em> is a thriller about Big Foot. Yet the novel provides very practical solutions for how to deal with isolation and fear \u2013 growing your own vegetable garden, seeking out small groups of trusted friends \u2013 and it is to Brooks\u2019s credit that his galumphing beasts are genuinely scary, as opposed to laughable. When I make the mistake of mentioning the saccharine 1980s Big Foot family comedy, <em>Harry and the Hendersons</em>, Brooks \u2013 who takes his responsibilities to fans of horror (\u201cmy tribe\u201d) as seriously as any other part of his research \u2013 recoils in disgust: \u201cNoooo!\u201d</p> <p>Brooks has always been a worrier. When I ask if he was an anxious kid, he reels back as if I\u2019d asked if the Pacific Ocean is wet: \u201cOh GAHHHHD. Yes!\u201d he gasps. He researches disasters because it\u2019s when he doesn\u2019t understand something, or what to do about it, that he spins out. \u201cKnowledge calms me down. I can deal with fear, it\u2019s the anxiety I have trouble with,\u201d he says. It\u2019s a testament to the thoroughness of his research that after the publication of <em>World War Z </em>he was invited to join the Modern War Institute at West Point as a <a href=\"https://mwi.usma.edu/max-brooks/\">non-resident fellow</a>. There, he writes articles about \u201cnon-military issues that could turn violent in the future,\u201d he says, such as a recent piece about <a href=\"https://mwi.usma.edu/food-insecurity-the-real-danger-of-monsantos-sale-to-bayer/\">how corporations now control the food chain</a>, and he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgq04T9YOCc\">lectures cadets</a> about how to think creatively.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/maxbrooksauthor/status/1239624352305303552\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A message from me and my dad, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MelBrooks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Melbrooks</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coronavirus</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DontBeASpreader?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DontBeASpreader</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Hqhc4fFXbe\">pic.twitter.com/Hqhc4fFXbe</a></p>&mdash; Max Brooks (@maxbrooksauthor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maxbrooksauthor/status/1239624352305303552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 16, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>But how to educate the public? He knows some people don\u2019t listen to lectures, or even the news. So instead he channels his knowledge into popular fiction. \u201cI write about fictional threats, because they\u2019re easier for people to deal with, but I provide factual solutions,\u201d he says. <em>World War Z</em>, which has sold over 1m copies, has been named among the <a href=\"https://www.duckworthbooks.co.uk/horribly-good-books/\">best horror books of all time</a>, alongside Stephen King\u2019s <em>It</em> and Bram Stoker\u2019s <em>Dracula</em>. But Brooks\u2019s writing hero is thriller writer Tom Clancy, famously another fan of research. \u201cThe best way to educate is to entertain. In the second world war, the US government got Hollywood on board to break down the complicated strategic ideas into very simple stories, and America used to be the best at that. But somewhere along the line we gave up,\u201d he says.</p> <p>While stressing that he\u2019s \u201cquite proud to be the child of these two awesome parents\u201d \u2013 his mother was the late, great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/jun/08/obituaries.news\">Anne Bancroft</a> \u2013 Brooks has generally kept his parents at arm\u2019s length from his career. Unlike plenty of other Hollywood progeny, he has not wanted to be known as anyone\u2019s junior, because he found out early on that it would only hurt him: his first book, <em>The Zombie Survival Guide</em> (2003), was originally marketed as \u201cMel Brooks Jr writes <em>Young Frankenstein</em> part two!\u201d The book flopped, \u201cand no surprise, because the media looked at it and said: \u2018This is the least funny book ever\u2019, and the horror people thought Mel Brooks\u2019s brat was taking a giant dump on something they loved,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everyone wanted Anne Bancroft to be sexy Mrs Robinson. Nobody cared that her favourite book was about microbes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Brooks is not anyone\u2019s image of a Hollywood brat. Yes, his parents had famous friends: Reiner, Van Dyke, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gene-wilder\">Gene Wilder</a>. But when they would all meet up on Sundays, they tended to talk about whether anyone had found a good dentist in Los Angeles, and who knew of a decent car mechanic. \u201cThey were all immigrants to this town \u2013 they were trying to figure out how to live,\u201d Brooks says. The family was comfortable, but his father drove him to school in a Honda Accord 1982 (\u201cbest car ever\u201d) because, he told his son: \u201cIt\u2019s OK to make your fortune. But don\u2019t drive your fortune past people who are starving.\u201d His dad may have written the line, \u201cIf you got it, flaunt it\u201d, for <em>The Producers</em>, but that was very much not how he lived. \u201cBoth my parents came from poverty and most people who are first-generation wealth always worry they\u2019re going to lose their money, because they\u2019re not really sure where it came from,\u201d says Brooks. His father lives close by in Santa Monica and, until the virus started, he would come to Brooks\u2019s house every evening before heading off for his nightly dinner with his best friend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/feb/20/love-and-free-food-mel-brooks-and-carl-reiner-share-the-secrets-of-their-70-year-friendship\">Carl Reiner</a>. These days, Brooks and his son go to his father\u2019s house and wave at him through the glass door, just as he did in the video.</p> <p>Brooks has his mother\u2019s dark Italian colouring and his father\u2019s features as well as his wit. (When I ask if he liked the 2013 movie adaptation of <em>World War Z</em>, starring Brad Pitt, he replies: \u201cI thought it was a really cool movie that happened to have the same title of a book I once wrote.\u201d) He credits his love of science and research to his mother: \u201cIn show business they only ever want one flavour and everyone just wanted her to be sexy Mrs Robinson. Nobody cared that her favourite book was about microbes \u2013 but I did. Everything I am comes from her,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Bancroft was 40 when she was pregnant with Brooks and had long since given up hope of conceiving. She was asked if she wanted a test for Down\u2019s syndrome, but was warned if she had a termination she would never be able to get pregnant again. Bancroft refused, saying she would love this baby whatever. \u201cSo I was very ... appreciated,\u201d says Brooks.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>America has the most incompetent, disastrous, captain ever, but the ship has had mechanical problems for some time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a child, he struggled with reading, and although the school dismissed him as another lazy Hollywood kid, his mother suspected he was dyslexic. She was right. There was little help available to dyslexic kids in the early 80s, but in 1959 Bancroft had won an Oscar for her performance in <em>The Miracle Worker </em>as Annie Sullivan, who taught Helen Keller, who was deaf and blind, how to read. So she knew about services available to blind children and she adapted them for her son, such as turning his schoolbooks into audiobooks, so he could read along to the tapes. \u201cPeople assume because of who my parents are that I had this very privileged childhood. And they\u2019re damn right, because I had this incredible mother who understood her son,\u201d he says. His father, he says, \u201cwas busy feeding us. My parents were great partners.\u201d Bancroft died from uterine cancer in 2005, two months after Brooks\u2019s son was born, \u201cso she got to be a grandmother for a bit. Thank God,\u201d he says.</p> <p>After college, Brooks worked briefly at <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, but soon realised he is really more of a solo worker than a collaborator. At 31, he published <em>The Zombie Survival Guide</em>, turning a lifetime of anxiety about existential threats into something potentially productive. For every one hour of writing, he says, he spends up to 100 hours researching, \u201cand that totally comes from my mom\u201d. People often ask if writing about zombies and Big Foot and apocalypses scares him, because they don\u2019t understand that the writing calms him down. But now he has a different problem: he knows too much.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t pacify myself with the ignorant notion that we were caught unaware [by the virus]. I can\u2019t go to bed at night thinking, we didn\u2019t have a plan so all the mistakes are forgivable. Here it is!\u201d he says, brandishing a thick wodge of papers, which is the National Response Framework, the United States\u2019s plan for how to respond to emergencies. \u201cSo there is absolutely a plan.\u201d According to Brooks, if America had fully locked down the country for three weeks, instead of doing it piecemeal state by state, and maintained a strict lockdown, the virus would have gone.</p> <p>I ask if the problem was the incumbent president. \u201cI don\u2019t want to blame everything on Trump. America has the most incompetent, disastrous, dangerous captain that we\u2019ve ever had. But the ship has had mechanical problems for some time,\u201d he says. He launches into an engrossing monologue about how trust in the government has collapsed, after it was attacked first by the left in the 1960s, then by the right in the 80s, eroding public trust to a disastrous effect. \u201cWe have planted a very bitter crop, and now it\u2019s harvest time,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But none of this explains why the UK\u2019s response has been so terrible, I say. He throws his hands in the air, exasperated. \u201cI expected all this from us. But I did not expect it from you. I\u2019m shocked, because you already had a national health service, you\u2019re much more unified than us, you still understand the need for government. So what\u2019s your excuse?\u201d he asks. There are some questions even Max Brooks can\u2019t answer.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Max Brooks is on Twitter @maxbrooksauthor</em></p>",
  "<h2>14 February: extreme shivers, extreme sweats</h2> <p>I\u2019m lying in bed, shivering like crazy. My partner, Diane, is asleep, and I burrow deep into her back. I\u2019m sweating like crazy, too. I\u2019m desperate for the loo, and I run there in my shivery sweats and sweaty shivers. It\u2019s only five minutes since I last went. When I sleep, the same obsessive moment plays again and again. It\u2019s to do with numbers. I need to get past number nine, but I can\u2019t. The dream lasts for hours. Finally, I force myself awake. Ten minutes have passed.</p> <p>I felt like this once before, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/22/world-encephalitis-day-horrific-pain-brain-care\" title=\"\">when I had encephalitis</a> as a kid. That lasted more than two years, but it\u2019s one particular night I\u2019m thinking of \u2013 the sweats and shivers, and the fear that I\u2019m not going to make it through till morning. After that, I used to check my pulse every time I woke up to see if I was alive.</p> <p>Last night Diane took me to the emergency GP. The GP was lovely, caring, cautious. But too cautious. Diane told her I\u2019d gone a bit loopy. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cOnly in my sleep. I\u2019m perfectly sane and lucid in the day.\u201d The doctor asked me what day it was, how many fingers she was holding up. Thursday, four fingers. She said to Diane that I may have sepsis. Perhaps I ought to go to hospital, even if only as a precaution. Sepsis can kill, she said. Sepsis my arse, I said to Diane on the way home. I\u2019ve got a urine infection and I just want to go back to bed.</p> <p>I\u2019m still shivering and sweating when Diane wakes up. She says we\u2019re going to the hospital. No, I say, I just want to sweat it out. I want to wrap the duvet around me and turn into a Simon burrito.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to A&amp;E,\u201d Diane says.</p> <p>I tell her I don\u2019t want to go.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so unyielding!\u201d I shout. Diane and I rarely argue. She looks upset. I don\u2019t know where the word unyielding comes from; I\u2019ve certainly never said it to Diane before.</p> <p>A&amp;E is packed. Valentine\u2019s Day, but nothing romantic about it. I am expecting to wait for hours, but as soon as I see the triage nurse, they put me on a bed in a cubicle. Within minutes, they\u2019ve inserted a canula. They test my blood pressure, my oxygen level, temperature. None of it is quite normal, but my temperature is the biggest concern \u2013 over 39C. Ever since the misdiagnosis of my encephalitis (my doctor, who just happened to be my dad\u2019s best friend, told me I was a malingerer, and suggested that Mum had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/aug/19/features11.g21\" title=\"\">Munchausen</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/aug/19/features11.g21\" title=\"\"> syndrome by proxy</a>), I have been terrified of being called a hypochondriac and done my best to stay away from hospital.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Three days of IV antibiotics get rid of my urinary infection and my temperature. The only thing is, I\u2019ve started to cough</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re treating it as sepsis,\u201d the doctor says, more to Diane than me. \u201cIf it\u2019s not sepsis, he\u2019s on the road to sepsis. We\u2019re going to put him on IV antibiotics. It\u2019s the Domestos treatment \u2013 kills all bugs.\u201d I smile. It sounds good. And, best of all, I\u2019m being believed.</p> <p>This small ward (six beds) is where people come when they\u2019re admitted straight from A&amp;E. It isn\u2019t full. Ilias is in agony with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/sickle-cell-disease\" title=\"\">sickle cell anaemia</a>; he\u2019s on morphine to ease the pain, but it makes him horribly itchy. The man next to me is out for the count: heavy, middle-aged, he just collapsed the other day and was rushed in. Barry, the fella closest to the window, is having tests. He\u2019s had an unlucky couple of years during which he\u2019s been in and out of hospital \u2013 a terrible car crash, broken back, urinary infections, and now goodness knows what. There is a spoilt young lad who plays his films and music at top volume. </p> <p>The IV paracetamol brings my temperature right down. Then it whizzes back, to almost 40C. I sit on the edge of my bed hugging my coat. The number game starts again; I still can\u2019t get past nine. They put me back on the IV paracetamol. Again, it does the trick.</p> <p>It\u2019s early evening and Diane and my younger daughter, Maya, have to leave. This is my first night in hospital since I was 11, and I\u2019m weepy. I\u2019ve got my laptop and headphones, and I\u2019m playing the same song on a loop: the medley from the Beatles\u2019 Abbey Road \u2013 Golden Slumbers, Carry That Weight and The End. I feel as if I\u2019m grieving, but I don\u2019t know what for.</p> <p>Saturday, I\u2019m feeling stronger. There\u2019s a camaraderie on the ward. The nurses are beyond wonderful \u2013 endlessly patient with difficult patients, physically strong, kind. Likewise the ancillary staff who keep the place virtually spotless. Sure, there\u2019s a cockroach in the loo, but it\u2019s more pet than threat.</p> <p>I am given three lots of IV antibiotics a day for three days. The nurses wake me gently in the night to test my blood pressure and oxygen levels. I am sent for a chest X-ray. Within a couple of days, I\u2019m feeling human. My appetite is back. Even the food is good: lamb dhansak and chickpeas, jerk chicken with rice and peas, fish and chips with mushy peas.</p> <p>Everybody is talking about the terrible virus that appears to be decimating China. Three weeks ago, a whole city, Wuhan, was placed under quarantine. Unbelievable. Two weeks ago, the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency and named the disease Covid-19, short for \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d. Almost 1,400 people have died in China, and today France has announced the first Covid-19 death in Europe. Thankfully, there\u2019s nothing here yet, though we are being advised to wash our hands regularly for 20 seconds while singing God Save The Queen.</p> <p>Miraculously, three days of IV antibiotics and paracetamol get rid of my urinary tract infection and my temperature. The only thing is, I\u2019ve started to cough, badly. I\u2019ve been susceptible to chest infections since my encephalitis. Back then, I was rushed to hospital with a pneumonia that almost did for me, and ended up staying there for six weeks.</p> <p>My chest feels dreadful by Monday morning. The doctors so far have been lovely \u2013 all women, all good listeners. The doctor who discharges me is a young man, and not a good listener. He says he thinks I\u2019ll be fine to go home today, if that\u2019s OK. It feels like a rhetorical question. I don\u2019t want to say it isn\u2019t fine (who wants to stay in hospital, however good the food?) and I don\u2019t want to sound aggressive. So I tell him I think I have a chest infection, and would perhaps benefit from another chest X-ray. He doesn\u2019t seem to hear. A few minutes later I search him out and say I\u2019m worried, because I have a history of chest infections and pneumonia. He tells me the antibiotics will take care of that.</p> <p>I feel sad to say goodbye to Ilias and Barry, and sad because one infection seems to have been replaced by another. Sure, I\u2019m no longer crazy feverish, but nor would I say I was fixed. Still, they obviously need the beds.</p> <h2>20 February: \u2018That doesn\u2019t sound good\u2019</h2> <p>Yesterday the global death toll from Covid-19 passed 2,000. Meanwhile, my chest is getting rawer and sorer.

It was clear and we don\u2019t want to irradiate you.\u201d But there was no reason it shouldn\u2019t have been clear; it didn\u2019t feel infected at that point.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to put you on a nebuliser for 20 minutes,\u201d he says. Afterwards, he takes off my mask. \u201cAny better?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I say. \u201cBut it does feel like I\u2019ve been on a mini break to the seaside.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cOK, we\u2019ll give you another 20 minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Asthma asks if I use an inhaler. I tell him I sometimes use a blue Ventolin, but it doesn\u2019t seem to have any effect.</p> <p>\u201cDo you inhale straight from the Ventolin or have you got an AeroChamber?\u201d</p> <p>I look blank.</p> <p>\u201cAh well, that\u2019s it. They\u2019re useless without the chambers. I\u2019m going to give you one to take home.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m beginning to think he may be a salesman rather than a doctor. Then he gives me a packet of steroids, which puts my mind at rest.</p> <p>Eight tiny pills, a few times a day. They make no difference, except for making me feel sick when they stick in my throat. My breathing is getting worse.</p> <h2>Early March: do we cancel our big party?</h2> <p>Diane and I have been together for over 30 years, and in January we got \u201ccivilled\u201d; civil partnerships for mixed-sex relationships had just been introduced. We were only the fourth heterosexual couple to get one in the London borough of Haringey, and were a little bit proud of it. It was a great day \u2013 surprisingly romantic, fun, history-making (if you count fourth). Only immediate family were there, but we are planning a big party in two weeks \u2013 by far the biggest we\u2019ve ever hosted. We\u2019ve invited more than 200 people, and even if I\u2019m not on top form, it\u2019s only one evening. It will be great anyway.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the WHO has just raised the global risk of spread of Covid-19 from \u201chigh\u201d to \u201cvery high\u201d. \u201cThis is a reality check for every government on the planet. Wake up. Get ready,\u201d says Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO\u2019s health emergencies programme.</p> <p>Everybody has started talking about how vulnerable old people are, and the need for social distancing. I am slightly worried about my symptoms. We don\u2019t want to kill off our guests, after all. I phone the GP, hang on for the obligatory 20 minutes before reception passes me to a doctor. \u201cCan I check whether I was tested for coronavirus in hospital?\u201d I ask. They did so many tests, but I haven\u2019t a clue what for. \u201cNo,\u201d she says, and puts down the phone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I promise you, you do not have coronavirus, you\u2019re just getting better from what may have been a little chest infection</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The public are being advised to phone NHS 111 if they are worried they might have coronavirus. After half an hour I get through. If you have symptoms, you go through the process again. Eventually I get through to a helpful nurse. \u201cYes, those sound like Covid-19 symptoms,\u201d she says. \u201cWould you prefer to see your GP or the emergency GP at the hospital?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEmergency GP at the hospital,\u201d I say, too enthusiastically.</p> <p>The hospital GP is charm personified. I tell her I\u2019m worried I may have Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cHave you been abroad recently, to China or Italy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you been in contact with anybody who has had coronavirus?\u201d How on earth do I know, I think.</p> <p>She gets out her stethoscope: \u201cA little bit of wheeziness, maybe.\u201d</p> <p>She asks me to blow into a peak flow meter. I take a mighty breath and reach 450.</p> <p>\u201cWonderful! 500!\u201d she says. \u201cAbsolutely nothing to worry about.\u201d</p> <p>I ask if I can try again because I normally do better on a second go. It\u2019s 350. And the third time. She ignores those readings. \u201c500. Wonderful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s safe to have our party? I\u2019ve heard about this social distancing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely safe. I promise you, you do not have coronavirus, you\u2019re just getting better from what may have been a little chest infection.\u201d</p> <p>I go home relieved. When Diane returns, I tell her I definitely don\u2019t have Covid-19: it\u2019s game on for the party. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you thought you did have it,\u201d she says.</p> <p> On 3 March, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, boasts on telly about shaking hands with the Covid-19 patients he\u2019s just met. In fact, the PM seems to be getting more insouciant by the day. On 5 March he suggests that, rather than locking down the country, \u201cone of the theories is that perhaps you could take it on the chin, take it all in one go and allow the disease, as it were, to move through the population, without taking as many draconian measures\u201d. Apparently, this is known as herd immunity.</p> <h2>10 March: the empty clinic</h2> <p>Nothing is shifting. I am breathless climbing the stairs. The asthma pump makes no difference. I ring the surgery and tell the doctor that I wasn\u2019t given an X-ray at hospital. \u201cOh, poor love,\u201d says Dr Niceynice. \u201cBless you. That\u2019s shocking. I\u2019m booking you in for one right this minute.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Niceynice is magnificent at phone empathy, less good at face-to-face appointments. She sends me to the smaller local hospital up the road. It\u2019s gloriously empty. A man in a mask ushers me to a waiting area, but before I have time to sit down I\u2019m whisked off for the X-ray. In and out.</p> <p>An hour after getting home, I get a call from Dr Niceynice. \u201cYour X-ray\u2019s clear,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, but\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Too late. Dr Niceynice has put the phone down.</p> <h2>12 March: a pandemic</h2> <p>My wheezing sounds like feedback \u2013 a song <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/my-bloody-valentine\" title=\"\">My Bloody Valentine</a> may have written in their heyday. Diane says she\u2019s worried. Yesterday the WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic. Everybody seems to be talking about why Britain hasn\u2019t gone into lockdown; why is everything going on as normal?</p> <p>At night I can\u2019t sleep.</p> <p>\u201cWhat d\u2019you think it is?\u201d Diane says.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe a bit of pneumonia, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019m getting better.\u201d</p> <p> We tell our guests we\u2019re going ahead with the party. Great, ping back the emails, we need something to celebrate.</p> <p>My sister, Sharon, and I argue for the first time ever. She doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s safe for Mum to come to the party and wants me to tell her not to. I say I\u2019m happy for her not to come, but I\u2019m not going to <em>tell</em> her not to. Mum, an incredibly youthful if shrunken 92-year-old, could stay alive by locking herself away and having a miserable existence, or she could take a few risks and thoroughly enjoy her final years, I say; it\u2019s the difference between living and existing. Ugh. I can\u2019t believe I said that. Smug git.</p> <p>I phone Mum, tell her not to come, and burst out crying to Sharon.</p> <p>Then Ireland announces its lockdown. We decide it\u2019s time to cancel our party, whatever the UK government is or isn\u2019t doing. \u201cWe\u2019re so relieved,\u201d our friends say. \u201cWe would have come, but it would have been so strange not being able to kiss and hug, and dancing at a distance.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I am so relieved we cancelled our party; who wants a party hosted by a horseman of the apocalypse?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By the next day, 10 people in Britain have died and there are nearly 2,000 confirmed cases. Diane is determined to get me seen at A&amp;E before a lockdown. When we get there, it is scarily empty. A couple of minutes later, a doctor calls me into the cubicle.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are your symptoms?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPersistent cough and breathing difficulties.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s young and kindly looking, but sounds angry. \u201cWhy did you come here today?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was told to come back if there was no progress. It\u2019s got worse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut why today?\u201d</p> <p>Stay calm, I tell myself. I\u2019ve been on antibiotics for three weeks and I\u2019m still no better. If it\u2019s a virus, I want to know if it is <em>the</em> virus.</p> <p>He gets out his stethoscope and listens closely. I wheeze in and wheeze out.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound wheezy to me,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Jesus, they\u2019ve moved the goalposts on sickness. Last week the GP suggested it was pneumonia; today I\u2019m worse and the doctor\u2019s telling me I\u2019m fine.</p> <p>\u201cSo why today?\u201d he asks again.</p> <p>\u201cOh bollocks to this,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ve not come here to be made to feel like a hypochondriac. I hate hospitals \u2013 this is the last place I want to be. Let\u2019s go.\u201d I get off the bed.</p> <p>My outburst shocks him into politeness, and upsets me. \u201cLook,\u201d I say, \u201cI know it\u2019s not your fault, you\u2019re just doing what you\u2019ve been told to. I\u2019m sorry. If we were allowed to hug, I\u2019d give you a great big hug.\u201d He looks terrified.</p> <p>But he\u2019s started to soften. \u201cI can hear something,\u201d he concedes. \u201cDo you smoke?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI used to, about 14 years ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve got COPD [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/breakthrough-science/2017/oct/23/the-life-changing-lung-disease-that-often-goes-undiagnosed\" title=\"\">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a>]. I\u2019ll write a report for your GP.\u201d</p> <p>But until a few weeks ago my lungs were fine, I say. I ran six miles, three or four times a week. </p> <p>\u201cYes, COPD,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Back home I discover Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, has just announced that 60% of the country \u2013 40-odd million people \u2013 need to catch the virus for us to build up herd immunity. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to beat coronavirus, Vallance suggests, adding that we don\u2019t want to \u201cswamp and overwhelm NHS services\u201d. Perhaps that\u2019s why Dr Angry had been so upset: I was swamping the empty hospital.</p> <p>Apparently, the NHS has also stopped testing for Covid-19, apart from the most serious cases in hospital. Anybody with a fever or \u201ccontinuous cough\u201d should simply stay at home.</p> <p>Two days after Vallance\u2019s announcement, the health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/matt-hancock\" title=\"\">Matt</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/matt-hancock\" title=\"\"> Hancock</a>, tells us we all misunderstood; herd immunity was never part of the plan. This may have something to do with the outcry that followed \u2013 when everyone did the sums and realised the government was talking about the deaths of 500,000 British people.</p> <h2>14 March: the ambulance</h2> <p>My breathing is deteriorating. In bed at night, I sound like a cattle farm. Diane and my daughters tell me off for using the phone. I can barely get a sentence out without spluttering. I\u2019m dizzy and my head hurts. I\u2019ve also developed a dull, persistent ache in my leg \u2013 the kind you often get with a virus.</p> <p> On Saturday, the day before our non-party, my breathing takes a turn for the worse. I am so relieved we cancelled; who wants a party hosted by a horseman of the apocalypse? Diane says she\u2019ll phone for the ambulance. I tell her not to be daft. A few minutes later, she says gently, \u201cShould I call the ambulance now?\u201d Yes, I nod.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aa5f5fba1da537912e8a1ed3937bc6a6955c1f65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa5f5fba1da537912e8a1ed3937bc6a6955c1f65/0_663_5412_5255/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A thermometer glowing as if it is hot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"971\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The ambulance is here in five minutes. They arrive in space-age blue suits, heavy boots, masks and goggles. They\u2019re certainly not lacking in PPE. Just the sight of them seems to improve my breathing. There are three of them \u2013 warm, likable, funny. They test my oxygen levels and take my blood pressure.</p> <p>\u201cNothing much wrong with your breathing,\u201d says one of them. \u201cMy breathing is worse than yours.\u201d</p> <p>I can see neighbours across the road staring at the ambulance. The three paramedics say they are going to sit in it to write their report. They return and tell me I\u2019ve got Covid-19. I\u2019ll be fine.</p> <p>How d\u2019you know, I wheeze. I mean, on either front.</p> <p>\u201cWell, it seems like Covid-19. Covid-19 symptoms. Try not to call us again. I know it\u2019s tempting when you\u2019re struggling with breathing.\u201d The female paramedic shows me some deep breathing exercises, though I can barely shallow breathe. \u201cAs I say, try not to call again because we\u2019re very busy,\u201d she says to Diane. \u201cBut if his lips turn blue, ring 999.\u201d</p> <h2>15 March: no party, more tests</h2> <p>Giving away \u00a35,000 worth of food isn\u2019t as simple as you\u2019d think \u2013 not now, anyway. Eventually we find two takers: a drop-in for migrants and a homeless shelter. On Monday morning, our older daughter, Alix, delivers the food. She returns elated. Everybody was so happy to get it, she says, and suddenly it doesn\u2019t feel that the money was wasted. The party just took a different form. She brings back a few samples \u2013 mushroom flan, teriyaki salmon, cheesecake, lots of lovely salads.</p> <p>On 17 March the prime minister urges the British public to \u201cavoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues\u201d. Stanley Johnson, his 79-year-old father, is having none of it. \u201cCourse I\u2019ll go to the pub if I need to,\u201d <a href=\"https://youtu.be/KkFJcMnUNyg\" title=\"\">he tells Phil and Holly on This Morning</a>. The Johnson family are good value, they\u2019d make an entertaining reality TV show; I just wish they weren\u2019t in politics.</p> <p>By now, it\u2019s more or less impossible to see a doctor. The GP surgery is closed down; A&amp;E visits are a no-no. We are told to ring NHS 111 if we\u2019re worried, but we can\u2019t get through. Soon enough the government tells us we\u2019re better off going to <a href=\"https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19/\" title=\"\">its Covid-19 website</a>, which tells us to self-isolate. It\u2019s a vicious circle of self-isolating helplessness.</p> <p>I tweet Boris Johnson. \u201cDear <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson\" title=\"\">@BorisJohnson</a>, I am sat at home struggling to breathe, as too many people are. You\u2019ve finally got the job you want, and within weeks you have created an NHS that tests for NOTHING &amp; leaves us all gasping for air, helpless in the greatest crisis of our lives. Act now. TEST US.\u201d No response.</p> <p>I decide to go private, for the first time in my life, only it\u2019s near impossible to get an appointment with a respiratory specialist; they\u2019re too busy saving lives for the NHS. Eventually, one agrees to a phone consultation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I tell the doctor we are Guardian journalists. He becomes animated, and tells us there is a desperate shortage of PPE</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dr Lung asks about my history, my symptoms, when the chest complaint developed. He tells me I need a lung scan, but there is a problem \u2013 the private hospital isn\u2019t allowing respiratory patients in. Don\u2019t worry, he says, we can see you on the NHS \u2013 get the tests done, the scan, the works. I\u2019m relieved, but it also makes me feel even worse. So this is how private medicine works in a pandemic: I\u2019m using a private referral to queue-jump, and not even paying for it. Morally queasy doesn\u2019t begin to cover it, but I am desperate. \u201cGo to the hospital and my colleague will see you,\u201d he says.</p> <p>There\u2019s something postapocalyptic about the hospital. Deadly silent. Security on the front door. They block our way in: why are we here? \u201cI\u2019ve got a persistent cough. Breathing problems. I\u2019ve been sent here by Dr Lung.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cOK, follow me.\u201d The man leads us to a side entrance usually reserved for ambulance arrivals. There is one other person here \u2013 a chatty woman with asthma who takes off her mask to eat her KFC when the staff aren\u2019t looking. There is a different kind of intensity to the hospital today; the bonhomie of my last visit has gone. Then, it felt the hospital was just preparing; now, it\u2019s the real thing.</p> <p>A red-haired doctor examines me. Halfway through, he apologises and says he has to rush to a meeting. Then he returns, listens to my chest, asks what I do. I tell him Diane and I are Guardian journalists. He becomes animated, and tells us there is a desperate shortage of PPE. Meanwhile, he says, they are short-staffed because so many people have had to take time off with symptoms, because they can\u2019t be tested. </p> <p>The only people who <em>do</em> seem to be getting tested are celebrities, footballers and politicians. Tell me about it, he says. I say that I want a test because, if it\u2019s not coronavirus, then I can start looking for other conditions \u2013 hopefully treatable ones. He says he\u2019s happy to admit me, but if he were me he\u2019d steer well clear. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have Covid-19 now, you probably will by the time you leave.\u201d I decide to go home without the test. They do the regular tests instead \u2013 blood oxygen, blood pressure, then one swab up a nostril and another in my mouth \u2013 and book me in for a lung scan in a few days. The doctor tells me he thinks I\u2019ve made the right decision and pats me on the arm affectionately. </p> <p>\u201cOi,\u201d I say: I thought we weren\u2019t supposed to be touching. He smiles. I hope he\u2019s going to be OK.</p> <h2>20 March: a new perspective</h2> <p>It\u2019s so quiet and peaceful in the night, give or take my wheezing. Everything starts to make sense. Of course it\u2019s terrible that all these people are dying, but the world is renewing itself. This always happens at some point, when things get out of control. Today the sky was a cloudless blue, there were hardly any cars on the road, the air felt pure and you could hear the birds making whoopee. The dawn chorus makes the silence even more profound. If this is the planet renewing itself, then we\u2019ve all got to do our bit.</p> <p>The world is beginning to feel unrecognisable. On 20 March the chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rishi-sunak\" title=\"\">Rishi Sunak</a>, announces that a rightwing Brexiteering government will pay 80% of a salary up to \u00a32,500 a month for those not working during the coronavirus crisis, if their companies agree to keep them on. Bankers are an irrelevance now. The key workers are the same doctors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-hunt\" title=\"\">Jeremy Hunt</a> was so critical of when he was health secretary; the same nurses for whom the Tories gleefully blocked a pay rise; the same supermarket workers whom the government contemptuously dismissed as unskilled.</p> <p>Every issue is illustrated in curves these days. There\u2019s the curve for those who don\u2019t know they have it; the curve for those who have a mild illness; and the curve for those who die. But what about the inbetweeny curve \u2013 for those who have been chronically ill for ages but are going to get better without ventilators and admission to the Covid-19 wards? The curve for those who happen to get a terrible chest condition while a pandemic is raging, but feel they don\u2019t have the right to complain because others are suffering far worse? The curve for those who go on to live long, fulfilled lives. I want to be on one of those.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"450d727d2a53a619f089e36decabaf129574ff4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/450d727d2a53a619f089e36decabaf129574ff4a/0_2191_5412_3247/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A packet of tablets with three out\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Later, I head back to the hospital for my lung scan. The roads are clear and I walk into the empty hospital. There\u2019s one older man in a mask waiting for a scan. A computerised voice tells me to hold my breath while the scanner closes in.</p> <p>A couple of days later, I meet my urologist on the phone. I started seeing him for a urinary tract infection a few months ago, but I\u2019ve always had my doubts about him; I suspect he\u2019s keen to whip my prostate out before I\u2019m ready.</p> <p>\u201cHow have you been?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, actually, I had another infection that turned into sepsis and I was hospitalised.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. Really?\u201d says Dr Piss. \u201cWell, perhaps it\u2019s time for the operation.\u201d He finds my notes and is quickly up to speed. He even has my chest X-ray. \u201cI see you\u2019ve got an area of pneumonia on the X-ray.\u201d</p> <p>No, I say, it was clear.</p> <p>No, he says, there\u2019s an area: not full-blown, but pneumonia.</p> <p>When was it taken, I ask.</p> <p>\u201cMid-February, in hospital,\u201d he says. This was a couple of days before my chest got bad. It must have already been on its way.</p> <h2>24 March: lockdown</h2> <p>The government finally orders all non-essential workers to stay at home in their \u201cprimary residence\u201d. I love the presumption that we have more than one. </p> <p>My right leg ache has extended into the left now. If I\u2019m lying in bed, it\u2019s agony, so I get up every few minutes \u2013 walk around, make myself some hot water as a treat. Jesus, what\u2019s become of me? All my life, I\u2019ve drunk coffee by the gallon, finishing off the day with a 1am cuppa. But less coffee means less urinary infections means less sepsis means less weird chest infections that may or may not be Covid-19 means more life.</p> <h2>27 March: Boris Johnson takes it on the chin</h2> <p>Two days after the start of lockdown, I stand by the front door in my purple dressing gown, giving NHS workers a good whoop. It\u2019s not good for my chest, but it\u2019s worth it. I start to well up, though anything makes me cry these days.</p> <p>A day later, it is announced that the prime minister has Covid-19. So he really is taking it on the chin, as he suggested we all do. NHS workers are becoming more vocal about the lack of testing. I tweet Johnson again, saying we need tests for all, and hoping he gets better. No reply, but I do get a surprise phone call.</p> <p>\u201cMr Hattenstone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou tested negative.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHold on,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ve not been tested.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you were. Last week in hospital, and it\u2019s negative.\u201d I ask questions, but the woman on the other end apologises, says she\u2019s in a call centre and has no more information.</p> <p>My friends are getting ill. Everybody\u2019s friends are getting ill. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s the dreaded\u2026 ?\u201d we ask each other. Most of us think it is, but we can\u2019t say for definite. Only I have been tested \u2013 apparently. But should I believe that, when I was categorically told I hadn\u2019t been?

Everybody\u2019s sending me lists of great box sets and movies to watch, but I can\u2019t focus. Weirdly, the one thing I can concentrate on is Hilary Mantel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/24/the-mirror-and-the-light-hilary-mantel-review\" title=\"\">The Mirror</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/24/the-mirror-and-the-light-hilary-mantel-review\" title=\"\">&amp; The Light</a>, longer than anything I\u2019ve ever read. It may be set 500 years ago, but so much resonates as Thomas Cromwell battles his own version of coronavirus: sweating sickness.</p> <p>I prop myself up in bed, pull my legs up, and try to sleep with my eyes open; I find it hard to shut my eyes while sitting up. In the silence I hear a mosquito buzzing. It\u2019s my chest. I hear sheep baa-ing. It\u2019s my chest. I hear a motorcycle revving up, loud and antisocial. It\u2019s my chest. Sod this for a game of soldiers.</p> <p>Dr Lung phones to say my scan is back. He says there doesn\u2019t seem much to worry about. There is inflammation on my lungs, and secretions, but no sign of active infection. He wants me to have another lung test in three months to make sure they\u2019ve not solidified into something nastier. I phone my cousin \u2013 a retired GP who looked after me brilliantly 47 years ago when I had encephalitis. \u201cInflammation \u2013 yep, that\u2019s good. A bit of pneumonia will leave you with that. Secretions \u2013 yep, you get them after an infection. They are a positive sign \u2013 that you\u2019re over the infection.\u201d</p> <h2>6 April: precautionary measures</h2> <p>Boris Johnson is in hospital. We are told it is just a precautionary measure; that he\u2019s having tests after 10 days of symptoms including a high fever. A day later he is moved into intensive care \u2013 again, a precautionary measure. </p> <p>\u201cDo you think he will die?\u201d Diane asks.</p> <p>\u201cNah,\u201d I say with a certainty I don\u2019t feel.</p> <p>The number of Covid-19 deaths is rising relentlessly. My mum phones to tell me one of her oldest friends, Lydia, has died from coronavirus. Ten bus drivers have died in London alone. The first three doctors to die in the UK are all BAME Muslims. There are so many heartbreaking stories: 28-year-old pregnant nurse <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/pregnant-healthcare-workers-pressured-into-covid-19-frontline\" title=\"\">Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapon dies</a>, but they manage to save her baby. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/boy-13-die-london-after-testing-positive-for-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab</a>, a 13-year-old with no previous underlying conditions, dies without his family around him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9100336bdab34adaab3646f2a03bdd51649be072\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9100336bdab34adaab3646f2a03bdd51649be072/0_2177_5412_3247/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A medicine spoon with red medicine in it\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>By now we\u2019ve passed 10,000 deaths with little fanfare or shock \u2013 just a hushed acceptance and numb inevitability. We are tracking France, we\u2019re told. But we\u2019re not: France includes deaths in care homes in its daily figures. Pound for pound, euro for euro, death for death, we are way ahead of France.</p> <p>On 12 April Johnson is released from hospital. The country breathes a collective sigh of relief \u2013 even those who say he\u2019s never knowingly told the truth in his life. He heads to Chequers to recuperate, while the rest of us remain in our primary residences. During this time of national crisis, the government has never seemed more determined to show there is one rule for some, another for others.</p> <p>It\u2019s not all misery. Far from it. Wonderful, uplifting things are happening. The Thursday night clap for carers is getting louder by the week. Ninety-nine-year-old war veteran <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/hes-just-a-wonderful-man-how-captain-tom-became-a-superstar-fundraiser\" title=\"\">Tom Moore</a> pledges to complete 100 laps of his garden in a bid to raise \u00a31,000. So far he has raised more than \u00a332m, clocked up his centenary and been awarded a knighthood. As we edge towards the end of April, the UK soars past 20,000 hospital deaths, and gets barely any nearer the promised 100,000 tests a day. Meanwhile the latest figures from the ONS, which incorporate Covid-19 deaths outside hospital, are horrifying: for the week to 10 April, the number of deaths is 41% higher than the official government figures.</p> <p>The aches come, the aches go, the aches return. As for the wheeze, I sound like an emphysemic canary. I phone the GP. Another locum, this time not so good. </p> <p>\u201cSo my chest is still bad. A lung scan shows inflammation and secretions, and I\u2019m worried about getting another urinary infection. I\u2019d like more antibiotics for my chest, just to see one last time if they make a difference.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUhum. I\u2019ll send the prescription to the chemist.\u201d</p> <p>Perfectly efficient, until it turns out I\u2019ve been prescribed an antibiotic that has not been in production for years.</p> <h2>May: songs of recovery</h2> <p>The weeks pass quickly. The government magically hits its testing target at the end of April, though it soon emerges that 100,000 tests a day is very different from 100,000 people tested in a day. By mid-May new figures will reveal that there have been more than 55,000 excess deaths (the number above the five-year average) during the pandemic \u2013 the highest total in Europe. Meanwhile, the number of confirmed Covid-19 deaths will top 36,000 \u2013 the second highest in the world.</p> <p>As for me, I\u2019m just trundling on. I\u2019m much better than I was at my worst, but I\u2019m not fully well. Symptoms disappear and occasionally new ones emerge. For the past few weeks I\u2019ve been dehydrated by night and rasping like Joe Pesci in Goodfellas by day. I feel embarrassed to tell people I\u2019m not fixed yet, so I say I\u2019m getting there.</p> <p>Our daughter Maya is autistic and a brilliant researcher. For weeks she\u2019s been nagging me to see a respiratory physiotherapist. She finds the number for one who lives nearby, rings it and puts the phone in my hand.</p> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t come round,\u201d I say. \u201cNobody does face to face these days. It\u2019s pointless.\u201d</p> <p>Leo, the physio, says he can pop round in an hour. Everybody gets a bit uptight. Can he be for real if he\u2019s willing to do a house visit \u2013 and in an hour?</p> <p>\u201cIf he\u2019s not wearing a mask, I don\u2019t want him to come in the house,\u201d Diane says. The others agree.</p> <p>Leo, a likable Antipodean, arrives in full PPE with a spare mask for me. He tells me my breathing sounds awful. I want to cry with gratitude. He gives me tips \u2013 breathe through a straw as if you\u2019re smoking, to open the airways; steam your head over a bowl of boiling water for five minutes, then huff (as if trying to steam up windows). But, most important, he clap-massages my back and chest to drain the lungs. Nothing comes up. He says that\u2019s probably because it\u2019s all solid, and will take ages to come up. He shows the family how to do the massage.</p> <p>None of the 10-plus doctors I have seen suggested respiratory physio. Perhaps that\u2019s the Covid-19 mindset: they either tell people to go away or treat them as if they are dying. </p> <p>A letter arrives from Dr Lung about the scan. \u201cThere was a 10mm pure ground glass opacity within left upper lobe and this is non-specific appearance.\u201d I Google it and discover a new academic paper on Covid-19. \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that GGOs aren\u2019t specific to Covid-19 and can be seen in so many different settings\u2026 in terms of Covid-19\u2026 GGOs on a CT scan are indicative of Covid-19-related pneumonia, or lung inflammation caused by the viral infection.\u201d</p> <p>Since Leo\u2019s visit, I have been wearing a mask. Three days later, in the middle of a furious massage-beating by Jimmy, who lives with us and is like a son, the first bit of mucus pops into it. It is thick, gluey and green. Just one globule, but it\u2019s a start. I show Alix the drop of mucus with pride. \u201cBrilliant!\u201d she says supportively. \u201cUgh. I feel sick.\u201d</p> <p>I send Leo a photo of what looks like a tiny alien, an ET of the lungs. He says it\u2019s good that it\u2019s come up, but it\u2019s bad mucus; the lighter the better. \u201cIf the colour doesn\u2019t lighten, you need to see your chest specialist,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Even so, I feel triumphant. I\u2019m sitting on the front doorstep, writing, the crazy spring sun beating down, and I\u2019m thinking of my little green alien and singing myself songs of recovery: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjD3EVC1-zU\" title=\"\">The Only Way</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjD3EVC1-zU\" title=\"\">Is Up</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jun/05/how-we-made-d-ream-things-can-only-get-better-tony-blair-election-alistair-campbell-\" title=\"\">Things Can Only Get Better</a>.

  "<p>Nirmal Purja is someone who responds to a crisis by becoming completely calm. When the Nepalese mountaineer saw the line of about 100 people waiting to reach the crest of Everest on 22 May last year, he knew there was no way he could overtake the slower climbers. Mentally, he abandoned the record he was attempting, for the fastest climb between the neighbouring peaks of Lhotse and Everest.</p> <p>Poor weather at the start of the climbing season had meant there was only a very small window of time in which people could attempt the summit \u2013 just three clear days. In 2018, the year before, there had been 11 good days, allowing climbing companies to stagger their teams. Purja had known there would be queues, but was taken aback by the numbers.</p> <p>Purja, a 36-year-old veteran of the Royal Navy\u2019s elite Special Boat Service, has climbed Everest four times, and was philosophical. \u201cIt is what it is. I always try to stay calm on the mountain,\u201d he tells me, speaking from his home in Winchester.

Then he tried to assess how he could help. He knew things could go catastrophically wrong, and quickly; this stretch of Everest, from the sheer rockface of the Hillary Step to the summit, was the most exposed part of the climb, with drops of up to 3,000 metres (9,842ft) on either side. As people queued, they got colder and used up unplanned-for quantities of their oxygen supplies. It was literally the worst place on Earth to get stuck in a queue.</p> <p>Looking at the line, with climbers travelling in both directions, Purja realised it would be impossible to rescue anyone who needed to be taken off the summit fast. Every climber was clipped to a safety rope, and the path is too narrow to allow the more experienced climbers to unclip and pass the slower climbers. The queue continued to build. Purja couldn\u2019t be confident that other climbers would be helpful in an emergency. \u201cIf you have to drag a body through that, no one would be able to give up the path to them. There <em>is</em> no path, and people are in their own survival state at that altitude, struggling to put one foot in front of another.

He worked out who had been waiting in critically cold conditions for the longest and prioritised them, and tried to calm the other climbers, taking off his mask to issue instructions.</p> <p>Purja\u2019s experience and military background meant that climbers were happy to be guided by him. Elsewhere, local Nepalese guides were finding it harder to convince their clients that they needed to turn back. There was a dangerous clash between the typically alpha-plus personalities of people who want to summit Everest and their guides, who are dependent on their fees for survival.</p> <p>\u201cWhen people are in stressful situations, they do shout,\u201d Purja says. \u201cYou can only get a few words out at that altitude: \u2018Move faster! Come off!\u2019 I disagree with it, but people come to Everest carrying a huge financial burden. Not only that, but they have spent more than two months and a lot of effort to be ready. That\u2019s why everybody rushes for the top.\u201d</p> <p>A year on, Thomas Becker tells me he remains disturbed by the behaviour he witnessed while queueing to reach the highest place on Earth. He is a lifelong climber, although it was his first attempt at Everest. He describes the experience as being \u201cvery <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2012/jan/24/review-lord-flies-william-golding\" title=\"\">Lord Of The Flies</a>\u201d. At the worst part of the queue, he was stuck in a line of around 40 climbers, behind a woman who was struggling. He had never met her and didn\u2019t know her name, but was worried by how inexperienced she seemed, unable to use her ice axe. He spent several hours helping her, so that he could shuffle forward himself, patiently advising her where to put her feet and catching her when she slipped. Behind them, tempers began to fray and climbers started swearing: \u201cFucking get moving!\u201d, \u201cGet the fuck off here!\u201d, \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21f6fa14899d3f96cd84c098ab671ab3f5b0d946\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21f6fa14899d3f96cd84c098ab671ab3f5b0d946/1_0_2695_2022/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas Becker, who teaches law at Harvard, climbing Everest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomas Becker, who teaches law at Harvard, describes queuing on Everest as \u2018very Lord Of The Flies\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Thomas Becker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Becker, a former rock guitarist who teaches human rights law at Harvard, was startled by the ruthlessness of his fellow climbers. Earlier in the day, he had discovered that someone had stolen eight of the oxygen tanks his team had stashed by their tents at base camp, which meant he was climbing the most dangerous stretch of the mountain with just two canisters instead of six. The theft was \u201cdisappointing\u201d, he says now, with polite understatement. \u201cThere is a code of ethics on the mountain that you don\u2019t steal anyone else\u2019s oxygen, because it could be fatal.\u201d He was also puzzled. \u201cThis is not the norm. Sometimes, someone might take one to stay alive, but to have a big chunk of tanks stolen... The folks we were with said this was the first time they had ever seen anything like that.\u201d</p> <p>He managed to feel a brief sense of elation as he embarked on the final stretch, edging closer to an ambition he had held since reading about Everest as a child. But it was a fleeting sensation. \u201cIt became less exciting when we started to see people being brought down, dead bodies. It became sad quickly.\u201d By the time he got to the summit, he had walked past a number of corpses. \u201cJust 10 minutes shy of Hillary Step, there was a guy attached to a rope who had passed away, dangling there. I think I saw five bodies that day, six maybe. There are people literally lying in your path, frozen,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s brutal.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are people who call up and ask: \u2018I\u2019ve never climbed anything. Can I go with your company? And I need a discount\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Purja\u2019s startling images of the queue at the top of Everest quickly went round the world. People who know nothing about mountaineering were shocked by this contradiction between the mountain\u2019s reputation as a lonely and unattainable peak, and the banal reality of a rush-hour crush. But it was more than banal: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/28/walking-over-bodies-mountaineers-describe-the-carnage-at-the-top-of-mount-everest\" title=\"\">11 people died on Everest that May</a>, more than twice the number of climbers who had perished the previous year \u2013 a figure widely attributed to the crowded conditions and the extra physical stresses caused by waiting in temperatures of -30C, at an altitude where oxygen levels are not sufficient to sustain human life. Climbers call it \u201cthe death zone\u201d.</p> <p>But within the climbing community, people were less surprised. Last year\u2019s was just a more extreme version of the bottlenecks that have been troubling the mountain with increasing frequency. The deaths were not caused by the queue itself, they argue, but a different problem: the rising numbers of inexperienced climbers who view Everest as the ultimate selfie destination, and the proliferation of companies willing to take their money and let them have a go, regardless of their ability.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ebaeae09a8c5c04c093ba535759d6725f44072d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ebaeae09a8c5c04c093ba535759d6725f44072d/0_76_3264_1957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Expedition leader Greg Vernovage with his Nepalese team\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Climbers don\u2019t know the risks and aren\u2019t concerned with them,\u2019 says expedition leader Greg Vernovage, centre, with his team.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Greg Vernovage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere are people who call up and ask: \u2018I\u2019ve never climbed anything. Can I go with your company? And I need a discount,\u2019\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.mountainguides.com/guides.shtml\" title=\"\">Greg Vernovage</a>, Everest expedition leader with International Mountain Guides, a well-established climbing firm. \u201cUnfortunately, there is probably a company out there now that will take them. It\u2019s very easy to jump on your computer and dig around for the lowest common denominator.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, 381 permits to climb the mountain were issued by the Nepalese government (a record number, 35 more than the previous year). The cost of climbing Everest varies wildly; cut-price operators will offer to take you up for as little as $30,000 (\u00a324,600) \u2013 a price that includes the $11,000 (\u00a39,000) permit \u2013 or you can pay $200,000 (\u00a3164,000) if you want to stay at the best hotels in the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu and be taken by the most experienced guides. Last autumn, Nepal\u2019s Ministry of Tourism showed no sign of wanting to restrict the numbers of permits issued after last season, encouraging more people to come \u201cfor both pleasure and fame\u201d.</p> <p>There is suspicion that less well-established guides and companies find it harder to tell tourists they need to turn back if they see them struggling. \u201cJust like a kid thinks they can eat a whole bag of candy without getting sick, climbers just want to stand on top. They don\u2019t know the risks and they aren\u2019t concerned with them,\u201d Vernovage says. \u201cCompanies need to be a bit more forceful with clients. Just because you pay the money, that doesn\u2019t give you a ticket to be on the summit team. I\u2019ve had that difficult conversation with people.\u201d</p> <p>The cheaper firms have fewer backup staff, lower supplies of spare oxygen and less ability to manage things when dangerous situations arise. Purja, who runs <a href=\"https://www.nimsdai.com/\" title=\"\">his own climbing company</a>, attributes the higher number of deaths in 2019 not so much to the numbers on the mountain as to the growth of cheaper operators, who employ less experienced guides. \u201cWe have backup people to help clients who are struggling. If everyone had been climbing with that support, no one would have struggled.\u201d</p> <p>Four Indian climbers were among the dead last year, leading to speculation that lower average salaries in India result in these climbers choosing cheaper tour operators, with tragic consequences. Attempting the mountain is expensive, so climbers are sometimes older, at the end of their careers, with expendable income but less physical stamina.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I saw people take 14 hours to cover a distance that took me two \u2013 people who usually have nothing to do with mountains</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There has been no climbing season this year. The view from the ground has been spectacular: the disappearance of a pollution haze means the snow-capped peaks of Everest have been visible from Kathmandu for the first time in decades. But the only people on the mountain are a small group of Chinese researchers and surveyors \u2013 there to place 5G masts, and to mark the 60th anniversary of the first Chinese ascent of the north side of the mountain. </p> <p>On 13 March, Nepal\u2019s government locked down Everest, announcing that no climbing would be allowed on the mountain because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Police have patrolled the roads nearby to prevent anyone approaching. The cooks, porters and guides who help international tourists attempt the summit have mostly returned to their villages. With the disappearance of a year\u2019s income, many have been pushed into destitution; a number of climbers have <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/climbing-community-fund-covid19\" title=\"\">launched fundraisers</a> to help Everest workers feed themselves and their families.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m doing fine, I\u2019m in England, I\u2019ve managed to get income from my book,\u201d Purja says. \u201cBut the community there is suffering. Some people don\u2019t even have food to put on the table.

As soon as he saw the queues at the top, he understood he was going to have to turn around. He was making an entirely self-sufficient attempt to summit, carrying his own kit and without oxygen \u2013 the most intensely challenging way to climb the mountain. \u201cThere are only a tiny fraction of people who can climb without oxygen,\u201d he says. He views its use as a form of cheating, \u201clike doping, like an enhancing drug\u201d. But without oxygen, it was too risky to wait in line. He abandoned his climb around 100 vertical metres from the summit. It wasn\u2019t the crowds that surprised him: \u201cYou don\u2019t go to Everest for a lonely adventure,\u201d he says. But he was dismayed by the slowness of the people ahead of him.</p> <p>\u201cI saw people who took 14 hours to cover a distance that took me two hours \u2013 these are people who usually have nothing to do with mountains. I have the feeling that they hear Everest is a nice thing to do and say: \u2018Let\u2019s do it!\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18726993d51592540314ba1bfc4b8d97487bf8a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18726993d51592540314ba1bfc4b8d97487bf8a5/0_0_2500_1875/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David G\u00f6ttler, who was climbing without oxygen and had to turn back because of the queues\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Most of these deaths were predictable,\u2019 says David G\u00f6ttler, who was climbing without oxygen and had to turn back because of the queues.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David G\u00f6ttler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was this inexperience that caused the spike in deaths, he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound hard or without feelings, because it\u2019s a tragedy for the families, but most of these deaths were predictable. It is surprising that there are not more of them, given how unprepared and naive people are. They pay the money and hire an agency, and think that this is a summit guarantee.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://eliasaikaly.com/\" title=\"\">Elia Saikaly</a>, a Canadian film-maker, was on Everest last year to make a documentary about a team of four women from Saudi Arabia, Oman and Lebanon. Like G\u00f6ttler, they made their ascent the day after Purja\u2019s photograph was taken, when the queues were still long. Saikaly had attempted Everest many times before, and succeeded on two earlier occasions. But he remains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2019/jun/04/death-carnage-chaos-a-climber-on-his-recent-ascent-up-everest\" title=\"\">troubled by what he saw that day</a>; he is now making a film about how his attitude to the mountain was changed by his experiences.</p> <p>There were between 25 and 40 people on and around the summit when Saikaly arrived at the tiny plateau at the top, a patch of mountain not much bigger than the surface area of a couple of ping-pong tables. He felt subdued as he arrived there. \u201cI didn\u2019t want anything to do with it, to be honest. Summits can be a bit of a disappointment, when you see that number of people taking selfies in such a spiritual place,\u201d Saikaly says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the pure experience it once was. The loss of life is very challenging. It makes you question why people do this and why you are there. We celebrated quietly.\u201d</p> <p>Becker also had mixed feelings as he stood at the peak, contemplating his achievement. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t an \u2018I found God\u2019 moment at the top that some people say they have. I was torn,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve dreamed about climbing it since I was a kid. But I think the 13-year-old me would have found it upsetting to go to the mountain and see it like that.\u201d</p> <p>Becker says he felt alienated by the \u201calmost colonialist culture of must-conquer-the-mountains\u201d. Some of his fellow climbers had already conquered figurative mountains in their business careers. \u201cThey think, because of that, they can conquer <em>the</em> mountain. There are people who paid six figures to get to the top and so they think: \u2018I\u2019m going to get my money\u2019s worth. I must make it to the top of the mountain, who cares what happens?\u2019 I think it draws certain people who will be happy to go to the top, at almost any cost to themselves and others.\u201d</p> <p>As well as this nagging ambivalence, Becker was in physical difficulty: his attempts to ration his depleted oxygen supply had led to his tank freezing; his mask had frozen on to his face and beard, the condensation inside it creating a cascade of ice down his front; his goggles were frozen to his suit. Without goggles, he was worried about developing ice blindness in the glare of the sun on the descent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d9a658032b79849e0d6222c048e6f863092f83f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d9a658032b79849e0d6222c048e6f863092f83f/0_0_3088_2316/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US guide Garrett Madison on Everest with flags and other climbers behind him\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It can be a good reality check; it reinforces the gravity of it all,\u2019 says US guide Garrett Madison of seeing dead climbers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Garrett Madison</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of all he, like other climbers on Everest last year, was very shaken by the experience of having to walk past so many dead climbers. <a href=\"https://madisonmountaineering.com/garrett-madison/\" title=\"\">Garrett Madison</a>, a US guide who was climbing with Saikaly, says it is something climbers see every year, but remains hard to get used to. \u201cFor a first-time climber, it can be shocking,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can be a good reality check; it reinforces the gravity of it all.\u201d</p> <p>Conditions are so harsh at the summit that it is usually impossible to expend energy on carrying bodies back. \u201cIt is a major effort to bring a corpse down,\u201d Madison says. \u201cIt is not like you can just chuck them on your back and trot on down.\u201d</p> <p>Becker was unable to avert his eyes. \u201cThe first person had the same boots as me, the same scrawny build as me. It was scary \u2013 he looked like me. I imagined myself in that situation, and I very much did not want to be in that situation. I was just sad for this guy. I thought about his family \u2013 does he have kids or a wife, or parents? What are they going to think?\u201d</p> <p>Worse was a sense that some seemed unconsciously to revel in the danger. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that anyone saw a dead body and thought: \u2018Oh, this is great!\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThere were some people who seemed upset about it. But there were others whose attitude was \u2013 and I\u2019m speculating \u2013 \u2018Wow, this is such a dangerous mountain, and I made it!\u2019 It almost made it more romantic that they made it to the top despite these deaths. That attitude was pretty uncomfortable.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>In the wake of last year\u2019s queues, there has been renewed discussion in Nepal about how better regulation of firms and climbers could be introduced. Some trekking firms would like firmer control of how many climbers can attempt the summit on a given day. A government panel recommended that anyone applying for a permit must in future show that they have successfully completed a 6,500 metre (21,325ft) climb, but the proposals had not been implemented before Covid-19 prompted lockdown. The damage caused to the country\u2019s tourist industry may have reduced the willingness to regulate.</p> <p>This April, a team of Nepalese soldiers had been due to mount an expedition to remove the mess that has been accumulating on the mountain for years: piles of empty fuel canisters, tents (the climbing company\u2019s logo carefully cut out before they were abandoned, to avoid responsibility), food wrappers and human excrement. But when climbing permits were cancelled, the cleanup operation was also abandoned.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Last year there was a line of people quite literally dying because of the over-commercialisation of the mountain</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>No one is sure whether the crowds will return next year. Most climbers who were forced to cancel trips this spring would like to return in 2021, which means the queues could be heavier still, with two years\u2019 worth of tourists attempting to summit at once. But if there is a global economic slump, fewer people will have the spare money to fund this very expensive adventure travel.</p> <p>Purja hopes that climbers will come back, to restore the livelihoods of the Nepalese climbing community, but he also hopes the next season will be cleaner and less chaotic. Other climbers say last year\u2019s season has made them re-evaluate their attitude to Everest.</p> <p>\u201cLast year there was a line of people quite literally dying because of the over-commercialisation of the mountain,\u201d Becker says. \u201cPeople have come to think, if you throw money at it you can get to the top, which brings more inexperienced people to the mountain and more sherpas to work there. It does make me reflect on what kind of climbing I want to do, what\u2019s responsible and doesn\u2019t endanger myself and others. And to think about whether I am perpetuating this culture \u2013 the romanticisation of Everest. I worry that, am I in some way part of the problem?\u201d</p>",

Tutors have told her she can only defer if she had a serious medical condition. \u201cI don\u2019t feel I have any control,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel very anxious and I\u2019m really down.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike many students, she has yet to experience online learning. When GSA sent students home, she and her classmates were simply told they had automatically passed the year and it would finish early. \u201cWe\u2019re told there will be online learning next year, but how do you do sculpture online?\u201d she asks.</p> <p>She says students do understand that universities need their tuition fees to survive. \u201cBut we are paying and we need a proper degree. This isn\u2019t what we signed up for.\u201d</p> <p>Luke Hassan, a master\u2019s student in event, festival and exhibition management at Birmingham City University, has had a similar experience. \u201cI have been getting very stressed-out studying on my own at home. I hoped I could defer my last semester, which is about to start, until September, when it will be hopefully easier to use the facilities at university. But they are saying I won\u2019t be allowed.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the university says: \u201cAny student can ask to temporarily withdraw and return to complete the same semester the following year, but we do not recommend this as it delays graduating by a year.\u201d</p> <p>Michelle Morgan, a former academic who now advises universities on the student experience, says making students feel trapped is the worst thing universities can do. \u201cIf you offer choices, students will feel more in control and they are more likely to decide to stay. Kindness and humanity work much better.\u201d</p> <p>She adds: \u201cThe&nbsp;traumas and challenges students may experience as a result of Covid-19 could be far-reaching. If a student is blocked from deferring it could exacerbate the state of their mental health and possibly prevent them completing their course.\u201d</p> <p>By contrast, Sheffield University says on its <a href=\"https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/coronavirus/faqs/students\">website</a> that it will consider coronavirus a reason for time out. However, Prof Wyn Morgan, the university\u2019s vice-president for education, hopes the university can offer struggling students extra support so they don\u2019t feel the need to defer.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve said if you\u2019re having trouble, talk to us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe might not be able to nail every concern, but we can provide reassurance. We want to show students that we aren\u2019t rigid in the way we do things. I think a blanket approach in these uncertain times can feel a little blunt.\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Glasgow School of Arts says the institution is developing creative approaches to delivering its teaching so that students can carry on with their studies. <br></p>",

  "<p>The failure of governments and central banks to set out a green recovery from the coronavirus crisis is threatening to derail vital UN climate talks aimed at staving off global catastrophe, campaigners have warned.</p> <p>On Friday, the UK and the UN attempted to revive the stalled Cop26 climate talks, with a coalition of businesses committing to a Race for Zero, signing up to reduce their emissions to net zero by mid-century. Close to 1,000 businesses have joined the campaign, including household names such as Rolls-Royce and the food and drink majors Nestl\u00e9 and Diageo.</p> <p>Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England and UN special envoy for climate and finance, said: \u201cThe transition to net zero is creating the greatest commercial opportunity of our time. Net zero targets must be underpinned by transition plans so that investors can assess which companies will seize the opportunities in the transition and which will cease to exist.\u201d</p> <p>But rhetoric is not enough while central banks are still pouring money into propping up \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, according to campaigners.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been great to hear the government\u2019s warm words about the green recovery, but what really matters now are the policies and investments needed to make it a reality,\u201d said Morten Thaysen, green recovery campaigner at Greenpeace UK.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK has a chance to lead on the world stage next year with Cop26, and set an example of what building back better actually looks like. Committing to this ahead of the climate talks will show international leadership on what a truly green recovery looks like.\u201d</p> <p>The vast majority of the stimulus money so far announced by governments around the world is set to prop up the fossil fuel economy, according to analyst company Bloomberg New Energy Finance. More than half a trillion dollars worldwide \u2013 $509bn (\u00a3395bn) \u2013 is to be poured into high-carbon industries, with no conditions to ensure they reduce their carbon output.</p> <p>Only about $12.3bn is to go towards low-carbon industries, such as renewable energy, and a further $18.5bn into high-carbon industries provided they achieve climate targets.</p> <p>At these rates, the rescue packages would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/heed-lessons-of-2008-crisis-experts-warn-global-leaders\">even less green than the economic stimulus following the 2008 financial crisis</a>, despite government rhetoric on a green recovery, and pressure from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/green-stimulus-can-repair-global-economy-and-climate-study-says\">economists</a> and campaigners to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/24/covid-19-economic-rescue-plans-must-be-green-say-environmentalists\">use the stimulus packages to shift to a low-carbon footing</a>.</p> <p>The current and former governors of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey and Mark Carney, joined Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau, governor of the Bank of France, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/05/world-climate-breakdown-pandemic\">write in the Guardian of the need for a green recovery</a>. They said: \u201cThe economic recovery plans being developed today offer the chance to build a sustainable, competitive new economy.\u201d</p> <p>However, the first disclosures from the Bank\u2019s Covid Corporate Financing Facility this week showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/airlines-and-carmakers-benefit-from-uk-covid-relief-scheme\">billions of pounds of taxpayer support are being funnelled to fossil fuel companies</a>. Airlines have taken up about \u00a31.8bn of the \u00a316bn already allocated from the funds, which could top \u00a367bn when fully disbursed, while carmakers have benefited by more than \u00a31bn so far and two oil service companies, Baker Hughes and Schlumberger, are taking \u00a3600m and \u00a3150m respectively.</p> <p>\u201cThe Bank of England\u2019s failure to lead by example in greening its activities risks seriously undermining the UK\u2019s efforts to show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/financial-help-for-airlines-should-come-with-strict-climate-conditions\">global leadership</a> on climate through Cop26,\u201d said Fran Boait, executive director of the pressure group Positive Money. \u201cIt would be farcical if the institution underpinning Britain\u2019s financial system is still pumping money towards companies whose business models are utterly incompatible with global emissions targets.\u201d</p> <p>The European Central Bank has also propped up high-carbon industries in its lending, with as much as \u20ac220bn (\u00a3193bn) going to fossil fuel industries, according to analysis by the pressure group Reclaim Finance. The bank\u2019s plans will funnel money to 38 oil companies including big names such as Shell and Total, and several coal companies. \u201cThe ECB is simultaneously acknowledging climate urgency and refusing to act,\u201d said Paul Schreiber, campaigner at Reclaim Finance. \u201cThis stance is unbearable \u2013 we now know that the ECB is not neutral, but finances climate change.\u201d</p> <p>Governments are also continuing to subsidise the fossil fuel industry, according to an <a href=\"https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/view/?ref=133_133639-s08q2ridhf&amp;title=Building-back-better-_A-sustainable-resilient-recovery-after-Covid-19\">analysis by the OECD and the International Energy Agency on Friday</a>. Last year, $478bn of government support was poured into the production and consumption of fossil fuels by 77 economies.</p> <p>\u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, the secretary-general of the OECD club of rich countries, said: \u201cI am saddened to see some backsliding on efforts to phase out fossil fuel support. This rise in production subsidies seems set to continue in 2020 with some countries targeting state aid to fossil fuel and related industries. We should seize this opportunity [of the coronavirus recovery] to reform subsidies and use public funds in a way that best benefits people and the planet.\u201d</p> <p>Britain\u2019s role as president of Cop26 means the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/28/uk-urged-to-tie-green-recovery-from-covid-19-crisis-to-cop26-summit\">UK government has a crucial role to pla</a>y if these trends towards a bailout of the high-carbon economy are to be reversed and the world is to reach net zero emissions. The vital UN summit, postponed by a year to November 2021, is seen as the last chance to put the world back on track to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations\">meet the Paris agreement on climate change</a>, and avoid catastrophic levels of global heating. For Cop26 to be a success, the government must lead by example in setting out a green recovery, experts concluded.</p> <p>\u201cThe clock is ticking for the UK to show it\u2019s serious about a green recovery,\u201d said Chris Venables, head of politics at the Green Alliance thinktank. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard bold and ambitious words from Boris Johnson and other ministers, but with the first stimulus package only weeks away we need to see the government\u2019s plans to support its ambitions. We need to take some big steps. Let\u2019s fire the starting gun on a real green recovery.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The coronavirus pandemic has wrought destruction on US workers at a scale and speed that is almost unfathomable.&nbsp;</p> <p>It was only in February that Donald Trump was touting an unemployment level of 3.5%, a 50-year low.

Barr was head of the department from November 1991 to January 1993.)</p> <p>Trump and Barr are close in age. Both grew up during the Vietnam war and the 1960s- and 1970s-era unrest.

The war was part of his family\u2019s reality.</p> <p>Barr\u2019s older brother was&nbsp;in Vietnam,&nbsp;fighting in the navy.&nbsp;Barr\u2019s&nbsp;father had served&nbsp;in the army during the Second World War&nbsp;and&nbsp;was a member of the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner to the Central Intelligence Agency.&nbsp;</p> <p>As a Columbia undergraduate, Barr stood fast against&nbsp;the&nbsp;anti-war protesters who sought to bring the university to its knees.&nbsp;Back then, the operative divide was \u201cStaten Island v Scarsdale\u201d \u2013&nbsp;conservative, often Catholic, students from the&nbsp;blue-collar New York City outer borough versus liberal, often Jewish, students from affluent suburbs.&nbsp;Barr, though far from working-class, was firmly planted in the first camp.&nbsp;</p> <p>At the time, radical leftwing&nbsp;activists such as Berkeley\u2019s Mario Savio argued that people of conscience must&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2014/12/01/mario-savios-bodies-upon-the-gears-speech-50-years-later\">throw themselves</a>&nbsp;against the machinery of the state.&nbsp;Barr, in contrast,&nbsp;saw himself as holding the line against anarchy and disorder.&nbsp;When protesters attempted to storm the university library, Barr and a group of counter-protesters blocked them. The standoff, according to the New York Times, was resolved by a massive fistfight. The counter-protestors won.</p> <p>Ultimately, however, Barr\u2019s side of the student culture war lost. Nixon, though an anti-communist, knew the American public\u2019s appetite for the war was rapidly depleting. He pulled America out of Vietnam after 20,000 US soldiers were killed on his watch.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Saigon fell&nbsp;and the draft ended, the two sides of the culture war retreated to their respective&nbsp;corners. Leftist students started their \u201clong march through the institutions\u201d \u2013 academia, journalism and the cultural sphere.&nbsp;</p> <p>And Barr and the pro-Vietnam crowd started their own long march, too. Barr briefly served in the CIA as an analyst and then in the agency\u2019s legislative counsel\u2019s&nbsp;office,&nbsp;where he met George HW Bush, then helming the agency.&nbsp;When Bush was later elected president, in&nbsp;1988, Barr&nbsp;joined the administration and&nbsp;rapidly rose&nbsp;to the top of the justice department,&nbsp;where he served his first tenure as attorney general.&nbsp;A profile&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-06-21-op-1236-story.html\">at the time</a>&nbsp;described Barr as a \u201cbookish-looking son of educators who speaks with a muted New York accent\u201d,&nbsp;and extremely effective.</p> <p>During the 1992 Los Angeles riots following the Rodney King verdict,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-should-ask-george-hw-bush-what-happens-when-william-barrs-the-attorney-general-and-a-citys-on-fire?ref=author\">Barr argued</a>&nbsp;that \u201cour system is fair and does not treat people differently\u201d. He conceded that \u201cour national criminal-justice system is a diverse [and] broad one\u201d,&nbsp;with cases of individual bias, but that \u201ctaken in its totality, the system seems to operate fairly\u201d.&nbsp;He&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/03/politics/bill-barr-los-angeles-riots-attorney-general/index.html\">blamed</a>&nbsp;the riots mainly on opportunistic gang violence.</p> <p>After two days of rioting,&nbsp;Bush and Barr invoked the Insurrection Act at the request of California\u2019s Republican governor, Pete Wilson. The statute is a rarely-used provision that permits the president to use federal military forces for domestic law enforcement, which is normally illegal.

  "<p>Tens of thousands of bereaved families who have lost loved ones to coronavirus are dealing with the financial procedures that follow a death \u2013 called probate \u2013 but are encountering a system hit by delays and bureaucracy.</p> <p>It usually takes about three to four months to sort out probate, which is essentially identifying the dead person\u2019s assets, paying off any debts and sharing out the remaining estate according to the will.</p> <p>Solicitors are warning, however, that even simple estates are taking months longer than normal to sort out. At the height of lockdown some solicitors were unable to access their offices to get physical wills, while obtaining details of bank accounts and investments has been fraught with delays.</p> <p>Homes and other properties that belonged to the deceased have to be valued. A professional surveyor, not just an estate agent\u2019s estimate, is usually required if there\u2019s a chance the estate may fall into the inheritance tax (IHT) bracket. During lockdown, physical valuations were almost completely suspended.</p> <p>The result is that the number of applications for grants of probate to HM Courts &amp; Tribunals Service (HMCTS), rather than rising as might be expected because of coronavirus deaths, has plummeted by 50% since the lockdown began, according to <a href=\"https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/probate-applications-halve-during-lockdown/5104257.article\" title=\"\">reports in the UK Law Gazette</a>.</p> <p>Chris Burrows, a partner at the Manchester law firm Glaisyers, says: \u201cThere are delays across almost all aspects of probate.\u201d</p> <p>When coronavirus struck, the government moved to address the problems with registering a death, such as letting a GP certify a death without physically attending.</p> <p>Tax and legal authorities have streamlined matters. According to the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners (Step), HMCTS is accepting electronic signatures on the IHT forms and has replaced affidavits with statements of truth that can be signed electronically.</p> <p>HMRC is accepting electronic signatures on the IHT forms and payment is being accepted by bank transfer rather than cheque. But HMRC\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died\" title=\"\"> inheritance tax deadlines</a> have remained in place: IHT is due six months after the end of the month in which the death occurs. There is an option to pay by instalments (at a 10th of the liability), with the first due by the six-month date.</p> <p>But a property cannot be sold, and the money distributed, until a formal grant is issued. Phoebe Tranter, who handles probate at solicitors Lawson-West in Leicester, says last year there were long delays at the the probate registry, the part of the HMCTS that issues these grants. This improved by the end of 2019 \u2013 but went into another tailspin when coronavirus struck. </p> <p>She says some banks have been brilliant during the crisis, while others have taken longer to deal with paperwork.</p> <p>Guardian Money approached HMCTS for figures on probate times but it said these are issued only quarterly and the next data release will not be until later in June.</p> <h2><strong>How to deal with a will and estate</strong></h2> <p><strong>1. Find the will</strong></p> <p>Once somebody\u2019s death has been registered and their funeral arranged, the first thing to do is locate the person\u2019s will (or confirm they did not make one).</p> <p>If you cannot find one in their home, contact the person\u2019s solicitor, accountant or bank to see if any of them holds it. You can check whether a will is stored with the Principal Registry of the Family Division. Ask for a search to be made of the safe custody wills register.</p> <p><strong>2. Contact banks and other financial providers</strong></p> <p>The executors named in the will, or the people who will inherit if there is no will (called intestacy), should start assembling the financial information.</p> <p>You should notify banks, building societies, mortgage lenders, credit card providers and insurance companies. Your first step should be the <a href=\"https://www.deathnotificationservice.co.uk/\" title=\"\">deathnotificationservice.co.uk</a>, which allows you to notify several banks and building societies of a person\u2019s death at the same time.</p> <p>Then go to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/after-a-death/organisations-you-need-to-contact-and-tell-us-once\" title=\"\">Tell Us Once</a> service, which lets you report a death to most government organisations in one go. You will be able to notify HMRC, DWP, DVLA, the Passport Office and so on in a few clicks.</p> <p>Co-op Legal Services this week also launched a <a href=\"https://www.co-oplegalservices.co.uk/probate-solicitors/bereavement-notification-service/\" title=\"\">bereavement notification service</a>, which apart from help in notifying banks also gives guidance on closing social media accounts and informing utility and insurance providers.</p> <p><strong>3. Estimate and report the estate\u2019s value</strong></p> <p>The executor needs to assess the amount in savings accounts, pensions, shares and Isas, and whether the dead person\u2019s employer owed them wages. Debts such as credit cards must be paid off. If the mortgage lender requires interest payments to continue while you are applying for probate, the executor can pay these bills and reclaim the money from the estate once they have obtained probate. The executor should check if there are any payouts from life insurance policies.</p> <p><strong>4. Begin the formal probate process</strong></p> <p>The executor should apply for a grant of probate, which is the legal document that enables you to access funds, sort finances and share out assets the deceased accumulated.</p> <p>The government website <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/applying-for-probate\" title=\"\">gov.uk/applying-for-probate</a> sets out the process and whether you actually have to go through it. According to Step, in England and Wales, there is usually no need to apply for probate if the estate is worth less than \u00a35,000. There is an application fee of \u00a3155 for estates over the \u00a35,000 threshold, with a \u00a360 fee added if you apply yourself rather than via a solicitor.</p> <p>Assuming you have obtained an estimate of the estate\u2019s value, and you have the original will and death certificate, you can begin the probate process online. </p> <p><strong>5. Decide whether to use a solicitor, probate brokerage or do it yourself</strong></p> <p>You are under no obligation to use a solicitor but if you do, don\u2019t automatically sign up with the family firm, or the bank, as the charges can be high. Most firms operate hourly rates or percentage charging systems.</p> <p>Law firms are required to disclose their fees online.</p> <p>Probate brokerages, such as <a href=\"https://www.finalduties.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Final Duties</a>, will find you a solicitor from its approved panel that will undertake probate for a fixed fee.</p> <p>Or you can do it yourself. If you want legal help without paying too much, <a href=\"https://legalservice.which.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Which? Legal</a> provides a probate service that promises unlimited advice and support from its experts at \u00a39 a month, plus a \u00a328 joining fee.</p>",
  "<p>I\u2019ve always been drawn to islands. As a child, most of the games I played were on a castaway theme, and I listened to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qnmr\">Desert Island Discs</a> on the radio at my grandparents\u2019 house with envy and a degree of scorn for some of the guests\u2019 \u201cluxury items\u201d. At seven, I\u2019d already decided what my luxury would be: a case of specially designed knives for gutting, skinning and filleting. I was a literal-minded child and assumed that all the guests on the show would actually be stranded.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ae3536f62fbbfb11b402382f08cb460d7edb71e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae3536f62fbbfb11b402382f08cb460d7edb71e7/1_60_1001_601/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Noirmoutier map\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I also assumed that the island would be some version of the one on which my grandfather had a holiday home, and where I spent all my holidays until his death in 1988. This was <a href=\"https://www.ile-noirmoutier.com/en\">Noirmoutier</a>, in the Vend\u00e9e region of France: it\u2019s a flat and sandy island 20km long and 7km at its widest point, connected to the mainland by a cobbled causeway, Le Passage du Gois, accessible only at low tide.</p> <p>It was, and still is, my happy place, to which I return again and again (if only in my imagination at this time of lockdown). After the death of my grandfather, I went there with my family throughout my daughter\u2019s childhood, visiting my favourite haunts, creating a new set of memories.</p> <p>My grandfather\u2019s house was an abandoned fisherman\u2019s cottage, rebuilt and furnished to a basic level and, at the time, standing almost alone by a deserted expanse of beach. To me, its charm lay in its simplicity: its whitewashed walls, its concrete floors, its lack of proper plumbing. The toilet was at the back of the house in a little wooden shack; until I was in my teens, we used the well for water. At the back was a stand of fig trees, which I liked to climb, eating the figs straight from the tree. At night, the stars were incredibly clear \u2013 for years there were no streetlamps on that part of the island \u2013 and I would often creep outside to lie on the beach and watch for shooting stars, and listen to the sound of the waves, and smell the scent of the salt flats and the mimosa that grew wild in the dunes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I would lie on the beach and watch for shooting stars, and smell the scent of the salt flats and the mimosa in the dunes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I only know the first time I went there from my mother\u2019s photo album. I was two weeks old, and that summer, which was especially hot, I had to be watered hourly with Evian as I lay in the shade of the fig trees. But maybe the island got to me then, because growing up in South Yorkshire I always thought of it as <em>home</em>: when I arrived in the summer for the school holidays, it was always with the feeling that I was finally where I belonged.</p> <p>Some of this, I think, was because the island was \u2013 and remains \u2013 a safe place. Here even my mother, who was usually rather an anxious parent, was happy for me to wander as far as I liked \u2013 along the beaches, across the dunes, into the forests of sea pines, or across the sand at low tide in search of clams and razor shells. I would sometimes borrow my grandmother\u2019s bike \u2013 a huge, ancient thing with virtually no brakes \u2013 and cycle into the town of Noirmoutier, to visit the markets and <a href=\"https://www.ile-noirmoutier.com/en/que-faire-sur-l-ile/patrimoine-sites-de-visites-sur-lile-de-noirmoutier/chateau-museum.html\">12<sup>th</sup>-century castle</a> with its collection of armaments, or ride the narrow pathways between the salt marshes that still make up much of the island\u2019s economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0bb192bc721e803307e02624be3f0ff9c149f7ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0bb192bc721e803307e02624be3f0ff9c149f7ad/226_0_2069_2356/878.jpg\" alt=\"Joanne Harris on Noirmoutier\" width=\"878\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joanne Harris has visited Noirmoutier throughout her life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Joanne Harris</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My grandfather had a fishing boat, and I would often go sailing with him or, later, on my own. There was a fallen second world war aircraft on the sandy sea bottom a couple of kilometres from the shore, and I would try to dive down and look for souvenirs among the curtains of seaweed that clung to the wreckage. No one paid much attention to what I did on the island: by definition, I couldn\u2019t go far, and although there was no beach supervision, I was a good enough swimmer to allay my mother\u2019s anxieties.</p> <p>As a result, I grew up feeling as if the whole of the island belonged to me. And, yes, I <em>did</em> have a hunting knife, a gift from my grandfather to celebrate my seventh birthday on the island, which I proudly wore in a sheath on my belt and used to open shells. This, too, was perfectly normal in that alternative reality, as was the fact that for six or seven weeks at a time I stopped wearing shoes, and walked barefoot until the soles of my feet became hard and invulnerable.</p> <p>There were no bath or shower facilities at my grandfather\u2019s house, but I swam every day in the sea, and took bucket showers in the yard. We cooked outside on the barbecue: mackerel or spiced <em>merguez</em>, eaten with ripe tomatoes, or beans, or new potatoes grown at the little farm just around the corner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d7f378221705ef64ec521370e3ff1de40a0faca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d7f378221705ef64ec521370e3ff1de40a0faca/191_0_5642_3388/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Windmill in the middle of sand dunes, Noirmoutier\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As a child, Joanne loved to explore the island\u2019s landmarks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J Borruel/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My particular territory was the long, pale stretch of sand between my grandfather\u2019s house at <a href=\"https://www.ile-noirmoutier.com/en/explorer-l-ile/la-gueriniere.html\">La Gu\u00e9rini\u00e8re</a> and the beach at <a href=\"https://www.ile-noirmoutier.com/en/explorer-l-ile/barbatre.html\">Barb\u00e2tre</a>, with its clump of concrete pillboxes left by the Germans after the war. This was a distance of seven or eight kilometres which led me past various familiar landmarks \u2013 three disused windmills; a variety of dykes, groynes and other sea defences (Noirmoutier has always been at the mercy of the tides); an ancient ring of rocks that might once have been a manmade tide pool. The pillboxes marked the place where I needed to turn back and walk home, and besides, they were haunted, tumbling further on to the sand with every year that went by.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/sep/01/vendee-noirmoutier-france-camping-family-holiday-puy-du-fou-cycling\">Vend\u00e9e, France: an old-school family holiday</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On special occasions we would all get into my grandfather\u2019s car and drive to the north-east side of the island, to <a href=\"https://www.ile-noirmoutier.com/en/bois-de-la-chaise.html\">Bois de la Chaise</a><em>, </em>with its grand old villas, lighthouse and beaches ringed with rocks.

Most of the islanders we knew were elderly people, born there, who never went to the mainland. I sometimes played with the children of tourists who came to the island, but I never thought of <em>myself</em> as a tourist. Because they were pale and I was brown, most people assumed I was an islander.</p> <p>Most of my happiest memories of childhood are of the island: the peppery scent of the sand dunes; the glow worms at night under the fig trees; the strong scent of the rising tide and the seaweed on the beach; the seemingly perpetual sunshine. Because of its position in the Gulf Stream, Noirmoutier has a microclimate that makes it significantly warmer than the mainland. That\u2019s why my grandfather had bought the house: when my aunt Claudine was a child, she nearly died of pneumonia, and the doctor advised a change of climate \u2013 the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, which was unaffordable, or the then-almost-unknown island of Noirmoutier. He bought the house and rebuilt it in the hope that he might one day retire there; instead it became a holiday home for all our extended family. Even now, over 30 years after his death, I still think of the island with nostalgia and affection, although the house is gone and the place has changed considerably.</p> <p>The bridge connecting Noirmoutier to the mainland has made it a tourist destination, with a multitude of new holiday homes. These are rather more modern than my grandfather\u2019s cottage, but they all have the same whitewashed walls and red-tile roofs, and gardens filled with hollyhocks and passionflower, mimosa and tamarisks, Russian vines and fig trees. The roads are asphalt, rather than just sandy tracks, and tourism has brought a multitude of mainland conveniences and attractions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bb566bd93e38053209cfcd429daf549e12d9168f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb566bd93e38053209cfcd429daf549e12d9168f/857_0_4607_2766/1000.jpg\" alt=\"La Plage des Dames.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">La Plage des Dames.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the charm and spirit of the place remain; and so do the salt marshes, home to countless birds, and the forests of sea pines, and the long stretches of sandy beach below the belt of grassy dune. The pillboxes have tumbled even further down the beach, like something from Planet of the Apes. When my daughter was young, she used to climb to the top of the largest one and pretend it was a fort. And the beach at L\u2019Anse Rouge is still the same, with the rocks she and I both climbed as children. Maybe some day she will introduce the place to the next generation. I do hope so\u2026 Meanwhile, it remains my happy place, not lost in the past, but anchored there \u2013 just as the island itself is linked by the bridge \u2013 by some of my fondest memories.</p>",

Reporters at the Guardian and KHN are independently confirming each death by contacting family members, employers, medical examiners and others before publishing names and obituaries on our sites. More than a dozen journalists across two newsrooms \u2013 as well as student journalists \u2013 are involved in the project.&nbsp;</p> <p>This project aims to capture the human stories of compassion and heroism behind the statistics. None of the healthcare workers honored started 2020 knowing that simply showing up to work might expose them to a virus that would kill them.</p> <p>When the crisis hit, they met the challenge. They steeled themselves against the long hours. Emergency medical technicians raced to ambulances to help.

Try swapping out rice for other grains such as millet and buckwheat, or cook with wonderful and unique varieties, such as <em>carnaroli</em> or <em>vialone nano</em>, a starchy rice grown in Veneto and typically used to make the classic <em>risi e bisi</em>, a dish that\u2019s also a great way to revive leftover rice that has been cooled and stored safely in the fridge.</p> <h2><strong>Risi e bisi</strong></h2> <p>This dish is a celebration of both rice and peas. Traditionally, it is made with carnaroli or vialone nano, a flat rice that grows in Veneto, where the dish originated. But it also works well with other rice varieties, or as a way to upcycle cooked rice into a fabulous and comforting meal. Risi e bisi is best made at the beginning of the pea season, when fresh peas are available at their smallest and sweetest. The shelled pods make a remarkably floral and sweet stock that makes this dish truly sing.</p> <p>Serves <strong>2</strong></p> <p><strong>300g fresh peas in their pods<br>Veg scraps saved for stock<br>\u00bd onion</strong>, peeled and finely chopped \u2013 put the skin in the stock<br><strong>2 sprigs parsley</strong>, chopped<br><strong>Parmesan rind</strong> (optional)<br><strong>2 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and crushed<br><strong>2 tbsp olive oil<br>190g vialone nano</strong>, risotto or other rice (or 400g cooked rice)<br><strong>30g parmesan</strong>, plus extra for serving<br><strong>20g butter</strong></p> <p>Pod the peas, and put the empty pods in a stock pot with any other veg scraps, including the onion skin, a few herb stalks and the parmesan rind, if using. Cover with one litre of boiling water, simmer for 25 minutes, then strain.</p> <p>In a wide pan, gently saute half a chopped onion and the crushed garlic in the olive oil for five minutes. Stir in the vialone nano, add a ladle of hot stock and simmer, stirring regularly, adding more stock as necessary, for 15 minutes, or until the rice is cooked but firm and the consistency of loose risotto. (Or stir in 400g cooked rice, then add enough stock to create a loose consistency and bring to a boil, stirring vigorously to create a starchy texture.)</p> <p>Add the chopped parsley, podded peas, butter and grated parmesan, simmer for three minutes, then taste, adjust the seasoning and serve with extra parmesan.</p>",

Here\u2019s what we know about the movement, and how cities and states are responding.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>What does it mean to </strong><strong>\u2018defund the police\u2019</strong><strong>?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/american-police-violence-against-black-people\">US police have a history of violence against black people. Will it ever stop?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For years, community groups have advocated for defunding law enforcement \u2013 taking money away from police and prisons \u2013 and reinvesting those funds in services. The basic principle is that government budgets and \u201cpublic safety\u201d spending should prioritize housing, employment, community health, education and other vital programs, instead of police officers. Advocates argue that defunding is the best way forward since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why\">attempts to reform police practices</a> over the last five years have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/us-police-officers-fired-rehired-why\">failed</a>, as evidenced by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/american-police-violence-against-black-people\">brutal killing of George Floyd</a>. Groups have a range of demands, with some seeking modest reductions and others viewing full defunding as a step toward abolishing contemporary police services.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>How much does America currently spend on police?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>In the past four decades, the cost of policing in the US has tripled and is now $115bn, according to a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-04/america-s-policing-budget-has-nearly-tripled-to-115-billion\">recent analysis</a>. That steady increase comes as crime has been consistently declining. In most cities, spending on police is <a href=\"https://populardemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Freedom%20To%20Thrive%2C%20Higher%20Res%20Version.pdf\">significantly greater</a> than spending on services and other departments ($1.8bn on police in Los Angeles, for example, which is <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-04/lapd-budget-cuts-garcetti-protests-explainer\">more than half</a> the city\u2019s general fund). The Covid-19 economic crisis has led cities and states to make drastic budget <a href=\"https://www.changethenypd.org/nycbudgetjustice\">cuts</a> to education, youth programs, arts and culture, parks, libraries, housing services and more. But police budgets have grown or gone largely untouched \u2013 until pressure from protests this week.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>How are lawmakers addressing the calls to defund?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Almost overnight and in direct response to protests, some mayors and other elected leaders have reversed their position on police funding. The mayor of LA said he would look to cut as much as $150m from the police, just two days after he pushed forward a city budget that was increasing it by 7%. A New York councilman has called for a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYCCouncil38/status/1268685464472621059\">$1bn divestment</a> from the NYPD. In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HelenGymAtLarge/status/1268893914074775552?s=20\">Philadelphia</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElectRyanDorsey/status/1268909453988020224?s=20\">Baltimore</a>, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/06/04/dc-city-council-janeese-lewis-george-election/\">Washington DC</a>, <a href=\"https://sf.curbed.com/2020/6/5/21281670/sf-mayor-defund-police-black-community-sfpd\">San Francisco</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rvp7OgYQ40zWjyhl15TLouRMCFhZ_ApjuJ5m1HmBurk/edit\">other cities</a>, local policymakers have expressed support for some form of defunding or opposing police budget increases. Most radically, in Minneapolis, council members have discussed potentially <a href=\"http://www.citypages.com/news/minneapolis-city-council-members-consider-disbanding-the-police/570993291\">disbanding the embattled police department altogether</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2020/06/02/heels-george-floyd-killing-colleges-have-moral-imperative-not-work-local-police\">Colleges</a>, public school <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/minneapolis-public-school-end-police-contract\">systems</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/museums-police-divest-black-lives-matter-1202690076/\">museums</a> and other institutions are also divesting from police.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cabaafe5c6116b4d05bfec2ea7481c43b1ade87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cabaafe5c6116b4d05bfec2ea7481c43b1ade87/0_53_4873_2924/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman holds a placard reading \u2018Defund the Police\u2019 during a demonstration in Manhattan over the death of George Floyd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman holds a placard reading \u2018Defund the Police\u2019 during a demonstration in Manhattan over the death of George Floyd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maria Khrenova/TASS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>How do proposed cuts align with activists\u2019 demands?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>The change in direction is monumental, but the size of the proposed cuts is not, activists have said. In LA, Black Lives Matter has been pushing for a \u201c<a href=\"https://peoplesbudgetla.com/\">people\u2019s budget</a>\u201d that allocates just 5.7% of the general fund to law enforcement, instead of the 51% of the mayor\u2019s plan. More broadly, longstanding abolitionist groups, <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59ead8f9692ebee25b72f17f/t/5b65cd58758d46d34254f22c/1533398363539/CR_NoCops_reform_vs_abolition_CRside.pdf\">such as Critical Resistance</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mpd150.com/10-action-ideas-for-building-a-police-free-future/\">MPD 150</a>, argue that the cities should not be looking for minor savings and cuts, but should be fundamentally reducing the scale and size of the police force and dismantle the traditional law enforcement system. That <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why\">can start</a> with finding \u201cnon-police solutions to the problems poor people face\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.citypages.com/news/minneapolis-city-council-members-consider-disbanding-the-police/570993291\">such as</a> counselors responding to mental health calls and addiction experts responding to drug abuse.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/defund-the-police-us-george-floyd-budgets\">Movement to defund police gains 'unprecedented' support across US</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>If cities defund police, will violence and crime increase?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Abolition groups argue that policing and prison are at their core racist and harmful and make communities less safe. They also point out that the vast majority of police work has nothing to do with responding to or preventing violence, and that police have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2015/03/30/395069137/open-cases-why-one-third-of-murders-in-america-go-unresolved\">a terrible track record</a> of solving murders or handling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/10/sexual-assault-rape-kit-backlog-ignored-destroyed\">rape</a> and <a href=\"https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/public-safety/police-officers-who-commit-domestic-violence-often-get-to-keep-their-guns/\">domestic violence</a>.</p> <p>While there is no contemporary example of defunding in the US, there are studies suggesting that less policing could mean less crime. In 2014 and 2015, New York officers staged a \u201cslowdown\u201d to protest the mayor, arguing that if they did less police work, the city would be less safe. But <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/09/nyc-cops-did-a-work-stop-yet-crime-dropped/\">the opposite turned out to be true</a>. When the officers took a break from \u201cbroken windows policing\u201d, meaning targeting low-level offenses, there <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-proactive-policing-crime-20170925-story.html\">was a drop in crime</a>. Researchers posited that aggressive policing on the streets for petty matters can ultimately cause social disruption and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/09/nyc-cops-did-a-work-stop-yet-crime-dropped/\">lead to more crime</a>. Policing that <a href=\"https://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/the-high-cost-of-driving-while-poor/Content?oid=4269240\">punishes poverty</a>, such as hefty traffic tickets and debts, can also create conditions where crime is more likely. When New York ended \u201cstop and frisk\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/ending-new-yorks-stop-and-frisk-did-not-increase-crime\">crime did not rise</a>.</p> <h2><strong>How are police unions responding to defunding calls?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>America\u2019s powerful police unions have <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/melissasegura/police-unions-history-minneapolis-reform-george-floyd\">long resisted even minor reforms</a> and accountability measures, and are predictably arguing, without evidence, that <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.com/2020/06/05/lapd-police-union-blasts-mayor-garcettis-killers-comment-and-proposed-budget-cuts/\">budget cuts</a> at any scale will make cities less safe. They\u2019ve <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/defund-police-ridiculous-idea-joe-gamaldi\">cited</a> looting and property damage amid protests this week to suggest that cities don\u2019t have enough officers. Defunding advocates, however, have pointed out that the highly militarized response to peaceful demonstrations and the aggressive and at times violent ways officers are handling protesters has only provided further evidence that police cause harm (when there is no public safety threat in the first place).&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Are there examples of police defunding that US cities can follow?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>America\u2019s legacy of racism and severe gun violence epidemic make it difficult to compare to other countries. But <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/defund-police/612682/\">some have pointed out</a> that compared to peer nations, the US spends significantly less on social services and more on public safety programs, and has astronomically higher incarceration rates. These investments in police and prison, however, don\u2019t translate to a safer country. In fact, police in America <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/09/the-counted-police-killings-us-vs-other-countries\">kill more people in days</a> than many countries do in years.&nbsp;</p>",

  "<p>Cities across the US have enacted curfews in an attempt to quell the unrest over the killing of George Floyd in police custody. But the selective enforcement of the curfew orders only underscores the demonstrators\u2019 message about law enforcement abuses, civil liberties experts warn.</p> <p>The vague, broad language in these orders gives law enforcement leeway to pick and choose when to arrest someone for violating curfew, allowing for situations that are ripe for abuse, experts said. In some cities, this has worked in protesters\u2019 favor when police chose not to arrest them. But when police enforce an order in some cases and not others, the order becomes an arbitrary tool of control that often appears to violate protesters\u2019 constitutional rights to assembly and free speech.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/new-york-state-57-police-resign-to-support-officers-fired-for-shoving-75-year-old\">New York state: 57 police resign to support officers fired for shoving 75-year-old</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe amount of discretion and the ways these laws are written are perpetuating the same injustices that our communities are out there protesting right now,\u201d Shilpi&nbsp;Agarwal, a senior attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of northern California, told the Guardian.<strong> </strong>\u201cThe thing that has inspired these protests and triggered this pain in folks is this flagrant abuse of power by police.

But prior to the lifting of the curfew in Los Angeles county \u2013 and a lawsuit filed by the ACLU and Black Lives Matter Los Angeles \u2013 the sheriff had said that the curfew \u201cwill continue on a daily basis until the organized protests are gone\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that the curfews are being enacted in order to quell protest,\u201d the civil rights attorney Rachel Lederman told the Guardian.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A curfew is a\u00a0very drastic measure...

In 1996, the ninth circuit <a href=\"https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1379847.html\">ruled</a> that \u201cthe law is clear that first amendment activity may not be banned simply because prior similar activity led to or involved instances of violence\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBanning or postponing legitimate expressive activity because other first amendment activity regarding the same subject has resulted in violence deprives citizens of their right to demonstrate in a timely and effective fashion,\u201d the ruling reads.</p> <p>San Francisco lifted its curfew on Thursday, though not before arresting a number of protesters, many of whom set out to purposely <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DSA_SF/status/1267994837061521408?s=20\">defy it</a>. Lederman pointed out that before the 1992 curfew, the last one in San Francisco was in 1968, after Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated. But the city didn\u2019t impose a curfew following the mass outrage over the verdict in the killings of LGBTQ+ leader Harvey Milk and the mayor George Moscone, two white men, or when sports fans <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/giants/article/San-Francisco-gets-tough-on-Giants-rioters-3994746.php\">destroyed much of the city</a> and set a municipal bus on fire while celebrating the San Francisco Giants\u2019 2012 world series win. \u201cIt\u2019s targeted at black-led, anti-racist protests,\u201d Lederman said.</p> <p>What was particularly concerning, said Agarwal, was that many jurisdictions such as Palo Alto and San Mateo county had enacted a curfew but hadn\u2019t experienced any sort of vandalism or looting. \u201cCities across California were just leaping to enforce these very drastic measures based on what they were afraid might happen,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Agarwal said she was worried about the future implications of these curfews.</p> <p>\u201cA curfew is a&nbsp;very drastic measure that should be reserved for very extreme circumstances,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery citizen should be afraid of the precedent that this is setting.\u201d</p>"
