  "<p>Two-thirds of Britain\u2019s police forces caught people driving in excess of 100mph during the first three weeks of the coronavirus lockdown, new data has shown.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The extreme speeds were not confined to motorways, as drivers also took the drop in traffic as an invitation to break the law on urban roads, thus endangering&nbsp;lives, police said.</p> \n<p>The highest speed recorded was 163mph on the M1 in London, 93 miles over the speed limit, according to the Metropolitan police\u2019s lead on road safety, Det Supt Andy Cox. That driver was in a Porsche but Cox said offenders were spotted in all types of vehicles, from across all demographics, and in all speed zones.</p> \n<p>He urged drivers to think of the dangers to \u201cvulnerable road users\u201d during a period when people were being urged by Boris Johnson to avoid public transport and instead to walk or cycle to work.</p> \n<p>Police data obtained by the RAC through freedom of information requests revealed that the second highest speed recorded in early lockdown was 151mph on the M62 in West Yorkshire, and the third 140mph on the A14 in Suffolk.</p> \n<p>RAC&nbsp;road safety spokesman Simon Williams described the speeds as \u201ctruly shocking\u201d and warned that motorists travelling this fast have \u201cvirtually no time to react should anything unexpected happen\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He went on: \u201cSome drivers have taken advantage of quieter roads to speed excessively, putting the lives of others at risk at the worst possible time. It\u2019s encouraging that so many police forces have taken firm action even during the lockdown, which sends a strong message to other would-be offenders.\u201d</p> \n<p>Five other forces detected motorists driving at more than 130mph.</p> \n<p>Cox, the Met\u2019s lead for its Vision Zero initiative to eliminate deaths on the roads, said his team caught a driver doing 134mph in a 40mph zone in Enfield. Tracking cameras showed driving speeds in London were \u201cabove the limit on average in all categories from the first part of lockdown to early May\u201d, he added.</p> \n<p>Data for May showed a tenfold increase in the number of enforcements in the 20mph zone, with 530 drivers caught breaking the limit, compared with just 50 in 2019.</p> \n<p>There were more than double the number of offences in the 30mph zone, and a near eightfold increase in speeding in the 60mph zones. The figures relate to physical interventions by officers and do not include data from speed cameras.</p> \n<p>Local councils have also been concerned, warning that speed limits did not change with empty roads.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/wandbc/status/1259411618884132865\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The roads are quieter but the speed limit is still the same.

At least 4,400 arrests have been made, according to the Associated Press.</p> <p>The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, announced that there would be a curfew mandated for New York City Monday night 11pm until 5am Tuesday, and a doubling of policing.</p> <p>A man was killed in Louisville, Kentucky, after police and national guardsmen \u201creturned fire\u201d&nbsp;while dispersing a crowd. Democratic governor&nbsp;Andy Beshear&nbsp;said the incident would be investigated. In Indianapolis, two were reported dead, adding to deaths in Detroit and Minneapolis.</p> <p>Trump is facing widespread criticism for tweets starkly demanding \u201claw and order\u201d, threatening to unleash \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and blaming fringe leftwing groups for inciting violence.</p> <p>The president, also grappling with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> pandemic, did not appear in public on Sunday and was not scheduled to do so on Monday. There have been protests outside the White House for three days in a row. On Friday, Trump, his wife, Melania, and their son Barron were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/trump-flees-to-bunker-as-protests-over-george-floyd-rage-outside-white-house\">rushed to</a>&nbsp;a bunker previously used during terrorist attacks.</p> <p>On Sunday, after a peaceful daytime protest, police and national guardsmen faced supporters as an 11pm curfew approached, and then advanced firing teargas. Lights illuminating the White House were turned off, which typically only occurs<strong> </strong>when a president dies.</p> <p>Minneapolis had a largely quiet night after the police vigorously enforced an 8pm curfew, shutting all main highways through the city. A lot of side streets were shut off by makeshift barricades erected by residents seeking to protect their homes. The police blocked junctions.</p> <p>Only a small number of people appeared to defy the curfew, including a group of several hundred who maintained a vigil at the place where Floyd was held for nearly nine minutes with police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on his neck. The street is now a memorial filled with flowers.</p> <p>On Monday the family of George Floyd, 46, released the results of a private autopsy they arranged, which concluded that Floyd died by homicide caused by \u201casphyxiation by sustained force\u201d. They called for the third-degree murder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">charge</a> against former officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck, to be upgraded to a first-degree charge and for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-killing-three-officers-charges\">three other officers</a> involved to be arrested for \u201cthe part they played\u201d in the man\u2019s death.</p> <p>Last week preliminary results of the official autopsy, released by the county medical examiner, had found that Floyd\u2019s died because of the \u201ccombined effects of Mr. Floyd\u2019s being restrained by police, underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system\u201d.</p> <p>Elsewhere, though, violence returned. In Birmingham, Alabama, a Confederate statute was toppled. Protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails in Philadelphia and were hit with teargas in Austin, Texas. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalised.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama, offered advice to the protesters.</p> <p>\u201cIf, going forward, we can channel our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action, then this moment can be a real turning point in our nation\u2019s long journey to live up to our highest ideals,\u201d he wrote in a Medium post.</p>",

Quite simply, I expect the same respect from the minister. I will continue to consider my options.\u201d</p> <p>Richard Lochhead, Scotland\u2019s higher education minister, said the plan was \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d. \u201cIt is completely unnecessary and could add further damage to the sector, given that around 10% of current enrolments are from England,\u201d he said, and called on the UK government to work with the devolved administrations to find a solution.</p> <p>Last year 26,700 students from England enrolled at a Scottish higher education institution, accounting for 10% of total enrolments.

  "<p>Tens of thousands of new arrivals to the UK will be able to go food shopping, change accommodation and use public transport from airports during a 14-day quarantine imposed to prevent a second wave of coronavirus, under draft plans to be laid before parliament.</p> \n<p>The Guardian understands that about a fifth of people are expected to receive a spot-check to ensure that they are staying at the address or addresses they have provided to the authorities, but enforcement of the quarantine will be limited.</p> \n<p>The rules, still being finalised and due to be published on Tuesday before coming into effect next week, have prompted cross-party concerns about the potentially limited impact on public health&nbsp;amid warnings of the severe damage that could be caused to the travel and aviation industry.</p> \n<p>Priti Patel, the home secretary, announced on 22 May that nearly all international arrivals at UK ports, including airports, ferry ports and international rail terminals, must quarantine for 14 days from Monday 8 June. There are exemptions for health workers, scientists, lorry drivers and others.</p> \n<p>During the coronavirus travel quarantine&nbsp;period, people will be allowed to leave their given address to buy food \u2013 including for pets \u2013 or medicine or to fulfil a legal obligation, it is understood. Arrivals into the country will be able to provide more than one address where they will stay for the period, sources with knowledge of the draft plans told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>Around 20% of arrivals will receive a check call to make sure they are where they should be. However, according to draft rules, the police in England will not have power of entry. In theory, if they call on someone suspected of breaching the regulations, the person does not have to open the door. Fines of \u00a31,000 can be issued in England, although while the quarantine plan is UK-wide, enforcement is devolved.</p> \n<p>One source&nbsp;said: \u201cTo get caught, you will either&nbsp;have to be unlucky or stupid.\u201d</p> \n<p>A No 10 source stressed that going to the shops or changing address were allowed only if no alternative was possible, and would not be seen as the norm.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Exemptions to quarantine include escaping harm or to access victim services, similar to the list of reasonable&nbsp;excuses to leave home that were in force at the start of the general lockdown.</p> \n<p>On arrival at ports and airports, people will be told to go directly home or to the address where they are staying, but the draft&nbsp;rules allow them to use public transport to get there.</p> \n<p>The plans differ from some other countries, such as Greece, which designated quarantine hotels where new arrivals would stay, with food left outside their door and smoking rooms to avoid the need to go out.</p> \n<p>Sir David King, the&nbsp;former government chief scientific adviser, who has convened an unofficial version of the Sage science advice committee to offer alternative views on coronavirus, said he was concerned by the draft plans. \u201cIf we look at what\u2019s happened in other parts of Europe, and certainly in south-east Asia, the quarantine process has been much more rigorous than this,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a particular worry I have, that is too much discretion is being left to the individual. If the legal requirement, which for infectious diseases is set out in law, is not followed through, then it does spell difficulties. There\u2019s too much emphasis on individual discretion in making key decisions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Travel and tourism industry representatives have said the plans, which will be reviewed after three weeks, will cause significant economic harm. They have called for so-called air bridges, allowing quarantine-free travel to and from countries with low Covid-19 infection rates.</p> \n<p>Henry Smith, the Conservative MP for Crawley, who is heading a cross-party group of several dozen MPs opposing the plans, said the draft rules meant the quarantine proposals made even less sense. \u201cIt really feels like it will bring limited public health benefit for a lot of economic pain,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were already some absurdities to the idea, like backdoor routes, so you could fly to Dublin, go Dublin to London, and then not be checked.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ben Bradshaw, the Labour MP and former culture secretary, said the only quarantine plan that would bring benefits would be targeted at specific countries with high Covid-19 infection rates, such as Brazil. \u201cThere are no public health benefits of a blanket quarantine at this stage,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is simply a fig leaf to disguise Priti Patel\u2019s embarrassment at not having had a quarantine at the beginning of the outbreak, when one might have been justified.</p> \n<p>\u201cNot only is there no basis in science for this ridiculous policy, but it will unnecessarily cost thousands and thousands of jobs. The sooner the government scraps it, the better.\u201d</p> \n<p>While the MPs frustrated with the quarantine plans seem unlikely to force a vote, their numbers have grown sufficiently to seemingly prompt officials to indicate that the system could be revised very soon. Briefings from unnamed sources to some newspapers suggested some air bridges without quarantine could be introduced by the end of the month.</p> \n<p>Asked about the idea of air bridges, Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said on Monday: \u201cWe\u2019ve said it\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking at, and that remains the case.\u201d</p> \n<p>At the weekend, more than 200 travel and hospitality businesses joined a formal push against the quarantine plans. George Morgan-Grenville, chief executive of tour operator Red Savannah, who is leading the campaign, said: \u201cThis is not just a group of company bosses complaining, but employees from bottom to top calling for the quarantine plans to be quashed.

  "<p>A US activist arrested as part of a brutal crackdown in Cairo has filed a lawsuit against a former Egyptian prime minister who now lives in Washington DC, arguing he was targeted for assassination, arrest and torture.&nbsp;</p> <p>Mohamed Soltan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/30/egypt-frees-ohio-state-graduate-mohammed-soltan-hunger-strike\">was arrested following the violent dispersal of protest</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/30/egypt-frees-ohio-state-graduate-mohammed-soltan-hunger-strike\">ers in Cairo in 2013</a>.

As a serving president, Sisi\u2019s status grants him diplomatic immunity from legal proceedings, but Kamel and others risk being served should they visit the United States.&nbsp;</p> <p>The complaint includes a demand for a trial hearing, which would give Soltan the opportunity to face Beblawi in court. \u201cAs anxious as I am, I look forward to that day,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Beblawi is currently an executive director at the International Monetary Fund in Washington DC.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI want him to see my face,\u201d said Soltan. \u201cI\u2019m sure he knew who I was but I was just a name \u2013 I want him to look into my eyes as I ask him why, why he took on the role that he did, ordering torture, the attempted extrajudicial killing, and what sort of moral justification he has that he can live with this.\u201d</p> <p>The Torture Victim Protection Act&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cja.org/what-we-do/litigation/legal-strategy/torture-victim-protection-act/\">allows</a>&nbsp;non-US or US citizens to file suit against individuals from any foreign nation where there is clear evidence of their complicity in torture. It has been used successfully against victims of torture in Guatemala as well as the Palestinian Authority.</p> <p>Beblawi did not immediately respond to requests for comment lodged with Egypt\u2019s State Information Service and the IMF.</p> <p>Soltan\u2019s lawyer&nbsp;Eric L Lewis said: \u201cWe think in a court of law the story will be told, and it will be decided on facts rather than on the basis of propaganda.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe Egyptian regime relies on secrecy and things done in the cover of darkness in a torture cell \u2013 this is about getting all these issues out in sunlight.\u201d&nbsp;<br></p>",

One incident, and it could kick off.\u201d</p> <p>Aima, 18, who did not wish to give her last name, was one of the organisers of a protest in London on Sunday. She said: \u201cI started the #LDNBLM hashtag and it blew off. I didn\u2019t expect that to happen. What inspired me was how much pain I\u2019ve suffered while in the UK. I moved here from Nigeria when I was 10 and as soon as I came here I experienced a lot of discrimination from the police and from people around me. People need to understand in the UK, we\u2019re suffering too.\u201d</p> <p>The protest was not associated with the more established group Black Lives Matter UK. A spokesperson for the group said: \u201cAlthough we are supporting newly founded groups in their demonstrations, we are currently not calling protests due to the life-threatening reality of the pandemic, which is killing members of our communities at a rate far greater than their white counterparts. We are the first to work, first to die and now, first to fight.\u201d</p> <p>The Met has increased &nbsp;stop&nbsp;and searches by 50% in a year. In April 2019 Met officers carried out 20,981 stops. This April, with lockdown fully in place, 30,608 stops were carried out. The Met says one in five searches led to further action being taken</p> <p>Demonstrations follow recent high-profile stop and searches in the capital, including on an ambulance driver waiting for his friend in south London, which prompted Jovan Nepaul, the chair of Lewisham Deptford constituency Labour party, to write to the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, expressing his concern about \u201cthe disproportionate policing of black people in our area\u201d.</p> <p>Trey Campbell-Simon, the BAME officer for the Chelsea and Fulham Labour party, said he attended a rally on Sunday to show solidarity with victims of police violence in the US. \u201cI also attended because the British police are not innocent. There is a long history with the British police using excessive force with black people, you only have to look at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/26/man-accused-of-starting-2011-london-riots-mark-duggan\">killing of Mark Duggan</a> for one example,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Metropolitan police said: \u201cWe understand there are concerns across some communities that the use of the stop-and-search tactic during the Covid-19 lockdown has been deliberately aimed at certain groups. We would like to reassure communities that this is absolutely not the case.<br><br>\u201cHowever, our use of stop and search over recent weeks has increased as additional resources have been placed into proactive patrols to tackle crime and keep London safe during this challenging period.\u201d</p> <p>Protesters say the demonstrations go much further than a protest against policing operations during lockdown.</p> <p>Another organiser, who wished to remain anonymous, said there had been widespread anger over recent government failures that had affected the BAME population.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a whole load of people who have directly been affected by the unlawful murders and unjust treatment of our brothers and sisters worldwide, but it\u2019s also more than that. It\u2019s looking at things like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/16/grenfell-tower-price-britain-inequality-high-rise\">Grenfell</a>, it\u2019s looking at things like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/windrush-institutional-racism-hostile-environment\">Windrush </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/windrush-institutional-racism-hostile-environment\">scandal</a>,\u201d the 22-year-old said. \u201cWe are here to stay, we\u2019re not just a blip in the moment.\u201d</p> <p>Further protests are planned in London on Saturday and Sunday. A demonstration on Wednesday at Hyde Park aims \u201cto demand justice for George Floyd and a public inquiry here in Britain into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/19/bame-dying-coronavirus-sadiq-khan\">disproportionate BAME deaths during the Covid-19 crisis</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Weyman Bennett, the <a href=\"https://www.standuptoracism.org.uk/\">Stand Up To Racism</a> national co-convenor, said: \u201cIn the UK we\u2019ve seen a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/08/manchester-police-taser-man-with-child-iopc-stretford\">black man </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/08/manchester-police-taser-man-with-child-iopc-stretford\">Tasered in front of his child in Manchester</a> this month while Tory adviser Dominic Cummings gets away scot-free.\u201d</p> <p>Demonstrators last weekend also demanded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/12/uk-rail-worker-dies-coronavirus-spat-belly-mujinga\">justice for Belly Mujinga</a>, a 47-year-old railway ticket office worker who died after contracting Covid-19 after being spat at while on duty. The British&nbsp;Transport&nbsp;Police announced last week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/29/police-close-case-of-rail-workers-covid-19-death-after-spitting-incident\">no further action would be taken</a>.</p> <p>Edan, 17, who plans to attend the next wave of protests in London, said events over the past decade had awoken her generation to widespread inequalities in the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s forcing people to see we live completely different lives, even if we live in the same area and go to the same school. We are leading two completely different realities.\u201d</p> <p>The Met said there were 23 arrests at the demonstrations in London on Sunday. \u201cThe arrests were for a variety of offences including breaching the Covid-19 legislation, assault on an emergency worker, possession of an offensive weapon and breach of the peace. The ages of those arrested ranged from 17 to 30 years.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office said in a statement it had \u201cput in place measures to ensure that policing is subject to appropriate levels of transparency and accountability \u2013 with regular inspections of the way forces engage with communities, frequent publication of data on use of police powers and strengthening the police complaints system.</p> <p>\u201cIf an officer does commit a serious breach of the standards expected of them, disciplinary proceedings and, if appropriate, criminal proceedings should follow.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 2 June 2020. The organisation Stand Up To Racism has called for a day of action on Wednesday 3 June, but is not involved in the Hyde Park demonstration as an earlier version had said.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cI do not want to see him on a shirt just like the other guys.\u201d Those were the words of George Floyd\u2019s brother, Philonese, during a phone call last week with Joe Biden, the Democrats\u2019 presidential nominee.</p> \n<p>Every African American will have known instantly what he meant. Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Walter Scott and now Floyd: <a href=\"https://www.9news.com.au/world/deaths-in-police-custody-list-usa/d5ee217c-396f-4de8-a0a6-1719e278f354#close\" title=\"\">the litany of names of black men</a> who died as a result of encountering the wrong law officer at the wrong time continues to lengthen. Video footage, in the cases of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/04/i-cant-breathe-eric-garner-chokehold-death-video\" title=\"\">Garner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/video/a-closer-look-at-the-walter-scott-shooting-424905283706\" title=\"\">Scott</a>, revealed to the world the casual, unconscionable brutality with which their lives were taken from them. The shooting of 17-year-old Martin by a Florida community watch officer, and the decision of a jury to acquit his killer, led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\" title=\"\">the creation</a> of the Black Lives Matter movement. But last week it was still possible, in America, for a white police officer to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/trump-flees-to-bunker-as-protests-over-george-floyd-rage-outside-white-house\" title=\"\">kneel for nearly nine minutes</a> on an unarmed Floyd\u2019s windpipe \u2013 in broad daylight \u2013 crushing the breath and life out of him.</p> \n<p>The sheer scale of the protests over Floyd\u2019s killing \u2013 breaking curfews and defying national guard troops, over six days and across nearly 40 American cities \u2013 suggests that this death may prove a turning point. Attempts to dismiss those participating as merely lawless rioters, or out-of-state \u201canarchists\u201d, in the words of President Trump, wilfully misrepresent what has been a mass expression of revulsion and fury.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d14b7887-7d31-4026-9de8-038d512039f2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b2Mdnx1VxBg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Against the backdrop of a Covid-19 death toll of more than 100,000, a defining and dangerous moment for America now looms. Long before Mr Floyd\u2019s death, Covid-19, which disproportionately affects the less well-off, had brutally exposed the racial fault line still running through the social landscape of the US. The pandemic, chaotically mishandled by Mr Trump, has killed African Americans at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/us-coronavirus-death-toll-racial-disparity-inequality\" title=\"\">almost three times the rate</a> of white Americans. The economic devastation wrought by the disease has pushed the unemployment rate <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-31/great-depression-like-jobless-rate-seen-for-u-s-eco-week-ahead?sref=ihi5JR1z\" title=\"\">close to 20%</a>, on a par with the Great Depression. Again, the fallout has disproportionately affected African Americans.</p> \n<p>It is the United States\u2019 great misfortune at such a time to be led by a president who sows division as a matter of political strategy. Bunkered down, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/first-thing-with-america-ablaze-trump-retreated-to-the-bunker\" title=\"\">now literally</a>, in the White House, the president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\" title=\"\">tweeted</a> last week: \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d The words echoed those of a notorious <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/05/29/when-the-looting-starts-the-shooting-starts-trump-walter-headley/\" title=\"\">Miami police chief</a> during racial unrest in 1967. They were unworthy of a politician holding any office, let alone that of the presidency. From his defence of far-right marchers in Charlottesville to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/22/donald-trump-nfl-national-anthem-protests\" title=\"\">abuse</a> of black football players who refuse to stand for the national anthem, Mr Trump has exacerbated racial division and exploited it to shore up his white voter base. Between now and November, there is a danger the president will attempt to act on the authoritarian undertones of his <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/the-inaugural-address/\" title=\"\">inauguration speech</a> in 2017, when he talked of stamping out \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d in the country\u2019s inner cities.</p> \n<p>Americans must hope that the protesters of recent days do not respond in kind to any such provocations. The Atlanta rapper Killer Mike has urged those marching across the US to take on prosecutors, mayoral offices, police chiefs and deputy chiefs in the voting booth, and to challenge those local structures of judicial and civic power, where systemic racism still thrives. A new generation of politicians, informed by the culture and insights of movements such as Black Lives Matter, will be required to follow through successfully on such a strategy. They may find allies in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIY8L0FLcYA\" title=\"\">police officers</a> such as those in New Jersey who have marched with protesters, or the police chief in Atlanta who condemned the use of Tasers by her officers and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCST6gaqHEk\" title=\"\">went out into the street</a> to listen to demonstrators. But they will need to access the levers of power themselves; for America they cannot come of age soon enough.</p>",

When it was put to him that some contact tracers have said they have had nothing to do, Hancock said that was a good thing.

But the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, says<a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2020/may/speaker-agrees-to-recall-of-parliament/\"> it is not safe to return to the old system of voting, involving large numbers of MPs crowding into the division lobbies.</a> Instead Rees-Mogg will ask MPs tomorrow to agree to a new system of voting, reportedly one that would involve MPs having to form an enormous queue all around parliament so that they can vote in person while observing social distancing.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/thehouse/article/the-virtual-parliament-is-no-longer-necessary-we-can-do-so-much-better\">an article for the House magazine </a>Rees-Mogg explains why he thinks it is so important for MPs to return to the Commons in person. Here\u2019s an excerpt.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It comes down to the quality of communication between MPs and ministers. Politics is better done face-to-face, even if the whites of the ministerial eyes are six feet away. In the chamber frontbenchers will have to keep on their toes as interventions are once again made possible. This exceptional aspect of British democracy, curtailed under the hybrid halfway house, can once again flourish.</p> <p>Out of the chamber, too, MPs will be able to come together - at the right social distance - to represent shared problems faced by those in multiple constituencies.

He explains: <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As state primary schools in England open today, so too do their independent counterparts, often known as prep schools. Christopher King, the chief executive of the <strong>I</strong><strong>ndependent Association of Prep Schools</strong>, says almost all of the 550 prep schools in England belonging to IAPS have opened to year 6 pupils this morning. Those with nurseries or \u201cpre-prep\u201d are also opening to reception and year 1 age groups, with what King calls a mixture of enthusiasm and apprehension.</p> <p>\u2018The vast majority of prep schools in England are open today, apart from a few that are opening tomorrow. They are enthusiastic about reopening, but for staff and parents there is a degree of apprehension particularly because of the younger year groups and the difficulty in social distancing,\u2019 King said.</p> <p>Like state schools, prep schools remained open for the children of key workers and to provide remote learning for the rest of their pupils. Initial reports of unhappy parents saw many private schools cut their fees by 10%-20% for this term.</p> <p>The situation is different in secondary schools, where neither state nor independent senior schools are reopening for the rest of the school year in England, other than for brief visits by year 10 and year 12 pupils from 15 June.

These are people who, for the last 10 weeks, have been told to stay in their homes 24/7, without any break for exercise or fresh air. </p> <p>This marks a remarkable U-turn from ministers. Previous guidance advised that people with serious underlying health conditions, such as lung disease or low immunity, would need to shield until the <a href=\"https://shropshireccg.nhs.uk/health-advice/coronavirus-advice/shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-groups/\">end of June</a>.

The latest update \u2013 announced via tweets at 10pm on a Saturday night and trailed in the press \u2013 was like moving the goalposts on the quiet. Rather than hearing it first from a government briefing or from their doctor, shielders had to find out about the change on social media. </p> <p>When I spoke to people affected, the reaction was one of confusion, anxiety, and anger.

But at a press conference last week <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-press-conference-statement-on-the-five-tests-28-may-2020\">Boris Johnson claimed that all five tests were being achieved.</a></p> <p>The five tests were originally set out by Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-uk-live-news-covid-19-lockdown-extension?page=with:block-5e988f548f08cf571cdb2645#block-5e988f548f08cf571cdb2645\">at a press conference in April</a> (when Johnson was ill). Here they are, with the rival assessments for each test from Johnson in his speech last week and from the ADPH yesterday <a href=\"https://www.adph.org.uk/2020/05/adph-presidential-blog-a-time-for-steady-leadership-careful-preparation-and-measured-steps/\">in its statement.</a></p> <p>The PM says all five tests have been passed. The ADPH accepts that the first test has been met, but on the other four it says it is too soon to be sure.</p> <p><strong><em>1 - NHS\u2019s ability to cope must be protected</em></strong></p> <p>What PM says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the start of the outbreak, there was significant concern that the NHS would not be able to cope. That turned out not to be the case, thanks to the heroic efforts of everyone who works in the NHS. And the heroic efforts of the British people to contain this virus. </p> <p>The data show that on 26 May, 475 people were admitted to hospital in England with coronavirus - down from a peak of 3,121 on a single day, on 2 April.</p> <p>On 27 May, 11% of mechanical ventilator beds in the UK were occupied by patients with coronavirus, down from a peak of 41% on 10 April.</p> </blockquote> <p>What ADPH says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Firstly, the pressure on the NHS \u2013 and those that tirelessly and expertly work within it \u2013 has been significant but it has been able to cope with those who unfortunately need hospital treatment for the effects of Covid-19. The number of people in hospitals with Covid-19 is falling, and beds are available for those that require them.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>2 - Sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates</em></strong></p> <p>What PM says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As measured by a seven-day rolling average, the UK daily death rate now stands at 256, down from a peak of 943 on 14 April.</p> <p>While every death is one too many, it is now the case that there has been a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rate, and so the second test is being met.</p> </blockquote> <p>What ADPH says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Secondly, there must be a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rate. While the first peak in deaths has passed, the downward trend is slow \u2013 particularly in care settings. Deaths are a measure of what happened roughly two weeks before \u2013 the effect of easing measures now will only become evident in two weeks.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>3 - Rate of infection decreasing to manageable levels</em></strong></p> <p>What PM says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And in the last seven days, an average of 2,312 new cases were confirmed with a positive test, that\u2019s down from a peak of 5,066 in the first week of May.</p> <p>Based on the various data available, the government is satisfied that the third test is being met.</p> </blockquote> <p>What ADPH says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The critical debate is about the third test \u2013 ensuring the rate of transmission of the infection continues decreasing to manageable levels (taken to mean R being well below 1). The rapid and multiple ways in which measures are being eased is likely to make it difficult to judge the cumulative impact on R. As we saw in March, R can go above 1 in a very short space of time \u2013 and once it does it can take many months to bring it back down. The room for manoeuvre is tight.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>4 - Testing capacity and PPE supply at adequate levels</em></strong></p> <p>What PM says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yesterday we carried out 119,587 tests, compared to around 12,000 at the start of April. Testing capacity has now increased to 161,214 a day.</p> <p>We have now signed over 100 new deals with PPE suppliers around the world. Here in the UK, thanks to the efforts of Lord Deighton and his team and the brilliance of domestic manufacturers we have signed contracts for over two billion items of PPE, including face masks, visors, gowns and aprons.</p> </blockquote> <p>What ADPH says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The fourth aspect, ensuring supply of tests and PPE is able meet future demand, remains an enormous challenge. PPE manufacturing and supply chains are stronger, but shortages are still being reported and it is not clear that supply can meet new demand as different parts of society, public services and the economy open. While testing capacity has undoubtedly increased, we are not yet confident that the current testing regime is sufficiently effective in getting the priority tests done and the results to where they are needed to enable swift action.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>5 - No risk of a second peak that would overwhelm NHS</em></strong></p> <p>What PM says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This package has been carefully designed so that we can ease the burdens of lockdown while expecting to keep that R below one. I cannot and will not throw away all the gains we have made together, and so the changes we are making are limited and cautious.</p> </blockquote> <p>What ADPH says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Finally, the fifth test. A second peak cannot be ruled out \u2013 whether it will overwhelm the NHS is an important question to ask. But perhaps the even bigger one is, do we really want the same number of deaths again? The scale to date represents an unimaginable tragedy and we must do everything possible to limit further loss of life.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T09:08:58.006Z\">at 10.08am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed4b8aa8f08f5e3730122cc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/andrewsparrow\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T08:25:11.227Z\">9.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning.

Here is an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Directors of Public Health are increasingly concerned that the government is misjudging this balancing act and lifting too many restrictions, too quickly. </p> <p>This is a new disease; evidence is still emerging and there is much uncertainty. However, based on what is currently known, several leading scientists and public health experts have spoken out about a string of recent national policy announcements affecting England which project a degree of confidence that many \u2013 including ADPH members \u2013 do not think is supported by the science.</p> <p>Over the weekend we have seen signs that the public is no longer keeping as strictly to social distancing as it was \u2013 along with this, we are concerned that the resolve on personal hygiene measures, and the need to immediately self-isolate, if symptomatic, is waning. A relentless effort to regain and rebuild public confidence and trust following recent events is essential.</p> </blockquote> <p>De Gruchy expanded on this in an interview on the Today programme this morning. She said local directors of public health could only be effective if other parts of the anti-coronavirus programme were working too. She went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So we need testing, the national testing programme, to be absolutely robust and ready, and we need the NHS test and trace to be robust and ready. And of course the other issue ... is about PPE and the supply of PPE. So all of those organisational challenges that we are all working really hard getting in place - we\u2019re not feeling, just yet, that we are really confident enough to meet any potential challenge if the government goes too quickly on easing lockdown measures.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T08:37:02.406Z\">at 9.37am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed4b1498f084df971c8d53a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T07:44:28.682Z\">8.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More than 200 travel and hospitality businesses have joined a campaign urging the government to overturn its planned 14-day quarantine for arrivals into the UK, PA Media reports.</p> <p>The group of major hotels, travel companies and restaurateurs claim the policy is \u201cunworkable\u201d and are calling for air bridges to be created which enable people to travel - without being quarantined - between countries where the risk of being infected by coronavirus is deemed to be low.</p> <p>George Morgan-Grenville, the chief executive of tour operator Red Savannah, who is leading the campaign, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is not just a group of company bosses complaining, but employees from bottom to top calling for the quarantine plans to be quashed.</p> <p>The extent of their pain is deeply worrying for our economy and our country.</p> </blockquote> <p>More than 200 businesses have signed the letter to the home secretory, Priti Patel. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T07:51:00.035Z\">at 8.51am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed4aade8f08f5e37301227a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T07:21:09.052Z\">8.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Guardian\u2019s Today in Focus podcast is exploring the coronavirus crisis in Britain\u2019s prisons.</p> <p>When Britain went into lockdown in March, most people were confined to their homes with little more than a short daily walk allowed.

  "<p>For many families across England, Monday marked a momentous occasion \u2013 the first time they had been reunited with children, grandchildren and other loved ones after 10 weeks of the coronavirus lockdown.</p> <p>Among those rejoicing as government rules were eased to allow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/groups-up-to-six-people-allowed-meet-england-monday-coronavirus-lockdown-easing\">up to six people to meet outdoors</a>, including in gardens, were Barbara Seymour and her family in West Bridgford, Nottingham.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to cry until after,\u201d insisted Seymour, 67, preparing a feast of salmon, roast chicken and caramelised potatoes before seeing her daughter and son-in-law Jenny and Eoian Matthews and two young grandchildren, who live in nearby Lady Bay, for the first time since March.</p> <p>Usually, Seymour and her husband, Vince Davies, 66, would look after May, seven, and Ailbe, five, about four times a week and \u201cspoil them rotten\u201d, but since the strict nationwide rules were imposed, they have only seen them briefly and from a distance.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a good life myself but not seeing my grandchildren has been enormous,\u201d said Seymour. \u201cIt\u2019s the best part of my life, having grandchildren.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"297ea83d6904bde461c94a7aadb39917f4856f2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/297ea83d6904bde461c94a7aadb39917f4856f2e/0_180_5918_3548/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nottingham lockdown family reunion\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>On Monday, although chairs were spaced 2 metres apart and her family could only pop in the house to use the bathroom, the family caught up over drinks and food in the sunshine. The Amazon Alexa was expected to come out later for \u201cboogie music\u201d.</p> <p>Although the evening was a \u201cmassive\u201d event for both Seymour and her adult family members, the focus was to make it as normal as possible for May and Ailbe. \u201cI want them to just think they\u2019re back in the garden again,\u201d said Seymour.</p> <p>The couple moved to Nottingham five years ago to be near Seymour\u2019s daughter Jenny, and when they moved into their current home, their grandchildren helped to plant the flowers in the back garden.</p> <p>On top of a treasure hunt \u2013&nbsp;finding pretty mismatching earrings in the garden \u2013 May and Ailbe helped to plant some winter cabbages with Seymour, whom they call Nana, and Davies, known as Grandpops.</p> <p>\u201cNot to be patronising to Mum, but I was a bit worried that she was really excited for this and the kids wouldn\u2019t be that bothered. But they have been. Earlier on Ailbe was saying: \u2018We\u2019re going to Grandma\u2019s!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Seymour said her work \u2013&nbsp;running a company that provides training in the health and social care sector, including care homes, with Davies \u2013&nbsp;meant the threat of the virus \u201cwas always in the back of our minds\u201d.</p> <p>The family have also decided to stick to their own more stringent rules, such as drawing up a diary of which friends they have seen, since losing faith in the government\u2019s ability to advise the public after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/26/the-guardian-view-on-the-cummings-crisis-a-social-contract-ripped-up\">Dominic Cummings affair</a>.</p> <p>Like others, they will still have to wait for a full family reunion. Seymour\u2019s two adult sons, who live in London and Dubai, were not available for a Zoom chat during the dinner and she admitted it would \u201cbe a long time before we see them\u201d.</p> <p>In normal circumstances, the whole family would be involved in preparing meals too. \u201cWe have fun together, we like being together. Today will be half of what we normally do,\u201d said Seymour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>While the hug that she is desperate to give her daughter is also off limits for the time being, the family have also written a get out clause for children into their rules.</p> <p>Seymour said: \u201cIf they come near me I\u2019m not going to tell them to back off because I think it would do them so much more damage.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s difficult for the BHA to consult with the stalls handlers, because they don\u2019t have a specific representative body. But the BHA assures me it met and engaged with employers of the handlers (Racetech and ARC), as well as with its own starters in formulating the protocols, which include disinfecting of equipment.

But it\u2019s tens of millions of pounds of lost attendance income across the industry. Say your ticket is \u00a330 and you have 30,000 tickets, it starts to get extremely expensive and it will take racecourses some time to recover, at least until the backend of next year. <br><br>\u201cI think there will be a reshaping of the industry, but I\u2019m not quite sure exactly how that\u2019s going to play out. In our case, at least until September we\u2019re not racing at Brighton and Worcester and it could be that we narrow even further the tracks that will race this year.

Speak Of The Devil, meanwhile, walked out of the stalls and was free at the back of a slowly run race before quickening through traffic to nick second. It looked more like an exercise gallop than a race for her and hopefully she can improve for it. Drying ground might not be in her favour, however, as she\u2019s a half-sister to that noted mudlover Morando. I\u2019ve seen the going described as soft but I expect it\u2019ll have dried out to good by the time of the Classics. <strong>Ellerslie Lace</strong> doesn\u2019t look good enough to win but she might nick a place at 50-1.

Ordinarily, they\u2019d be at Longchamp but the Parisian tracks have been closed for the time being because Covid-19 remains too much of a problem in the area, so French racing is focused on the Normandy coast. <br> It may make a difference because Deauville\u2019s mile is straight, whereas the trials have been run on turning tracks and often at a false pace. Today\u2019s Poule d\u2019Essai Des Poulains ought to be run at a stronger clip, because of the status of the race and also because there are no fewer than three runners who made all the running last time. Each of them was gifted a soft lead, which surely won\u2019t happen today; will they fight for the lead? I think the circumstances give a chance to <strong>Kenway (2.50pm BST)</strong>, a 25-1 shot. You\u2019d think he\u2019d be exposed after nine runs and he was well held by some of these at Longchamp in October but that came at the end of a busy year for him and the closing surge he produced to win a Group Three the previous month was deeply impressive. <br> He got a lot closer to the likes of Victor Ludorum three weeks ago, when he again finished well after being held up out the back in a steadily run race. He comes from the yard of Frederic Rossi, who isn\u2019t well known in Britain but currently tops the trainers table in France. \u201cI\u2019m delighted with the move to a straight track and I think the rhythm of the race will help him,\u201d Rossi has told today\u2019s Post. At 33-1 or bigger, I\u2019d also be interested in <strong>Reshabar</strong>, who has achieved least of today\u2019s field in pure form terms but looks very progressive and unexposed. He\u2019s trained in Germany by Markus Munch, who appears to be a version of Clive Brittain in that he\u2019s happy to turn up in big races with outsiders. Munch\u2019s 50-1 shot Spectre was fourth of 16 in the Queen Anne three years ago. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed4f2408f084df971c8d7fe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T12:24:17.636Z\">1.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>There\u2019s some runners from Newmarket in the next race and one thing to consider is that they will have had to travel that 245-mile trip this morning.

Mark Johnston was telling me on Twitter recently that he likes his horses to be at the track at least four hours before they run.

But what is the best tactic to pick a route through the bear-traps as horses, jockeys and trainers try to pick up the threads of the Flat season after nearly three months off? <br><br>Punters have latched on to the tried-and-tested \u201cfirst run for Mick Appleby\u201d system in the opener, which has shown an 18% profit on turnover since the start of 2017 with 30 winners. These include the likes of Merryweather, who won her first start for Appleby in December at 22-1 just a few weeks after leaving Ralph Beckett\u2019s yard as a twice-raced maiden, and has since added two more wins and run well in a Listed race at Deauville, with other winners on debut for the yard at 16-1, 14-1 and 10-1 twice. <br><br>Appleby suggests in this morning\u2019s Racing Post that <strong>Stone Mason</strong> (1.00), a recruit from Roger Charlton\u2019s stable, might need the run, so while many punters are happy to take 6-4 about the four-year-old, there are probably more appealing bets elsewhere and <strong>Ice Pyramid</strong> (5.05) could be the pick of the card. <br><br>Philip Kirby\u2019s gelding put up a career-best to win over track-and-trip in February, travelling smoothly and winning with something to spare in a very good time. He is up another 7lb in the weights but is certainly up to bridging the gap if he is anywhere close to his best and a current price of 7-2 looks generous. <br><br><strong>Little Red Socks </strong>(2.10) knew her job when making a winning debut for Karl Burke in March and has decent prospects of following up at around 7-2, while a step back up to six furlongs could be just what <strong>Heath Charnock </strong>(3.20) needs a couple of races later. <br><br>Simon and Ed Crisford, British racing\u2019s first officially licensed training partnership, will be keen to hit the ground running with <strong>Rock Of Diamonds </strong>(3.55), while Newcastle specialist <strong>Be Proud </strong>(4.30), a dual winner over course-and-distance, is the solid option at around 100-30 in the five-furlong handicap. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed4e80a8f087122eca534c1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T11:36:31.733Z\">12.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Greg Wood has ploughed through the form to bring you tips for today\u2019s resumption card at Newcastle.

There would still have to be at least one steward at the track to make decisions on things like whether it\u2019s safe to race if something goes wrong, so, on a day like this, with just one card, it wouldn\u2019t make much difference. But we have two cards or more per day from tomorrow and a central panel could have ruled over all of it. Evidently, the BHA have decided that these circumstances bring enough challenges without trialling remote stewards.

There is so much to say here \u2013 some of it complicated, much of it all too clear.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cOr, you know, you could just go on TV, open up your mouth, and let this shit fall out,\u201d he said before playing a clip of Fox News host and \u201chuman boat shoe\u201d Tucker Carlson.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-nEHkgm_Gk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l-nEHkgm_Gk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cRioting is the one thing you don\u2019t want,\u201d Carlson said on his show over footage from violent clashes between police and protesters in Minneapolis. Carlson compared the violent protests with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/central-park-new-york-white-woman-black-birdwatcher\">now-infamous&nbsp;incident&nbsp;</a>in Central Park last week in which a white woman called the cops on a black birdwatcher, who asked her to leash her dog, and feigned hysteria to gain a swift police response. \u201cUgly opinions, police brutality, officious birdwatchers, rude and entitled ladies walking their dogs in big-city parks \u2013 all of that is bad. But none of it is nearly as bad as what you just saw,\u201d Carlson said.</p> <p>\u201cOK, first: fuck you, Tucker,\u201d Oliver responded. \u201cThat\u2019s just a general point. Second, saying \u2018officious birdwatcher\u2019 is deeply offensive \u2013 because you\u2019re either trying to both-sides that Central Park incident or insulting fans of this show, who proudly call themselves \u2018officious birdwatchers\u2019. I am the \u2018officious bird\u2019; they are the \u2018watchers.\u2019 Keep their name out of your mouth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople like Tucker love to venerate order at moments like this, and that\u2019s easy to do when order in its current form is designed to benefit and protect you,\u201d Oliver continued. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to overstate how clearly we\u2019ve been reminded lately of the hostility of our existing order toward black people who\u2019ve been killed by police on the street [George Floyd], killed by police in their own home [emergency room technician Breonna Taylor, who was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">killed&nbsp;by police</a> on 13 March in Louisville], \u201ckilled by wannabe police in the street [Ahmaud Arbery, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia\">shot and&nbsp;killed&nbsp;</a>while jogging in February by two white men in Georgia], and threatened with state violence while literally birding [Christian Cooper, the birdwatcher in Central Park]. \u201cCollectively, that has just got to be some brutality bingo right there.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/18/john-oliver-sports-coronavirus-return\">'It's just not possible right now': John Oliver on bringing back sports safely</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAnd when \u2018order\u2019 results in you lying face-down on a lawn while your grandma stands between you and the police who have pulled their guns on you after you allegedly just rolled a stop sign,\u201d he continued, in reference to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbs7.com/content/news/Arrest-affidavit-details-controversial-incident-between-black-man-and-Midland-police-570679501.html\">Tye Anders</a>, a 21-year-old Texan arrested in a terrifying ordeal with police in May. \u201cI can see why being lectured on the importance of \u2018order\u2019 at the expense of all else is just not what you want to fucking hear right now!\u201d</p> <p>And the president, Oliver noted, is baiting \u2013 the host pointed to his tweet from the weekend (which Twitter sanctioned for \u201cglorifying violence\u201d) in which he called the protesters \u201cthugs\u201d and said \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d \u201cWhen a man like Donald Trump uses the word \u2018thugs\u2019, you know exactly what it\u2019s code for,\u201d said Oliver. \u201c\u2018When the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u2019 is actually a quote from a notoriously racist 1960s Miami police chief. And it is truly astounding how Donald Trump has managed to live 74 years with a remedial understanding of spelling, grammar, geography, science, civics nutrition and child development, and yet he\u2019s the fucking Library of Alexandria when it comes to racist maxims of the 20th century.\u201d</p> <p>Oliver\u2019s main segment concerned the less explosive but extremely important issue of mail-in voting \u2013 the same issue which garnered Trump\u2019s other Twitter censure last week, for his erroneous claim that it\u2019s \u201csubstantially fraudulent\u201d. Mail-in voting is actually common in many states with both Republican and Democratic-leaning governments, \u201cand if this pandemic continues into the fall, as it most certainly will, many voters will want to do exactly that\u201d, said Oliver. \u201cBecause think about it: holding an in-person election during a pandemic is an absolute nightmare.</p> <p>\u201cThe question isn\u2019t \u2018should we have voting by mail\u2019 at all, because we already do,\u201d Oliver explained. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018how hard should we make it?\u2019\u201d That question depends on where you live \u2013 some states have significant restrictions on mail-in voting, such as Alabama, which requires mail-in ballots to include a photocopy of one\u2019s state ID and a notary signed by two witnesses. Voter fraud is thus a crime that is \u201cdifficult, high-risk and low reward\u201d, said Oliver. \u201cIt\u2019s as if at the end of Ocean\u2019s Eight, we learned that Sandra Bullock had gone to all the trouble of breaking into the Met Gala to steal a map of state\u2019s quarters.\u201d</p> <p>And while advocates argue that it will reduce obstacles to civic participation, \u201cthat in and of itself may be why it\u2019s become so controversial\u201d, Oliver said. \u201cConservative opponents often speculate that any increased participation would benefit Democrats despite the fact that researchers have consistently found that hasn\u2019t obviously helped one party or the other.\u201d</p> <p>The attempts to discredit mail-in voting during a pandemic is why \u201cnow is absolutely the time to talk about this,\u201d Oliver concluded. \u201cYou cannot prepare for an election the same way you update your computer\u2019s software, by just putting it off for months on end and secretly hoping that maybe you\u2019ll be dead before you actually have to deal with it. We need to get this right, now.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>How to use Spotify: hit play, ensure ears are on. Right? Actually, not quite. There\u2019s a much deeper audio experience to be had if you take advantage of the platform\u2019s impressive functionality across its mobile and desktop versions. From turning Spotify into an alarm clock to creating communal playlists with friends, not to mention using it to learn Korean, it\u2019s worth looking into the full range of its features. Read on for our list of the best tips and tricks to make the most of Spotify. Although, yes: you will need your ears on.</p> <p><strong>Get a super-specific song-based mood<br></strong>Wish you could listen to your fave tune for hours on end without getting bored? Spotify Radio can help with that. Find the song on Spotify, select the three dots next to it and choose the Radio option. It\u2019ll then play you an endless, curated list of similar music. You can use the same trick for artists, albums or playlists as well, and listen to music ad-free with Spotify Premium.</p> <p><strong>Plunge into Spotify\u2019s vastness<br></strong>Spotify\u2019s selection of music is humungous \u2013 there\u2019s a huge range of albums from artists around the world. But the platform does a lot more than music \u2013 there are shedloads of podcasts, featuring almost any regular fave you can think of and plenty you can\u2019t, from wellness to comedy to true crime. It even offers language lessons. Just search Language Superstar for a series of tutorials on Korean, Norwegian, Czech and more.</p> <p><strong>Have a personal experience<br></strong>Spotify uses your listening history to develop highly personalised recommendations. Head to Made For You (under Home on mobile or under Your Library on desktop) and you\u2019ll find Release Radar \u2013 it updates every Friday with personalised highlights from the week\u2019s new releases. There\u2019s also Discover Weekly, which updates every Monday with tailored song recommendations, and Daily Mix \u2013 based on frequently listened-to genres, which blends your regular choices with Spotify suggestions. You can make all of these playlists more accurate by liking songs you enjoy \u2013 which in itself creates a Liked Songs playlist.</p> <p><strong>Entertain the little \u2019uns<br></strong>There\u2019s a specific Spotify app for children: Spotify Kids. If you sign up for a Spotify Premium Family account you can download it from the iOS App Store or Google Play. Each child can create their own account, with fun avatars and colour themes, then listen to family-friendly tunes, plus specific playlists tailored to different age groups. Also, the music on Spotify Kids is carefully selected, with explicit music filtered out. That means kids are free to explore music, while you enjoy peace of mind.</p> <p><strong>Take control of your listening<br></strong>Spotify is full of cool features for customising your listening experience. Premium users can listen to their favourite music without ad breaks, to make it feel more like a music library than a digital radio service.</p> <p>You can also change the audio quality of tracks to compensate for the strength of your connection. Select Music Quality under Settings (on the desktop app, click the down arrow on the top right of the screen and for mobile, tap home and then the gear cog on the top right of the screen). Alternatively, Premium subscribers can download tracks to listen to offline, should you be about to subject yourself to train journey-esque levels of poor reception.</p> <p><strong>Make songs blend seamlessly<br></strong>Hate that awkward gap between tunes on your party dance floor? Go to your settings menu (see \u201cTake control of your listening\u201d above), on desktop select Advanced Settings or on mobile, tap Playback. You can set tracks to crossfade into each other \u2013 with a slider letting you select how long the mix is. There\u2019s also an Automix setting. Who needs a DJ, eh?</p> <p><strong>Use Spotify to fall asleep/wake up to<br></strong>Want to drift off to the soothing sounds of your fave playlist? Set Spotify to turn off after a certain length of time by selecting the three dots next to the song that\u2019s playing. Just scroll down to the bottom of the menu that pops up and click where it says Sleep Timer to select how long until it stops.</p> <p>You can also use Spotify as an alarm \u2013 although only if you have an Android phone. Set a Google clock on your phone, then click where it says: Default Sound and you can change the alarm sound. Click the Spotify icon in the resulting window and you can pick a playlist to wake up to.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/premium-listening/2020/may/27/bluetooth-or-wifi-a-jargon-free-guide-to-connecting-your-audio-to-your-smart-devices\">Bluetooth or wifi? A jargon-free guide to connecting your audio to your smart devices</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Listen with others<br></strong>Spotify\u2019s at its best when used socially. You can follow your friends to see what they\u2019re listening to \u2013 as well as other artists to get updates on their releases. To follow artists, just click on their name and select Follow. For friends, you\u2019ll need to connect your account to Facebook.</p> <p>You can also use Spotify\u2019s Collaborative Playlist function to create a shared listening experience with a pal \u2013 just click/tap on the three dots next to a playlist you\u2019ve already created and select Make Collaborative (mobile) or Collaborative Playlist (desktop). Then you can both add tracks.</p> <p><strong>Get social<br></strong>Want the world to know about your love of the new Lewis Capaldi album? Select the three dots next to any music you like and you can share it on social media. The interface with Instagram is particularly impressive. On mobile, select the dots and choose Share to Instagram Stories. It\u2019ll auto-create a story featuring the artwork, as well as a clickable link so your followers can open the track on their own Spotify account.</p> <p><strong>Connect powerfully<br></strong>You can listen to Spotify through lots of devices \u2013 smart speakers, smart TVs, stereos, etc \u2013 using your phone/tablet as a remote to set the volume, control what\u2019s playing and more. The most robust way to do this is through Spotify Connect, which uses wifi connectivity to offer higher-quality audio, less dropout and covers a wider range. You\u2019ll be able to use a limited version of Connect with a free Spotify account but to connect to every eligible device you\u2019ll need to upgrade to Premium. If a device offers Spotify Connect, it should show when you tap the Connect icon \u2013 which looks like a computer monitor and a speaker \u2013 at the bottom of your phone/tablet.</p> <p><em><strong>Spotify Premium gives you music without the interruptions.

It's defunding. Here's why  | Alex S Vitale</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The increasing militarization of US society is inseparable from its imperial policies (211 deployments of US armed forces in 67 countries since 1945). The militaristic response to the killing of Floyd tells a story&nbsp;of oversized police presence, unprovoked assaults and excessive force. Ironically, the misleading debate over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/george-floyd-protesters-condemn-opportunistic-looting-violence\">rioters v protesters</a> and outside agitators v legitimate local citizens turns attention away from&nbsp;how heavy law enforcement presence fuels disrespect for the police. The stark contrast of the police response to rightwing provocateurs who show up inside and outside state capitols with guns and loaded ammunition looms large.</p> <p>I recall my own experience of protesting in Charlottesville, Virginia, against hundreds of masked, armed Nazis with live ammunition in which the police stepped back and remained still and silent as we were mercilessly attacked. Without the intervention and protection of antifa, some of us would have died. Sister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/01/heather-heyers-mother-on-hate-in-the-us-were-not-going-to-hug-it-out-but-we-can-listen-to-each-other\">Heather Heyer</a> did die. I believe the attack on any innocent person is wrong, but the focus on the protesters\u2019 assaults on persons or property takes our attention away from the police killing of hundreds of black, poor and working-class people.</p> <p>It also obscures the role of the repressive apparatus in preserving an order so unjust and cruel. The rule of big money, class and gender hierarchies and global militarism must be highlighted in our profound concern with anti-black police murder and brutality.</p> <p>The four catastrophes Martin Luther King Jr warned us about \u2013&nbsp;militarism (in Asia, Africa and the Middle East), poverty (at record levels), materialism (with narcissistic addictions to money, fame and spectacle) and racism (against black and indigenous people, Muslims, Jews and non-white immigrants) \u2013&nbsp;have laid bare the organised hatred, greed and corruption in the country. The killing machine of the US military here and abroad has lost its authority. The profit-driven capitalist economy has lost its glow. And the glitz of the market-driven culture (including media and education) are more and more hollow.&nbsp;</p> <p>The fundamental question at this moment is: can this failed social experiment be reformed? The political duopoly of an escalating neofascist Donald Trump-led Republican party and a fatigued Joe Biden-led neoliberal Democratic party \u2013&nbsp;in no way equivalent, yet both beholden to Wall Street and the Pentagon \u2013&nbsp;are symptoms of a decadent leadership class. The weakness of the labor movement and the present difficulty of the radical left to unite around a nonviolent revolutionary project of democratic sharing and redistribution of power, wealth and respect are signs of a society unable to regenerate the best of its past and present.&nbsp;Any society that refuses to eliminate or attenuate dilapidated housing, decrepit school systems, mass incarceration, massive unemployment and underemployment, inadequate healthcare and its violations of rights and liberties is undesirable and unsustainable.</p> <p>Yet the magnificent moral courage and spiritual sensitivity of the multiracial response to the police killing of George Floyd that now spills over into a political resistance to the legalized looting of Wall Street greed, the plundering of the planet and the degradation of women and LGBTQ+ peoples means we are still fighting regardless of the odds.&nbsp;</p> <p>If radical democracy dies in America, let it be said of us that we gave our all-and-all as the boots of American fascism tried to crush our necks.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>Cornel West is an American philosopher, author, critic, actor, civil rights activist and leading member of Democratic Socialists of America</p></li> </ul>",

That number is now more than 1.1 million and, he says, \u201cI think we will jump to 2 million pretty soon.\u201d</p> <p>The past month has seen the sport make its TV debut on US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/01/us/espn-ocho-spt-trnd/index.html\">network ESPN</a>&nbsp;and attract the attention of the comedian John Oliver\u2019s HBO show&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=50&amp;v=HPdRVxiAq_0&amp;feature=emb_logo\">Last Week Tonight</a>, which will financially sponsor the forthcoming Marble League in return for a few diminutive billboards placed among the event\u2019s 10,000+ marble \u201cspectators\u201d. The team will this week meet a major international TV producer who is interested in developing marble racing as a primetime TV format. After 20 years in youth work and child psychiatry, Dion quit his job three days ago, saying, \u201cI just live from YouTube now.\u201d</p> <p>It was Jelle, now 37, who first began making marble runs as a four-year-old autistic child, helped by his brother, who is two years older. Jelle still builds all the tracks and stands for the races, though it is no longer a two-man operation. The commentator, Greg Woods, is American, their designer is based in Belgium, their composer in Greece, and a 15-strong committee scrutinises all times and results. \u201cYeah, we have to check everything really well,\u201d says Dion, \u201cbecause in America people are really living for it, and they see it as a real sport.\u201d&nbsp;<a href=\"https://store.dftba.com/collections/jelles-marble-runs\">Merchandise sales</a>&nbsp;for the competing teams, inevitably, are also booming.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b65f26b86bbfacbf264a2c5b99532f98a17d609\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b65f26b86bbfacbf264a2c5b99532f98a17d609/0_0_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the sets at Jelle\u2019s Marble Runs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the sets at Jelle\u2019s Marble Runs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anton Weber/Jelle's Marble Runs</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How does he account for its appeal? The lack of any other sport has obviously been significant, he says, also pointing to the humour of the videos, which include stop-motion battles between competing marbles in the stands and marble streakers.</p> <p>Fundamentally, Dion says, \u201cIt pulls you into another dimension. Most people who watch it forget real life. Everything that has a competitive element \u2013 the human brain is just addicted to that.\u201d He says 49% of viewers are now in the US, with the UK the fourth biggest audience after the Netherlands and Germany. \u201cPeople are really rooting for one team. It\u2019s very cool to see and to experience.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, he confesses with a laugh, \u201cI don\u2019t understand it really, because if you ask me, I would never watch it. I would never watch it on YouTube if I wasn\u2019t involved.\u201d</p>",

On the A82 at Loch Lomond and in Glen Coe, traffic was 200% higher than the previous weekend.</p> \n<p>Police ran a checkpoint at Drymen near Loch Lomond, an area where there has been some of Scotland\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/16/loch-lomond-scotland-hotspot-for-lockdown-breakers\">highest rates of lockdown breaches</a>, and turned back drivers who did not live nearby.</p> \n<p>Sturgeon said traffic data was worrying since progress suppressing the pandemic was still fragile. She said she was rethinking her decision to trust people to understand the rules and uphold them voluntarily or use discretion wisely.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have a duty to be clear with you that if there is continued evidence of even a minority of people not abiding by these guidelines and travelling unnecessarily, we will have to put these restrictions on group sizes and travel distance into law,\u201d Sturgeon told Monday\u2019s daily coronavirus press briefing.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe won\u2019t hesitate to do that if we think that\u2019s necessary for the collective safety and wellbeing of the population ...

The list is too long to give here of these black American men of all ages, who are too often victims of encounters with the police that turn out badly; of the trigger-happy in a country where firearms are routinely carried as an accessory, or just plain racism.</p> \n<p>\u201cToo many mothers in the African American community must teach their sons from early adolescence how to behave on the street so as not to arouse suspicion and not to be in turn the target of blunders or mistakes.

And when informed by those mothers and fathers that Dylan \u201ccouldn\u2019t sing\u201d, his followers loved him all the more. The image was set, and no matter how many wonderful bands he would go on to recruit \u2013 the Hawks, the Rolling Thunder troupe, the Never Ending Tour ensemble \u2013 he will live longest and most powerfully in the memory as a lone figure in the spotlight with an acoustic guitar, a harmonica and a defiant nasal drawl scraped clean of all varnish, delivering songs like these. There are bleak tales of injustice visited on the invisible poor (The Ballad of Hollis Brown and North Country Blues), the angry civil-rights broadsides (Only a Pawn in Their Game and The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll) and an evisceration of cold war hypocrisy (With God on Their Side), each of them explicit in its accusatory detail and suffused with an empathy and a seemingly world-weary wisdom so striking in one of his age.</p> <p>But in this first entirely self-composed album there were also songs of self-discovery coming from more oblique angles, like When the Ship Comes In and Restless Farewell, and a moment of luminous tenderness: Boots of Spanish Leather, transformed from the traditional Scarborough Fair into one of the songs with which he gave a generation access to their newest and deepest feelings.</p> <h2>The three to check out next&nbsp;</h2> <p><strong>Highway 61 Revisited (1965)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwOfCgkyEj0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IwOfCgkyEj0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Bob Dylan: Like a Rolling Stone \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>If the rackety boogie of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/13/bob-dylan-subterranean-homesick-blues-50th-anniversary\">Subterranean Homesick Blues</a> lit the fuse, this was the explosion. He had found the formula he was looking for: a gnarlier, snarlier version of the British Invasion bands, an endless high-voltage, high-heeled surge of guitars, keyboards and drums, a first-take sound with the big-city blues in its veins and a poet at the controls, singing about tortured thieves and junkyard angels and remaking the Old Testament as a road movie. Like a Rolling Stone, released as a six-minute single, was the harbinger and also a career pinnacle. What did it mean, this howl of triumphant disdain? It seemed to mean whatever you were thinking yourself, making the world feel a bigger place. And, to finish off, Desolation Row, a universe created from scratch in 11 stripped-back minutes of carnival hallucinations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/27/wu-tang-clan-where-to-start-in-their-group-and-solo-back-catalogue\">Wu-Tang Clan: where to start in their group and solo back catalogues</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Blood on the Tracks (1974)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKcNyMBw818\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QKcNyMBw818?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Bob Dylan: Tangled Up in Blue \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Any expectation of linear development having been blown apart by the excursions into country and other forms of vernacular music that followed <a href=\"https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/ellen-willis/the-sound-of-bob-dylan/\">Dylan\u2019s motorbike accident</a>, Blood on the Tracks was received with a sigh of collective gratitude. Souls were soothed by the return to earlier songwriting strategies in the graceful melodies, the finely wrought lyrics and the unadorned arrangements of Simple Twist of Fate, Shelter from the Storm and If You See Her, Say Hello, while Tangled Up in Blue showed him using all his powers to hold a narrative up to the light and examine its many facets. There was the entrancing mystery of Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts, a tale of violence and lust in the old west, and a lost-love song of kindness, regret and eternal resonance set to a skipping rhythm in You\u2019re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go. The album followed his divorce from Sara Lownds, but its stories were universal: \u201cLife is sad, life is a bust / All you can do is do what you must / You do what you must do, and you do it well / I do it for you, honey baby can\u2019t you tell?\u201d</p> <p><strong>Time Out of Mind (1997)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdWto-AUM3Q\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fdWto-AUM3Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Bob Dylan: Make You Feel My Love \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In 1989 the Canadian producer and guitarist Daniel Lanois took Dylan down to New Orleans to help him refocus his music with the widely praised Oh Mercy. Eight years later the partnership was resumed in Miami. Dylan\u2019s voice was wearier and rougher now, its changed texture emphasised by Lanois\u2019s production techniques. Everything on Time Out of Mind sounded older; it was as if the Muddy Waters band of 1956 had just vacated the studio but left behind their amps and instruments, with which Dylan and Lanois created their spectral webs of sound. The mood was at its most intense in Not Dark Yet, a slow-march meditation on mortality, and the 16-minute Highlands, an ambling 12-bar blues in which Dylan collapsed the space between Robert Burns\u2019 hymn to a lost rural home and an encounter with a waitress in a Boston diner. And, half-buried, there\u2019s Make You Feel My Love, destined to become probably his most covered song since Blowin\u2019 in the Wind.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/25/sonic-youth-where-to-start-in-their-back-catalogue\">Sonic Youth: where to start in their back catalogue</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>One for the heads&nbsp;</h2> <p><strong>\u2019Cross the Green Mountain (2003)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_7x-1BxTAM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B_7x-1BxTAM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Bob Dylan: \u2018Cross the Green Mountain \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Invited to provided a song for the film Gods and Generals, Dylan drew on his study of the American civil war in the New York Public Library to construct an eight-minute ballad imagining the thoughts of a dying Confederate soldier.

Probably more. In a normal job you finish work and think: \u2018Aarrghhh, at least that\u2019s over.\u2019 But when you finish this you think you\u2019ve actually done something.

But she was so strong. The drugs made it difficult for her to walk but she would be up in the middle of the night making tea, coming upstairs. I had to tell her off. She was like: \u2018No, if I can do it, I\u2019ll be doing it.\u2019 You had to let her get on with it.</p> <p>\u201cBefore she got delirious and really ill she sat me down to talk about my boxing. I wasn\u2019t bothered about fighting. She was like: \u2018Look, you can\u2019t throw away everything. If you\u2019re going to do it, you\u2019ve got to do it properly.\u2019 My mum was one of them people. If she did something, she did it right. Like the house. I\u2019ve never seen someone hoover like it in my life. I\u2019m surprised we\u2019ve got carpet left.\u201d</p> <p>In March 2019, just weeks after he lost his mum, he made his return to the ring and won his third fight on a first-round TKO. He won his next two bouts and was set to fight at the O<sub>2</sub> in March. Then lockdown intervened. It should have been his first fight at super-flyweight [112lb or 52.1kg]. </p> <p>\u201cAs a baby I had a growth hormone deficiency,\u201d he explains. \u201cI was under Whittington hospital for eight years as an outpatient. From 13 I\u2019d be in hospital every few weeks for check-ups. I was also under Great Ormond Street. My case was quite severe. At 15, I was the size of a six-year-old. Three foot seven. I couldn\u2019t get no one to box me because of my size.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b630825192e3de5972275b426169cd4b875b5a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b630825192e3de5972275b426169cd4b875b5a8/27_260_3526_2116/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Cox (right) gets the decision over Steven McGuire at York Hall in Bethnal Green during September last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam Cox (right) gets the decision over Steven McGuire at York Hall in Bethnal Green during September last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Sharkey/TGS Photo/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBut then I\u2019d have growth spurts.

Not too bad.\u201d</p> <p>Cox grins and then becomes serious as he considers his debt to the NHS. \u201cMy prescription when I was young was three-and-a-half grand a month. So I love the NHS. After the virus the government really needs to give hospitals what they need. I hope ordinary people feel the same because this pandemic has brought us together. When I see an old person on the train I like to help and talk to them. But nowadays they look at you like you\u2019re a mugger. That\u2019s how bad London is.

  "<p>The word \u201cviolence\u201d is going to be used a lot to describe the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/30/protests-spread-across-us-in-response-to-george-floyd-killing-video\">events in US cities over the weekend</a> and all this week. So it\u2019s going to be important to be clear about who is violent and what violence is. Property destruction and harming human beings are profoundly different actions, and with a few exceptions (seemingly interlopers in the protests) virtually all the violence visited on human beings during this round of civil unrest across the US has been inflicted by police.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-who-was-he-his-friends-words\">An athlete, a father, a 'beautiful spirit': George Floyd in his friends' words</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This began with the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-who-was-he-his-friends-words\">George Floyd</a> in public in direct violation of what the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/knee-neck-george-floyd-death.html\">Minneapolis </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/knee-neck-george-floyd-death.html\">police department manual</a> says about chokeholds. He told officers he couldn\u2019t breathe and begged for his life. What is particularly stunning about the brutality of the police across the country is that they seem to expect impunity. They do not serve the public or keep the peace; they serve themselves.</p> <p>Nevertheless, much of the finger-wagging has been about property destruction, and it is dismaying to see that some are more upset about broken glass than public killing \u2013 or rather that they seem to believe society ought to<strong> </strong>rest on a foundation of stable property relations, not human rights and justice.</p> <p>The distinction between damaging or destroying human beings and inanimate objects matters. But it\u2019s not simple. People trapped inside a burning building break down the doors to escape; an estranged husband with a restraining order breaks down a door to further terrorise his ex-wife. The same actions mean different things in different situations. Martin Luther King famously called riots&nbsp;\u201cthe voice of the unheard\u201d \u2013 and as the outcry of people who have tried absolutely everything else for centuries, property damage means something very different from merely malicious or recreational destruction. When they riot, the black people most impacted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/09/years-life-lost-us-police-violence-people-of-color\">police brutality</a> and by four centuries of poverty, dehumanisation and deprivation of basic rights and equality, are more like people trapped inside that burning house trying to break out.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is no easy way to distinguish between ardent white supporters of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-protests-donald-trump-white-house-washington-police-brutality-minneapolis-latest-news-updates\">black uprising</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_bloc\">black bloc-style</a> white people who revel in property destruction, taunting the police and escalating situations (before often slipping away before the police crack down). They are anti-authoritarians opposed to police brutality and the overreach of the state, and should not be confused with the rightwing authoritarians who many fear will use the pandemonium as cover for their own agenda, which could include creating more chaos.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa6592c49400aacb9c7f29fb84dfe37a5e2ac5a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa6592c49400aacb9c7f29fb84dfe37a5e2ac5a8/0_147_3995_2397/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police surround protesters in Minneapolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police surround protesters in Minneapolis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What these authoritarians and anti-authoritarians often have in common is an enthusiasm for violence for its own sake and a belief that it is revolutionary. Most successful recent revolutions have, in fact, been largely nonviolent, and those that were violent have tended more toward highly disciplined guerrillas in the mountains than window-smashers on the high street.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to note, of course, that property destruction can hurt the very constituencies that riots and uprisings are supposed to speak for. The loss of small minority-owned businesses, social centres and local amenities further impoverishes communities. Here, it\u2019s worth noting that I\u2019ve read accounts of residents of Minneapolis <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/alondrabikes/videos/10116080980577950/?hc_location=ufi\">trying to put out fires</a> and otherwise protect property in their own neighbourhoods, only to be attacked by police as they did so.</p> <p>A Minneapolis nursery school teacher told me that earlier this week: \u201cMy brothers-in-law in Minneapolis were participating in the hosing-down of an active fire in the lot next to their house (a bank). These were community members keeping the fire from reaching their homes.&nbsp;Fire and police were not on the scene until many hours later, being occupied elsewhere \u2026&nbsp;But the MPD police did stop by at one point in the middle of the night to throw teargas into the midst of the neighbours doing this work, and to shoot rubber bullets at&nbsp;the guys spraying the fire down.\u201d</p> <p>A dozen years ago, when I wrote a book about civil society response to urban disaster, I learned the term <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/04/elite_panic.html\">\u201celite panic</a><a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/04/elite_panic.html\">\u201d</a>. It describes how the authorities often respond in an emergency \u2013 not by protecting and aiding the public but by seeking to control and repress us, protecting nothing but their own power and position. Police across the country seem to be doing this and more, demonstrating the same impunity the killers of George Floyd seemed to be counting upon.</p> <p>One of the stunning things about Saturday night\u2019s police riot was the direct and intentional <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/5/31/21276013/police-targeted-journalists-covering-george-floyd-protests\">violence against journalists</a> across the nation. Reporters have been arrested while working, thrown to the ground and pepper-sprayed, hit with rubber bullets and fired on while broadcasting. Photojournalist&nbsp;Linda Tirado is now <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/us/minneapolis-protests-press.html\">blind in one eye</a> after being shot by police. This is not only an assault on individuals but on the role of a free press in keeping the government accountable and the public informed.&nbsp;</p> <p>The story of activist violence is often used to justify police violence, but damage to property is not a justification for wholesale violence against children, passersby, journalists, protesters, or anyone at all. It is the police who should have lost their legitimacy, over and over, after the many individual killings from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/04/i-cant-breathe-eric-garner-chokehold-death-video\">Eric Garner</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/apr/09/north-charleston-shooting-police-scanner-video\">Walter Scott</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Breonna Taylor</a> to George Floyd. And after reckless, entitled, out-of-control violence in police riots like that on Saturday night. Perhaps the point of their action this week is that they don\u2019t need legitimacy, just power.</p> <p>There\u2019s one more kind of violence to talk about, and that\u2019s structural violence. That\u2019s the way that institutions and societies are organised to oppress a group of people, and for black Americans, that\u2019s included slavery, the long terrorism of Jim Crow and lynching, voter suppression from the 19th century to the present, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/23/black-americans-housing-crisis-sub-prime-loan\">redlining</a> (denying or charging more for necessary services) and subprime mortgages, discrimination in housing, education, and employment and far more.</p> <p>Right now, several forms of structural violence that particularly matter are the chronic stress and lack of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/04/racism-us-healthcare-coronavirus-african-americans\">access to healthcare</a>, housing issues, and work situations that have made black Americans die of Covid-19 at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/black-americans-death-rate-covid-19-coronavirus\">far higher rates</a> than other races.</p> <p>The autopsy report cited in the arrest warrant for the man charged with George Floyd\u2019s murder suggested his death was due to hypertension and a heart condition; it was, in fact, caused by police brutality and violation of civil rights, and his health issues, if true, might be just part of that same spectrum of structural violence. The police have been agents of this all along, and when they come out with teargas and clubs to suppress uprisings, they announce that this is who they are and who they want to be: violence in service of violence.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Rebecca Solnit&nbsp;is a Guardian US columnist</p>",

  "<p>When deciding how and when lockdown restrictions will be lifted across the UK, the government has said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/what-does-the-r-number-of-coronavirus-actually-signify\">R value</a>, denoting how many people on average one infected person will themselves infect, is crucial. But experts say another metric is becoming increasingly important: K.</p> \n<h2><strong>What is K?</strong></h2> \n<p>K sheds light on the variation behind R. \u201cSome [infectious] people might generate a lot of secondary cases because of the event they attend, for example, and other people may not generate many secondary cases at all,\u201d said Dr Adam Kucharski, an expert in the dynamics of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.</p> \n<p>\u201cK is the statistical value that tells us how much variation there is in that distribution.\u201d</p> \n<p>But unlike R, K numbers are not intuitive. \u201cThe general rule is that the smaller the K value is, the more transmission comes from a smaller number of infectious people,\u201d said Kucharski. </p> \n<p>\u201cOnce K is above about five or 10 it tells you most people are generating pretty similar numbers [of secondary cases], you are not getting these super-spreading events. Once K is below one, you have got the potential for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/what-are-super-spreaders-and-how-are-they-transmitting-coronavirus\">super-spreading</a>.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Is K fixed, or does it fluctuate with public health measures, like R does?</strong></h2> \n<p>As with the rate of transmission, there is a K value<strong> </strong>that relates to transmission when you do not have any control measures in place. Once measures are implemented, however, the distribution in transmission changes. \u201cIt is unlikely that with lockdown measures in place you\u2019d see a lot of super-spreading events simply because there aren\u2019t any opportunities for them,\u201d said Kucharski. \u201cSo if you were to analyse that data, you\u2019d probably calculate a different K value because you have got those control measures changing the dynamics of interactions.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>What is the K number for Covid-19?</strong></h2> \n<p>In the absence of public health measures, \u201cthe values that are coming out for Covid-19 seems to be between about 0.1 and 0.5,\u201d said Kucharski. That, he says, means that in the early stages of an outbreak about 10-20% of infections probably generate about 80% of the transmission.</p> \n<p>In other words, super-spreading matters \u2013 a reality highlighted by reports such as that from South Korea where one individual is thought to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/20/south-korean-city-daegu-lockdown-coronavirus-outbreak-cases-soar-at-church-cult-cluster\">infected dozens of others by attending church</a>.</p> \n<p>But Kucharski cautioned against the use of the term super-spreader. \u201cI think we do have to be really careful about blaming people because often it is not really much about the person, it is much more about the environment they happened to be in while they were infectious,\u201d he said.</p> \n<h2><strong>Why is K important?</strong></h2> \n<p>Knowing the K value helps to inform what sort of public health measures may help to reduce R.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we can identify and reduce the situations that are disproportionately driving transmission, then that suggests that we could actually have potentially quite a lot less disruptive measures in place, but still keep the reproduction number low,\u201d said Kucharski.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>But it could also be important for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/how-will-englands-coronavirus-test-and-trace-system-work\">test</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/how-will-englands-coronavirus-test-and-trace-system-work\">-and-trace</a> measures, he said. \u201cIf cases occur at random, it\u2019s very hard to track down and stop every chain of transmission. But if cases cluster together, and we can identify those clusters, testing and tracing directed at these situations could have a disproportionate effect on reducing transmission.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>How might the relaxation of the lockdown affect K?</strong></h2> \n<p>Lockdown reduces the chances of a single infectious person spreading the disease to others. \u201cObviously if you start to allow larger gatherings, have larger workplaces, if you have other types of interaction starting, then that does increase the chance that one infection could spread to more people than it would have been able to a couple of weeks ago,\u201d said Kucharski. \u201cIt could decrease the K, but it could also increase the R.\u201d </p>",

Shortly after the shooting, police raided his family home.</p> <p>Two officers were questioned under caution on Saturday, with one placed under house arrest while investigators looked into the incident, local media reported.</p> <p>Amir Ohana, the public security minister who oversees Israel\u2019s police, vowed to investigate but said officers were \u201crequired to make fateful decisions in seconds in an area that has been inundated with terror attacks, and in which there is a constant danger to their lives\u201d.</p> <p>During the past few years, lone Palestinian attackers have stabbed or shot civilians and police in Jerusalem, although the incidents have dropped in frequency since an escalation in late 2015 and 2016.</p> <p>Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, did not mention the killing at a cabinet meeting on Sunday, but his defence minister and alternate prime minister, Benny Gantz, apologised for the incident. \u201cI am sure this subject will be investigated swiftly, and conclusions will be reached,\u201d Gantz said.</p> <p>B\u2019Tselem, a leading Israeli human rights group, said justice was unlikely. While its researchers have only partial data for official police complaints, they found that investigations into the killings of more than 200 Palestinians by the army during the past nine years resulted in only three soldiers being convicted.</p> <p>\u201cEven in a case as clearcut and horrifying as this, the opening of the investigation is simply the first step in its whitewash,\u201d the group\u2019s spokesman, Amit&nbsp;Gilutz, said of Halak\u2019s killing.</p> <p>\u201cEnforcing an occupation and denying millions of people their human rights requires a great deal of perpetual state violence. Therefore, existing Israeli law enforcement mechanisms are designed to protect the perpetrators of this violence \u2013 not their victims.\u201d</p> <p>Gideon Levy, an Israeli columnist and one of the most prominent anti-occupation voices in the country, <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-being-black-in-america-shouldn-t-be-a-death-sentence-what-about-being-palestinian-1.8883372\">expressed</a> little hope for an impartial investigation or that the killing \u2013 which he argued was not unusual \u2013 might lead to change in Israel and Palestine.</p> <p>\u201cThe [Israeli] border police are no less brutal or racist than the police in the United States,\u201d he wrote in Haaretz newspaper. \u201cThere, they shoot black people, whose blood is cheap, and in Israel they shoot Palestinians, whose blood is even cheaper. But here, the killing puts us to sleep; there it sparks protest.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Fears that Iran is in the grip of a second wave of coronavirus have been reinforced, with the health ministry saying 3,000 new cases were recorded in 24 hours \u2013 the highest figure for two months.</p> <p>The Islamic Republic, one of the worst-hit countries in the Middle East, started easing its lockdown in April after a drop in deaths.</p> <p>Its leaders have been reluctant to acknowledge that they may have lifted restrictions prematurely. They have argued that a recent rise in new infections was confined to certain provinces and that the number of deaths was relatively low. At the weekend the president, Hassan Rouhani, said most restrictions had now been lifted, pointing to the opening of 40,000 mosques, as well as shops and offices. Despite a clear reversal of fortunes in the past fortnight, few newspapers appeared willing to acknowledge that the virus had not been conquered.</p> <p>But health ministry officials on Monday sent out a dire warning about complacency, saying the battle was far from over.</p> <p>The health minister, Saeed Namaki, said he was witnessing sad scenes across the country. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he said, \u201ccorona is going to score a goal in the 90th minute if some officials and the people believe that corona is over. If we neglect the situation we will go backwards. People, have mercy on us, let\u2019s have mercy on ourselves, government officials are getting tired.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Iran&amp;type=cases\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Iran&type=cases\">Graphic</a> </figure>  <p>The latest figures showed 2,979 new infections in the previous 24 hours, taking the total of infections in Iran to 154,445. The daily figure is the highest since 1 April. The comparative figure for 1 May was 802 new infections.</p> <p>The number of deaths is also starting to rise again, with 81 dead in the previous 24 hours, the highest figure since 27 April. A total of 8,778 have died since Iran\u2019s outbreak began.</p> <p>Namaki said he had been disturbed by the lack of social distancing on public transport. \u201cThe&nbsp;slightest negligence can destroy all successes and tarnish our reputation in the international arena,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Contrary to some messaging by Iran\u2019s leadership that the virus was weakening, he said that it had become more dangerous. \u201cLast week we had cases of patients dying at the age of 32 or 42 without any underlying disease, due to coronavirus,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cMy colleagues and the deputies of the ministry of health are working around the clock and traveling to one province every day to control this epidemic, but we are dealing with local issues and behaviours that could lead to the return of the peak of the disease.\u201d Wedding celebrations, he warned, would turn into funerals soon afterwards. </p> <p>He said the virus was most dangerous in the south-west province of Khuzestan, but infections were also rising in Kermanshah, Hormozgan, Sistan and Baluchestan. The health ministry claimed adherence to social distancing rules had dropped from 90% to 40%, and that promised new buses for Tehran had not materialised, leading to overcrowding. Those not wearing masks on Tehran public transport should be banned from travelling, Namaki said.</p> <p>Experts both at home and abroad have voiced scepticism about&nbsp;Iran\u2018s official figures, saying the real toll could be much higher.</p> <p>Health officials have repeatedly raised the alarm about Khuzestan on&nbsp;Iran\u2019s south-western border with Iraq. Khuzestan remains at red, the highest level on&nbsp;Iran\u2018s colour-coded risk scale, and is the only province where the government has reimposed a lockdown.</p> <p>Iranian authorities have been under intense internal pressure to lift restrictions and get the economy, already shattered by sanctions, back moving. Nearly $2.5bn of damage has been done in 13 sectors of the economy, according to government estimates. Inflation is projected to settle at 24% next year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a senior Iranian lawmaker said on Monday that around 230 people were killed in the street protests against Iran\u2019s petrol price rises last November.</p> <p>It was the first time Iran had even semi-officially disclosed the scale of the protest. Motjaba Zulmoor, the head of the Iranian parliament\u2019s National Security Commission said 52 of those killed were government officials and the remainder were 78 street protesters mainly killed while attacking government&nbsp;buildings.</p> <p>Zulmoor claimed 2,000 protesters were injured and 5,000 officials, but gave no number for those detained. He blamed foreign media for the wave of attacks, and&nbsp;said the police were forced to intervene when assaults started on police centres.&nbsp;</p> <p>An Iranian government spokesman also attacked Donald Trump for his policing of the current protests against racism and police brutality, saying it showed he had no authority to advise others on human rights issues.</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Government lawyers have tried and failed to remove the name of Dominic Cummings from a sex discrimination claim being pursued by Sajid Javid\u2019s former special adviser, the Guardian can disclose.</p> <p>The demand was rejected after barristers for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/01/adviser-sacked-by-cummings-may-have-case-for-unfair-dismissal-expert\">Sonia Khan, the former chancellor\u2019s media adviser</a> who was marched by armed police from Downing Street, successfully argued that the behaviour of Boris Johnson\u2019s chief aide was pivotal to the case.</p> <p>The disclosure will be seen as an attempt by the government to protect Cummings from further controversy. He is facing demands for his resignation after the Guardian revealed that he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/28/durham-police-believe-cummings-probably-did-break-lockdown-rules\">driven hundreds of miles across the UK</a> during the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>It also means that Cummings could be made personally liable for part of any damages award.</p> <p>Khan was Javid\u2019s media adviser at the time she was escorted from No 10 after Cummings accused her of misleading him over her contact with individuals close to the former chancellor Philip Hammond. She denied any inappropriate contact. Javid was furious to learn about her dismissal after the event.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"25b3a05d764fe8104e4ef1e3e0ca644008331835\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25b3a05d764fe8104e4ef1e3e0ca644008331835/0_0_1732_2164/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sonia Khan\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sonia Khan was escorted from No 10 after Dominic Cummings accused her of lying about contact with one of Philip Hammond\u2019s former staff.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At an employment tribunal hearing in central London, a judge set the case for a five-day hearing in December at which the relationship between Cummings and Johnson will be scrutinised.</p> <p>Barristers for Khan named Cummings as a respondent in the case, which also includes an unfair dismissal claim. It is understood that the government\u2019s solicitors attempted to argue that his name should be removed and replaced as a respondent with that of the Cabinet Office.</p> <p>Whitehall sources said Cummings planned to fight the claim.</p> <p>Counsel for Khan, who is being backed by the FDA union, argued that Cummings was pivotal to the case and that what he had done personally, rather than just as an agent of the employer, was actionable. He is expected to be summoned as a witness.</p> <p>The hearing ruled that the Cabinet Office could be added as a respondent but Cummings would also remain.</p> <p>Khan, 28, was accused by Cummings of lying about her conversations with Hammond\u2019s former staff member Poppy Trowbridge.</p> <p>It is understood Khan was asked to hand over her work phone, and also presented her personal phone to Cummings.</p> <p>There were no other firsthand witnesses to Khan\u2019s sacking by Cummings, who spoke to her in an office in Downing Street close to the prime minister\u2019s.</p> <p>In a meeting days after Khan\u2019s departure with Boris Johnson\u2019s team of special advisers \u2013 known as spads \u2013 Cummings is said to have remarked: \u201cIf you don\u2019t like how I run things, there\u2019s the door.\u201d</p> <p>Bruce Carr QC, a former government adviser on employment law, said the naming of an individual as a respondent could mean he could be personally liable for damages.</p> <p>\u201cThere are plenty of cases where it is appropriate and legitimate to include an individual as a respondent where that individual is central to the allegations of discrimination,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhere that is or might be the case, it is actually very difficult for the principal respondent such as a government department to persuade a tribunal to strike out a claim against the individual named respondents.</p> <p>\u201cWhat you are effectively asking them to do is rule that the claim against the individual is frivolous or hopeless or is being brought for illegitimate reasons.\u201d</p> <p>Cummings has previously faced criticism over what some describe as his high-handed behaviour. In 2012, a senior civil servant received a payout of \u00a325,000 from the Department for Education in a bullying case she took against Cummings and a senior member of Michael Gove\u2019s team when Cummings was a special adviser at the department. An internal investigation found no grounds for disciplinary action.</p> <p>Cummings also drew criticism for hiring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/17/andrew-sabisky-boris-johnsons-ex-adviser-in-his-own-words\">Andrew Sabisky, a temporary contractor who resigned</a> over comments about eugenics and race.</p> <p>Johnson could also be asked to give evidence to the tribunal. At the time of Khan\u2019s dismissal last September, the terms of employment for special advisers made it clear that it was only the prime minister who had the power to sack them. This was then changed after Khan left, giving Cummings ultimate \u201cresponsibility for disciplinary matters\u201d.</p> <p>Dave Penman, the head of the FDA, declined to comment on the specifics of the case. \u201cThe FDA continues to support Sonia Khan through her legal claims at tribunal,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said:&nbsp;<strong>\u201c</strong>We don\u2019t&nbsp;comment&nbsp;on&nbsp;ongoing&nbsp;legal&nbsp;matters.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>A source added that it is standard government practice to ask for the employing department to be named as the respondent rather than individual employees.</p>",

  "<p>Now 25 years on from the outbreak, Seattle is completely overgrown. Abandoned cars are still lined up on the highway, rusted and rooted down by vegetation bursting through the tarmac. Skyscrapers still pierce the sky, their metal skeletons exposed by the bombs that were dropped in early, vain attempts to contain the fungal sickness that was spreading through the population. In any one of these buildings, there could still be the infected: aggressive runners, who still retain at least the appearance of humanity, or the skin-crawling clickers, hosts who have long since lost their sight and selves to the fungus \u2013 or worse.</p> <p>As usual in post-apocalyptic fiction, there are also other people out to do you harm. In The Last of Us Part II, you are Ellie, a 19-year-old survivor who happens to be the only known person with immunity to the contagion that\u2019s destroyed humanity \u2013 but immunity won\u2019t save her from bullets, or from being savaged to death, so whenever you get into a combat situation the tension is absurdly high. This isn\u2019t a game with shootouts and explosions and powerful weapons \u2013 instead it\u2019s desperate grappling with a knife, improvised molotov cocktails, hiding prone in long grass while people patrol with guard dogs.</p> <p>In 2013, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/jun/05/the-last-of-us-ps3-video-game-review\">The Last of Us</a> was one of the last truly great games to be released on the PlayStation 3, a trans-American road trip that pushed both the technological and storytelling boundaries of video games. Ellie, then 14, wasn\u2019t centre stage in that game: instead it was Joel, a smuggler trying to deliver her across the country to an organisation that might be able to use her immunity to develop a vaccine. With apologies to anyone who hasn\u2019t played it yet: that didn\u2019t work out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"289a853b98ce2121b10f9ff59d3fce05e8b71c7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/289a853b98ce2121b10f9ff59d3fce05e8b71c7f/0_0_3840_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gameplay from The Last of Us Part II\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Extraordinarily realistic characters and arresting locations ...

The world is still devastated; there\u2019s still no hope. This time we play as Ellie herself, on a different kind of journey.</p> <p>\u201cThe first game is about the unconditional love that parents have for their child and how insane that can be \u2013 the beautiful things that love can make people do, and the scary things,\u201d says Neil Druckmann, lead writer and director of The Last of Us and its sequel, and VP of its developer, Naughty Dog. \u201cThis is asking the same question but from a slightly different angle: if someone has wronged someone you love, hurt someone you love, how far are you willing to go to do right by them and bring the people responsible to justice?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a story about people, and the extraordinary and horrific things they can do for each other, or to each other</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Naughty Dog is to story-driven video games what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/grand-theft-auto\">Grand Theft Auto</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/red-dead-redemption\">Red Dead Redemption</a> developer Rockstar is to open-world ones: whenever the studio comes out with a new game, it\u2019s an event that expands the possibilities for its genre. The Last of Us Part II\u2019s extraordinarily realistic characters and performances and its arresting locations are part of this, but technology can only take things so far when it comes to storytelling. What distinguishes Naughty Dog\u2019s games from other expensive, cutting-edge action games is that many of the best, most memorable moments come not from shootouts or thrilling set pieces \u2013 though Naughty Dog is famously excellent at those \u2013 but from conversations.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve discovered that we don\u2019t actually need as much action as we usually think about with a game like this,\u201d says Druckmann. \u201cThose quiet, thoughtful moments where people are just talking, or where you\u2019re walking around looking and interacting with a scene, are important in themselves \u2013 and then we move on to the tension.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eML5icfq5VM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eML5icfq5VM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The Last of Us was already an extremely violent game, but Part II is even more so. In a short sequence premiered last week, in which Ellie weaves her way through the city to track down a woman in a heavily guarded Seattle hospital, we see the sort of graphic violence usually confined to the most intense horror movie. This is not playful violence; it is not exactly supposed to be fun, though plenty of players will surely nonetheless enjoy experimenting with the game\u2019s tools for stealth and murder. Instead The Last of Us goes to immense lengths to make its violence feel consequential, in contrast to the casual pointing and shooting of most action games, in which you hardly give a thought about the body count you\u2019re amassing as you cheerfully plough through hundreds of grunts.</p> <p>\u201cWe needed to ground the violence,\u201d says Druckmann. \u201cIt\u2019s not completely realistic but we are going for believability. The feeling that we\u2019re after when you\u2019re playing these violent sequences, the adrenaline and tension, is more important than pure realism. That\u2019s how we judge what\u2019s too much, what is too little \u2013 to thread the needle and show the consequences of your actions.\u201d</p> <p>Video game storytelling has greatly improved in the past seven years, in both the indie and blockbuster spaces. Creators, designers and writers from ever more diverse backgrounds are using games\u2019 interactivity and capacity for putting you in another person\u2019s shoes to tell the kinds of tales about the kinds of people that would have been unthinkable a decade ago, when even having a female lead character was a novelty. Against that backdrop you might wonder what yet another violent post-apocalyptic video game might have to offer in 2020.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce1dcd7f4cc9ffad20907f9f832eb21406a4864d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce1dcd7f4cc9ffad20907f9f832eb21406a4864d/0_0_3840_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"shooting scene\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Precious immunity ... in combat situations, the tension is absurdly high.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naughty Dog/Sony</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Naughty Dog\u2019s willingness to tackle difficult and sometimes distressing themes and material, in a way that\u2019s grounded in believable characters, make this more than just another zombie story.

For many observers, there was a distinct echo of Richard Nixon\u2019s 1968 acceptance speech \u2013 \u201cWe see cities enveloped in smoke and flame\u201d \u2013 and a foreboding that history could take a newly dark and dangerous turn.</p> <p>For three years, the first president elected without political or military experience rode his luck and skirted past disaster. In the fourth year, the fates demanded payback.</p> <p>Not even Trump\u2019s harshest critics can blame him for a virus believed to have come from a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, nor for an attendant economic collapse, nor for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/13/us-slavery-400-years-virginia-point-comfort\">four centuries of slavery,</a> segregation, police brutality and racial injustice.</p> <p>But they can, and do, point to how he made a bad situation so much worse. The story of Trump\u2019s presidency was arguably always leading to this moment, with its toxic mix of weak moral leadership, racial divisiveness, crass and vulgar rhetoric and an erosion of norms, institutions and trust in traditional information sources. Taken together, these ingredients created a tinderbox poised to explode when crises came.</p> <p>Trump, they say, was uniquely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/george-floyd-donald-trump-protests-violence-looting\">ill-qualified for this moment.</a> He tried to wish away the threat of the coronavirus and failed to prepare, then paid no heed to how communities of colour bore the brunt of its health and economic consequences. As unrest now grips dozens of cities, he speaks an authoritarian language of \u201cthugs\u201d, \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d.</p> <p>The nation waits in vain for a speech that might heal wounds, find a common sense of purpose and acknowledge the generational trauma of African Americans.

  "<p>A day before the first confirmed fatality from coronavirus outside mainland China was reported on 2 February this year, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/01/andy-gill-influential-guitarist-with-gang-of-four-dies-aged-64\">death of the influential guitarist and musician</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/01/andy-gill-influential-guitarist-with-gang-of-four-dies-aged-64\"> Andy Gill</a> was announced. The 64-year-old, who fronted the post-punk band Gang of Four, died of pneumonia after two weeks in St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London.</p> \n<p>The trajectory of Gill\u2019s illness, which took medics looking after him in January by surprise, is now familiar \u2013 sudden deterioration, low oxygen levels and organ failure. He had fallen sick after his band returned from a trip to China in late November. A short time later, his 26-year-old tour manager was taken to hospital in Leeds with a severe respiratory infection.</p> \n<p>As images started rolling in of wards in China and then Italy overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients, Gill\u2019s widow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/22/why-mothers-day-is-so-tough-for-my-family-this-year\">Catherine Mayer</a> \u2013 an author and co-founder of the Women\u2019s Equality party \u2013 couldn\u2019t shake the suspicion that her partner of nearly 30 years may have been an early victim of the virus.</p> \n<p>In a blog<a href=\"https://www.catherinemayer.co.uk/post/2020-vision-14-may-16-00\">post written last month</a>, Mayer said she emailed Gill\u2019s thoracic specialist to ask the question. \u201cHis response winded me,\u201d she wrote. The consultant said: \u201cIt seemed to me at the time of Andy\u2019s illness that we had not fully understood why he deteriorated as he did. Once we learned more about Covid-19, I thought there was a real possibility that Andy had been infected by Sars-Cov-2.\u201d</p> \n<p>Genetic analyses of the new coronavirus suggest that the virus emerged in humans in China in late November to early December 2019. While China\u2019s official submission to the World Health Organization (WHO) states the first infection was recorded on 8 December, government data seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/first-covid-19-case-happened-in-november-china-government-records-show-report\">by the&nbsp;South China Morning Post</a> suggests<em> </em>the first known case was observed on 17 November.</p> \n<p>In the UK, the first confirmed cases of coronavirus came on 31 January when two Chinese nationals staying in a hotel in York tested positive. But as the crisis has rolled on, and the virus\u2019s range of distinctive symptoms become more widely known, many \u2013 some in letters to the Guardian \u2013 have asked themselves if they or their loved ones could have had it earlier.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are on heightened awareness about any sort of respiratory infection and it is easy to retrofit stories to things,\u201d said Dr Stephen Baker at Cambridge University\u2019s Infectious Diseases Institute. Colds, influenza and even pneumonia are, after all, common in the winter months.</p> \n<p>However, without clear information about what was happening in China in the final months of last year, it is hard to know how likely it is to have arrived in the UK earlier than the first confirmed case, he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s say it was kicking off fairly substantially in Wuhan and people weren\u2019t being informed: could there have been people travelling to and from China at that point who may have been infected by coronavirus? That is completely possible. Is it then possible that they transmitted the virus to other people when they were in the UK? Yes, of course that\u2019s possible.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52526554\">Earlier last month</a>, the news emerged that a swab taken from a man treated in a hospital near Paris on 27 December for suspected pneumonia tested positive for Covid-19, raising the prospect that the virus arrived in Europe a month earlier than previously thought.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Data gathered through the Covid-19 symptom-tracking app developed at King\u2019s College London also suggests that people were falling ill from coronavirus in the UK from the beginning of January. \u201cThe reports I am getting are from people who were ill from early January onwards and strongly suggest they had Covid-19 but were not recognised as such,\u201d the epidemiologist professor Tim Spector <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tracker-app-suggests-coronavirus-arrived-at-new-year-rcsvkdrgn\">said last month</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/sage-minutes-reveal-how-uk-advisers-reacted-to-coronavirus-crisis\">Recently released minutes</a> from the meetings of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) show that in January that the group felt unable to plan for \u201cthe worst case&nbsp;scenario\u201d because of the uncertainty around the data coming out of China. On 13 March, over a week before lockdown was introduced, the group concluded \u201cthere are more cases in the UK than previously thought and we may therefore be further ahead of the epidemic curve\u201d.</p> \n<p>The WHO has urged countries to investigate any other early suspicious cases, so that the circulation of the virus can be better understood, encouraging doctors to check records for pneumonia cases of unspecified origin in late 2019. Public Health England has also acknowledged that it \u201ccannot exclude the possibility that Covid-19 was in the UK in December or early January\u201d.</p> \n<p>Andrew Soppitt, a retired hospital consultant from West Sussex, is convinced he became infected with coronavirus on a skiing trip to Austria in late January. The ski resorts he visited, St Anton and Bad Hofgastein, were the suspected locus of many subsequent infections. \u201cI was really ill. I felt like death. I just couldn\u2019t get out of bed. I could barely get up the stairs. I lost my sense of taste and smell. I started having sweats,\u201d he said. Soppitt made repeated requests to be tested through the NHS 111 service, but was refused.</p> \n<p>Earlier this month, the former intensive care specialist, who is in his mid-50s, got the results back from a privately-bought antibody test, which showed he had had the disease at some point but can\u2019t pinpoint when. He says he is certain, though. \u201cIt absolutely confirms that I had it February after the trip to Austria in January. It is now blindingly obvious that it was about before people admitted it.\u201d</p> \n<p>But if there were cases in the UK earlier than previously thought, then why did the virus only start to escalate when it did? The answer, says Baker, is that it probably took an influx of infected people before the epidemic really started to grow in the UK.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was around February half term, people coming back from skiing holidays in northern Italy \u2013 that\u2019s probably what brought back a bulk of the [first] cases. It\u2019s really at the point when you get a number of introductions in one go that onward transmission is more likely to happen \u2026 as soon as you get a certain number of the population infected in one go then you make that expansion of an epidemic [more likely].\u201d</p> \n<p>Not everybody who has coronavirus is equally infectious and, if there were cases earlier in the year, they may not have had enough contact with others to form significant outbreaks, said Baker. \u201cWhen you\u2019re ill, you tend to stay at home, so people may have been self-isolating on the basis that they didn\u2019t feel very well.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Another possibility, says Nathalie MacDermott, clinical lecturer in infectious diseases at King\u2019s College London, is that the virus was \u201csmouldering under the surface for a long time and we weren\u2019t necessarily identifying it\u201d. If, as some research suggests, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/covid-19-transmission-rate-stable-for-third-week-says-ons\">a large proportion of coronavirus infections are asymptomatic</a>, then the virus could have been spreading silently and gaining access to more vulnerable sections of the population.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe elderly population, generally speaking, are a little bit less likely in the first place to come into contact with it, because they are not in a workplace where they are having frequent contact with people. They go out, but it might be more limited \u2026 So maybe it took a while to get to widespread community transmission and to start affecting our older population.\u201d</p> \n<p>The idea that coronavirus was spreading in Europe as early as December and January has serious public health implications, a fact that has propelled Catherine Mayer to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/28/andy-gill-gang-of-four-to-release-guitarists-final-recordings\">look for answers after her husband\u2019s death</a>. She and the specialist who treated Gill hope to be able to do antibody tests on samples from him and his tour manager to establish whether they had the disease.</p> \n<p><em>\u201c</em>How many hundreds of thousands of Covid-19 deaths might have been prevented by greater transparency and quicker and better public health responses, and not just in China but elsewhere?\u201d wrote Mayer.</p>",
  "<p>Patson Daka has just spent half an hour recounting the journey that led from school playing fields in Zambia to the spearhead of Red Bull Salzburg\u2019s attack, so it seems cheap to follow up with the kind of question that speaks of football\u2019s maddening impatience levels. But he is about to resume a season whose success can be measured by a strike rate of a goal every 74 minutes in Austria\u2019s Bundesliga, so here goes: would it be fair to say he is the next Erling Braut Haaland?</p> <p>There is laughter at one end of the line and some relief at the other. \u201cI\u2019m not the next anything,\u201d Daka says. \u201cThere\u2019ll only be one Haaland and there\u2019ll only be one Patson.

When Salzburg resume their title chase against Rapid Vienna on Wednesday he will be seeking his 18th&nbsp;goal of the domestic league campaign and he is now their leading man. At 21, he is also the latest player to the fore of a production line whose diversity is unmatched.</p> <p>\u201cErling did his part to help and has left this opportunity for the rest of us, so now it\u2019s time to elevate ourselves also,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was always a kind of competition between the two of us where we wanted to improve each other. In football, and life, things happen quicker for some people and we don\u2019t expect everything to move at the same pace for everyone. I think I\u2019ve needed a bit more time to discover myself and develop more. We all just knew it was his time, his moment.\u201d</p> <p>Daka&nbsp;knows&nbsp;he had ground to make up. One of the few parallels with Haaland\u2019s background was the presence of a footballing father. Growing up in Kafue, a town in south-central Zambia, his earliest memories were of watching his dad, Nathtali, cause havoc on the wings for Nitrogen Stars. Nathtali never needed an excuse to find a ball, or fashion one, and share his passion with his son. But he died before he could see the spectacular returns and Daka is spurred by determination to honour his memory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have the opportunities I have today,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel I have achieved the dream he had for me, to see me play at a high level and come to Europe, and create my own legacy. It drives me every time because, wherever he is today, he is proud of me.\u201d</p> <p>The tale of Daka\u2019s breakthrough involves a mite of good fortune but is primarily a modern success story of talent identification in previously-overlooked areas. In 2012 he was sitting an exam when Airtel Rising Stars \u2013 a pan-African grassroots initiative sponsored by the eponymous telecoms company \u2013 arrived to hold trials behind his school.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d just finished writing when one of my friends told me: \u2018Some people have come to select players to represent the province, maybe we can go and you can try your luck.\u2019 We went along and they were about to start. I knew one of the coaches and he told me to rush home for my training kit so I could be a part of it. I ran there and back. After playing for less then 10 minutes, they removed me from the pitch and said: \u2018OK, wait for us here.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c4ad998fe52c67c2a7a541bc6654b6284c12c08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c4ad998fe52c67c2a7a541bc6654b6284c12c08/0_67_1936_1162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zambia\u2019s Patson Daka (left) gets in ahead of Valentine Ozornwafor of Nigeria in the Africa Under-23 Cup of Nations last November.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zambia\u2019s Patson Daka (left) gets in ahead of Valentine Ozornwafor of Nigeria in the Africa Under-23 Cup of Nations last November.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mohamed Abd El Ghany/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They had seen enough and Daka has not looked back. Within a year he was captaining a Zambia team picked from thousands who had attended Airtel\u2019s trials; they were runners-up at a tournament in Nigeria, where he finished top scorer. He was called up to the senior national team at 16; by then he was a star at under-17 level and already coming under harsh scrutiny in the domestic top flight.</p> <p>\u201cI played one season, scored two goals and gave one assist,\u201d he says of a barren campaign on loan from Kafue Celtics to Nchanga Rangers. \u201cI moved again [to Power Dynamos], scored once in the first half of the season and the fans didn\u2019t want me. At one point almost the whole country didn\u2019t want to see my name in the national team. But then I started scoring in every game and came out top scorer for the club. That\u2019s how things changed.\u201d</p> <p>The rewards would follow. In 2015 he was spotted by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9 while playing at the Africa Under-17 Cup of Nations. Kanout\u00e9\u2019s agency, 12 Management, works closely with Salzburg and within two years Daka was playing for their feeder club, FC Liefering.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/01/manchester-united-extend-odion-ighalo-loan-to-31-january\">Manchester United extend Odion Ighalo's loan to 31 January</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt, no second option,\u201d he says when asked whether Salzburg, whose alumni include Sadio Man\u00e9 and Naby Ke\u00efta, have cultivated the perfect environment for an African player. \u201cTo see how they have made their names here gives me confidence and I feel like: \u2018OK, this is the right place for me.\u2019 It\u2019s the No 1 team for every Zambian now; people are always asking me: \u2018Can you talk to the Red Bull people and ask them to come to us?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Six months after arriving in Austria, Daka was joined by one of his closest friends. Enock Mwepu, a dynamic midfielder destined for the top, was another beneficiary of that Airtel scheme and when they first met as 13-year-olds the idea of a new life 4,500 miles from home would have been a fairytale.</p> <p>\u201cI pushed him so hard, tried to give him tips for what to do and what not to do, so he could also make it and we could be together,\u201d Daka says of Mwepu\u2019s initial arrival on trial. \u201cI was given almost everything I needed here but there\u2019s just that feeling of missing home, so to be with someone who has been like family was some relief and another reason to focus.

In the short term his focus is on retaining Salzburg\u2019s title, a task made easier when the previous leaders, Lask Linz, were deducted six points for breaking Covid-19 training regulations.

  "<p>Which film has the most extras? As a child, Richard Attenborough\u2019s Gandhi was just the answer to a trivia question. Growing up in India in the 90s and 00s, we knew the great man\u2019s story inside out. At school, history textbooks waxed poetic about his legend; our parents counselled us to emulate him by practising celibacy and turning the other cheek. Watching the movie, telecast every year punctually on his birthday, was never a priority.

What does Gandhi represent in our post-truth world? His image still stares out at us from Indian rupee bills, but all talk of non-violence is bunkum in an age where the threat of nuclear annihilation is the only deterrent to endless wars. Back home, in Narendra Modi\u2019s India, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-49922319\">Hindu supremacists steal his ashes from memorials</a> and shamelessly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/17/modi-gandhi-campaigns-end-indian-election\">praise his assassin as a patriot</a>.

When the film begins, Gandhi is already old and bald and walking with a stoop \u2013 walking, in fact, to the prayer meeting where he will be shot dead. Is the sound of flies hovering in the background meant to suggest we are in India? Soon enough brown men and women are peering out from the sides of the frame, dutifully exchanging salaams and namaskars.&nbsp;</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7I6D3mSYTE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B7I6D3mSYTE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7I6D3mSYTE\">Watch a trailer for Gandhi</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The story swiftly falls into a pattern: mumbling natives, a few good white men. Ben Kingsley never quite disappears into the role. He sticks out in a group of Indian actors with his elaborate pauses, in a way I doubt Gandhi ever did. The film itself is a litany of speeches: the young Gandhi, as a lawyer in South Africa, exhorting his fellow Indian immigrants to burn their passes; then, an hour later, dressed in a loincloth in India, brainstorming about the best way to gain independence. The country\u2019s turbulent struggle for freedom is portrayed as a school elocution contest, with breaks in plush drawing rooms where a select few glumly deliberate on \u201cpeople out there\u201d. It will be some time before I recover from the scenes of Kingsley addressing Indian villagers in English, his uppity outbursts of \u201cMy dear!\u201d and \u201cO Lord!\u201d and \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, stop it!\u201d</p> <p>The list of liberties Attenborough takes with history is long and not always amusing.

Attenborough would have us believe that the British empire became a liability due to a few errant officials: a psychotic General Dyer ordering the brutal <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Jallianwala-Bagh-Massacre\">Jallianwala Bagh massacre</a> in Amritsar, an overzealous police inspector quick to arrest Gandhi. What is suppressed, as any schoolboy in India will tell you, is the wilfulness with which the British fomented religious antagonisms in the subcontinent, through their deceitful strategy of <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/08/partition-british-game-divide-rule-170808101655163.html\">divide and rule</a>. The ending of the film makes for unbearable watching, since the imperial culpability in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/31/break-silence-partition-british-colonial-history-south-asian\">partition</a> is never explored. The violence of those years comes across as an endorsement of the colonial logic that deemed Indians unfit to rule themselves. Jallianwala Bagh, on the other hand, is carefully presented as a wayward brigadier\u2019s lapse, in no way reflective of the Raj.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e2bcb54acbbb69965ae3166fc414e5b449260cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e2bcb54acbbb69965ae3166fc414e5b449260cf/0_0_1810_1190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Through British eyes \u2026 Geraldine James, right, as Mirabehn, with Rohini Hattangadi and Ben Kingsley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"657\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Through British eyes \u2026 Geraldine James, right, as Mirabehn, with Rohini Hattangadi and Ben Kingsley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Columbia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What was Gandhi like in his private moments, when he was not reciting his fortune-cookie quotes? What was he like as a father, a husband? Over three hours, we don\u2019t get to find out. A revolutionary like Gandhi is incapable of being the bland saviour Attenborough makes him out to be. The second half moves forward smoothly, but that is because the story is now seen through the eyes of a British woman: <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mirabehn\">Mira</a><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mirabehn\">behn</a>, born Madeleine Slade, a disciple of Gandhi. In contrast, the confusion of the first half can be attributed to the absence of a credible outsider (read: white person) who can bear witness to the narrative. To be fair, there is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Freer_Andrews\">CF Andrews</a>, a priest and close friend of Gandhi\u2019s, and of course Vince Walker, the intrepid New York Times correspondent played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/martin-sheen\">Martin Sheen</a> \u2013 and inspired by the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bellers03/status/1266174838374313992\">real-life journalist Webb Miller</a> \u2013 but they both lack the confidence of the disciple who will always assure her guru: \u201cI know that you are right.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>For an epic movie, Gandhi is redeemed by its cameo performances. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/21/daniel-day-lewis-an-extraordinary-career-of-acting-artistry-is-it-really-all-over\">Daniel Day-Lewis</a> as a racist teenager! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4IGyT_9vjg\">Om Puri</a> as a repenting rioter! But there too, a sense of being cast as extras in one\u2019s own play persists, as we see iconic Indian names \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/16/saeed-jaffrey\">Saeed Jaffrey</a>, <a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/celebrity/story/7-iconic-alyque-padamsee-ad-films-that-india-will-always-thank-him-for-1390593-2018-11-17\">Alyque Padamsee</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/if-neena-gupta-could-go-back-in-time-i-wouldnt-have-a-child-outside-marriage-2164348\">Neena Gupta</a> \u2013 relegated to bit-parts when no Indian actor was apparently ever in the running to play Gandhi. And it isn\u2019t just a question of the movie not having aged well. Halfway through one of Gandhi\u2019s speeches in South Africa, a guest whispers to another on stage: \u201cHe has become quite good at this.\u201d Except that Kingsley hasn\u2019t. He still looks as awkward as before, mouthing his lines like someone who has practised them one too many times. The glibness is true to type for a film that claims to be something it isn\u2019t.</p>",

Inheritance is a collection to engage not only the reader who knows all about contemporary poetry and probably writes it, but everyone who appreciates elegant craft, shapely storytelling and delicate love lyrics, with a touch of acerbic mischief to offset melancholy and no \u201cpoetic\u201d pretentiousness whatever.</p> <p>Bailey is best known as an award-winning&nbsp;novelist, and a consummate writer in a number of prose genres. <a href=\"https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/paul-bailey\">His \u201cauthor statement\u201d</a> on the British Council website &nbsp;is several years out of date, to judge by the bibliography, but its conclusion helps illuminate the style he brings to poetry. \u201cI share Isaac Babel\u2019s lifelong ambition to write with simplicity, brevity and precision,\u201d he states. \u201cIt was he who said: \u2018No steel can pierce the human heart so chillingly as a period at the right moment.\u2019 I hope one or two of my full stops have done, and will do, just that.\u201d</p> <p>Poem has exemplary \u201csimplicity, brevity and precision\u201d and lays bare the art of the well-placed period.&nbsp;The silent beat is important in any poetry kit, whether in the form of punctuation mark, line break, stanza break or the gaps and steps of the experimental poet\u2019s work. Full stops are often pivotal, and sometimes final. Bailey\u2019s Poem is concerned with the symbolic full stop as well as the literal:&nbsp;each stanza meditates on the \u201clast of days\u201d as they occur in the chronology of the speaker\u2019s life, and there is a co-terminal full stop and a new opening sentence for each stanza, until the poem\u2019s last word.&nbsp;</p> <p>I was reminded of the thought recorded by Henry James on suffering a stroke near the end of his life: <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/flashbks/james/jnote.htm\">\u201cSo here it is at last, the distinguished thing.\u201d</a></p> <p>There is a common sense of expectation \u2013 even, almost, hope - fulfilled. (\u201cSo here it is at last \u2026\u201d) Poem is haunted by the anticipation of dying. It\u2019s a common one, of course: there probably aren\u2019t many writers who fail to rehearse the way their own story will end. It might be one of the psychological essentials for writing, though some (and some literary eras) are more drawn to it than others. Philip Larkin is another death-haunted writer who springs to mind.</p> <p>Bailey brings characteristic humour to his youthful self-portrait: \u201cI cherished the idea of being doomed. / My happiest day was when a stranger said / I looked like Keats.\u201d But death begins a lot earlier for Bailey, as a word temporarily to end all others.&nbsp;He recalls a childhood illness, undergone at a point when he would have been relishing the still-new gift of talk. As a result, \u201cwords absconded from me\u201d: the intrusion of the \u201cdistinguished thing\u201d \u2013 as word, as idea, and personally relevant \u2013 led to a new level of silent thinking. The word sank deep, and changed time itself.</p> <p>Bailey pursues the concept of time given shape by death in his refrain, \u201cMy last of days.\u201d It\u2019s not difficult to understand, and yet it has a mirage-like quality and defies exact interpretation. As it\u2019s repeatedly applied to the different phases of the protagonist\u2019s life it becomes incantation. The preference for the formulation \u201clast of days\u201d over a simple \u201clast day\u201d suggests a finite quantity of days inexorably running out. It diffuses the sense of conclusion over a wider time span: there are days before \u201cthe last of days\u201d that are leading towards it. The contemplation is not simply melancholy: there\u2019s an extended pleasure in it, too. I think this is why the phrase is particularly haunting: it opens an ambiguous space, a space to which any reader of poetry appreciates an invitation. In fact, all the small narratives incorporated into the poem are like that. Readers are given only the simplest of outlines.</p> <p>If we know Bailey\u2019s work well, and have read his biographies, we can of course insert a richer landscape along the way, but it\u2019s not a prerequisite for making imaginative connection with the poem. The clean, plain, prosaic lines of the narrative and the rhetorical, wistful music of the refrain are everything needed.</p> <p>In the penultimate stanza, the focus shifts from the self to the \u201clast of days\u201d of \u201cfriends I loved\u201d. This \u201cabundance\u201d of mourning sharpens the reality and finality of death, and makes a bridge of feeling to the new self-perception of the terse last stanza. \u201cMy last of days is getting closer now. / I fear I have to welcome it.\u201d</p> <p>The expression \u201cI fear\u201d may signal a typically English understatement, as if the writer really wanted to say, apologetically but perhaps with wry amusement, something like: \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t admit this, but I\u2019m afraid I welcome my last of days.\u201d On the other hand \u201cI fear\u201d may signal simply that: fear. This doesn\u2019t cancel out the positive aspect of \u201cwelcome\u201d but suggests obligation.&nbsp;There\u2019s an unnerving, but perhaps faintly bracing, absence of choice regarding the last full stop.</p> <p>One further, happier thought: this is a new poem, written since Inheritance was published, and it\u2019s among Bailey\u2019s best.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",

Changes to lockdown regulations today also include letting people outside for work, worship, exercise or shopping, and allowing mines and factories to run at full capacity.</p> <h2><strong>Manila eases lockdown</strong></h2> <p>Traffic jams and crowds of commuters returned to the Philippine capital on Monday, as Manilla relaxed antivirus measures in a high-stakes gamble to slowly reopen the economy while fighting the coronavirus outbreak.&nbsp;Public transport was still limited and many commuters waited for hours to get a ride despite the government deploying special buses. School classes remain suspended for the next two weeks. Barber shops and beauty salons can open next week at a third of their capacity. The Philippines remains a south-east Asian hotspot for Covid-19, with more than 18,000 infections and 957 deaths.</p> <h2><strong>Japan may open doors to travellers from selected countries</strong></h2> <p>Japan is considering reopening its borders to travellers from selected countries that have low levels of coronavirus infections, as it begins to ease restrictions put in place earlier this year to control the outbreak. As schools, cinemas, sports clubs and department stores reopened in Tokyo on Monday, media have reported that the government is also planning to allow travellers in from Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand in the coming months. There was no immediate comment from the foreign ministry.</p> <h2><strong>Brazil passes 500,000 Covid-19 cases</strong></h2> <p>Brazil has reported 16,409 new cases, taking the total of infected cases to 514,849. It keeps the country in second place in terms of infections, behind the US on 1.78 million cases. Brazil has moved into fourth in terms of deaths, with 29,314 fatalities, according to the health ministry. President Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly dismissed the severity of the virus and continued to flout social distancing measures. On Sunday he road a horse to a rally calling for the supreme court to be shut down for investigating him.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Africa approaches 145,000 confirmed cases</h2> <p>Nearly 145,000 people have now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/01/coronavirus-live-news-brazil-passes-500000-covid-19-cases-as-india-extends-lockdown-in-high-risk-zones?page=with:block-5ed4d4ab8f08f5e3730123de#block-5ed4d4ab8f08f5e3730123de\">tested positive for the coronavirus in&nbsp;Africa</a>, the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office for the continent says. So far out of those cases reported by its 54 countries, more than 61,100 people have recovered and 4,100 have died. South Africa, sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s most industrialised nation, has the most cases, while&nbsp;Egypt, at the other end of the continent, has counted the most deaths.</p> <h2><strong>Moscow eases lockdown despite high virus caseload</strong></h2> <p>Shopping malls and parks are reopening in Moscow on Monday as the Russian capital eases coronavirus restrictions despite having the world\u2019s third-largest caseload, with 405,843 infections. The relaxation of the confinement orders in Moscow, the centre of Russia\u2019s outbreak with a population of more than 12 million, comes after Vladimir Putin announced the epidemic had passed its peak in the country.&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>Lee Bowyer has warned clubs to expect more footballers to refuse to play for fear of injury after revealing Charlton\u2019s talisman Lyle Taylor is one of three players who have said they will not take the field when the Championship resumes. The season is due to restart on 20 June but the club\u2019s top goalscorer, who is out of contract at the end of the month, informed Bowyer he does not wish to play because an injury could jeopardise his chances of a \u201clife-changing move\u201d.</p> <p>The 30-year-old has not trained with the club since last Tuesday and Bowyer admitted he twice failed in his efforts to change Taylor\u2019s mind.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes my job a hell of a lot harder to win games but it is something I cannot control,\u201d Bowyer told the Guardian. \u201cI can\u2019t make him play. But at the same time, I understand his situation \u2013 and it\u2019s difficult because he\u2019s got a chance of earning life-changing money. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s a young lad and he\u2019s got many years in front of him. I half understand because he may not get this opportunity again.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor has scored 11 goals in 22 matches this season despite knee and thigh injuries and last season scored 25 goals as the club were promoted via the League One play-offs. Bowyer compared Taylor\u2019s influence at the relegation-threatened club to Troy Deeney at Watford and admitted he is torn by the forward\u2019s decision. \u201cI\u2019m pleased for him because he\u2019s worked hard for me for two years \u2013 he\u2019s a big reason we are in the division with his goals last season \u2013 but at the same time I needed him now, until the end, to help us,\u201d Bowyer said. \u201cWe are not a one-man team, for sure we are not, but he has been our talisman.\u201d</p> <p>The long-serving Charlton defender Chris Solly, also out of contract this month, equally does not wish to play for fear of injury, while David Davis, the Birmingham loanee, has told Bowyer he will not play because of concerns over player safety. Around 1,400 EFL players are out of contract at the end of June and Bowyer admitted he expects more to reject the chance to play between now and the resumption of the season. \u201cFor sure, for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cLyle Taylor and Chris Solly aren\u2019t going to be the only ones.\u201d</p>",

But in city after city, law enforcement agencies seem determined to prove the protesters right, by responding with a hefty dose of police brutality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why\">The answer to police violence is not 'reform'. It's defunding. Here's why  | Alex S Vitale</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is no shortage of examples of police using excessive force against protesters. In <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/31/21275994/police-violence-peaceful-protesters-images\">New York</a>, officers who had intentionally covered their badge numbers \u201cpulled down the mask of a peaceful protester, who had his hands up, and pepper-sprayed him in the face\u201d. In Salt Lake City, an older man with a cane was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bubbaprog/status/1266908354821206016\">shoved to the ground</a>. In Austin, police shot a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayjanner/status/1267111893753307137\">pregnant woman</a> in the stomach with a \u201cnon-lethal\u201d round. There were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drivenbyboredom/status/1267263490009546753\">scenes</a> reminiscent of the infamously brutal suppression of demonstrators at the 1968 Chicago Democratic convention. As Reason<em> </em><a href=\"https://reason.com/2020/05/31/d-c-cops-kept-herding-protesters-into-harms-way/\">concluded</a>, officers around the country acted with \u201ctotal disregard for protesters\u2019 safety or rights\u201d.</p> <p>There was no real need for those New York officers to disguise their badge numbers. After all, even when police officers\u2019 names are fully known, there is rarely any accountability. The whole reason protesters are angry is that it seems American cops can get away with almost anything. In 2016, an Arizona police officer <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/09/us/police-shooting-video-arizona.html\">executed a man</a> who was pleading for his life. It was on video. The officer was <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/daniel-shaver-shooting-ex-arizona-police-officer-not-guilty-murder-n827641\">acquitted</a>. This was not an exceptional case; it <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/police-officers-convicted-fatal-shootings-are-exception-not-rule-n982741\">happens over and over</a>. If outright murder goes unpunished, no officer need every worry about getting in trouble for blinding and maiming a few protesters.&nbsp;</p> <p>Of course, it\u2019s the protesters who are called violent, even when the overwhelming majority do nothing but march and chant \u2013&nbsp;though they <em>do </em>refuse to back down, and challenging authority can be a capital crime in a police state. There have certainly been plenty of instances of vandalism and theft accompanying demonstrations, but it\u2019s important to make a clear distinction between acts of property destruction and actual violence. Setting a police car on fire is very costly to taxpayers, but harm to human bodies should be far more disturbing.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Setting a police car on fire is very costly to taxpayers, but harm to human bodies should be far more disturbing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>American police have been brutal for a long time, and both Democratic and Republican presidents have failed to successfully reform them. Barack Obama\u2019s justice department was admirable for <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-baltimore-chicago-police-2016-story.html\">at least investigating</a> a number of egregiously out-of-control departments, though <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/08/wait-do-people-actually-know-just-how-evil-this-man-is/\">outright criminals like Joe Arpaio</a> managed to remain in power throughout Obama\u2019s term. Donald Trump made it clear from the outset that if it was up to him, police could brutalize people with total impunity \u2013&nbsp;he even explicitly encouraged cops to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/28/16059536/trump-cops-speech-gang-violence-long-island\">rough people up during arrests</a>. <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/05/trumps-george-floyd-obama-protest-police-violence-kneeling.html\">According to</a> the Trump-supporting head of the Minneapolis police union, the president has reversed Obama\u2019s policies by \u201cletting the cops do their job, put the handcuffs on the criminals instead of us\u201d. But when cops kill, as in the case of George Floyd, they need to be the ones with the handcuffs on. Otherwise they have a license to freely murder citizens.&nbsp;</p> <p>There have been commendable exceptions to the pattern of police misconduct. In Michigan, a local sheriff <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/31/us/flint-michigan-protest-police-trnd/index.html\">marched with protesters</a> and in New York, several officers shocked protesters by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/31/us/nypd-officers-kneel-with-protesters-trnd/index.html\">joining them in taking a knee</a>. But it seems to be that there are just a few \u201cgood apples\u201d in a generally rotten bunch. The frequency of aggressive, militarized responses to civil demonstrations suggests there is something very deeply wrong with police culture and with policing as an institution.</p> <p>At the very least, we need to seriously demilitarize the police, so that they do not appear to be an occupying army, <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2017/10/21/when-local-cops-drive-tanks-the-deadly-consequences-of-militarizing-mayberry/\">complete with tanks</a>. But there are serious criminal punishment scholars <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/10/15/alex-vitale-interview-the-end-of-policing/\">who have suggested</a> we need to talk about \u201cending the police\u201d altogether. By this, they do not mean allowing anyone to victimize anyone else without fear of consequences, or ceasing to protect the population from threats. Rather, they mean totally rethinking how laws are enforced and how social problems are addressed. Having a militarized force respond to situations that require social workers trained to deal with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Charles_Kinsey\">mental health issues</a> has often made things <a href=\"https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/family-of-man-killed-by-cpd-says-he-was-mentally-ill-should-not-have-been-shot\">tragically worse rather than better</a>. Frankly, fire departments seem like they would do a much better job addressing many of the situations that police are now dispatched to deal with. Firefighters actually protect and serve, while police too often act like squads of armed thugs rather than compassionate and helpful community servants.&nbsp;</p> <p>In theory, the police are supposed to protect the community. When they are whacking the community with sticks, and firing teargas into it, they are more like an armed gang than keepers of the peace. When police show no interest in obeying the constitution or treating protesters with dignity and care, then they should cease to command respect. A police force that runs amok does not deserve to be called \u201claw enforcement\u201d. They are rioters, plain and simple.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>Nathan Robinson is a Guardian US columnist and the editor of Current Affairs</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>The prime minister announced on Thursday that groups of up to six people could meet outdoors in England from Monday, permitting what he described as \u201ca long-awaited and joyful moment\u201d as family and friends reunite after 10 weeks in lockdown. He set out the next stage in the easing of restrictions with a caveat that \u201cthere may still be some anomalies, or apparent inconsistencies, in these rules\u201d.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamWagner1/status/1267419302799593472\">police have published updated instructions</a> on what is now permitted under the updated public health regulations setting out the restrictions on gatherings and overnight stays away from home. The government has also published an <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/558/regulation/2/made\">updated version</a> of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) regulations. </p> <h2>Can I see my family and friends?</h2> <p>Yes. Whereas people in England were previously allowed to meet one person from another household outside while maintaining a two-metre distance, from Monday, groups of up to six will be allowed to meet. People will be permitted to congregate in gardens and other private outdoor spaces, instead of just in public spaces, as Johnson said \u201cthere is no difference in the health risk\u201d.</p> <p>The prime minister said people should try to avoid seeing people from too many households in quick succession, \u201cso that we can avoid the risk of quick transmission from lots of different families and continue to control the virus\u201d.</p> <p>The government also announced that from Monday, the 2.2 million people who have been \u201cshielding\u201d from Covid-19 in England because they are deemed to be clinically extremely vulnerable will be allowed to spend time outdoors for the first time in 10 weeks. They will be able to go outside with members of their household while continuing to follow physical distancing guidelines. Those who live alone can meet outside with one other person from another household.</p> <p>Reviews of the shielding guidance are expected to be made at regular points in the coming weeks.</p> <p>In Scotland, people from one household will be able to meet with another household outdoors in public spaces or a private garden from Friday, providing they maintain physical distancing. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the maximum number of people in a group should be eight.</p> <p>The approach in Wales is similar. People in a household will be able to meet with one other household outdoors from Monday. In Northern Ireland, groups of six are already allowed to meet outdoors. The Stormont executive plans to confirm the further easing of lockdown regulations after a meeting on 4 June but it is expected to allow small outdoor wedding ceremonies, attended by no more than 10 people.</p> <h2>Does that mean we can have a barbecue?</h2> <p>Yes. \u201cYou can even have a barbecue providing you do it in a socially distanced way, provided everybody washes their hands, provided everybody exercises common sense,\u201d said the prime minister. . The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, added that those having a barbecue should remember they can spread the virus by passing things from one person to another.</p> <h2>Can we go into other people\u2019s homes?</h2> <p>Yes and no. The UK government has said the science makes it clear the chances of spreading coronavirus is much smaller outside so socialising inside is not allowed.</p> <p>However, the prime minister said people could go through houses to access back gardens. Whitty also confirmed it was acceptable for people to use their host\u2019s toilet, as long as they washed their hands thoroughly and wiped down surfaces afterwards.</p> <p>The Welsh government has also said it is OK for people to walk through someone\u2019s home to get to their garden but they would be publishing guidance on how to do this safely.</p> <p>In Scotland, Sturgeon said: \u201cIf the distance [from your own home] is so far that you would have to use someone else\u2019s bathroom, then perhaps you shouldn\u2019t be doing it.\u201d</p> <h2>How far can we travel?</h2> <p>While people in England can travel as far as they want to take exercise and spend time outside, they cannot stay over at people\u2019s houses. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to go to other households and stay there. I\u2019m afraid we are not at that stage,\u201d said Johnson.</p> <p>In Wales people are being asked to stay local, which is defined as about 8km (five miles) from their homes. Sturgeon said there would be no legal limit on how far people in Scotland could travel but she said the strong advice was to stay within five miles.</p> <h2>Can I do non-essential shopping?</h2> <p>Yes. Outdoor retail such as markets and car showrooms in England will be allowed to open in England from Monday. Other non-essential shops can open a fortnight later, as long as they abide by the guidelines.</p> <p>In Scotland, garden centres and plant nurseries will be able to open from Friday. The Welsh government will decide whether non-essential retail will reopen at their next lockdown review on 18 June, though they said such businesses, which could comply with the physical distancing duty, should prepare to reopen.</p> <h2>Can children go to school?</h2> <p>The UK government confirmed it was pushing ahead with plans to open primary schools in England to some pupils from Monday, giving headteachers three days of half-term&nbsp;holiday to make final preparations. Nurseries and childcare providers in England are also being told they can reopen from 1 June. However, some local authorities have insisted schools in their area will not be opening.</p> <p>In Scotland, teachers can return to schools from Monday to prepare for&nbsp;the start of the new school year on 11 August, when pupils will do a mixture of at-home and in-school learning. The governments in Wales and Northern Ireland have said schools will not reopen on Monday.</p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/20/trump-threatens-cut-states-election-funding-mail-in-ballot-plans\">escalating baseless attacks</a> on mail-in voting in what appears to be an obvious effort to sow doubt about the fairness of the 2020 election.</p> <p>The president has long made false accusations about voter fraud, claiming without evidence that 3-5 million Americans voted illegally <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/01/23/at-white-house-trump-tells-congressional-leaders-3-5-million-illegal-ballots-cost-him-the-popular-vote/\">in the 2016 election</a>. But his barrage against mail-in voting is particularly alarming ahead of an election during the Covid-19 pandemic, where there is likely to be severely limited in-person voting and many Americans will probably vote by mail for the first time. Advocates worry voters who don\u2019t want to risk their health and vote in person could also be swayed by Trump\u2019s rhetoric, not feel comfortable voting by mail, and simply choose not to vote at all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/27/honest-elections-project-conservative-voting-restrictions\">Revealed: conservative group fighting to restrict voting tied to powerful dark money network</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Trump\u2019s menacing rhetoric could discourage some people, particularly minority groups, from casting mail-in votes, said Domingo Garcia, president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, which advocates on behalf of Hispanic Americans.</p> <p>\u201cIt could have a chilling effect and I think that\u2019s the intent,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Trump is using his bully platform to try to discourage people from voting and to try to stop people from voting by mail.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s tweets on mail-in voting in recent weeks have been a mix of unsubstantiated claims and outright falsehoods.

But Albright said Trump\u2019s comments were worrisome in a larger context of aggressive Republican efforts to police voting.</p> <p>In Georgia, Albright noted, Brad Raffensperger, the secretary of state, has encouraged absentee voting but also created an \u201c<a href=\"https://sos.ga.gov/index.php/elections/secretary_of_state_brad_raffensperger_appoints_absentee_ballot_fraud_task_force_\">absentee ballot fraud taskforce</a>\u201d stacked with prosecutors to monitor mail-in voting. In Texas, which severely restricts absentee voting, Ken Paxton, the attorney general, <a href=\"https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/admin/2020/Press/4.14.20%20Letter%20to%20Rep.%20Klick.pdf\">warned</a> of possible \u201ccriminal sanctions\u201d for anyone who advised a voter they could use Covid-19 as the basis for requesting a mail-in ballot.</p> <p>\u201cThat one-two punch is what makes it very intimidating,\u201d Albright said. \u201cIt does influence people and does intimidate people and makes some folks feel like this is not something they want to engage in.\u201d</p> <p>The Republican National Committee is also seeking to recruit up to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/us/Voting-republicans-trump.html\">50,000 volunteers</a> to monitor voting this fall, the first time in nearly three decades when they won\u2019t be under a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/01/09/576858203/decades-old-consent-decree-lifted-against-rncs-ballot-security-measures\">federal court order</a> barring them from engaging in poll-watching activity.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is growing alarm that Trump\u2019s rhetoric will lay the groundwork to contest the results of the presidential election once the ballots are counted. Unlike past elections, America is unlikely to know the winner of the presidential race on election night as officials count ballots coming in (some states allow ballots to be counted as long as they are postmarked by election day).</p> <p>The candidate who appears to be ahead on election day may ultimately end up losing as more ballots are counted. And a candidate could use the gap in getting official results to claim widespread fraud, said Nathaniel Persily, a law professor at Stanford University who closely studies elections.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s where the disinformation and the polarizing rhetoric and questioning of the legitimacy of elections could come in. You say there\u2019s something fishy with the mail ballots if they are not reflective of the percentage that has not been revealed up to that point.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Republicans offered a preview of this in 2018, when they <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-california-elections_n_5c004a8ae4b027f1097be7a7\">suggested there was something amiss</a> as Democrats in California congressional races picked up votes as the state continued to count mail-in ballots after election day. In Florida, Trump and Rick Scott, then the state\u2019s governor, <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rick-scott-recount-law-enforcement-fraud_n_5be4fb42e4b0e8438895dc54\">baselessly accused</a> election officials of fraud as they counted ballots in a US Senate race Scott was running in.&nbsp;</p> <p>To shore up confidence in the results of the election, a consortium of experts recommended last month that states and media organizations make it clear they expect a delay in reporting official results well ahead of election night.</p> <p>Accepting the legitimate transfer of power is crucial to the foundation of American democracy.

He touted the achievement as a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d and a preview of what he could deliver in a second term.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cSleepy Joe can\u2019t do this,\u201d Trump said, lacing into his Democratic rival Joe Biden. He added, not too subtly: \u201cI hope the seniors are going to remember it.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Older voters, America\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/essay/an-early-look-at-the-2020-electorate/\">largest and most reliable</a> voting bloc, have for years punched above their political weight. Over the past two decades, Republicans maintained an advantage with this constituency, and in 2016 their outsized political influence in key swing states such as Michigan and Wisconsin were essential to Trump\u2019s electoral victory.&nbsp;But there are signs that may be changing.</p> <p>The White House event, staged during the last week of what Trump designated \u201cOlder Americans Month\u201d, came as a string of national and battleground state polls show the president\u2019s support declining with older voters, amid his erratic handling of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>These voters are the most vulnerable to Covid-19, which has already claimed the lives of more than 100,000 Americans. A Quinnipiac University <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=3661\">poll</a> released last week shows Biden leading Trump by 10 points among voters 65 and older.&nbsp;</p> <p>The president\u2019s troubles with older voters began before the coronavirus spread to the US. But political strategists in both parties say the shortcomings of his response to the virus has only deepened the problem.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest factor right now is that older Americans are disproportionately impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d said Michael Steele, a Republican political strategist. \u201cTheir friends are dying and they can\u2019t even go to the funerals.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>In recent weeks, Trump has turned his attention almost entirely from controlling the public health outbreak to reopening the country and restoring the economy. But polling suggests seniors remain deeply concerned about their health, and the potential for a second coronavirus outbreak in the fall. They are also among the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/may-5-10-2020-washington-post-university-of-maryland-poll/722b3348-4f59-4b35-9fa0-2f9eb4ac76c0/?itid=lk_inline_manual_1\">most supportive of and the likeliest to abide by</a> precautionary public health measures to control the spread of the virus.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=\"https://navigatorresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Older-Americans-Deep-Dive-Final.pdf\">A new analysis by Navigator Research</a>, a progressive polling firm tracking public opinion on Covid-19, found older Americans losing faith in Trump\u2019s handling of the outbreak, increasingly characterizing his performance as \u201cself-absorbed\u201d and neither \u201cserious\u201d nor \u201cpresidential\u201d.</p> <p>In March, voters 55 and older approved of Trump\u2019s response to the pandemic by 17 points, according to the polling memo shared first with the Guardian. Now, these voters narrowly disapprove of his response, a 19-point erosion in just two months.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cFor senior voters, there\u2019s this really vivid contrast between a steady leader and an erratic leader, a leader who listens to experts to one who thinks he knows it all,\u201d said Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic pollster.</p> <p>Lake said senior women are particularly uneasy with Trump\u2019s behavior, especially his promotion of unproven medical treatments and his aggressive push to reopen the economy despite warnings from public health experts.</p> <p>\u201cWhat some men dismissed as just \u2018Trump being Trump,\u2019 senior women really thought was divisive, disrespectful, erratic, and they value all three of those qualities,\u201d Lake said. \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s primarily senior women who are moving away from him.\u201d</p> <p>That erosion was reflected in the recent Quinnipiac poll, which found that women support Biden by 22 points over Trump. By contrast, Trump leads Biden by 11 points among men over 65.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a69208379f78ee1874754b62d745290a930be6bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a69208379f78ee1874754b62d745290a930be6bf/0_171_5161_3098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden and Jill Biden arrive to lay a wreath at the Delaware Memorial Bridge Veterans Memorial Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden and Jill Biden arrive to lay a wreath at the Delaware Memorial Bridge Veterans Memorial Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Semansky/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lake said Biden probably does not have to win older voters to deny Trump a second term. Given how narrowly Trump won in 2016, a marginal dent in his support there could be enough to tilt some battleground states in Biden\u2019s favor.</p> <p>Michael Gwin, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said: \u201cOlder Americans know that Vice-President Biden will provide the strong and compassionate leadership our country needs in a moment of crisis like this, and they know that Biden will always fight to protect the entitlements they\u2019ve spent their entire lives working towards.\u201d</p> <p>Allies and aides to Trump have publicly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidJUrban/status/1253344448953683970?s=20\">downplayed</a> concerns about his deficit with seniors. But the White House has also ramped up efforts to showcase how the administration is benefiting seniors.&nbsp;And in May, Vice-President Mike Pence delivered personal protective equipment to a nursing home in Orlando treating coronavirus cases.</p> <p>\u201cJust like every American, senior citizens saw what President Trump achieved for America during his first three years in office and they see the president leading the nation during the coronavirus response,\u201d said Sarah Matthews, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign. </p> <p>Despite the uncertainty enveloping 2020, Nancy LeaMond, the executive vice-president and chief advocacy and engagement officer of the non-partisan AARP, expects older voters will once again play a decisive role in the presidential election.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to find a way to vote, even if they\u2019re afraid in the current pandemic,\u201d she said during an online briefing last week.</p> <p>LeaMond emphasized that seniors are \u201cnot a monolith\u201d, nor are they firmly aligned with a political party, noting that while older voters were essential to Trump\u2019s political success, they helped Democrats take control of the House in 2018.</p> <p>On the policy front, protecting entitlement programs like social security and Medicare were always priorities for older voters, and LeaMond said they are probably even more so amid the pandemic.&nbsp;</p> <p>As a candidate, Trump was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/05/11/us/politics/where-trump-breaks-with-the-republican-party.html\">emphatic</a> in his support for such programs, breaking with traditional Republican orthodoxy. But as president, Trump has at <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/10/21131316/trump-2021-budget-entitlement-cuts\">various times </a>suggested openness to spending cuts \u2013&nbsp;comments the Biden campaign intends to highlight. The Trump campaign is, in turn, attempting to weaponize Biden\u2019s past comments on social security dating back to 1979.&nbsp;</p> <p>Even before the coronavirus upended the presidential election, Biden\u2019s strength with his agemates was a threat to Trump.&nbsp;During the primary, Biden&nbsp;won voters over 65 in every state contest except <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/entrance-and-exit-polls/vermont/democratic\">Vermont</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/entrance-and-exit-polls/new-hampshire/democratic\">New Hampshire</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Democrats say older voters, who helped Biden secure the party\u2019s nomination, view him as an empathetic leader shaped by personal tragedy, and are drawn to his moderate politics and his emphasis on shared American values.</p> <p>But Trump, 73, has also sought to cast his 77-year-old opponent as \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d, a doddering older man unfit for the presidency. As part of a recent advertising blitz, Trump\u2019s re-election campaign mocked Biden as \u201cold and out of&nbsp;it\u201d and \u201cgeriatric\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>Biden\u2019s campaign believes this strategy could backfire. Some of Trump\u2019s top aides have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-campaign-divided-over-how-to-attack-biden-amid-worries-over-troubling-poll-numbers/2020/05/02/2dcf8740-8bf0-11ea-8ac1-bfb250876b7a_story.html\">reportedly</a> warned allies that their aggressive attacks on Biden\u2019s mental fitness could further harm Trump\u2019s standing among senior citizens.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Florida, a state with a significant retiree population, Biden has for months maintained an edge with the state\u2019s older voters, an electorate that now includes the president.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s electoral success likely depends on winning Florida, where he defeated Hillary Clinton by just over 1 percentage point in 2016. According to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/results/exit-polls/florida/president\">exit polls</a>, he carried voters 65 and older in the state by a 17-point margin.</p> <p>Democrats say many voters in the state are souring on the president. The coronavirus has hit elderly Floridians hard: more than <a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/05/17/in-florida-83-percent-of-coronavirus-deaths-are-people-65-and-older/\">80%</a> of those who have died from coronavirus were older than 65, and more than 40% of them can be traced to long-term care facilities.</p> <p>\u201cSeniors have eyes and ears. They see and hear exactly what Donald Trump has done and are going to be holding him accountable,\u201d said Terrie Rizzo, chair of the Florida Democratic party. \u201cTrump has failed us as seniors and it is now our turn.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>The Biden campaign is attempting to solidify this advantage, which pollsters say could fade as the dynamics of the virus shift. Last week, surrogates hosted a series of events in battleground states with seniors while Biden makes frequent appearances on local television stations, whose audience skew older.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfc2625d2bee9779537e07a19c2905d4af4b17ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfc2625d2bee9779537e07a19c2905d4af4b17ce/0_186_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump takes questions from reporters during an event on protecting seniors with diabetes in the Rose Garden of the White House on 26 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump takes questions from reporters during an event on protecting seniors with diabetes at the White House on Tuesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Campaign organizers, along with state party officials, have also been conducting \u201cwellness checks\u201d on older voters during the pandemic.

For the veterans of those conflicts, and the many more whose lives were shaped by them, the scale of loss in such a short period of time is hard to grasp, he said, especially as more is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/us-social-distancing-lives-lost-coronavirus-lockdown-study\">revealed</a> about what could have been done to save American lives.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a huge trauma,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more people learn, the more and more angry and disappointed they are.\u201d</p>",

There is broad consensus among most public health experts worldwide that too swiftly ending lockdowns risks a potentially devastating second wave of infections in a pandemic that has already cost more than 100,000 American lives.</p> <p>But the Tea Party Patriots have spearheaded a drive, in radio and TV interviews, to mobilize doctors urging states to move faster. It is now attracting broader financial support from rightwing donors and groups in the shape of the SOC. Doctors in the group have also pushed unscientific theories about the pandemic in ways that have sparked anger and criticism.</p> <p>The Tea Party leader Jenny Beth Martin said the group has about 800 members and its mission is to \u201ceducate the American public about the unintended side-effects\u201d of the shutdown. Martin said 800 doctors signed a letter in May to Donald Trump which called the lockdowns a \u201cmass casualty\u201d event causing depression and other ills and urged Trump to end the \u201cnational shutdown\u201d. A copy of the letter is going this week to governors nationwide.</p> <p>The coalition\u2019s key groups are dark money non-profits that historically have been funded by a mix of wealthy donors, corporations and conservative foundations.

Gold told the AP that there was \u201cno scientific basis that the average American should be concerned about\u201d Covid-19 \u2013 something that downplays all medical evidence about the pandemic\u2019s risks.</p> <p>Gold has also used talk radio to tout the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine \u2013 which Trump has taken in hopes of blocking Covid-19 \u2013 despite growing scientific evidence it carries big health risks.</p> <p>The coalition\u2019s economic and health agendas are drawing fire from scientists and economists of all political stripes.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that these organizations have found doctors who are willing to support a rightwing agenda designed to help Donald Trump against all scientific evidence and appropriate public health practices is shameful,\u201d said Irwin Redlener, a professor of public health at Columbia University.</p> <p>Critics notwithstanding, Brandon said the coalition recently spent $50,000 for videos on Facebook, Hulu and Twitter targeting independents and Republicans with the message that Covid-19 mostly hits the elderly to minimize risks for others.&nbsp;</p> <p>FreedomWorks, which boasts an arm whose tax status permits lobbying, has also been prodding the Senate \u201cto pump the brakes on new spending\u201d, Brandon said referring to the $3tn-plus that has already been allocated for corporate relief and the pandemic\u2019s painful fallout for tens of millions. </p> <p>Besides coalition projects, Tea Party Patriots and FreedomWorks have tapped their email lists and social media to mobilize activists to join \u201cliberate\u201d demonstrations in more than 10 states including North Carolina, Wisconsin, Virginia and Michigan, with the latter attracting some gun-toting activists.</p> <p>Key groups in the SOC coalition, which has 200 members, have been funded by prominent billionaires, including some who have been active in the sprawling big-money network led by the oil and gas billionaire Charles Koch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/fears-grow-of-surge-in-us-coronavirus-cases-from-george-floyd-protests\">Fears grow of US coronavirus surge from George Floyd protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tea Party Patriots, for instance, received almost $2m in 2017 and 2018 from Richard Uihlein, whose net worth in early 2020 was almost $25bn according to public records.&nbsp;Charles Koch, whose net worth Forbes last month pegged at $46.5bn, has been an Alec funder.

  "<p>As the United States responds to the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s (CCP) brazen crackdown on Hong Kong, it is hard to imagine a US president with less credibility than Donald Trump - who just this week <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266231100780744704\">threatened</a> violence against US citizens protesting police brutality and racism - to respond effectively to the CCP\u2019s dangerous infringement on the rights of the people of Hong Kong.</p> <p>The rising tensions over Hong Kong are a window into the future of the US-China relationship \u2013 the challenges posed by the Chinese Communist party (CCP), the stakes at play, and how dangerous it is when the United States lacks an effective approach.&nbsp;</p> <p>After the \u201chandover\u201d in 1997, the people of Hong Kong were promised at least 50 years of self-rule and a democratic system of government; the CCP has encroached on Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy ever since. Major protests \u2013 including in 2014 and last year \u2013 have been sparked not only by acts of repression by the CCP, but also more recently by the fear that time is running out for Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p> <p>A new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/china-vote-npc-national-security-laws-hong-kong-us-protest\">law</a> approved by the Chinese mainland\u2019s national people\u2019s congress makes those fears more real than ever. The CCP argues that the inability of the Hong Kong government to deal with protests means that Beijing must step in, a move that violates the promise of separate political systems. The new law authorizes arrests for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-52762291\">vague</a> transgressions such as \u201ctreason\u201d, \u201csedition\u201d and \u201csubversion\u201d, raising fears that anyone deemed an opponent of the CCP could be arrested. The law also authorizes the CCP\u2019s security services to operate openly in Hong Kong, formally extending the power of the Chinese security state to Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p> <p>The CCP views the protests in Hong Kong as a direct threat to the CCP\u2019s autocratic system, and influencing the CCP on this is difficult. But the CCP watches closely for the reactions of the rest of the world, in particular the US. Trump has generally made it clear that he couldn\u2019t care less what happens in Hong Kong. At the height of the protests last year, Trump <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/03/politics/trump-biden-call-xi-secure-server/index.html\">reportedly</a> told the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, that he would stay quiet about Hong Kong in order to facilitate a trade deal. In public remarks Trump has <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-02/trump-calls-hong-kong-protests-riots-adopting-china-rhetoric\">called</a> the protests \u201criots\u201d and said they are China\u2019s business to handle.&nbsp;</p> <p>The US Congress, however, responded to last year\u2019s events by passing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1838/text\">Act</a>, which Trump was forced to sign. That law requires the US secretary of state to certify every year that Hong Kong remains autonomous, which is a precondition for the US to continue its preferential economic relationship with Hong Kong. On Wednesday, in response to the CCP\u2019s latest move, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/prc-national-peoples-congress-proposal-on-hong-kong-national-security-legislation/\">notified</a> Congress that Hong Kong was not autonomous from the mainland.&nbsp;</p> <p>Pompeo\u2019s certification gives the president and secretary of state the ability to impose consequences ranging from sanctions to a complete change in the US-Hong Kong economic relationship. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher: Hong Kong\u2019s precarious position as a relatively free, democratic society and a global financial hub are dependent on its special treatment by the United States and the international community. If those relationships change, then Hong Kong, US-China relations and the global financial system will change too.&nbsp;</p> <p>Threatening to change the US relationship with Hong Kong could, conceivably, deter the CCP from further crackdowns, because the CCP benefits financially from Hong Kong\u2019s unique economic status. But if the US upends Hong Kong\u2019s special status, it could help seal the fate of the people of Hong Kong as just another part of the CCP\u2019s autocratic domain. The US cannot do that.&nbsp;</p> <p>The CCP\u2019s actions are not taking place in a vacuum \u2013 they are illustrative of the broader challenges the CCP poses to the world, and the dilemmas it presents for the US. As tensions rise, and the CCP uses the cover of the global pandemic to aggressively pursue territorial claims from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/china-and-india-move-troops-as-border-tensions-escalate\">India</a> to the South China <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/New-South-China-Sea-tensions-rattle-Manila-and-Hanoi-amid-pandemic\">Sea</a>, the range of threats is only growing.&nbsp;</p> <p>Trump\u2019s erratic policies have only made matters worse. His trade war hurts the American economy. His lack of interest in human rights has removed potential deterrents against the CCP\u2019s campaign of ethnic cleansing in Xinjiang and repression in Hong Kong. Trump\u2019s undermining of US alliances and withdrawal from leadership in international organizations has ceded the global playing field to China. The list goes on.&nbsp;</p> <p>As the US develops strategies to confront the challenges posed by the CCP, we will need to embrace policy approaches that Trump has abandoned. That will mean standing up for values, investing in the American economy, working with allies, and strengthening international institutions.&nbsp;</p> <p>When it comes to standing up for Hong Kong today, the US must respond to the passage of the new law with immediate diplomatic pressure. It also needs to send clear public and private <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/reports/2019/09/16/474577/support-democracy-human-rights-asia/\">signals</a> about the measures that the US will take if Beijing follows through with a crackdown on Hong Kong \u2013&nbsp;including targeted sanctions against the officials, security services and companies involved</p> <p>To bring international pressure against the CCP, the US must also put Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy on the agenda of international organizations from the United Nations to the G7.&nbsp;</p> <p>The US must closely coordinate with its allies, in particular the United Kingdom, which has a special role to play as the signatory to the Sino-British Joint Declaration that outlined the terms of Hong Kong\u2019s handover to China. The US has taken a first step in this direction with a joint US-UK-Canada-Australia <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CBCAlerts/status/1265974905268469763\">statement</a> condemning the CCP\u2019s move.&nbsp;</p> <p>The situation also requires consulting with and following the lead of those on the ground in Hong Kong fighting for their rights. The US must ensure that its actions do everything possible to help the people of Hong Kong rather than sacrificing Hong Kong to make a larger point about the CCP.&nbsp;</p> <p>Perhaps most importantly, effectively standing up for values abroad requires upholding universal values at home. The Trump administration\u2019s endless assaults on America\u2019s democratic institutions - of which Trump\u2019s threat of violence against Americans is just the most recent shocking illustration - erodes America\u2019s ability to credibly pressure the CCP over its own human rights abuses.</p> <p>Right now, the people of Hong Kong and the US and people across the world need strong, principled American leadership to deal with the challenges posed by the CCP. Three and a half years of Trump\u2019s counterproductive policies \u2013 which the CCP have taken advantage of \u2013 have only made that US leadership more necessary than ever.</p>",

  "<p>The air is clean and fresh, fish have reappeared in urban waterways, birds are frequenting uncut gardens, wild mammals are meandering through cities and greenhouse gas emissions will likely drop by an unprecedented<a href=\"https://www.iea.org/news/global-energy-demand-to-plunge-this-year-as-a-result-of-the-biggest-shock-since-the-second-world-war\"> 8% this year</a>. Nature has clearly benefited from several months of dramatically reduced economic activity. From a climate crisis perspective, this drop in emissions is astonishingly close to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/26/united-nations-global-effort-cut-emissions-stop-climate-chaos-2030\">7.6% yearly reduction</a> in emissions that scientists have advised will be necessary during the next decade. And yet none of this is cause for celebration.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Most surprising are the carbon-intensive industries that confirm they are continuing to decarbonise despite the pandemic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The resilience of nature is temporary, and will last only as long as the lockdown is enforced. More importantly, the reduction in greenhouse gases is not the result of decarbonising the economy, but the unintended consequence of economic paralysis that has come with painful human consequences and huge costs to lives and livelihoods. This is not what addressing the climate crisis looks like. The thoughtful reduction of greenhouse gases has to be intentional not circumstantial, sustained not temporary. Above all, it must lead to improved human wellbeing, not to human or economic suffering.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is a second inadvertent link between climate crisis and the coronavirus pandemic that is perhaps less examined. The recovery packages designed and implemented by governments to rescue the ailing global economy could rise as high as $20tn over the next 18 months. The scale of this stimulus will shape the contours of the global economy over the next decade, if not longer. This is precisely the decade when climate scientists have warned global emissions will need to be cut by half in order to reach a sustainable trajectory. In the midst of the crisis wreaked by the pandemic is an opportunity: to ensure rescue packages don\u2019t merely recover the high carbon economy of yesterday, but help us build a healthier economy that is low on carbon, high in resilience and centred on human wellbeing.</p> <p>The case for rebuilding our economies in line with environmental targets has broad public support. A<a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/two-thirds-britons-believe-climate-change-serious-coronavirus-and-majority-want-climate-prioritised\"> recent poll</a> from Ipsos Mori shows that 71% of the global population understands that climate change is as at least as serious a crisis as Covid-19, and 65% think the former should be prioritised in the economic recovery. This is not only in industrialised countries<strong> </strong>that can more easily afford to green their economies; 81% of the citizens in India and 80% of people from Mexico were also strongly in favour of a green and healthy economic recovery.&nbsp;</p> <p>One of the first institutions to call for this dual approach was the<a href=\"https://www.iea.org/commentaries/now-is-the-time-to-plan-the-economic-recovery-the-world-needs\"> International Energy Agency</a>, which will publish a report this month detailing policies that governments could adopt to chart the course of recovery while decarbonising their economies. Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund is not only advising that fiscal stimulus packages should be based on green measures, but going as far as recommending<a href=\"https://www.climatechangenews.com/2020/04/29/imf-chief-1-trillion-post-coronavirus-stimulus-must-tackle-climate-crisis/\"> scrapping fossil fuel subsidies</a> and taxing carbon.&nbsp;</p> <p>A growing number of corporate leaders are also calling for government stimulus packages to have green strings attached. In the UK, the call from a group of major business leaders for the government to embrace a green recovery was answered by the prime minister\u2019s statement that the UK\u2019s commitment to delivering net zero emissions<a href=\"https://www.businessgreen.com/news/4015202/boris-johnson-promises-prioritise-low-carbon-investment-uk-covid-19-recovery\"> \u201cremains undiminished\u201d.</a> In Europe,<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-14/european-ceos-ministers-start-campaign-for-green-recovery\"> 180 business leaders</a>, policymakers and researchers explicitly urged the EU to build the recovery package around the Green Deal. Meanwhile the Spanish government recently released a draft law banning all new coal, oil and gas projects, establishing the direction of the Covid-19 recovery effort. In Canada, <a href=\"https://cleanenergycanada.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=14af3f96b3d5df9564694d168&amp;id=c498eb3db8&amp;e=8c32efcdc6\">more than </a><a href=\"https://cleanenergycanada.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=14af3f96b3d5df9564694d168&amp;id=c498eb3db8&amp;e=8c32efcdc6\">320 signatories representing more than 2,100 companies</a> have signed on to support a resilient recovery.</p> <p>Perhaps most surprising are the carbon-intensive industries that have confirmed they are continuing to decarbonise despite the pandemic, including BP, Shell, Daimler and Rio Tinto. Elsewhere, eight investment groups, including BNP Paribas Asset Management, DWS and Comgest Asset Management, have<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b019e52e-3555-48b5-ada9-d77655bc4f7d\"> urged corporates</a> to maintain their focus on decarbonisation while dealing with the consequences of the recession. The Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance, a group of institutional investors representing more than $4.6tn in assets under management (AUM), remains committed to an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.next-finance.net/Post-Covid-recovery-packages-must\">irreversible shift</a> to a resilient, net-zero and inclusive economy\u201d. And BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, with $7.4 tn AUM, has pledged to<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03d73458-6876-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75\"> punish</a> the directors of companies that fail to manage environmental risks in 2020.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/28/the-world-wasnt-ready-for-a-green-new-deal-in-2009-today-it-may-be\">The world wasn't ready for a Green New Deal in 2009. Today, it may be | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But it\u2019s not all good news. For every corporate actor that has shown a commitment to greening the economy, there are many that haven\u2019t adhered to these values. Some have used the crisis as an opportunity to roll back environmental commitments or push through controversial projects and laws. Plastic companies in the US have lobbied to reverse<a href=\"https://heated.world/p/the-right-is-using-covid-19-to-wage\"> single-use plastic laws</a>, while three states have<a href=\"https://heated.world/p/whats-better-than-a-bailout-silencing\"> criminalised environmental protest</a>. In Europe,<a href=\"https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/german-car-industry-calls-eu-drop-tighter-emission-limits-light-crisis\"> car manufacturers</a> are pushing to loosen emissions standards; globally, airlines are<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/08/airlines-lobby-to-rewrite-carbon-deal-due-to-coronavirus\"> lobbying to stop using 2020</a> as a baseline emissions year, and China has announced it will loosen<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-environment/china-to-modify-environmental-supervision-of-firms-to-boost-post-coronavirus-recovery-idUSKBN20X0AG\"> environmental legislation</a> to boost the post-coronavirus recovery.</p> <p>This is the moment to raise voices everywhere and remind leaders of their chief responsibility: protecting their citizens and putting human wellbeing at the centre of the decision-making process.&nbsp;Some of this is already happening. Organisations representing more than 40 million health professionals from 90 countries worldwide have just published <a href=\"https://healthyrecovery.net/\">an open letter to G20 leaders</a>&nbsp;and their chief medical advisers in support of a \u201chealthy recovery\u201d where carbon emissions would be massively reduced.</p> <p>Crises are a moment of rupture and change. In the midst of the pandemic, we face a choice between recovering the carbon-intensive global economy that has set us on the path towards environmental breakdown, or accelerating the transition towards a future that prioritises the health of people and planet. Today, that future may be closer within our reach than it was at the beginning of 2020.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong> Christiana Figueres was head of the UN climate change convention that achieved the Paris agreement in 2015, and is co-author of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-future-we-choose-surviving-the-climate-crisis-9781838770822.html\">The Future We Choose</a></p>",

Published in a brief flowering after the outbreak of the first world war in 1914, these short stories remain as arresting and disturbing as ever. Two of the tales, \u201cRash\u014dmon\u201d and \u201cIn a Bamboo Grove\u201d, spawned a film by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/rashomon\">Akira Kurosawa</a> with a series of contradictory narrators that brought a fresh approach to cinema. Stories such as \u201cLoyalty\u201d<em> </em>tackle the ideas of honour and duty in the samurai code head on, but many of them have moral subtexts. \u201cThe Nose\u201d and \u201cDragon\u201d can both be read as a critique of religious leaders eschewing the spiritual for the physical. While the earlier stories are more conventionally striking in terms of voice and structure, the later, autobiographical tales reflect the writer\u2019s steady disintegration into mental illness. </p> <p>Unreliable narration is at the heart of Catriona Ward\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/little-eve-9781780229157.html\">Little Eve</a></strong>, a beautifully rendered folk horror tale that is deeply unsettling. This story of nebulous cults, murders and obfuscation in the Scottish Highlands is all realised in language that is effective and affecting.

  "<p>When coronavirus crept across the world in early February, talk of how different nations were dealing with the virus came to resemble the Olympics for state capacity. Which country had the authority, the supplies and the expertise to \u201ccrush the curve\u201d? A balance sheet of national progress marked out a bleak race to the horizon, enumerated in case numbers and death figures.</p> <p>Although the focus over recent months has remained on leaders in crisis mode and the central agencies delivering forecasts and quarantine measures, local authorities have also played a prominent role during the pandemic. Chinese mayors, US governors and Indian chief ministers have coordinated local responses, taking responsibility for populations and even <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-28/alcohol-spat-shows-india-states-battling-modi-for-virus-billions\">locking horns</a> with national politicians.</p> <p>Most people would read the pandemic as a sign that populations and nation states should band together, and<strong> </strong>for the people \u201cat the head of the rope\u201d to pull even harder, to use the metaphor favoured by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. But there are others who see matters quite differently. They spy opportunity in the crisis, and wager that we might be able to ride the wave of the pandemic into a new tomorrow, where the virus shatters the global map \u2013 and undermines the power of democratic nation states.</p> <p>The US is ground zero for this type of thinking. Across the country, regions have broken up into \u201ccompacts\u201d, with states competing against each other for life-saving ventilators and PPE. The atmosphere is one of competitive federalism, where states are reconfigured as economic units bidding in a marketplace. Washington\u2019s state governor, Jay Inslee, accused Trump<strong> </strong>of<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jay-inslee-trump-twitter-coronavirus-washington-liberate-america-a9471681.html\"> \u201cfomenting domestic rebellion\u201d</a> for his calls to \u201cliberate\u201d individual states; governor Gavin Newsom termed California a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/us/california-coronavirus-newsom-nation-state.html\">\u201cnation-state.\u201d</a> One Maryland governor confessed to keeping Covid-19 <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/495519-maryland-governor-says-coronavirus-tests-acquired-from-south-korea-under\">tests in an undisclosed location under armed guard</a>, in part to prevent their seizure by central state authorities.</p> <p>Although North America\u2019s economy is gradually reopening, the virus is still rampaging through its population. What will economic recovery look like in the midst of a pandemic? The president\u2019s economic advisers have some ideas. In an <a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1162126/2020_04_28_When_and_Where_Will_the_Recovery_Happen_ID_ee44b445dd92.pdf?p=pdf\">analysis</a> released at the end of April, Arthur Laffer and Stephen Moore, two of Trump\u2019s closest economic confidants and authors of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/09/trumponomics-trump-reaganism-authoritarian-wall-street-main-street\">the book on \u201cTrumponomics\u201d</a>, predicted that \u201cblue\u201d Democratic states would be slower than \u201cred\u201d states to recover, because of what they saw as their pre-existing excess of regulations and taxes.</p> <p>Their analysis divided the US map into <a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1162126/2020_04_28_When_and_Where_Will_the_Recovery_Happen_ID_ee44b445dd92.pdf?p=pdf\">\u201claggard anti-growth\u201d states and \u201cmomentum pro-growth\u201d</a> states. The former have minimum wages, pro-union laws and state income tax; the latter are free of such regulations.<strong> </strong>In the established mode of disaster capitalism, Laffer and Moore\u2019s analysis appears to see the pandemic as a way to compel \u201canti-growth\u201d states to adopt ever lower tax rates in order to attract mobile capital and labour. It suggests those who resist will not be bailed out by redistribution from the central government, but left to languish in a deserved economic depression. The effect is reminiscent of social Darwinism, applied as a philosophy of government.</p> <p>The most articulate cheerleader for this kind of post-pandemic libertarianism is Balaji Srinivasan, the electrical engineer and former general partner at Silicon Valley venture capital fund Andreesen Horowitz. Since the pandemic began, Srinivasan has foretold a redivision of the world map into \u201cgreen zones\u201d that have controlled and contained the virus and \u201cred zones\u201d, which have not.</p> <p>\u201cWe are entering this fractal environment,\u201d Srinivasan <a href=\"https://hopin.to/events/virtual-startup-societies-summit-special-jurisdictions-in-a-post-covid-world\">recently</a> told a virtual summit organised by the Startup Societies Foundation, \u201cin which the virus breaks centralised states\u201d. The virus does not stop at the border, so nor will this process of fragmentation. As regions seal themselves off to prevent contagion, \u201cyou can drill down to the state, or even the town or county level\u201d, Srinivasan observed, noting that any state without the virus under control will \u201cface defection\u201d in an intensified contest for talent and capital. After the pandemic has passed, \u201cnations are going to turn into effectively vendors and entrepreneurs and relatively mobile people will be applicants\u201d, he predicted.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to imagine how a particular breed of investor could see this pandemic as an opportunity that will accelerate existing trends. The loose attachments that investors feel towards this or that nation will grow even looser as capital becomes more mobile, and a sorting process will separate the productive few nations from the malingering many. States that don\u2019t fall in line with the demands of this investor class will be starved by the voluntary expatriation of the wealthy, with their assets and abilities in tow.</p> <p>If you assume this is merely a pessimistic vision, you\u2019d be wrong. In fact it accords with a long-cultivated ideology that Srinivasan shares with a group of like-minded venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, who subscribe to variations of the radical libertarian philosophy known as \u201canarcho-capitalism\u201d. The idea at its root is that a wealthy class of investors and entrepreneurs should be free to exit nation states and form new communities whose members can choose which rules (and tax laws) they\u2019re governed by \u2013 as if those rules were products on a store shelf. </p> <p>For like-minded libertarians, the colour-coded zones used in public health to control the virus are the blueprint for a new political economy. Since Srinivasan began discussing the framework, colour-coded zones have been rolled out to control the virus in Malaysia, Indonesia, Northern Italy and France; the strategy was also considered as a model for biocontainment <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/07/kushner-coronavirus-surveillance-174165\">in the White House</a> in early April. As of early May, India has divided its 1.3 billion people into a patchwork of green, yellow and red zones, with different freedoms and restrictions based on each.</p> <p>The red-green zone schema has already informed the strategies of global investors. In April, Henley &amp; Partners, the global citizenship broker, released its annual ranking of national passports for mobile investors, and predicted that coronavirus would spark a dramatic shift in global mobility. Its chief source <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/ae/news-releases/record-breaking-global-mobility-grounded-by-covid-19-pandemic-301034963.html\">forecast</a> that \u201cas the curtain lifts, people will seek to move from poorly governed and ill-prepared \u2018red zones\u2019 to \u2018green zones\u2019, or places with better medical care.\u201d In early May, it <a href=\"https://robbreport.com/travel/destinations/super-rich-buying-pandemic-passports-multiple-nationalities-2918500/\">reported</a> a 42% increase in applications for new nationalities, compared with the previous year.</p> <p>Nobody can tell what the world will look like after the pandemic. But what we can be sure of is that some investors appear to be already placing<strong> </strong>their bets on a vision of the future where the wealthy are freed from tax constraints. As nations are divided into different zones according to their respective stages of viral and economic recovery, the well-off could follow Elon Musk\u2019s recent threat to relocate from California to Texas, voting with their feet for locations that elude redistributive taxation. In our post-pandemic future, the flight to safety, away from contagious \u201cred zones\u201d, could be a flight from the nation state as we know it.</p> <p>\u2022 Quinn Slobodian is an associate professor of history at Wellesley College, US&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>One of 2019\u2019s biggest Malayalam hits, Kumbalangi Nights provides a superior example of one of those lay-of-the-land movies that troubles to build a world and properly study its characters before foisting anything so urgent, vulgar or trifling as a plot upon us. At its centre sit four varyingly useless brothers, stranded without parents on the banks of a river winding through the titular Keralan tourist hotspot. The two oldest are introduced at one another\u2019s throats, where they\u2019ve apparently been for most of their lives: these are Saji (Soubin Shahir), a sentimental, oft-shirtless bruiser, and Bobby (Shane Nigam), a mop-topped slacker who\u2019s renounced weed on the grounds it \u201cmakes you think, and I am not the thinking type\u201d, a self-insight he goes on to prove with his clumsy pawing of sweetheart Baby (Anna Ben).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/29/terror-firmer-troma-horror-film\">My streaming gem: why you should watch Terror Firmer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A third sibling, the mute and melancholy Boney (Sreenath Bhasi) has already bailed and left these two to each other\u2019s devices, partly because he hasn\u2019t the voice to raise, partly because he\u2019s tired of the pair\u2019s bullshit. The youngest, teenage Franky (Mathew Thomas), shows a degree of potential \u2013 he\u2019s a team player on the soccer pitch, has a scholarship awaiting him and appears rather charmingly beguiled by the opposite sex \u2013 but we might well wonder whether this will be allowed to coalesce into anything more substantial, given the clownishness and toxicity of his housemates. Calmly and naturalistically, the film sets down a gauntlet for these bros to run: can any of them grow up and become a man without taking on the worst characteristics of those around them?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P4BFBSafF0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3P4BFBSafF0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Keen as they might be to run their mouths, the film they\u2019re in \u2013 written by Syam Pushkaran, and directed by Madhu Narayanan \u2013 is instead characterised by a thoughtful silence: it transports us to one of this planet\u2019s quieter, prettier spots, and never feels the need to overcompensate with score, action or frantic jabber, allowing scenes to present as reflective or stilled, like the Kumbalangi waterways. Beneath this placid surface, however, there\u2019s a fair bit going on, not least a tacit understanding of the wider imbalances at play in this patriarchal neck of the woods. These brothers have been afforded a certain freedom and power, but they haven\u2019t fully comprehended what to do with it, and are thus prone to abusing it somehow.</p> <p>Much of the onscreen activity could be defined as relaxed human comedy, but we\u2019re constantly aware how close some of it comes to a knife-edge. It\u2019s literal when Bobby submits to a shave while asking his putative brother-in-law, the uptight barber Shammy (Fahadh Faasil), for Baby\u2019s hand in marriage; more metaphorical when Saji comes round from a botched suicide attempt to be offered not counselling, but a slap in the face from a police inspector and the fates alike. These guys can be good together \u2013 Pushkaran carefully punctuates the squabbling with moments of genuine fraternal camaraderie \u2013 but for two-thirds of the film, we\u2019re just waiting for one of them to put their foot in any given situation, if not to rashly dive in two-footed. That we\u2019re never disheartened or repulsed entirely is down to Narayanan\u2019s excellent ensemble, particularly his leads, who temper the worst aspects of maleness with vivid flickers of promise that suggest we may still witness a positive outcome.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86df87a653a99fc97ac0bb2ff707463b057b9ae8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86df87a653a99fc97ac0bb2ff707463b057b9ae8/317_0_1509_906/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Crucially, no one strides on to screen with the conventional bearing of a hero; these actors never radiate that vanity, so we believe in them as the kind of blundering dumbos anybody possessed of a penis can be in the absence of proper guidance. Narayanan\u2019s direction assumes a forgiving quality: it\u2019s never indulgent, however becalmed matters seem, but it insists on allowing the brothers time and space, in the hope they\u2019ll see the error of their ways and take some form of responsibility before the credits roll.</p> <p>The final third \u2013 in which women cross the boys\u2019 threshold, obliging them to adapt accordingly \u2013 initially plays a touch gentle after all the roughhousing, but it feels healthier, too: a detox that enables the brothers to reconnect with emotions they walled off after their abandonment. They\u2019ll need to, because this surprising, edifying entertainment has one final twist, which has as much to do with genre as it does with the characters we\u2019ve spent the better part of two hours getting to know. That\u2019s best left for you to discover, but it\u2019s a development that makes explicit the question underpinning all Kumbalangi Nights\u2019 inquiries: if our homes and our movies can change shape for the better, why on earth can\u2019t the men who inhabit them?</p> <ul> <li><p>Kumbalangi Nights is available on Amazon Prime in the US and UK</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p><em>Attention, Scoobies! Spoilers for all seven seasons of Buffy lie ahead.</em></p> <h2>20. Chosen (season 7, episode 22)</h2> <p>I did not love the final season of Buffy, which was the most disposable, largely because it laid waste to much of the humour and spark that had made the show so fun. But wrapping up the whole series by binning the central idea of a chosen one, and turning teenage girls all over the world into a collective chosen, was a neat and satisfying note to end on.</p> <h2>19. Prophecy Girl (s1, e12)</h2> <p>The early episodes gave only hints of the greatness to come, but the first season finale showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/joss-whedon\">Joss Whedon</a> was willing to go to dark places \u2013 killing off the lead character. It was only temporary, of course, which is something of a Whedon trope nowadays.

The Zeppo (s3, e13)</h2> <p>Poor Xander tended to be Buffy\u2019s clown, a serial if accidental trouble-maker who did things such as falling in love with a giant praying mantis. This episode rounded him out and saw him go it alone as he defeated a milder, more human evil, while the rest of the Scoobies were distracted by yet another apocalypse.&nbsp;</p> <h2>17. Innocence (s2, e14)</h2> <p>As metaphors for nightmarish teenage experiences go, Buffy\u2019s boyfriend immediately turning into a bloodthirsty killer after they have sex for the first time is up there. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/30/bones-crunching-seven-days-12-seasons-246-episodes-and-one-addled-brain\">David Boreanaz</a> really ramped up the brood for his first outing as Angel\u2019s soulless alter-ego, Angelus.</p> <h2>16.

Throughout season four, all of the characters failed to communicate, again and again; Oz\u2019s brief return led to some of the best heart-to-hearts in the series for everyone.</p> <h2>15. I Only Have Eyes For You (s2, e19)</h2> <p>This is classic early Buffy: on one level, a self-contained story of a ghostly doomed affair between student and teacher, but written so cleverly as to move on to the bigger story of Buffy and Angel/Angelus.</p> <h2>14. Halloween (s2, e6)</h2> <p>For all of its experimentation, sometimes the most straightforward conceits worked best. Here, the gang turned into their Halloween costumes, but even when it was wrapped up, it set storylines in motion that would play out until the 144th episode.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d229b6874a63082331d848173ffca7d2d1473f7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d229b6874a63082331d848173ffca7d2d1473f7b/71_62_2831_1698/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Xander in Buffy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Xander as a gun-toting soldier \u2013 skills that would stay with him for the rest of the series.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><br>13.

I am a sucker for characters acting out of character, and this was one of the most fun incidents of it, with Giles and Joyce getting the ultimate munchies and regressing to their teenage years.&nbsp;</p> <h2>13. Doppelgangland (s3, e16)</h2> <p>The vampire Willow, first introduced in The Wish, makes another appearance in Sunnydale. For all of Willow\u2019s evil iterations, this was easily the most jolly \u2013 and it gave the world of The Wish another brief outing.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n74pgkzOzLM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n74pgkzOzLM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Willow was the subject of many a teenage obsession. </figcaption> </figure>   <h2>11. Normal Again (s6, e17)</h2> <p>This divisive episode played out to an uncertain \u201cwas it all a dream?\u201d premise and it showed Buffy at its bleakest. But the setup \u2013 that Buffy might be in a psychiatric hospital and that Sunnydale could be a figment of her disturbed psyche \u2013 was a haunting one, not least because the ending was outrageous enough to keep the possibility of it open.&nbsp;</p> <h2>10. The Gift (s5, e22)</h2> <p>Hey, she died twice: the 100th episode saw Buffy make the ultimate sacrifice, again, in order to save the world and her sister/the key, Dawn, while sending Glory, the show\u2019s campest big bad, packing at last. It could have been mawkish, but it got its levels of sentimentality just right.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0a6bcc57d3860ead3b182a085aad8bd00c758aad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a6bcc57d3860ead3b182a085aad8bd00c758aad/101_0_1716_2108/814.jpg\" alt=\"Buffy\" width=\"814\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You can\u2019t keep a good slayer dead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>9. Becoming (s2, e21 &amp; e22)</h2> <p>It is almost sacrilegious to admit it, but often I could take or leave most of the Angel-centric episodes, with the exception of this season two closer. This was the first time Buffy really flexed its dramatic muscles and proved that, while it was a teen supernatural show, it was as emotionally sophisticated as the best dramas. It was so good you could even forgive the flashback accents.</p> <h2>8. Graduation Day (s3, e21 &amp; 22)</h2> <p>This two-part finale marked the closing chapter in the first half of the Buffy story; it was the last of the old guard. It started small and intimate, as Buffy and Faith squared off, and ended as big as it gets, with the mayor\u2019s ascension and the students of Sunnydale High banding together to defeat him. While the final-ever episode destroyed Sunnydale itself, destroying the school was a good place to start.</p> <h2>7. Tabula Rasa (s6, e8)</h2> <p>For all the darkness of season six \u2013 and this is horribly bleak, at the episode\u2019s start and end \u2013 this memory loss episode managed to harness the perfect Buffy silliness that buoyed everything. Considering it had to follow Once More, With Feeling, it showed that season six certainly had its moments. I would watch a whole season of the adventures of Alex, Umad and Joan the vampire slayer.</p> <h2>6. Restless (s4, e22)</h2> <p>While previous season finales built towards a grand finish, this bucked the trend, dispensing with the big bad in the penultimate episode and leaving the gang to dream their way out of a tumultuous season. Few shows can pull off dream episodes, but this had the perfect balance of surreal silliness and profundity \u2013 and, of course, it neatly foreshadowed the arrival of Dawn.</p> <h2>5. The Wish (s3, e9)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6760480d67fb7c0487ba8534dba9c34807cecf32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6760480d67fb7c0487ba8534dba9c34807cecf32/15_16_943_566/500.jpg\" alt=\"Cordelia gets more than she bargained for with the vampire Xander in Buffy\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cordelia gets more than she bargained for with the vampire Xander.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is one of the most rewatchable episodes of the whole series. Of all the forays into alternative realities, this was by far the best. Cordelia wishes that Buffy had never come to Sunnydale, a wish that a new vengeance demon is happy to grant.

This musical entry \u2013 made long before musical episodes were a thing \u2013 seemed to crunch down every facet of the show into its purest essence, from its humour and its playfulness to its increasingly tortured sensibilities.

Although not the toughest enemies Buffy battled, the Gentleman were by far the scariest, stealing voices as they eviscerated victims, and this was a genuinely frightening mini horror movie. Given that the show made its name on quick, witty dialogue, to put out a near-silent episode and still have it be phenomenal was just showing off.&nbsp;</p> <h2>1.

It evolved to become a brilliant show, though, because it was also capable of tackling the big stuff with tremendous skill and ingenuity. Joyce\u2019s death is the first time a major character dies, and the ordinariness of it \u2013 an aneurysm, nothing supernatural and, crucially, nothing to be done \u2013 is utterly wrenching. There is no music, just the confusion and panic that follows a catastrophic event; it remains one of the most honest depictions of grief that I have ever seen on screen. It is certainly the most difficult episode of Buffy to watch, but in terms of the writing, the performances, the direction and the sheer emotional&nbsp;impact, this episode is peerless.&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>After a short hiatus, today\u2019s list is a little different, covering the top 20 pieces from the whole of last week.</p> <h2>1. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/25/world-cup-questions-why-did-england-not-beat-argentina-1998\">World Cup questions: why did gifted England not beat Argentina in 1998?</a></strong></h2> <p>\u2018It\u2019s a moment of jaw-drop, of dead air. Owen runs past the Argentina end, arms wide, grabbing the night into his chest, cresting the perfect high. This is what he was born to do. Freeze that frame for ever.\u2019</p> <h2>2. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/26/last-iron-lung-paul-alexander-polio-coronavirus\">The man in the iron lung</a></strong></h2> <p>\u2018Three days later, Paul woke up. His body was encased in a machine that wheezed and sighed. He couldn\u2019t move. He couldn\u2019t speak. He couldn\u2019t cough. He couldn\u2019t see through the fogged windows of the steam tent \u2013 a vinyl hood that kept the air around his head moist and the mucus in his lungs loose. He thought he was dead.\u2019</p> <h2>3. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/26/britt-ekland-i-was-put-through-emotional-and-psychological-warfare\">Britt Ekland: \u2018I was put through emotional and psychological warfare\u2019</a></strong></h2> <p>\u2018Two days after their first date \u2013 which was also their first meeting \u2013 the comedian Peter Sellers gave Britt Ekland a dachshund puppy called Pepper. Ekland had just arrived in London from Sweden to be 20th Century Fox\u2019s next big star. She was 21 years old and living at the Dorchester hotel; a dog was a ridiculous gift, she says. Just 10 days after their first date, Ekland and Sellers were married, and the puppy was lost in the whirlwind. \u201cAll these years, I always wondered: what happened to Pepper?\u201d\u2019</p> <h2>4. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/28/bobby-moore-and-the-mystery-of-the-missing-bogota-bracelet\">Bobby Moore and the mystery of the missing Bogot\u00e1 bracelet</a></strong></h2> <p>\u2018Entangled in myth, lies and political intrigue, dragged through the criminal underworld and spat across the international press, the tale of Bobby Moore and the missing Bogot\u00e1 bracelet threatened international relations and very nearly left England without their main man for the 1970 Mexico&nbsp;World Cup. But why would he have pinched it? Could it have been a prank? Did a bracelet even exist?\u2019</p> <h2>5. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/29/do-i-really-care-woody-allen-comes-out-fighting\">\u2018Do I really care?\u2019 Woody Allen comes out fighting</a></strong></h2> <p>\u2018There are a thousand things one could discuss with Allen: his 70 years in comedy, his 55 years of making movies. But, at this point, there is really only one thing to discuss \u2013 and he knows it. \u201cYou can ask me anything,\u201d he tells me down the phone from his home in (of course) Manhattan. So, even though our interview is supposed to be about his latest film,&nbsp;A Rainy Day in New York, we spend the hour talking about the scandal that has overshadowed his career for the past 25 years and, for many, obscured it.\u2019</p> <h2>6.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/06/ive-never-seen-doctor-zhivago\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/27/lauren-arsenal-invincibles-interview-wenger\">Lauren: \u2018No one wanted to ref in training.

It doesn\u2019t seem like that long ago, until you remember how unusual it was then for women in the public eye to come out. And then it feels like centuries ago. The prejudice was extraordinary: Toksvig was stood down by Save the Children, as compere for its 75th birthday celebrations, but a&nbsp;direct action protest by the Lesbian Avengers&nbsp;led the charity&nbsp;to apologise.\u2019</p> <h2>8. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/25/courtney-love-in-liverpool-scousers-wild-child-how-to-rock\">Courtney Love in Liverpool: the Scousers who taught the grunge icon how to rock</a></strong></h2> <p>\u2018If you were in Liverpool in 1982 and had a habit of wandering down Mathew Street, perhaps on your way to Probe record store, you are likely to have seen Courtney Love. She was 17 and living in the city, having been invited there by Teardrop Explodes frontman&nbsp;Julian Cope. Probe was one of her favourite places to go \u2013 if not to buy records, then to sit outside on the steps, drinking cider with her friend from back home in America, Robin Barbur.\u2019</p> <h2>9. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/30/desert-drugs-and-fatal-desperation-the-true-story-behind-alice-springs-trios-miraculous-rescue\">Desert, drugs and fatal desperation: the true story behind Alice Springs trio\u2019s miraculous rescue</a></strong></h2> <p>\u2018It was&nbsp;initially reported as a camping trip gone awry, and a miraculous rescue from the remote outback. But a police investigation, prepared for the Northern Territory coroner, has found that Hockridge, McBeath-Riley, and Tran had ventured into the bush in a drug smuggling operation that went wrong, looking to find methamphetamine they had hidden.\u2019</p> <h2>10. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/that-1980s-sports-blog/2020/may/28/nottingham-forest-retained-european-cup-40-years-ago\">When Nottingham Forest retained the European Cup 40 years ago</a></strong></h2> <p>\u2018Winning the 1979 European Cup was hardly a fluke. Defeating Liverpool and Cologne on their way to the final in Munich, Nottingham Forest could not be accused of having things easy. Admittedly, Malmo were not the most testing of opponents in the final. But a year on, Forest\u2019s opponents in the final at the Bernab\u00e9u could not be dismissed so lightly.\u2019</p> <h2>11. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/30/the-final-farewell-alan-jones-signs-off-with-climate-change-apology-amid-plaudits-from-celebrities\">The final farewell: Alan Jones signs off with climate change apology amid plaudits from celebrities</a></strong></h2> <p>\u2018One of the many celebrities who lined up to farewell Alan Jones this week had some people scratching their heads. Why would tennis great&nbsp;Roger Federer&nbsp;record a personal video message for a shock jock who has a shameful history of verbal abuse of women in power and of&nbsp;vilifying Lebanese Muslims?\u2019</p> <h2>12. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/central-park-new-york-white-woman-black-birdwatcher\">Video of white woman calling police on black man in Central Park draws outrage</a></h2> <p>\u2018Footage of a confrontation between a black birdwatcher and a white dog walker in Central Park in&nbsp;New York&nbsp;has gone viral, reigniting national debate over everyday racism and a social media storm.\u2019</p> <h2>13. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/25/how-we-made-airplane-the-movie\">How We Made: Airplane!</a></strong></h2> <p>\u2018We took the story seriously.

Her father, the celebrity hairdresser Gavin Hodge, was a man about town and spinner of near-mythic tales; her mother, Jan, a former model. They lived with their two children, Gavanndra and Candy, in a mansion flat in Battersea, not far from&nbsp;Chelsea\u2019s&nbsp;stylish Kings Road. Yet appearances are all too often deceptive and Hodge\u2019s childhood, as this fine memoir makes clear, was an altogether more precarious affair.\u2019</p> <h2>16.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/06/ive-never-seen-doctor-zhivago\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/30/blind-date-rachel-rydian\">Blind Date: \u2018He was raiding his dad\u2019s booze cabinet\u2019</a></strong></h2> <p>\u2018I definitely wasn\u2019t expecting my date to dance for me, but he did a whole&nbsp;Lady Gaga&nbsp;routine, which was very impressive.\u2019</p> <h2>17. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/29/my-favourite-game-britain-upset-usa-gold-tokyo-91\">My favourite game: Britain upset the USA with 4x400m gold at Tokyo \u201891</a></strong></h2> <p>\u2018Pettigrew\u2019s rolling style became a flail, his desperation to reclaim the lead depriving him of all rhythm. Though the slowest of the four British legs, every one of Akabusi\u2019s glorious, unthinkable 410m provided plenty for his latterday motivational speaking career.\u2019</p> <h2>18. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/minneapolis-george-floyd-protests-saturday-crackdown\">Dispatch from Minneapolis: the night the city cracked down on George Floyd protests</a></strong></h2> <p>\u2018But not long after the curfew kicked in, any such illusions were quickly dispelled. A line of state police in riot gear appeared from a side street. A call for the protesters to disperse was swiftly followed by teargas, flash bombs and baton rounds. As the crowd surged away, the police moved rapidly forward in line, driving people back with more gas and rounds.\u2019</p> <h2>19. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/the-chaser-goes-viral-with-provocative-post-mocking-zuckerbergs-position-on-facebook-factchecking\">The Chaser goes viral with provocative post mocking Zuckerberg\u2019s position on Facebook factchecking</a></strong></h2> <p>\u2018An Australian satirical news site crashed on Friday after it went viral for mocking Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s refusal to fact-check social media with a deliberately provocative post.\u2019</p> <h2>20. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/31/beware-jeans-avoid-the-gutter-keep-your-saddle-dry-10-tips-to-make-cycling-a-delight\">Beware jeans, avoid the gutter, keep your saddle dry \u2026 10 tips to make cycling a delight</a></strong></h2> <p>\u2018It\u2019s no good getting a posh road racer if your home is surrounded by potholes, which applies to most of us who live in post-austerity Britain.

They know it is against the law but they are not afraid. We had one mother who was jailed for a year after carrying out FGM but for her she is happy. She is locked up but her girl is cut.</p> <p>\u201cMany girls have been cut, including girls we had managed to keep safe through the cutting season, which began in October last year. Some girls escaped and they ran to our FGM centre; we had several girls just turn up.

In this region of west and central Africa, four out of 10 girls are married before 18. If you look at the countries of the Sahel \u2013 Mali and Niger, Burkina Faso \u2013 it\u2019s six out of 10.\u201d</p> <p>Brooks says there are fears for those who never return. \u201cIt\u2019s a real worry that girls won\u2019t come back \u2026 [because of the Covid-19 outbreak] the financial stresses might be even harder and families will be looking for girls to get married earlier.\u201d</p> <p>However, the pandemic may offer an opportunity to help some children, he says. \u201cThere is a phenomenon in the Sahel area, where many children are sent across borders to be with Qur\u2019anic teachers and learn Arabic. There are hundreds of thousands of [these] children across the region, known as <em>almajirai</em>. They live away from home and the outcomes for these children are very poor; they often end up begging on the street.\u201d</p> <p>The sudden closure of schools put many children in danger by sending them on long unaccompanied journeys home, says Brooks.</p> <p>\u201cWhen [the schools] were closed suddenly children were roaming around trying to get home \u2026 Over 7,000 moved just from Nigeria to Niger; [we think] about 30,000 of them are on the move. It is an awful moment for vulnerable children but Covid has kicked open the door to this situation that wasn\u2019t sufficiently known about.

I\u2019m worried I\u2019m not going to get a job,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge chunk of students coming out of university with no idea what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Polly Hatcher, 23, studied history at the University of Leeds and is now considering a master\u2019s due to limited job opportunities. \u201cI feel a bit lost,\u201d she says. \u201cI had a plan and this has thrown a spanner in the works.\u201d Hatcher hopes further study will allow her&nbsp;to bide time, give her a niche, and make her a stronger candidate.</p> <p>Those who graduate into a decimated job market are often advised to go abroad or to continue education. With options for the former limited by the pandemic, experts are predicting an uptake in postgraduate courses over the next few years.</p> <p>A master\u2019s can give students more skills in a competitive job market. However, Isherwood warns not to look at further study as \u201cthe easy safe option\u201d, since not all postgraduate degrees improve employment prospects. </p> <p>Not everyone can afford this option, either. \u201cThe recession will compound disadvantages,\u201d Josh Hillman, director of education at the Nuffield Foundation, says. One way it could do this is through greater take up of postgraduate courses among wealthier students, he adds.</p> <p>Hillman believes universities now have a \u201csignificant responsibility\u201d to consider the employability of their graduates. In recent years, there has been growing recognition of the need to future-proof students\u2019 skills for a changing world of work, as automation was already expected to alter jobs over the coming decades. The pandemic may have made the focus on transferable skills even more necessary.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe often say our students are going into jobs that don\u2019t exist yet and in a way that\u2019s what employers will look for,\u201d says Natalie Brett, head of London College of Communication and pro vice-chancellor of the University of the Arts, London. </p> <p>Soft skills such as flexibility, resilience, communication, problem solving, and creativity were already becoming increasingly important and will likely become even more desirable, Brett says, while digital skills could be more in demand as organisations move services online.</p> <p>Rachel Hewitt, director of policy and advocacy at the Higher Education Policy Institute, says universities have faced growing demand from students to help them to develop such skills. \u201cThat\u2019s only going to build as we move forward in this difficult time,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Many careers services are currently providing services online. \u201cWe\u2019re busier than ever,\u201d says Claire Guy, a careers advisor at a Russell Group university and a member of the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services. \u201cWe\u2019ve always run workshops on developing a positive mindset, but there\u2019s a new flavour to that now. There\u2019s not just a need [for students] to be resilient about job rejections, but about the fact they might have to change their whole career plan.\u201d</p> <p>Hillman says he fears universities \u2013 which face a \u201cfinancial<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/06/coronavirus-uk-university-finances-student-numbers\"> black hole\u201d </a>estimated at over \u00a32.5bn \u2013 don\u2019t have the ability or expertise to give students the increased support they will need. \u201c[Universities] might have to do some rapid rethinking and partner with national organisations in the employment sector,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that might not be their top priority.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Universities UK is currently working with universities, careers services and employers on ways to provide additional support for recent graduates and current students, such as through enhanced careers services.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the NUS is urging the government to offer financial support for students graduating this year. \u201cGraduates and education leavers need a safety net: government intervention to support them by introducing a grant to be used towards further education, training, and other activity that will improve their job prospects,\u201d Claire Sosienski Smith, NUS vice-president for higher education, says.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/04/i-cant-get-motivated-the-students-struggling-with-online-learning\">'I can't get motivated': the students struggling with online learning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Support given now could help limit \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/06/risk-dole-queue-future-young-people-after-covid-19-crisis\">long-term scarring</a>\u201d caused by graduating into a recession. \u201c[Students graduating now] face a cliff edge,\u201d Hillman says. \u201cEvidence from previous recessions shows the effects of this can last at least up to a decade and possibly beyond that, with regards to earnings and job satisfaction.\u201d</p> <p>Becci Newton, deputy director of public policy research at the Institute of Employment Studies, says new graduates will need to keep moving in the early stage of their career and stay focused on their goals to avoid stagnating. \u201cThe ability to continuously learn and develop becomes the crucial key skill,\u201d she says.&nbsp;</p> <p>All of this may sound daunting to the class of 2020.

  "<p>When Liz Dixon-Spain got married in 1967, there was only one place where she wanted to celebrate \u2013 in her parent\u2019s garden with this beautiful beech tree (<em>Fagus sylvatica</em>) overlooking the festivities. She planted daffodils around it just for the occasion. \u201cIt felt wonderful having the tree in the background,\u201d says the 73-year-old from South Holland, Lincolnshire. \u201cI have been friends with it all my life.\u201d</p> <p>Holding wedding receptions in the garden has become something of a family tradition, with her two sisters also celebrating their nuptials next to the tree in 1974 and then 1977. The beech has been a constant presence in her family\u2019s lives. \u201cIt is part of all of our family memories because they all happened around the tree,\u201d Liz says.</p> <p>When she was a child, Liz often played around the tree with her siblings and enjoyed watching it come to life as a \u201chome to generations of wildlife\u201d. \u201cThere were tawny owls, as well as all the usual garden birds, with pheasants also roosting in its branches. Hedgehogs, squirrels, rabbits, muntjac deer, dormice, frogs and toads have all sheltered in the plants growing under this tree.\u201d</p> <p>After her marriage ended, she moved back to her childhood home, an old vicarage, where she has been living ever since. \u201cWe think our lovely tree is at least 130 years old \u2013 around the same age as the house.\u201d</p> <p>Before the coronavirus pandemic, she would open up the garden to the public as part of the national garden scheme. Visitors were just as impressed when they first caught a glimpse of the tree. \u201cThe house is three storeys and on a hill, so you can see just how big the tree is,\u201d says Liz. \u201cLooking at it from inside the house is fantastic, but to stand right underneath feels extraordinary. It\u2019s in the middle of the garden and it\u2019s so large, it\u2019s almost trying to get into the house.\u201d</p> <p>The tree has also become a major part of her children and grandchildren\u2019s lives too. Liz has four grownup sons, who spent their childhood playing tennis marathons on the grass in front of the tree. Her children and eight grandchildren live across the UK, in London, Scotland, Southport and Stamford. \u201cThey come here to meet up. The tree brings us together.\u201d</p> <p>One of her grandchildren, Frank, 10, lives in Hackney, east London, but visits Liz often. The beech tree inspired him to write the following poem, which begins: \u201cThrough the pebble filled driveway, through the old wooden gate, lay a paradise for nature.\u201d</p> <p>Liz is happy that everything is coming full circle. \u201cThe memories that me, my sisters and my children have are carrying on in our grandchildren, who use the area for camps, \u2018kick the can\u2019 football and wheelbarrow races.

The UK, Ireland, France, Portugal, Italy and Slovakia will all exit coal before 2025. Spain produced 70% less coal-powered energy in 2019 and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-22/spain-nears-life-without-coal-sooner-than-anyone-thought\">is predicted to achieve full </a>closure by 2027.

Here, plants and trees that grew on this spot 17m years ago are exposed by the machines, now mostly in the form of black coal. Some of the wood is still visible, but once laid bare it will decompose quickly in the fresh air.</p> \n<p>The coal companies\u2019 logic is that since the damage to the environment has already been done, existing mines should be exploited to the maximum. But that can mean expanding brown coalfields by digging them out from underneath <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/30/human-rights-mining-german-villagers-take-on-coal-giant-rwe\">existing villages</a>. </p> \n<h2><strong>Bulldozing a village </strong></h2> \n<p>One of those villages is M\u00fchlrose. LEAG, the Czech-owned coal firm that runs Boxberg, wants to add the lignite-rich land beneath the village to its current mine. So M\u00fchlrose will be razed and locals rehoused in the nearby town of Schleife. Even the graves in the cemetery will be moved.</p> \n<p>Of the village\u2019s original 600 inhabitants, only 200 remain. But people\u2019s lives should not be uprooted for a dying industry, Rinnert says.</p> \n<p>Yet some in M\u00fchlrose say they are tired of living next door to a coalmine and are ready to move. \u201cWe\u2019ve suffered here for years,\u201d says Reinhild Martin.

Nearly everyone was employed by the coal company. Men in the mines, women in the cafeterias. At the same time, the noise and pollution were almost unbearable.</p> \n<p>Thick layers of brown or grey coal dust would be carried by the wind, lodging on window panes and clinging to the laundry on the line, Martin remembers. Over the years, she claims, M\u00fchlrose people died of lung cancer, but the matter was never officially investigated.</p> \n<p>Although it pains her to leave, Martin looks forward to a fresh start with the compensation. </p> \n<p>\u201cOnce they start ripping down the houses, I don\u2019t want to return to the village. Those that left before and that came back to see the devastation never really recovered from the sight,\u201d she says. </p> \n<p>In communist East Germany, forced displacement was part of everyday life in mining regions. An estimated 30,000 people in the Lusatia region were relocated and more than 130 villages destroyed.</p> \n<p>Next to the human cost the environmental impact is a lasting one, too. Germany\u2019s lignite mines have destroyed 175,000 hectares of <a href=\"https://www.bund.net/fileadmin/user_upload_bund/_migrated/publications/150330_bund_broschuere_zukunft_statt_braunkohle.pdf\">the country\u2019s landscape</a>. Soil here is considered dead since nothing grows in it afterwards. And once the mine shuts and the pumps regulating the water levels are turned off, the ground becomes waterlogged.</p> \n<p>Rinnert says recultivating disused pits for tourism and other uses has had mixed success and is not sustainably planned. \u201cThe coal companies are making an effort now, but who will pay once their operations stop and their money runs out?\u201d </p> \n<p>Some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/sep/17/lusatian-lake-district-project-east-germany\">old mines</a> have been flooded to <a href=\"https://www.leag.de/de/geschaeftsfelder/bergbau/cottbuser-ostsee/\">create artificial lakes</a>, but managing the water quality is a long-term project. \u201cRight now no guarantees exist that the companies will continue to care for the lakes.

  "<p>Total Recall is a movie about a totalitarian government that\u2019s colonized another planet so it can charge ordinary people to breathe. There would be no conflict in the film without it: no serpentine Philip K Dick plot about a construction worker whose dreams of being a secret agent on Mars are rooted in real memories. No skirmishes between the authorities and the pocket of mutants, deviants and ne\u2019er-do-wells who rebel against them from Martian red-light district of Venusville. And certainly none of the scrotum kicks, impalings or gruesome fusillades of machine-gun fire that audiences had come to expect from an Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/23/the-shining-at-40-will-we-ever-fully-understand-what-it-all-means\">The Shining at 40: will we ever fully understand what it all means?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the director Paul Verhoeven, Total Recall was the next step in his own improbable colonization of Hollywood, following RoboCop three years earlier. Verhoeven had already established himself in his native Holland as a craftsman and provocateur of the first order, eager to test the extremes of sexuality and violence \u2013 his first English-language film was appropriately titled Flesh + Blood \u2013 and indulge a fetish for Hitchcockian blondes and mankind\u2019s darkest impulses. As a small child, Verhoeven had lived through the Nazi occupation and the experience shaped him, not only in films that would address the war directly, like Soldier of Orange and Black Book, but in genre entertainments that smuggled themes about life under fascism.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFMLGEHdIjE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WFMLGEHdIjE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>From a distance of 30 years, it\u2019s now possible to look at Total Recall as the middle part of an unofficial sci-fi/action trilogy about authoritarian governance, bookended by RoboCop and Starship Troopers, but it didn\u2019t seem that political at the time. Verhoeven\u2019s talent for delivering the hard-R goods has always given him the latitude to slip more subversive sentiments into his work, and even the overt satire of RoboCop and Starship Troopers was often ignored or misunderstood during their original run. Now that the future Verhoeven predicted has come to pass \u2013 in corporate and militarized law enforcement, in the propaganda used to sell the public on pointless and endless war \u2013 his intent seems more obvious. But his career in Hollywood, for as long as it lasted, was often about getting away with something.&nbsp;</p> <p>Loosely based on the Philip K Dick short story We Can Remember It for You Wholesale, Total Recall is about Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger), a beefy construction worker in 2084 who lives a modest and happy life with his wife Lori (Sharon Stone), but keeps having vivid dreams of Mars. To scratch this insistent itch, he visits a company called Rekall, which promises interstellar vacations without the risk and expense of boarding a shuttle. Through memory implants, Quaid can order up a two-week trip to Mars that\u2019s as vivid as if he\u2019d gone there himself \u2013 and for a few hundred credits more, he can travel as another character, so he chooses \u201csecret agent\u201d. The procedure goes terribly awry, due to the fact that the Rekall implant clashes with Quaid\u2019s actual memories of being a secret agent on Mars, which nefarious forces have suppressed. It turns out that his current life has been a lie, and it\u2019s going to take an actual trip to Mars for Quaid to unravel this conspiracy and discover who he really is.&nbsp;</p> <p>From there, Verhoeven, working from a heavily fussed-over screenplay credited to Ronald Shusett, Dan O\u2019Bannon and Gary Goldman, departs from the text. Like a lot of Dick\u2019s short stories, We Can Remember It for You Wholesale retreats into metaphysical space where Quaid\u2019s real and false memories collide, but Verhoeven has a Schwarzenegger movie to make. That means Quaid\u2019s journey of self-discovery takes the form of other Schwarzenegger sci-fi/actioners of the period like Predator or The Running Man, with him shooting and punching and bludgeoning his way to the truth. It eventually puts him at the heart of the resistance in the mutant-filled Venusville area on Mars, where he finds the girl of his dreams, Melina (Rachel Ticotin), armed and ready.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81ce064b1e88dd181e188095fc9933914eb47546\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81ce064b1e88dd181e188095fc9933914eb47546/0_0_3501_2383/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Schwarzenegger in Total Recall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Schwarzenegger in Total Recall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image from film company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Drawing from his unrivaled gallery of heavies, Verhoeven cast Ronny Cox, who had played the corporate shark \u201cDick\u201d Jones in RoboCop, as Vilos Cohaagen, the nefarious governor of the Mars Colony, and Michael Ironside, who would later play a military recruiter in Starship Troopers, as Cohaagen\u2019s sadistic right-hand man. We get only bits and pieces of Cohaagen\u2019s business on Mars, but it involves the dangerous mining of turbinium ore, an energy source with military applications, by an oppressed mutant population. The big twist of Total Recall is that Cohaagen knows Mars has the natural potential to create an atmosphere to sustain human life, but it\u2019s more profitable to control an artificial environment himself. Why should these lowly meatsacks get their oxygen for free?</p> <p>Verhoeven pushed the politics of RoboCop and Starship Troopers more to the foreground than he does in Total Recall, but he shows again how propaganda networks brand the resistance as \u201cterrorists\u201d and describe their indiscriminate slaughter as \u201c[restoring] order with minimal use of force\u201d. Total Recall suggests that colonization is an opportunity to terraform a reality that\u2019s entirely managed by the terraformers, without a scrap of land that regular people can call their own. Cohaagen is a delectable villain for Schwarzenegger to knock off, but he\u2019s not an evil genius with some generic or arbitrary plans to be unraveled. He says he\u2019s happy at his job because he gets to do whatever he wants. Controlling who gets to have air is as God-like a power as any mortal can imagine.</p> <p>Of course, Verhoeven is still making a Schwarzenegger movie, and Total Recall is one of his most purely entertaining, full of cartoonish violence, cutting-edge special effects and the types of one-liners that made Schwarzenegger a dad-joke Dirty Harry. (After shooting the duplicitous Lori in the head, Quaid deadpans, \u201cConsider that a divorce.\u201d) As Quaid makes his way to the Mars underground, the film fills the screen with memorable future-world innovations: The walk-through X-ray scanner, the automated driver-less \u201cJohnnycabs\u201d that imitate the banter of actual cab drivers, the erotic possibilities of a three-breasted mutant call girl. Those looking for a good time in a dystopic, totalitarian colony can still find it.</p> <p>Verhoeven and Hollywood would part ways a decade after Total Recall \u2013 consider Hollow Man a divorce \u2013 and he\u2019s currently on a retreat to Europe that\u2019s resulted in two great films, Black Book and Elle, that are more in line with the more modest Dutch films that put him on the map. (His new film, a lesbian nun story called Benedetta, would have probably premiered at Cannes last month were it not cancelled because of the coronavirus.) Seeing the film again is a reminder of how much American blockbusters miss an iconoclast like Verhoeven, who could manage mega-productions without losing his voice in them, and who wasn\u2019t contented by merely turning out slick product. He would prove to be irreplaceable.&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>A decade ago, the highly prized \u201cking of fish\u201d, the bluefin tuna, was taken off menus in high-end restaurants and shunned by top chefs, amid warnings by environmentalists that it was being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2010/mar/19/bluefin-tuna-industry\">driven to extinction</a>.

There are currently 11 CABs, one of which is UK-based Control Union Pesca (CUP). Last year, in its <a href=\"https://cert.msc.org/FileLoader/FileLinkDownload.asmx/GetFile?encryptedKey=m1kVxySCvNnjmy0+sGiy6XJQGKAr/dTPjg4ERHbEuth7qodkjdz70LbyLiRddjhK\">preliminary report</a>, CUP decided Usufuku Honten met the criteria for MSC certification.</p> <p>Di Carlo claimed there was a \u201clack of impartiality\u201d in this process as well as what he believes is flawed science: \u201cThe MSC claims to be very rigorous in its scientific approach but here we have a case where the MSC\u2019s assessors used a number of values far below the scientific average. We know it is not a sustainable fishery but the MSC assessors are coming up with values that ensures it passes. To me, that\u2019s not telling the truth about sustainability.\u201d</p> <p>An audit of the process, carried out by a third party auditor, Assurance Services International, found CUP had assured Usufuku in 2018 that it would be the first bluefin tuna fishery to be certified, after the company had expressed concern over the French fishery also seeking approval. In its <a href=\"https://www.asi-assurance.org/s/assessment/a1P1H000002xXeNUAU/a20171219089\">report</a>, the auditor described this as one of six \u201cminor nonconformity\u201d issues, under standards around impartiality. MSC said CUP has since taken action to address the issues flagged by ASI.&nbsp;</p> <p>WWF, which co-created the now independent MSC scheme two decades ago, has objected to 17 of its certifications in total, mostly unsuccessfully, and has called on the body to reform.</p> <p>\u201cWe think the MSC is an excellent tool,\u201d Di Carlo said \u201cWe have already said clearly we haven\u2019t seen enough reform in the MSC system to be satisfied that they are meeting sustainability criteria. I would not trust all of the fisheries to be sustainable.\u201d</p> <p>Grantly Galland, an officer at the Pew Charitable Trusts, said that after years of overfishing it was premature to \u201cdeclare victory\u201d for bluefin tuna.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe most recent stock assessment for the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean was riddled with uncertainties,\u201d Galland said. \u201cThe scientists were unable to confirm whether the stock has recovered.</p> <p>\u201cWe are objecting because we think the certifying body got it wrong. They concluded ICCAT\u2019s management was a bit more robust than it was in reality.\u201d</p> <p>In a letter posted on the MSC website, Sotaro Usui, CEO of Usufuku Honten, described WWF\u2019s objection as \u201cdisappointing and unfair\u201d and accused it of taking advantage of the review to criticise MSC and ICCAT.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/22/disappearances-danger-and-death-what-is-happening-to-fishery-observers\">Disappearances, danger and death: what is happening to fishery observers?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2017, ICCAT scientists who estimate the health of the migratory bluefin tuna population were unable to say with certainty that the stock had recovered, and recommended \u201ccaution\u201d in setting quotas.</p> <p>Shana Miller, a senior officer in international fisheries conservation for the Ocean Foundation, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no dispute that the population is better off than it was 10 years ago. But are we at the point where the population has recovered? We don\u2019t know. ICCAT scientists don\u2019t know. And if they don\u2019t know, how can the MSC know they have recovered?\u201d</p> <p>Steven Adolf, researcher and author of Tuna Wars, said: \u201cThe MSC is still the best certification standard we have, but there is room for improvement. And I think the MSC are aware of that. ICCAT does not have a very robust management and Pew, WWF and MSC have a common interest to improve that.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Rohan Currey, the chief science and standards officer at MSC, said an assessment includes \u201cmany layers of scrutiny, and input from a wide range of stakeholders\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt ensures the independent assessor takes all available information into account when deciding if a fishery is or is not sustainable.<br><br>\u201cThis bluefin fishery \u2013 Usufuku Honten \u2013 asked to be assessed in 2018 and that process is still under way. As part of this, WWF and the Pew Trusts will shortly have the opportunity to present unresolved objections to an independent legal expert, who will then decide a way forward.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWe cannot prejudge the outcome of this assessment \u2013 but fisheries only get certified if they can demonstrate, through evidence, that they meet the MSC\u2019s robust standard. Clearly, this is vital for a stock such as the eastern Atlantic blue which has suffered historic overexploitation.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Control Union Pesca, now Control Union, told&nbsp;the&nbsp;Guardian it would not be appropriate to comment, as some of the&nbsp;points raised by WWF and Pew are under consideration&nbsp;by an adjudicator.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 and 3 June 2020. Firstly to make clear the stock recovery relates to eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna. Bluefin tuna populations in other areas, including in the western Atlantic, continue to struggle. And secondly to include a statement from the MSC in relation to the CAB assessments of individual fisheries not being precedent setting.</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Manila eases lockdown</strong></h2> <p>Traffic jams and crowds of commuters returned to the Philippine capital on Monday, as Manilla relaxed antivirus measures in a high-stakes gamble to slowly reopen the economy while fighting the coronavirus outbreak.&nbsp;Public transport was still limited and many commuters waited for hours to get a ride despite the government deploying special buses. School classes remain suspended for the next two weeks. Barber shops and beauty salons can open next week at a third of their capacity. The Philippines remains a south-east Asian hotspot for Covid-19, with more than 18,000 infections and 957 deaths.</p> <h2><strong>Japan may open doors to travellers from selected countries</strong></h2> <p>Japan is considering reopening its borders to travellers from selected countries that have low levels of coronavirus infections, as it begins to ease restrictions put in place earlier this year to control the outbreak. As schools, cinemas, sports clubs and department stores reopened in Tokyo on Monday, media have reported that the government is also planning to allow travellers in from Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand in the coming months. There was no immediate comment from the foreign ministry.</p> <h2><strong>Hong Kong reports first locally transmitted case in two weeks</strong></h2> <p>Hong Kong has confirmed its first locally transmitted coronavirus cases in more than two weeks, fuelling concerns over its spread as restrictions on movement are relaxed, Reuters reports. The Centre for Health Protection said on Sunday it was investigating two confirmed cases of coronavirus, taking the number of cases so far to 1,085. Four people have died of the disease in Hong Kong.</p> <h2><strong>Wuhan reports zero new asymptomatic cases</strong></h2> <p>Wuhan, the Chinese city of around 11 million people where the Covid-19 pandemic began, reported no new asymptomatic cases on Sunday, according to Chinese health officials. State media, Xinhua, said on Monday more than 60,000 nucleic acid tests were conducted on Sunday, finding no asymptomatic cases. Mainland China reported 16 new cases overall on Sunday, the highest daily number in three weeks. All were reported as imported cases \u2013 11 in Sichuan province, three in Inner Mongolia, and two in Guangdong.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Brazil passes 500,000 Covid-19 cases</strong></h2> <p>Brazil has reported 16,409 new cases, taking the total of infected cases to 514,849. It keeps the country in second place in terms of infections, behind the US on 1.78 million cases. Brazil has moved into fourth in terms of deaths, with 29,314 fatalities, according to the health ministry. President Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly dismissed the severity of the virus and continued to flout social distancing measures. On Sunday he road a horse to a rally calling for the supreme court to be shut down for investigating him.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Moscow eases lockdown despite high virus caseload</strong></h2> <p>Shopping malls and parks are set to reopen in Moscow on Monday as the Russian capital eases coronavirus restrictions despite having the world\u2019s third-largest caseload, with 405,843 infections. The relaxation of the confinement orders in Moscow, the epicentre of Russia\u2019s outbreak with a population of more than 12 million, comes after President Vladimir Putin announced the epidemic had passed its peak in the country.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>North Korea to reopen schools </strong></h2> <p>North Korea will reopen schools this month after shuttering them over the coronavirus pandemic, reports said Monday. Pyongyang has not confirmed a single infection but has imposed strict rules, including closing its borders and putting thousands of its people into isolation. The new school term \u2013 initially scheduled to start in early April \u2013 has been repeatedly postponed, although some universities and high schools were allowed to resume classes in mid-April.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>The Queen makes first public appearance</strong></h2> <p>In the UK, the Queen has been pictured riding in the grounds of Windsor Castle \u2013 her first public appearance since the lockdown began. Windsor is said to be the Queen\u2019s favourite royal residence and she has been photographed over the weekend riding one of her ponies, a 14-year-old Fell pony called Balmoral Fern. The 94-year-old regularly rides in the grounds of Windsor and has been a passionate horse lover and breeder of thoroughbred racehorses throughout her reign.</p> <h2><strong>Spain to extend lockdown</strong></h2> <p>Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, has said the country needs 15 more days of lockdown until 21 June \u201cto finish with the pandemic once and for all\u201d, and that he would ask parliament to approve a final two-week extension to the stay home rule. \u201cWe have almost achieved what we set out to do,\u201d Sanchez told a press conference, as he expressed his intense relief that the number of new cases in Spain, one of the nations hardest-hit by the virus, had fallen dramatically.</p> <h2><strong>Bangladesh lifts lockdown</strong></h2> <p>Bangladesh lifted its coronavirus lockdown on Sunday, with millions heading back to work in densely populated cities and towns even as the country logged a record spike in deaths and new infections. \u201cThe lockdown has been lifted and we are heading almost towards our regular life,\u201d health department spokeswoman Nasima Sultana said, calling on those returning to work to wear masks and observe social distancing.

The basement of the \u201cChurch of the Presidents\u201d, located opposite the White House briefly caught fire, before firefighters rushed to put it out, and the Washington monument was surrounded by smoke from multiple fires. Officers fired teargas into the crowds, and US marshals personnel and DEA agents were deployed in addition to national guard and Secret Service to assist the police.</p> <p>In the Los Angeles neighborhood of Santa Monica, police fired teargas and other projectiles at protesters blocking a main shopping road. On one shopping street numerous buildings and businesses were looted, including clothing and shoe stores.</p> <p>In New York thousands of protesters returned to the streets, marching through Manhattan during the day and later congregating at Union Square, where numerous police cars had been torched on Saturday night.

This is the civil rights movement and it\u2019s 2020.\u201d</p> <p>There was looting in Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago and other cities throughout the country.</p> <p>Police have come under intense scrutiny and criticism for their actions on Saturday night, accused of heavy handed tactics, attacking and arresting protesters and members of the media.</p> <p>In the Florida city of Fort Lauderdale officers on motorcycles doused crowds in teargas, according to local press reports.</p> <p>In Atlanta, where teargas was again used by police on the streets, two officers were fired and three placed on desk duty over excessive use of force on Saturday night. Officials say the incident came to light via <a href=\"https://www.fox5atlanta.com/video/689934\">a video</a> that shows a group of police officers surrounding a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat. The officers pull the woman out to zip-tie her and appear to use a stun gun on the man. Local reporters said the police had earlier broken glass on the car and also flattened its tires.</p> <p>Demonstrators also protested outside US embassies in London, Berlin and Copenhagen as the movement spread abroad.</p> <p>Back in Minneapolis, authorities were determined to force compliance with the curfew on Sunday night and prevent a repeat of the widespread looting and arson that damaged stores along a more than two-mile stretch of Lake Street, a thoroughfare of mostly locally owned businesses.</p> <p>All the main highways were closed and many side streets closed off by makeshift barricades. A few people around defied orders to stay home at night.

It\u2019s not a dystopian, post-civilisation world \u2013 we\u2019re in a slightly weird world, where things have changed, but not completely.\u201d</p> <p>While there have already been numerous announcements of novels purposefully set during the lockdown \u2013 Avon has already snapped up Love in Lockdown, about two neighbours who meet on their balconies, while <a href=\"https://www.thebookseller.com/news/hodder-buys-lockdown-thriller-stay-home-1203781\">Hodder &amp; Stoughton has acquired Stay Home</a>, in which a married woman breaks lockdown to find her lover murdered in his living room \u2013 many more writers are in Watson and Robertson\u2019s boat, making tweaks and adjustments to reflect our current situation, rather than big changes to plot or character.

There will be insufficiently little exciting plot, in other words, if they can\u2019t interact as they did pre-Covid.\u201d</p> <p>Many writers have decided to shift their novels to the near past to avoid the pandemic entirely. Romance novelist Romy Sommer was writing a contemporary romance set in a Tuscan vineyard, but has agreed with her editor to put it on hold until Italy\u2019s situation stabilises. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll set it in the past, maybe I\u2019ll incorporate Covid once it\u2019s blown over.

Like Lesley Kelly, whose Health of Strangers series, which she started writing around five years ago, is set during a pandemic similar to Covid-19.

I can\u2019t quite believe it\u2019s gone. Maybe I\u2019m in denial, but I do believe it will come back. I\u2019m not sure where or how though. Too much is in the air. I know the show\u2019s producers will do everything they can to get it back up and running.&nbsp;</p> <p>The best thing about being a playwright is having a play on. We write to communicate, to share our stories. Getting into rehearsals, getting a play on stage, that\u2019s what I live for. So it feels extremely sad right now. But everyone in the industry is in the same boat. It\u2019s not like only my show got cancelled because, say, the finance fell through. You have to be humble about your own disappointment, and see the bigger picture.&nbsp;</p> <p>I wonder what theatre will be like after coronavirus. Will there still be audiences? What will they want to see? What will be able to afford to give them? I know we are an industry of resourceful and imaginative people. We won\u2019t give up without a big fight. The aliveness of theatre is such a special, specific thing. I can\u2019t see it going away.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea71798597847a529e95babbb4726e6bdd8beeb9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea71798597847a529e95babbb4726e6bdd8beeb9/379_915_4992_2995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inferno from the Dante Project performed in Los Angeles last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inferno from the Dante Project performed in Los Angeles last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cheryl Mann/The Music Center</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018I was involved in 80 shows around the world.

Now, thanks to coronavirus, around 80 shows I was involved in around the world have been cancelled.&nbsp; I\u2019d been working on The Dante Project, a three-part epic that was due to premiere at the Royal Opera House in London this month. It took three years to bring together. The score was done, the designs were finished, and we were just about to go into rehearsals with the Royal Ballet when everything shut down.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d6c5b02542ec5ec156c51dff19c6b5386866dc08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6c5b02542ec5ec156c51dff19c6b5386866dc08/2231_165_2472_3090/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018This is a key moment for the Government\u2019 \u2026 Wayne McGregor.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This is a key moment for the Government\u2019 \u2026 Wayne McGregor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: South China Morning Post via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The actual cancellation was quite quick and brutal. I found out in March just after my 50th birthday. The Royal Ballet had planned a celebration for me, to go alongside the Dante premiere, which would have been lovely. I\u2019m generally an optimist, though. I\u2019m pretty good at dealing with what life throws at me. The most difficult thing for me has been my company. I have a company of 50 people and they\u2019re my biggest concern. Trying to work out how it can have a life in the future has taken a huge amount of energy.&nbsp;</p> <p>The creative arts will always be vibrant, but this is a key moment for the government to realise their crucial value to everyday life, and support the industry. The experience of watching a play, a ballet, a live performance, when you\u2019re all in the same space, breathing the same air together \u2013 that\u2019s such a special thing.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f47fb2254f876390154f0ae8475a4cb7f9e67ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f47fb2254f876390154f0ae8475a4cb7f9e67ee/1126_1639_1915_1149/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018My mood changes hourly\u2019 \u2026 Catherine Cohen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My mood changes hourly\u2019 \u2026 Catherine Cohen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zack DeZon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018I flew to London and there were six people on the plane\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Catherine Cohen, comedian and actor</em></p> <p>In early March, I did this fun show in Washington DC with a bunch of female comedians. After the show, I asked them: \u201cI\u2019m meant to go to London in two days. Do you think that\u2019s a bad idea?\u201d And they were like: \u201cNo, it will be fine. You should go!\u201d</p> <p>So I flew to London and there were six people on my flight. There was this weird<em> </em>energy in the air, but my show was sold out and went amazingly. Afterwards, I was hugging a bunch of people and having drinks at the bar. I got back to my hotel room at 3am and finally had a chance to check my phone. There was a message from my mum saying: \u201cYou need to come home right now!\u201d I cancelled the rest of my London shows and flew back.</p> <p>I\u2019m dying to get back to performing. I host a weekly show at Club Cumming in New York\u2019s East Village and I miss it so much. I\u2019ve started hosting it every Wednesday on my Instagram Live, which is useful, because having a show to prepare for helps me remember what day of the week it is. But it\u2019s no replacement for the energy of performing in front of a live crowd.</p> <p>My mood changes on the hour. Some days I wake up with a knot in my stomach, feeling hopeless, thinking that everything I\u2019ve ever worked for in my career has disappeared. And then other days I think: \u201cWhat a wonderful opportunity to pause, reflect \u2013 and reinvent my artistic process!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21c738dbabd8df23a51fd84a5691c979819a29c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21c738dbabd8df23a51fd84a5691c979819a29c8/0_42_4941_2965/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018This is the longest I\u2019ve gone without playing the drums since I was 14\u2019 \u2026 Jack Bevan, on right, with Foals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This is the longest I\u2019ve gone without playing the drums since I was 14\u2019 \u2026 Jack Bevan, on right, with Foals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018They were doing temperature checks at Manila airport\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Jack Bevan, drummer, Foals</em></p> <p>We were at Heathrow airport, on our way to tour Asia, just as everything started to shut down. When we arrived at Manila, in the Philippines, everyone at the airport was having their temperature checked. Then our Manila gig got cancelled the day before we were meant to play. We flew back to the UK and were in lockdown about a week later.&nbsp;</p> <p>I feel sorry for emerging bands who would have been promoting debut records this summer. They\u2019ll be hit the hardest. If coronavirus had happened to us the year our first album came out, or even our second, it would have crippled us. We might have been dropped by our label. But because we\u2019re more established, we\u2019ve been able to take a year off touring.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If this had happened the year our first album came out, it would have crippled us</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Still, it hurts. Festivals account for approximately 80% of our income. The impact on artists is huge, but it\u2019s also devastating for people who aren\u2019t talked about so much \u2013 the road crew and the venue staff, who may not fall into the furloughing scheme. We\u2019ve been selling fans Foals T-shirts to support the crew. We\u2019ve actually sold 3,000, which helped tide them over for a few months.&nbsp;</p> <p>We haven\u2019t been able to get in a room to play because of the lockdown rules \u2013 and I\u2019m itching to do it. This is the longest I\u2019ve gone without playing the drums since I was 14. Our initial plan was to spend 2020 touring, then and go back into the studio next year. But I think we\u2019ll probably start writing later this year instead, and get back to touring next year \u2014 if we\u2019re allowed.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c7bf820c07ba5b73f23210181f6ca795bfa34c15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7bf820c07ba5b73f23210181f6ca795bfa34c15/0_309_6326_3795/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Chaotic flight\u2019 \u2026 Chelsea Wolfe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Chaotic flight\u2019 \u2026 Chelsea Wolfe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Total Guitar Magazine/Future via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018My crew and I almost didn\u2019t make it back home\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Chelsea Wolfe, singer-songwriter</em></p> <p>It was wild watching everything happen. I went from being on a tour bus on my way to Berlin to buying flights, driving straight to the airport, and getting on a chaotic plane home to the US. My crew and I almost didn\u2019t make it back. After Trump announced a ban on all arrivals from Europe, the airlines started price-gouging. Flights were jumping from a few hundred dollars to thousands right in front of our eyes.&nbsp;</p> <p>There was definitely a period of mourning when I got home. I poured so much into Birth of Violence, my last album, and I was so looking forward to getting it out to people on tour. I thought I might still be able to do my later tour dates, but then the entire European leg was cancelled, followed by Australia and New Zealand.</p> <p>I live in northern California, near the mountains. Now I wake up in the morning, do a Zoom yoga class, and start making music in my home studio. Once I got over the shock of being at home, it was nice to be creative again. I work on songs with my bandmates, going back and forth via email.&nbsp;</p> <p>The financial stuff is scary. Cancelling the tour was huge. I\u2019d already invested so much money into booking the tour bus, renting the gear, paying for my crew, the flights, a week of their time for rehearsals, the stage dressings. None of that stuff is refundable. I\u2019ve been able to sell some tour merch, which helps. It\u2019s been cool to see fans wanting to support artists. Lots have left comments online saying: \u201cI was meant to see you play live, but I bought a T-shirt instead.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Across the valley, the hills have slowly adopted the dusty colours and frayed textures of full summer. Widening patches of pale green meadow stood out across the landscape as the silage was cut, wilted and gathered in the welcome sunshine.</p> <p>The lack of significant rainfall over the past month has reduced the flow of the stream to a meagre trickle, altering the soundscape of the lane and bringing the background patterns of wind and birdsong into sharper focus. The last of the bluebells, nearly hidden by tall grasses, topped the bank, while the seed heads of dandelions, perfectly mature, waited for a liberating gust of wind. At the top of the track, beyond a field of rushes tall enough to conceal a fox, I took the path across the hill towards the quarry. As I paused to look beyond a gap in the hedge, one of the grazing horses wandered over to check my pockets for potential snacks, leaning its head over my shoulder as if to share the view of the Cambrian mountains.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ad19f6cb4b820b66275ce5814b2c730251beaa6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ad19f6cb4b820b66275ce5814b2c730251beaa6/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The view through the hedges of sheep grazing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">View through the hedges of sheep grazing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Gilbey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The tunnel of branches over the track brought cool dappled shade, but just down the hillside the canopy was more open than last year. The savage gales of February had partly toppled two of the shallow-rooted oaks, which now rested uncertainly on their neighbours. In the open arena of the disused quarry, the turf overlying the thin soil was crisp and yellow from drought. The emerging flower spikes of the foxgloves that dot the ground had matured over the few days since my last visit, and wild bees swerved urgently between the newly opened blooms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8989e6e727be42457af7988bb26dd9ad02f0c136\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8989e6e727be42457af7988bb26dd9ad02f0c136/0_88_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The first of the honeysuckle flowers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The first of the honeysuckle flowers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Gilbey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the end of the old coach road, a right turn would have taken me down to the coast. The temptation was strong, but it has been many weeks since I could justify a walk on the narrow cliff path, and I had to settle for the sea glint on the horizon. With regret I turned left and, clambering over the stile, took the footpath across the top field towards home. By the final gateway, the valley opened out below me under a newly leaden sky. As I dropped into the steep-banked road, the cooling afternoon drew the scent of the first honeysuckle flowers down from the hedgerows.</p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump was taken to the secure White House bunker, usually reserved for times of war or terrorist attacks, in the midst of noisy protests on Friday about the killing of George Floyd by police, and sporadic clashes close to the presidential complex\u2019s perimeter.</p> <p>According to several accounts by unnamed officials, Trump spent nearly an hour sequestered in the austere suite of hardened underground rooms designed for use in grave emergencies, and in which the then vice-president, Dick Cheney, took shelter during the 9/11 attacks.</p> <p>The decision to move the president to the bunker was attributed to US Secret Service officers tasked with protecting him. It was taken as chants from protesters in nearby Lafayette Park could be heard in the White House, and Secret Service and DC and park police were required to push back demonstrators from barriers close to the White House, some of whom were throwing stones and water bottles.</p> <p>The decision to take Trump to the bunker, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/politics/trump-protests-george-floyd.html\">first reported in the New York Times</a>, preceded the turning off of external lights at the White House during further protests on Sunday, and has inevitably reinforced the sense of a president under siege.</p> <p>Largely unheard from except for the stream of predictably accusatory and inflammatory tweets, Trump did, however, condemn Floyd\u2019s killing in a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-kennedy-space-center/\">speech marking the SpaceX launch in Florida</a> on Saturday.</p> <p>The White House and Secret Service remarked that they did not comment on security protocols and decisions or the means and methods of protective operations. The bunker is hardened to withstand the force of a passenger jet crashing into the White House.</p> <p>The incident provoked a stream of derisive comments on social media, comparing Trump unfavourably both to the presumptive Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, who visited protesters and to the cowardly lion from the Wizard of Oz. The hashtag \u201c#bunkerboy\u201d became a trending term on Twitter.</p> <p>Greg Sargent, who writes the Plum Line blog for the Washington Post, wrote: \u201cPresident of the United States cowering in fear of delivering a national address while instead issuing deranged tweets from his underground bunker somehow persuades himself that the world is laughing at someone else.\u201d</p> <p>The activist and author Amy Siskind was equally scathing. \u201cTrump hiding out in a bunker Friday, and shutting off the lights at the White House Sunday \u2013 both over a few hundred protesters \u2013 will be forever remembered as defining moments of his presidency when he was revealed as a coward, not the strongman he advertised.\u201d</p> <p>Colin Hanks, the actor son of Tom Hanks, described the incident as a metaphor for Trump\u2019s presidency.</p> <p>\u201cTrump is not leader. He KNOWS it in his bones. He is a coward. Turning off the lights, pretending no one is home while hiding in a bunker. There is no better metaphor for his, and his entire administration\u2019s failures. The election is in seven months. VOTE. HIM. OUT.\u201d</p> <p>Trump, who has tweeted encouraging the use of lethal force against \u201clooters\u201d, and warned protesters outside the White House of \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and \u201cominous weapons\u201d, has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service.</p> <p>By Monday Trump was calling for \u201claw and order\u201d and blaming far-left agitators for a sixth straight night of violent nationwide protests.</p> <p>After his visit to the space Launch in Florida on Saturday, Trump returned to a White House under virtual siege, with protesters, some violent, gathered just a few hundred yards away through much of the night. Demonstrators returned on Sunday afternoon, facing off against police at Lafayette Park into the evening.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/george-floyd-donald-trump-protests-violence-looting\">George Floyd: Donald Trump under fire as violence flares across America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe president and his family were rattled by their experience on Friday night, according to several advisers,\u201d the Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/politics/trump-protests-george-floyd.html\">report said</a>.</p> <p>Trump has been widely criticised for his response to the protests that have rocked the nation since video of Floyd\u2019s death began spreading on social media. <br><br>Despite days of peaceful protests and violent clashes with police in some of America\u2019s major cities, Trump has not addressed the nation and has repeatedly sent inflammatory messages over Twitter.</p> <p>Late on Friday, Trump tweeted that protesters could have been attacked with dogs and weapons wielded by the US Secret Service and accused the DC mayor for supposedly not providing police to protect the White House.</p> <p>\u201cThey let the \u2018protesters\u2019 scream and rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard \u2013 didn\u2019t know what hit them,\u201d Trump said.</p> <p>\u201cIf they had [breached the fence],\u201d the president continued, \u201cthey would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.
