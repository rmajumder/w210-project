Most have a crew of more than 1,000 who often live in close quarters below decks.</p> <p>At least a dozen people have already been brought to shore off these ships requiring urgent medical attention.</p> <p>The NSW government hopes that after this medical work is done, these vessels will return to their ports of origin.</p> <p>\u201cA ship left two nights ago, and there\u2019s information that over the next couple of nights another couple of ships will refuel and restock and go back to their original port, or their port of origin.

  "<p>In the early 2000s, the most popular queer characters on TV were Jack McFarland and Will Truman of the sitcom Will &amp; Grace. Will and Jack were so beloved, Vice-President Joe Biden once theorized the show had <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/will-grace-real-life-political-impact-marriage-equality/\">played a major role in shifting views on marriage equality</a>. The characters were also the start of a trope that would prevail on TV for years: the cosmopolitan gay male. The image would live on in shows such as Queer as Folk, Looking, and the reality competitions Project Runway and America\u2019s Next Top Model. Who could imagine that 20 years on, a mullet-wearing, gay, polyamorous exotic animal owner from rural Oklahoma would become TV\u2019s biggest talked about gay star?</p> <p>Joe Exotic, the eccentric subject of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-series\">Netflix docu-series Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness</a>, has amassed a fervent following in the short time since the show\u2019s premiere on Friday. The rapper Cardi B <a href=\"https://people.com/music/cardi-b-start-gofundme-tiger-king-joe-exotic/\">live-tweeted</a> her reactions and expressed a desire to start a GoFundMe campaign for Mr Exotic, whose full name Wikipedia gives as Joseph Allen Maldonado-Passage (n\u00e9 Schreibvogel). Fans have taken to dressing up as Joe, slapping on fake handlebar mustaches and blond mullet wigs. And actors such as Dax Shepard and Jared Leto are pitching themselves to play the gun-loving zookeeper in a <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/03/30/celeb-tiger-king-fans-fighting-over-roles-in-future-movie/\">forthcoming scripted miniseries</a>. Amid the anxiety of the coronavirus pandemic, we are finding humor and relief in an imperfect, self-described \u201credneck\u201d queer who owns more than 200 tigers. He\u2019s the furthest cry from the affable, anodyne queer men who typically win America over, such as Cam and Mitchell of Modern Family and the \u201cgay best friend\u201d cast of Queer Eye. But unlikely times call for an unlikely hero.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible people need a really flawed person to humanize right now,\u201d says Matt Brim, professor and author of Poor Queer Studies. Brim says the love for Joe might be more complicated than it immediately appears to be. \u201cWhat is the calculus here? For some viewers, Joe Exotic\u2019s rural white queer class identity may be his flaw, so that looking past or accepting it signals tolerance, that most passive-aggressive of power plays. For other viewers, those same qualities \u2013 in their specific and unwieldy combination \u2013 may represent the very soup of our common dilemma. One thing\u2019s for sure: we\u2019re not in South Bend any more,\u201d he said, referring to the city where the former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg was mayor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/shortcuts/2020/apr/01/like-pouring-tequila-on-your-brain-why-tiger-king-is-the-most-watched-show-on-netflix\">Like pouring tequila on your brain: why Tiger King is the most-watched show on Netflix</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Joe belongs to a rural, Republican-voting, working-class background, which makes for great TV for those who have a superficial understanding of the south. Joe appears to be keenly aware of this fact, playing into the shock value of his queer, southern life. Before Tiger King, he pitched multiple reality shows about his life to networks and starred in country music videos with his husbands. He is the perfect kind of reality star \u2013 straddling the line between an unrestrained \u201cbig\u201d personality and a caricature.</p> <p>Joe\u2019s queerness and southern-ness intersect in distinct, complex ways. This includes his use of meth, a popular gay recreational drug. (In 2018, Oklahoma, site of Joe\u2019s zoo, was listed as having one of the highest <a href=\"https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/meth-addiction/meth-capital/#gref\">rates of meth use</a> in the US.) He goes out of his way to associate with traditional ideas of masculinity through his love for guns, collection of large, aggressive animals, and pursuit of young, butch men who have previous histories of only dating women.</p> <p>In the show, Joe says he fell in love with tigers while recovering from a suicide attempt he linked to his parents\u2019 homophobia. Did Joe decide the best way to reconcile his queerness with his surroundings was to assimilate in the most extreme ways \u2013 leaning into the love for hunting and control over wildlife that dominates southern culture? Then he cultivated this assimilation and it grew into a profitable persona. Joe made it so that the most outrageous thing about him in Oklahoma was neither his queerness or poly relationships. It was his tigers.</p> <p>Despite his progressive lifestyle, Joe himself is not a progressive. He believes in unregulated gun rights and, during his bizarre, far-fetched run for governor of Oklahoma, positioned himself as a libertarian. A viral video shows him pondering why black people can say the N-word but white people can\u2019t. However, his queerness complicates this otherwise predictable ideology. At his wedding, we see Joe and his two husbands dressed in fuschia western shirts \u2013 none of the elements feel coherent or like they belong together. Since its legalization in 2015, same-sex marriage no longer possesses the same air of radicalism and defiance. But a <em>polyamorous </em>one? Even the progressives in Brooklyn might bat a lash at that.</p> <p>In Tiger King, Joe presents a less than perfect view of himself \u2013 from his meth use to nasty spats with co-workers to his tragic, failed marriages to allegedly straight men. But, in many ways, Joe\u2019s imperfections (and criminal convictions) are what make him feel like a breakthrough for queer representation. Because \u201cperfect\u201d is so 1998.</p> <p>However, there is the danger we are collectively laughing<em> at </em>Joe and his rural background, instead of laughing <em>with</em> him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-series\">Murder, madness and tigers: behind the year's wildest Netflix series</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a post, the runner of the popular Instagram account QueerAppalachia expressed concerns over Joe\u2019s popularity, writing: \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about why Joe is a joke to everyone, even to the folks that understand the nuanced history &amp; economics that brought him into existence as a rural queer\u2026 [Joe Exotic] is more than just another <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/hillbillyjoke/\">#hillbillyjoke</a>, so much of his story is about class &amp; access.\u201d</p> <p>Representation of queerness in red states has always been sparse and complicated. The portrayals often face accusations of being exploitative or overly simplistic. A recent one was John B McLemore of the hit podcast series S-Town. McLemore was a queer horologist living in Woodstock, Alabama, a small, conservative place he hated. Critics called the podcast \u201cvoyeuristic\u201d and irresponsible for outing McLemore after his death. Netflix\u2019s Queer Eye occasionally chooses LGBTQ+ subjects living in conservative locales for its transformations, and the show\u2019s format \u2013 \u201cfix all your problems in an hour\u201d with a group of affluent, pro-consumption coastal gay men \u2013 has drawn scrutiny.</p> <p>Does the novelty of a complicated figure such as Joe Exotic expose our preferences for coastal queer narratives? \u201cYes,\u201d says John Howard, professor and author of Men Like That: A Southern Queer History. \u201cFor 25 years, scholars have criticized a bicoastal bias in US queer history that has focused attention on east and west coast metropolitan areas. But this is changing.\u201d Howard points to the conversations Tiger King is producing. \u201cLet\u2019s hope the public debate expands. Perhaps we\u2019ll learn more about working-class queers and trans people of color who, as yet, remain at the margins of Joe\u2019s narrative.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

  "<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) is considering changing its guidance on whether people should wear face masks in public, prompted by new evidence that suggests doing so could help contain the pandemic.</p> <p>The WHO, and the UK government, currently advise that face masks do not play a major role in protecting people from infection outside healthcare settings. But there are growing calls for this stance to be reviewed, with suggestions that the widespread use of face masks may have played a role in containing outbreaks in some Asian countries.</p> <p>Speaking at a Chatham House briefing on Wednesday, Prof David Heymann, an infectious disease expert who led the global response to the SARS outbreak, said that new evidence from Hong Kong had prompted a reconsideration of the role of face masks. \u201cThe WHO is debating that tomorrow to understand if there is evidence that would call for a change in what WHO is recommending,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The data from Hong Kong was shared confidentially with the WHO, but is likely to be published soon, Heymann said. He added that, in reassessing its policy, the WHO would take into account health workers\u2019 need for masks in all countries.</p> <p>The possible shift in guidance comes as a body representing thousands of doctors in the UK called for every patient and member of staff in hospitals to be provided with face masks, to be worn at all times to help reduce the spread of coronavirus.</p> <p>The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) says the virus is so widespread and infectious, and the risks to frontline staff so great, that everyone in hospital should always have their mouth covered to reduce the risk of transmission.</p> <p>The HCSA is demanding the change in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/worrying-event-deaths-of-nhs-doctors-from-covid-19-stark-reminder-of-pandemic\">the death of two hospital doctors</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/first-nhs-consultant-dies-from-covid-19\">Amged El-Hawrani</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/first-working-nhs-surgeon-dies-from-coronavirus\">Adil El Tayar</a>, from coronavirus. Hawrani, aged 55, was an ear, nose and throat specialist while Tayar was a transplant surgeon.</p> <p>\u201cOur call for surgical masks to be worn by all staff and patients in all areas of hospitals, and for all patients to be treated as Covid-19 patients, comes in the wake of two consultant deaths, and of course the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/uk-prime-minister-boris-johnson-tests-positive-for-coronavirus\">infection of the prime minister and health secretary</a>,\u201d said Dr Claudia Paoloni, the HCSA\u2019s president and an anaesthetist at an NHS hospital in Bristol. \u201cThis underlines how infectious this disease is.\u201d</p> <p>In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/cdc-considering-recommending-general-public-wear-face-coverings-in-public/2020/03/30/6a3e495c-7280-11ea-87da-77a8136c1a6d_story.html\">is also said to be reviewing its guidance on masks</a> and may advise Americans to cover their faces while commuting to work. And in <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/not-wearing-masks-protect-against-coronavirus-big-mistake-top-chinese-scientist-says\">a recent interview</a>, George Gao, the director general of China\u2019s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, suggested the failure to wear masks in the US and Europe was a \u201cbig mistake\u201d.</p> <p>Dr Peter KaHung Chan, an epidemiologist at the University of Oxford, said that the evidence on public use of face masks is still unclear, but that <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034660v1.full.pdf\">observational studies from Hong Kong</a> have, at least, shown that the overall package of containment measures have been effective. \u201cFace masks are certainly not the only thing that was useful, but they\u2019re something that should be studied properly instead of dismissed or excessively promoted with inadequate empirical evidence,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Until now, the WHO has suggested that masks are mostly useful for protecting other people if you have symptoms such as coughs and sneezes that could spread droplets. But Heymann said the realisation that a lot of transmission of Covid-19 occurs before symptoms raises the possibility that masks could help stop the spread among people before symptoms emerge.</p> <p>\u201cOne or two days before symptoms develop, it seems [people] may be shedding virus at that time and it may be that if they\u2019re talking and spewing droplets around they may be spreading the virus,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAs the evidence becomes available it seems that there will be a more serious debate [including] tomorrow at the WHO trying to decide whether masks really do play a role at some point in the outbreak containment,\u201d he added. \u201cBelieve me if they do, there\u2019s a private sector healthy enough in many countries to begin producing those masks in the quantities that are necessary.\u201d</p> <p>Paoloni\u2019s call to Public Health England (PHE) comes as it finalises new guidance telling NHS staff across the UK what personal protective equipment (PPE) they should wear in different areas of hospitals and other settings when dealing with patients who are confirmed or suspected to have Covid-19. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/31/nhs-staff-gagged-over-coronavirus-protective-equipment-shortages\">Serious shortages of PPE </a>and confusion over what kit is needed have prompted huge alarm and fear among frontline staff.</p> <p>In a letter to PHE, Paoloni says that staff should wear full PPE \u2013 double gloves, a surgical gown, FFP3 face mask and visor or goggles \u2013 in a wider range of settings that PHE has previously proposed, including A&amp;E units, operating theatres, wards, radiology departments and intensive care units, which are rapidly filling up with infected patients.</p> <p>\u201cStaff and patients may not even be aware they are spreading the virus because the symptoms can be so slight and vary from person to person. Even those who appear to have recovered may be infectious. By shifting to a policy where staff and patients are considered potential Covid-19 carriers, we will be cutting the prospect of infection and reducing the chances of crucial NHS staff being taken ill at the worst possible time,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cOur message is simple: we need social distancing in our hospitals too, and that means changing the guidance so that everyone wears a mask.\u201d</p> <p>The HCSA is \u201cconcerned that safety standards are being dictated by supply [availability of PPE] rather than than being based on protecting NHS staff, our most precious resource,\u201d she added.</p> <p>NHS England and ministers have made huge efforts over the past 10 days to get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/31/more-orders-for-nhs-ventilators-covid19\">many millions of pieces of extra kit</a> to hospitals, GP surgeries and other care settings.</p>",

The shuttering of businesses and the complete dissolution of supply chains means that the sector that accounts for around 1/7th of the UK economy is effectively closed for business. While new orders, as well as delivery times, can reverse quickly as businesses rebuild inventories, the worst decline in employment since July 2009 shows that a recovery will not be quite as instantaneous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is optimism amongst businesses that output will be higher in a year\u2019s time, which the nation will certainly be hoping is the case.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <h2>Seamus Nevin, Chief Economist at Make UK</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cToday may be April Fool\u2019s Day but this result is no joke. A PMI score of 47.8 amidst the ongoing Covid19 outbreak is a sign of just how hard manufacturers have been hit. </p> <p>\u201cMany firms have had to shut and lots of those that remain open have seen orders or output suffer. Others have switched to making products that are vital to the national attempt to stop the spread of the virus; a testament to why backing manufacturing is so important.<br></p> <p>\u201cAt the start of this year manufacturing companies reported unprecedented optimism about investment and trade but that had all been swept away by current events. With estimates suggesting up to a fifth of smaller firms could go out of business in the next few months Coronavirus has highlighted the need to maintain and develop our domestic manufacturing base. The Chancellor has rightly intervened to help but even still costs are going up. A 6.2% increase in the national living wage came into effect this morning.

  "<p>The creation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2020/apr/01/nhs-nightingale-inside-londons-temporary-coronavirus-hospital-video\" title=\"\">NHS Nightingale</a>, assembling a 4,000-bed emergency hospital in just two weeks, is an important milestone. It is not fashionable to give ministers the benefit of the doubt, but the circumstances should allow the presumption of decent motive. They are trying to protect people. That does not make them immune from error, nor should it insulate them from criticism. It is possible to applaud government efforts without ignoring poor judgment.</p> <p>It appears clear that the Covid-19 virus spread faster and wider than might have been the case, because Downing Street underestimated the risks and moved too slowly to a regime of mass testing, by which point materials were harder to procure. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/aged-care-providers-with-covid-19-cases-had-to-ask-for-ppe-from-emergency-stockpile\" title=\"\">Shortages of personal protective equipment</a>, for which health and social care workers are now desperate, arose from a failure to anticipate demand weeks ago, or even years. A pandemic was listed among disaster scenarios for Whitehall contingency planning long before the current outbreak. Yet testing, isolation and quarantine \u2013 basic public health interventions \u2013 were barely on the ministerial agenda.</p> <p>The facts are that progress on testing is slower than people have been led to expect, and frontline workers feel unprotected, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-government-vows-accelerate-testing\" title=\"\">promises of prompt action</a>. There is no need to wait before holding the government to account for mismanagement of expectations. Promises have been broken and clarity about the reasons for delay have not been forthcoming. On insufficient testing, an internal government briefing note contains the mystifying defence that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/who-urges-countries-to-track-and-trace-every-covid-19-case\" title=\"\">World Health Organi</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/who-urges-countries-to-track-and-trace-every-covid-19-case\" title=\"\">zation\u2019s instruction</a> to \u201ctest, test, test\u201d was aimed at another audience. \u201cNot all countries have the same infrastructure as the UK,\u201d the note says, \u201cand there are countries that the WHO needs to press on testing.\u201d The implication is that the advice was for less developed nations, which is neither true nor relevant to the question of why Britain is not moving faster. Germany has been testing on a scale that far outstrips the rest of Europe.</p> <p>What the government needs is consistency about its story and to admit mistakes in real time. There are questions for ministers to answer over the provision of protective equipment. We are nowhere near the 250,000 daily tests for coronavirus infections the prime minister promised. This figure looked like the worst kind of spin when Downing Street admitted on Wednesday that only 2,000 people out of 500,000 frontline NHS workers had been tested for coronavirus. Similarly, spraying around claims of 3.5m <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/uk/coronavirus-british-government-buys-3-5m-antibody-test-kits-1.4212250\" title=\"\">serological tests</a> \u2013 to gauge background rates of exposure and immunity \u2013 further eroded trust, given there is little evidence of them. Ministers are making promises they cannot keep.</p> <p>Politicians might inspire more confidence by admitting the scale of the challenge instead of pretending that more is being done than can realistically be achieved. Jeremy Hunt has been the government\u2019s most effective critic, perhaps because he was health secretary when the <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2020/03/government-documents-show-no-planning-ventilators-event-pandemic\" title=\"\">last national pandemic flu exercise</a> was run \u2013 and the NHS was found wanting. Yet Mr Hunt did not upgrade the health service\u2019s capacity to cope effectively.</p> <p>Downing Street\u2019s communications strategy through the crisis has been a mix of candour and opacity. There have been moments of refreshing honesty \u2013 about the likely severity of what is to come \u2013 and a laudable public deference to science. But, under pressure, there has also been a notable default back to bad habits of waffle and misdirection.</p> <p>Politicians instinctively avoid admitting when they have no answers to a question, for fear it shows weakness, but the greater danger right now is corroding public confidence with spun lines that cannot hold. This unusual situation requires a level of respect for government efforts that is unfamiliar in peacetime. But the quid pro quo is that government also respects the people with clear, honest accounts of the challenges and its decisions. So far it has largely not. There is an understandable pressure to feed a public appetite for information. Unduly optimistic claims about PPE and testing appear to be driven by the view that audiences need good news. They do, but not if it later turns out to have been fake news.</p>",
  "<p>Since the introduction of strict new measures to stem the spread of coronavirus, not everybody has been in agreement as to what exactly \u201clockdown\u201d means.

Travel for the purposes of work where it cannot be carried out from home, similarly for the provision of voluntary services, is also legal.</p> \n<h2>Why have there been disagreements over these limited rights?</h2> \n<p>The problem has been that ministers and officials, eager to prevent transmission of the coronavirus, are circulating more restrictive guidance than is in statute or the regulations.

Those who do not pay can be taken to court.</p> \n<h2>Can people appeal against fines?</h2> \n<p>The courts are not hearing many cases at the moment, but anyone who feels they have been fined inappropriately can go to court to contest it.

His outfit is known for their use of online adverts that aim to cut through the cacophony of social media using simple, blunt messaging while also attracting controversy for stunts such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/19/tories-tweet-anti-labour-posts-under-factcheckuk-brand\">rebranding the Conservative press officer account as </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/19/tories-tweet-anti-labour-posts-under-factcheckuk-brand\">\u201cFact Check UK</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/19/tories-tweet-anti-labour-posts-under-factcheckuk-brand\">\u201d</a> while posting about the leaders\u2019 debate in the last election.</p> <p>Both the government and health officials have united behind the slogan of \u201cStay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives\u201d, which is being repeated at every opportunity. The phrase, credited to former Michael Gove adviser Henry de Zoete, is now printed on a bright yellow background on lecterns during daily Downing Street press conferences, while also appearing on official public information adverts.</p> <p>The government has also been able to take advantage of relatively cheap availability of commercial advertising, with many big companies reducing their marketing spend following the economic chaos caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Newspaper websites have been particularly badly hit, with many companies blocking their adverts from appearing alongside articles relating to the coronavirus outbreak, meaning many face an uncertain financial future even though their journalism has never been more popular.</p> <p>The NHS has separately upped the promotion of its mental health campaign Every Mind Matters, amid concerns the public could be struggling to cope while staying at home and away from other people during the pandemic. The health service is running adverts on Facebook, Instagram, and Facebook\u2019s Messenger service in a bit to increase awareness of the service which offers mental health improvement plans to the public.</p> <p>They are also promoting advice for people worried about coronavirus, urging the public to talk to others about their worries, stick to trusted sources of information, and do their best to connect with people.</p> <p>The government already has experience running large-scale communications campaigns, having recently spent \u00a346m on last autumn\u2019s Get Ready promotions designed to prepare the British public for a potential no-deal Brexit \u2013 although that was later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/28/get-ready-for-brexit-campaign-had-little-effect-says-watchdog\">judged to have had little impact</a>.</p> <p>Adverts featuring chief medical officer Chris Whitty telling people to remain at home have been appearing across television and radio since last week, while the the same promotion has been placed at the top of listings on Apple\u2019s App Store and iTunes.</p>",
  "<p>The Evening Standard, edited by the former chancellor George Osborne, has imposed a 20% pay cut on some staff and furloughed others in a move that may breach UK employment law.</p> <p>The London newspaper, which has reported losses of \u00a323m over the past two years and relies on advertising for more than 80% of its revenues, announced the moves to staff on Wednesday in response to a dramatic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/01/newspapers-to-lose-50m-in-online-ads-as-firms-use-coronavirus-blacklist\">shift in the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/01/newspapers-to-lose-50m-in-online-ads-as-firms-use-coronavirus-blacklist\">ad</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/01/newspapers-to-lose-50m-in-online-ads-as-firms-use-coronavirus-blacklist\"> market</a>.</p> <p>Employment lawyers said companies cannot unilaterally impose pay cuts or furlough staff without consultation. It is understood that Standard staff were not aware of the changes before the announcement.</p> <p>The paper also said it was halting publication of its weekly magazine ES. Osborne <a href=\"https://twitter.com/george_osborne/status/1245306308657545216?s=21\">said</a> the publisher had taken these \u201chard decisions so we can keep our people in jobs and go on bringing the paper to you during this crisis\u201d.</p> <p>The newspaper said it had implemented \u201cimmediate measures\u201d but did not directly comment on how it had consulted staff.</p> <p>It is unclear what proportion of staff have been furloughed or had their pay cut. The salary reduction is thought to apply to all working employees earning more than about \u00a340,000.</p> <p>Matt Gingell, a freelance employment lawyer, said: \u201cGenerally, employers cannot impose pay cuts on the workforce and have to get their consent. If an employer imposes a salary cut without the employee\u2019s agreement, the employee may continue working but make it clear that they are working under protest.</p> <p>\u201cAlternatively, the employee might resign on the basis that the employer has fundamentally breached their contract of employment. Depending on the circumstances, various claims could be considered.\u201d</p> <p>Philip Landau, an employment lawyer at Landau Law, said: \u201cIn some cases there may be a general variation of contract clause [in an employee\u2019s contract] and a company could say \u2018we can vary your contract at any time as you\u2019ve given your consent\u2019. The question is: can employers rely on this in court? Employers should exercise caution as it could still be considered unreasonable conduct by the courts.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the UK\u2019s best-known companies have begun agreeing pay cuts with their top managers as financial pressures arising from the coronavirus pandemic begin to hit boardrooms.</p> <p>Taylor Wimpey said on Wednesday that annual bonuses for bosses would be scrapped this year and the board had agreed to take a 30% pay cut for the duration of the lockdown, after the company closed all of its construction sites.</p> <p>The firm has cancelled a 2% annual salary increase for executive directors that was scheduled to come into force on 1 April.</p> <p>The English wine, beer and cider producer Chapel Down said its board, executive and senior managers had taken 20-40% salary cuts after the firm was hit by the closure of pubs and bars as well as its own brewery, shops, restaurant and bar.</p> <p>On Tuesday the Sports Direct owner Frasers Group said its senior management team had taken \u201cvoluntary pay reductions\u201d to a maximum salary of \u00a340,000.</p> <p>Both Frasers Group and Taylor Wimpey said the pay reductions had been agreed with those affected. Chapel Down did not return phone calls.</p>",
  "<p>You have to admire Sir Richard Branson\u2019s tactics. A begging letter from an island-dwelling billionaire doesn\u2019t gain sympathy. A co-ordinated lobbying campaign that involves Airbus, Heathrow airport and Rolls-Royce \u2013 all big employers in the UK \u2013 gets noticed at the Treasury.</p> <p>And, naturally, one can see why the trio want Virgin Atlantic to survive, whether by a government-backed bailout or other means. The airline is an important customer for each of them. Virgin Atlantic flies 31 planes fitted with Rolls-Royce engines and has another 21 on order. Airbus makes wings for its A330 aircraft in north Wales.</p> <p>Yet the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, cannot simply roll over. His stance on airline bailouts was clear and correct a fortnight ago. He had already helped the industry hugely via the \u201cfurlough\u201d scheme, which will pay 80% of staff wages during shutdown. Individual requests for support would only be entertained \u201cas a last resort\u201d and would \u201conly be considered if all commercial avenues have been fully explored, including raising capital from existing investors\u201d.</p> <p>So what fresh capital have Virgin Atlantic\u2019s owners contributed? Branson\u2019s Virgin Group owns 51% of the airline and the rest belongs to Delta Air Lines, a major US carrier and a company still worth $15bn (\u00a312.1bn). The duo should, in theory, be able to raise serious sums, even in the current climate.</p> <p>Details, though, are as clear as mud. Branson is reported to have injected $250m into his Virgin Group, but it\u2019s unclear how much is destined for the airline, and in what form. The Treasury needs to establish the facts before it even thinks of advancing a penny to a loss-making airline, let alone the reported \u00a3500m-worth of loan and credit guarantees.</p> <p>The case for state assistance looks weak. It\u2019s up to Branson and Delta to prove otherwise. That means digging deep themselves, as opposed to getting other people to write letters.</p> <h2>Nation won\u2019t weep over banks\u2019 dividend ban \u2013 despite dangers</h2> <p>Dear chief executive, would you prefer to cancel your bank\u2019s dividend or resign? Put like that (well, almost), banking bosses followed instructions from the Bank of England. Dividends are banned, in effect, for the rest of the year.</p> <p>The investment banking divisions of these institutions, some of which will be making a ton of money from the volatility in financial markets, may find they\u2019re also told to drain bonus pools next January and February. Let\u2019s see if they would actually obey, but the nation probably wouldn\u2019t weep if executives and traders go bonus-less next year.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street, albeit via its comical \u201cvolunteer or else\u201d letters, has done the right thing. First, the dividend curbs will keep about \u00a37.5bn within the banking system, capital that can be used to support more lending if the hoped-for V-shaped recovery doesn\u2019t materialise.</p> <p>Second, if the economic emergency becomes truly awful, some banks may yet need to raise capital from shareholders via rights issues. That prospect is still distant but can\u2019t be ignored. It would be silly to dispatch cash to investors now if there\u2019s even an outside chance that a capital top-up is needed within a year.</p> <p>Third, laying down the law to banks helps elsewhere. It is easier for the Treasury to resist every individual corporate demand for a bailout if regulated banks are seen to be pushed beyond their comfort zone.</p> <p>There are possible long-term dangers, it should be said. Regulators are not just stopping dividends, they\u2019re interfering in other ways \u2013 such as forcing banks to take on more lending risk, even with government-backed coronavirus loan schemes. The risk is the creation of a paralysed banking system unable to fund a recovery at the other side of the crisis.</p> <p>That, though, is tomorrow\u2019s problem \u2013 and one, we hope, that never arrives. In the meantime, the game is about preserving lending capacity. That\u2019s tough on shareholders, especially the retail brigade who were only there in search of previously safe-looking income. Sadly for them, there\u2019s nothing that can be done: in a crisis, banks get requisitioned.</p> <h2>Next\u2019s sensible plan a sign of retail property fragility</h2> <p>Clothing retailer Next looks better equipped than most in its sector to withstand a long period of shop closures. If it\u2019s looking for sale-and-leaseback deals on properties to reinforce an already strong(ish) balance sheet, it\u2019s bracing for extreme stresses. The approach is sensible \u2013 but it also sends a very bearish signal for retail property market.</p>",
  "<p>Cat owners may wish to be more cautious about contact with their pets, as a study from China has revealed Covid-19 can be transmitted between cats.</p> <p>The team, at Harbin Veterinary Research Institute in China, found that cats are highly susceptible to Covid-19 and appear to be able to transmit the virus through respiratory droplets to other cats. Dogs, chickens, pigs and ducks were found to be unlikely to catch the infection, however.</p> <p>The findings followed <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/cat-infected-covid-19-from-owner.html\">recent reports of a pet cat in Belgium</a> being infected with Covid-19. About a week after the cat\u2019s owner started showing symptoms, the cat also developed breathing difficulties, diarrhoea and vomiting, and subsequent tests by vets at the University of Li\u00e8ge showed the animal was infected with coronavirus.</p> <p>The lab experiments from the Chinese team involved a small number of animals that were given a high dose of the virus and there is no direct evidence that cats would also be able to infect people. However, the team behind the work said their findings provided important insights into the animal reservoirs of Covid-19 and how animal management might have a role in the control of the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cSurveillance for Sars-CoV-2 in cats should be considered as an adjunct to elimination of of Covid-19 in humans,\u201d the paper concluded.</p> <p>The work, which is not yet peer-reviewed, was uploaded to the preprint website <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.015347v1.full.pdf\">bioRxiv</a> on Wednesday. In the study, five cats were inoculated with coronavirus. Three of the animals were placed in cages next to cats that had not been given the virus, and one of the exposed cats also became infected, suggesting that transmission occurred through respiratory droplets. The findings were then replicated in a second group of cats. Ferrets, which are already being used in vaccine trials for Covid-19, were also found to be susceptible.</p> <p>Experts said the findings were credible, but that they did not indicate cats were an important vector in spreading the disease between humans.</p> <p>Prof Eric F\u00e8vre, chair of veterinary infectious diseases at the University of Liverpool, said: \u201cPeople should take usual precautions of hand washing when handling their pets, and avoid overly intimate contact, especially if sick with Covid. It is important to add that this says nothing about how the virus coming out of a cat may or may not be infectious to humans.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham, said similar observations of transmission in cats had been made in relation to Sars, which is genetically closely related to Covid-19. \u201cHowever, it should be remembered that cats are not playing much, if any, role in the spread of this virus,\u201d he said. \u201cHuman to human transmission is clearly the main driver, so there is no need to panic about cats as an important source of virus. Obviously, if you think you have Covid-19 and share a house with a cat, then it would be sensible to limit close interactions with your furry friend until you are better.\u201d</p>",

Despite government guidance calling on landlords to \u201cshow compassion\u201d for their tenants, campaigners say the current policy is likely to lead to a major eviction and rent arrears crisis once the lockdown ends.</p> \n  <p>In a letter to the department for communities, homes and local government, the London Renters Union, which represents thousands of renters in London, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Urging landlords to \u2018show compassion\u2019 does nothing in reality to protect renters. The government has left renters to fend for themselves. As the government\u2019s recent <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/876500/Consolidated_Landlord_and_Tenant_Guidance_COVID_and_the_PRS_v4.2.pdf\">guidance</a> clearly states, tenants are still legally obliged to pay rent and landlords are still able to issue eviction notices to renters who enter into rent debt. The eviction process will begin as soon as the temporary ban on evictions is lifted.</p> \n   <p>Renters should be freed from having to make any rent payments during the coronavirus pandemic and should be protected from having to pay back massive arrears once social distancing measures are reversed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The call was echoed by Acorn, a community-based union that organises among renters in 15 other cities. Kat Wright, Acorn\u2019s national organiser, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Despite the spin, the government is not protecting renters.

  "<p>Early reports out of China showed that elderly people and the chronically ill were <a href=\"http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51\">most vulnerable</a> to Covid-19. Yet an alarming number of young people in the United States have been hospitalized with severe infections. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm\">nearly 40% </a> of American Covid-19 patients who were hospitalized were under 55 \u2013 and 20% were between ages 20 and 44. And in rare cases, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/boy-13-die-london-after-testing-positive-for-coronavirus\">even children</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-illinois-governor-announces-rare-death-of-baby\">have died</a> after falling ill with Covid-19. Three experts interpret the data.</p> <h2><strong>Are more young people falling </strong><strong>severely ill with Covid-19 than expected?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Dr</strong><strong> Timothy Brewer: </strong>The data have actually been pretty consistent across lots of different countries. Initially, people were very focused on mortality rates, and death rates in young adults are low pretty much everywhere you look. And I think people interpreted that to mean that young adults were not getting infected, and were not getting severely ill. As more data came out about hospitalizations and infection rates, we learned that was not the case.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20028423v3\">recent study</a> out of Shenzhen, China, showed that young people are just as likely to get infected as older individuals. Now that we\u2019re seeing more data on hospitalization rates, we\u2019re seeing that yes, young adults are experiencing severe illnesses. The big difference between them and older adults is [young adults\u2019] mortality rates tend to be lower.</p> <p><strong>Dr</strong><strong> Edith Bracho-Sanchez:</strong> Adults and people with underlying medical conditions are, without a doubt, the most severely impacted by this. But the American public, as a whole, has wide-ranging levels of underlying baseline health. Close to two out of every 10 kids in this country are obese; nearly four out of every 10 young adults are. And that\u2019s just one baseline measure of health in the American public.</p> <p>Unfortunately in America, not all our population is in top-shape health.</p> <p><strong>Dr</strong><strong> Christopher J</strong><strong> L</strong><strong> Murray: </strong>We have grave concerns with overinterpreting the reported case rates because it\u2019s very much a function of who gets tested. In some places, like here in the US, [mostly] old people were being tested. So we\u2019ve largely been looking at the death data. What we do know is that the population death rate [in people] below age 50 is dramatically lower than 80 and older.</p> <p>There\u2019s a lot of lag in data. So we\u2019ve got a pretty good handle on confirmed cases and deaths, but age breakdowns and hospitalization data are really patchy at this point.</p> <h2><strong>How exactly do specific health issues \u2013 such as vaping or obesity \u2013 modulate someone\u2019s susceptibility to a serious infection?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Murray: </strong>We just don\u2019t know. We need to see more specific data to understand that.</p> <h2><strong>Are lower death rates among young people a function of shortages and physicians allocating scarce resources to the young?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Brewer:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200325-sitrep-65-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=2b74edd8_2\">There is a big variation in mortality rates overall across countries</a>. In the US mortality rates are about 1.5%. In Italy, they\u2019re around 9%. In South Korea, they\u2019re under 1%, and in Germany, they\u2019re under 0.5%. Some of that has to do with whether your healthcare systems are overwhelmed, and some of it will be the age distribution of the population. Italy has an older population, for example, than the United States or South Korea.</p> <h2><strong>Have you seen serious Covid-19 illnesses in pediatrics?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Bracho-Sanchez: </strong>Yes, I\u2019ve sent a few children to the hospital. It\u2019s been consistent with what the national and international data is showing; the kids that I have sent to the hospital have had underlying medical conditions that make them immunocompromised. While it is true that the majority will have a mild illness, there are some kids and young adults who will have a very severe illness, and that cannot be emphasized enough.</p> <h2><strong>Does that change the way public health professionals try to communicate with the public?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Bracho-Sanchez: </strong>Just like any other age group, there can be a wide range of manifestations of this virus.</p> <h2><strong>What do we understand about the recovery and potential long-term effects of a severe infection?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Brewer: </strong>It takes people a lot longer to recover from this than we thought. We\u2019ll have to see long term, but one of the things we learned from tuberculosis \u2013 which is a totally different pathogen \u2013 is that even if you cure the tuberculosis, a lot of people are left with long-term lung damage. And that\u2019s very much a concern with Covid-19, and it\u2019s something we\u2019ll learn about going forward.</p> <p>Experts:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Dr</strong><strong> Edith Bracho-Sanchez, </strong>assistant professor of pediatrics and director of pediatric telemedicine at Columbia University-New York Presbyterian Morgan Stanley children\u2019s hospital</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>Dr</strong><strong> Timothy Brewer,</strong> professor of epidemiology at the UCLA Fielding school of public health and of medicine, and a member of the division of infectious diseases, at the David Geffen school of medicine at UCLA</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>Dr</strong><strong> Christopher J</strong><strong> L</strong><strong> Murray,</strong> institute director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (<a href=\"http://www.healthdata.org/\">IHME</a>), professor and chair of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington</p></li> </ul>",

We don\u2019t get to do any political rallies at this moment anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Warren also praised Kate McKinnon\u2019s impersonation of her on Saturday Night Live (\u201cShe\u2019s such an incredibly talented comedian\u201d), recalled how she once was mistaken for McKinnon in a grocery store, and confirmed a rumor that she fought between dress rehearsal and the live show to keep several lines in her scene. \u201cI can tell you, having worked there and having been a writer on the show,\u201d said Meyers, \u201cthe writers who wrote those lines, the fact that you fought for them \u2013 they will be fans of yours forever.\u201d</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnMHmNqhGxo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YnMHmNqhGxo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel recapped Trump\u2019s frequent touching of the communal White House microphone at his press briefings. \u201cWe just witnessed a battle between ignorance and germaphobia,\u201d he said of one clip, \u201cand germaphobia got knocked out cold.\u201d</p> <p>Tuesday was the first day of work for Trump\u2019s new chief of staff, Mark Meadows, a former North Carolina congressman who\u2019s \u201cone of Trump\u2019s most enthusiastic suck-ups\u201d, said Kimmel. \u201cIn fact, the only reason he agreed to take the job of chief of staff is because he found out first lady was taken already.</p> <p>\u201cCan you think of any worse first day of work than in the Trump administration in the middle of a pandemic?\u201d Kimmel wondered. \u201cI would rather be the assistant manager at Popeye\u2019s the day those chicken sandwiches came out.\u201d</p> <p>And finally, ABC announced that it has cancelled the Bachelor Summer Games. \u201cThis suddenly just got real for me,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cI guess they had no choice, but the truth is, corona is only the third most dangerous virus lurking in the Bachelor hot tub.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>The Polish government intends to hold a presidential election in May, despite a growing chorus of voices saying that doing so amid a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">pandemic</a> would be unfair, undemocratic and potentially dangerous.</p> <p>Based on current polling, current president Andrzej Duda, an ally of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, would be likely to gain more than 50% of the vote and thus win a second term in office without requiring a second round of voting.</p> <p>Incumbent politicians around the globe are receiving a boost in the polls during the uncertainty of coronavirus, as people seek stability during the crisis. Critics say the Polish government wants to capitalise on this rather than have a riskier election later on, when the public health and economic fallout from coronavirus could offer a very different backdrop.</p> <p>Poland currently has 2,420 confirmed cases of coronavirus and has seen 36 deaths. The country implemented some of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/coronavirus-several-eu-states-ban-mass-events-after-italian-lockdown\">earliest lockdown measures in Europe</a>, closing its airports and land borders more than two weeks ago, and the government hopes these strict measures could help avoid the exponential growth phase of the epidemic seen in western Europe.</p> <p>However, even as the lockdown measures have become progressively stricter in recent weeks, authorities have insisted that elections on 10 May go ahead. The rightwing PiS narrowly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/14/poland-populist-law-and-justice-party-increases-majority\">won a general election last autumn</a>, but lost control of the upper house of parliament. Controlling the presidency is key for the party to avoid political deadlock.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/lack-of-testing-raises-fears-of-coronavirus-surge-in-eastern-europe\">Lack of testing raises fears of coronavirus surge in eastern Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even as the government has introduced more restrictions on citizens\u2019 movement, forbidding them to leave the house except for essential business, it has refrained from officially declaring a state of emergency or a state of natural disaster, both of which require elections to be postponed.</p> <p>Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, the powerful PiS chairman, has said in interviews that the vote must go ahead. In a late-night amendment to a parliamentary bill over the weekend, the government introduced a rule that senior citizens or those in quarantine could submit postal votes. Another amendment could soon be under consideration that would allow the entire public to vote by post.</p> <p>On Saturday, more than 40 NGOs called on the prime minister to introduce a state of natural disaster and postpone the vote. If the vote went ahead, \u201cthe election result would very likely not reflect the real preferences of voters, and the president\u2019s legitimacy to hold office in such conditions would be extremely weak\u201d, said the appeal. More than 500 doctors and medical professors have also signed an appeal calling on the vote to be postponed on the grounds that it would cause a health risk for those taking part.</p> <p>On Sunday, the candidate from the centre-right Civic Platform party, Ma\u0142gorzata Kidawa-B\u0142o\u0144ska, said that if the vote went ahead, the government would be responsible for any citizens who fell ill, and said she was suspending her campaign. Other candidates have not followed suit, but with public appearances or rallies impossible due to coronavirus, and political campaigning and point-scoring irresponsible during an epidemic, it is hard to see how any vote could be fair.</p> <p>Duda himself has hinted that the election could yet be moved: \u201cIf it did happen that the epidemic was raging \u2026 then in that situation, the election date could turn out to be unsustainable, but I am counting on it that we will be able to calmly hold these elections,\u201d he told state-run television over the weekend.</p> <p>As coronavirus wreaks havoc with the fabric of everyday life across the globe, a number of governments are wrestling with dilemmas of whether or not to go ahead with elections. On 15 March, both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/french-urged-to-vote-in-local-elections-amid-coronavirus-lockdown\">France</a> and Germany\u2019s Bavaria held local elections amid much criticism, with many believing the vote contributed to the spread of the virus. The second round of French elections, scheduled for 22 March, was cancelled.</p> <p>A number of upcoming votes have been postponed due to coronavirus, including a presidential election in Bolivia scheduled for May and an Ethiopian general election in August. However, South Korea will push ahead with a general election planned for 15 April, promising that all 14,000 polling stations will be disinfected and equipped with hand sanitiser, and that patients with coronavirus can vote from hospital.</p>",
  "<p>At the end of The Long Goodbye, Raymond Chandler\u2019s detective Philip Marlowe bids farewell to his readers and to the characters in the novel. \u201cI never saw any of them again \u2013 except the cops,\u201d muses Marlowe. \u201cNo way has yet been invented to say goodbye to them.\u201d Chandler was expressing a wider truth. In the words of the British criminologist <a href=\"https://www.oxfordlawtrove.com/view/10.1093/he/9780199283392.001.0001/he-9780199283392\">Robert Reiner</a>: \u201cWelcome or unwelcome, protectors, pigs or pariahs, the police are an inevitable fact of modern life.\u201d</p> <p>Especially, we are again learning, in a national emergency. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/uk-police-reissued-with-guidance-on-enforcing-coronavirus-lockdown\">Coronavirus Act 2020 </a>has given a ratchet to three of the most persistently controversial themes in British policing history: police powers, police discretion and police coordination. All three are back in the spotlight in the Covid-19 lockdown. But this week\u2019s arguments, prompted in part by the former supreme court judge <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/30/police-criticised-stepping-mark-lockdown-sanctions-12479549/\">Jonathan Sumption\u2019s</a> warnings about the growth of a police state, are only the start. The real test for the policing of the pandemic is yet to come.</p> <p>Ever since the creation of London\u2019s Metropolitan police in 1829, issues like these have been recurrent in the often volatile evolution of relations between politics, the police and the people. When the state took wide new powers last month they again became a source of argument. Police chiefs have not always appeared in control of events at a time when government is itself struggling to coordinate public discipline over travel, exercise and shopping.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/uk-police-use-drones-and-roadblocks-to-enforce-lockdown\">Coronavirus Act</a> is in some ways a recognisable descendent of the draconian emergency legislation that Britain adopted at the start of the world wars of the 20th century. But in some ways it is different. By and large, the wartime emergency legislation granted wide new powers to central government, which was then free to make regulations to apply them. But the 2020 act also gives many powers to the devolved authorities and confers other powers directly on public health, immigration and police officers at local level. As a result, a degree of potential inconsistency between nations, localities and even individual services was baked into the legislation at the start. Devolvers will approve. Centralisers will not. Much remains in need of sensible clarification.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Today\u2019s events are reminding a new generation of police that relations with the public are always contingent</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/uk-police-reissued-with-guidance-on-enforcing-coronavirus-lockdown\">different approaches</a> so far are often arbitrary. Derbyshire police have used drones to highlight people walking in the Peak District and dye to deter swimmers from a quarry pool near Buxton. This attracted the wrath of Lord Sumption, who called the policing disgraceful. But other forces are also doing things that, in other circumstances, would be highly controversial too. North Yorkshire are using soldiers to conduct roadblocks. Cumbria issued a unilateral decree that the Lake District was \u201cclosed\u201d. Devon and Cornwall police asked the public to report \u201cillegal gatherings\u201d. The Metropolitan police are challenging users of the London Underground to justify their journeys. Some of these acts can reasonably be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/30/uk-police-guidelines-coronavirus-lockdown-enforcement-powers-following-criticism-lord-sumption\">justified</a>, but others are plainly excessive.</p> <p>Some of these interventions echo wartime restrictions. At some stage in the current outbreak there may well be a protest picket somewhere against, perhaps, a supermarket over food prices or a bank for not lending to small businesses or the self employed. The picket may comply with all the physical distancing guidance and be dignified and orderly. But it would probably elicit the same response as a protest reported by the civil rights campaigner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/feb/23/council-for-civil-liberties-letter-kidd\">Ronald Kidd</a> in his wartime book, British Liberty in Danger. In June 1940, police tried to ban a meeting in south London against high food prices because, the police said, \u201cit was undesirable that \u2018ill-feeling should be stirred up at a time of crisis\u2019\u201d. That meeting eventually took place. A protest today might run up against the same response and be banned.</p> <p>Today\u2019s events are reminding a new generation of police chiefs and officers that relations with the public are always contingent. For generations, police in this country have set great store by the notion that they police \u201cby consent\u201d rather than by imposition. They like to think it distinguishes them from an un-British \u201cgendarmerie\u201d, against whom the Chartists protested in the early days of the Met. But \u201cpolicing by consent\u201d is often used, by both police and their critics, in unrealistic and idealised ways. Margaret Thatcher, for example, once said the police need \u201csupport and not criticism\u201d. Approaches like that bear no relation to complex social realities, not least in emergencies.</p> <p>Policing is a public good, but it is simultaneously a confrontational activity. It is a mistake to dismiss all policing as authoritarian. But nor is it the case that policing is just another public service. Consent, whether to policing or anything else, is always conditional. Consent has to be won and given, negotiated and sustained. Consent routinely involves invoking and accepting some degree of power. What is consent for some may be imposition for others. That goes with the territory. </p> <p>Consent may be problematic, but it is nevertheless crucial. Today\u2019s police chiefs properly invoke policing by consent. Greater Manchester\u2019s chief constable Ian Hopkins, in his public statement this week said, rightly, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/31/derbyshire-police-chief-defends-forces-reaction-to-lockdown\">mistakes had been made</a> in policing the lockdown and that some officers would get things wrong. The Met\u2019s assistant commissioner Neil Basu did the same thing when he wrote that policing by consent remained the mantra even in \u201ca period of readjustment to our new responsibilities\u201d.</p> <p>No one should be surprised that the appropriateness of various forms of policing has come to a head again in a time of pandemic. The state, after all, has just claimed unusual powers to direct our lives for the common and individual good. Those powers need to be debated \u2013 which parliament did not do \u2013 before they receive consent. The entire episode embodies what the philosopher Benedict de Spinoza wrote in 1670. \u201cIt is not, I contend, the purpose of the state to turn rational beings into beasts or automata, but rather to allow their minds and bodies to develop in their own ways in security and enjoy the free use of reason \u2026. Therefore, the true purpose of the state is in fact freedom.\u201d</p> <p>These early days of the policing of the pandemic are nevertheless relatively straightforward. Public consent is currently high. Most of us probably think that it is irresponsible to test the law to the limits by, say, heading off in the car to climb Snowdon.</p> <p>The much more difficult and demanding test will come in a few weeks, when someone in authority says that we have probably reached a stage where some of the restrictions can be lessened and aspects of the old normality resumed. That will be the point when Spinoza\u2019s \u201cfree use of reason\u201d will pose a far larger threat to the state\u2019s coronavirus policy. That will be the moment when the policing of what is normal and abnormal, responsible and irresponsible, good freedom and bad freedom will become more complex, chaotic and confrontational. It could be a long hot summer. We all need to start thinking about it now.</p> <p>\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<h2>HOT SHIITAKE</h2> <p>There was consternation among Premier League clubs on Wednesday after they were accused by a major public figure of completely running out of wild mushrooms. Furious MP Julian Knight, chief suit of the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, lambasted the nation\u2019s top 20 teams for operating in a \u201cmorel vacuum\u201d, perhaps believing that the industry had not been giving enough attention to edible fungi since the departure of Fifa\u2019s mushroom-loving if sadly fictional former head honcho, Cep Blatter. \u201cIt sticks in the throat,\u201d Knight said of the top flight\u2019s trompette-neglecting ways. \u201cThis exposes the crazy economics in English football and the morel vacuum at its centre.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/01/bournemouth-manager-eddie-howe-takes-significant-voluntary-pay-cut-coronavirus\">Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe takes 'significant voluntary' pay cut</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Knight\u2019s hackles had been raised by news that as the coronavirus crisis bites some clubs were continuing to pay their players in full while simultaneously making swingeing cuts to other areas of their budget, furloughing staff on normal-person wages and showing complete disregard for chanterelles. News of \u201csignificant, voluntary pay cuts\u201d reportedly accepted by Eddie Howe and other members of the leadership team at Bournemouth, whose approach might have been influenced by their proximity to the foraging hotbed that is the New Forest, has done little to assuage critics.</p> <p>One of the issues Premier League clubs have traditionally faced is a lack of either the funds or the inclination to even consider the plight of wild mushrooms, when they could spend \u00a3270,000 a week on Mesut \u00d6zil instead. However lucrative your global TV rights deal, when Max Meyer is taking home \u00a3130,000 a week there\u2019s not a lot left for forest-friendly fungus.</p> <p>\u201cFundamentally mushrooms are a bit of a luxury in our business,\u201d said one high-placed source The Fiver made up. \u201cObviously it\u2019s nice to have some, and there are times in life when they\u2019re almost indispensable, but our business is about success on the pitch and anything that doesn\u2019t help achieve it is irrelevant as far as I\u2019m concerned. We all stopped thinking about mushrooms back when Chelsea started paying Winston Bogarde \u00a340,000 a week and nothing\u2019s changed since.\u201d</p> <p>***UPDATE: Due to an administrative error at Fiver Towers, Julian Knight\u2019s comments were misreported. He in fact accused the Premier League of operating in a \u201cmoral vacuum\u201d.

Why not determine the remaining matches of the season, at all levels, through a series of coin tosses? Companies with broadcasting and advertising rights could retain their privileges in the staging of events and the betting companies would be back in business. There would, of course, be some loss of gate revenue and income from the sale of cheese and other dairy products \u2013 but these losses could be offset by intercalating another entire season, based solely on coin tosses, between the end of this one and August.

  "<p>The day Sonja Farak\u2019s world unraveled \u2013 the day a crack pipe and sliced evidence bags of cocaine were found at her workstation \u2013 started like many others: she attended court. A drug chemist in a lab at Amherst, Massachusetts, one of the state\u2019s two main drug testing facilities, Farak was responsible for testing evidence obtained by police. Her certified assessment of the content and amount secured thousands of drug convictions for the state, and she routinely appeared in court to affirm them; without a chemist\u2019s signature proving an illegal substance, the charges of possession could not stand. Usually, this process was unremarkable, occurring off-stage, but Farak\u2019s arrest on 19 January 2013 for drug theft and evidence tampering raised an alarming possibility: if she was high while at work, her tests could be thrown out, and the convictions overturned. Farak had worked at the lab for nearly a decade, contributing to thousands of prison sentences. How long had this been going on?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-series\">Murder, madness and tigers: behind the year's wildest Netflix series</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The arrest of the then 35-year-old Farak, depicted in the opening scenes of Netflix\u2019s documentary series How to Fix a Drug Scandal, shocked a Massachusetts criminal justice system already reeling from <em>another</em> drug chemist scandal. Just six months earlier, in August 2012, Annie Dookhan, a chemist at the Hinton Labs in Boston, was caught forging tens of thousands of tests in order to win over her superiors and prosecutors as a star employee; her arrest immediately threw thousands of convictions into legal limbo. Dookhan and Farak didn\u2019t know each other, and worked at opposite ends of the state, but their collective actions exposed a badly neglected system designed to streamline the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, in which the actions of one unreliable actor resounded powerfully. \u201cIt\u2019s the sheer ripple effect,\u201d Erin Lee Carr, who directed all four episodes of the series, said to the Guardian. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about 10 cases, we\u2019re not talking about a thousand cases. We\u2019re talking upwards of 20,000 cases that were impacted by two chemists.\u201d</p> <p>It was an unprecedented nightmare for Massachusetts, one How to Fix a Drug Scandal dissects in suspenseful yet compassionate fashion over the course of four hours, with first-person interviews from criminal defense lawyers who fought to secure release for clients convicted with faulty evidence, state prosecutors, journalists and members of Farak\u2019s family. (Farak, now out of prison, spoke with Carr off-the-record, but declined an on-the-record interview due to an ongoing civil case.) The series also delves into a second, more insidious layer of scandal: the state attorney general office\u2019s efforts to downplay Farak\u2019s liability to past convictions. Whereas Dookhan\u2019s arrest jammed court dockets with thousands of appeals and overturned numerous faulty convictions, there was near silence after Farak\u2019s arrest, as the state attorney general\u2019s office buried evidence of Farak\u2019s longstanding drug addiction, blocked legal attempts to view evidence, lied to district attorneys and misled two circuit court judges \u2013 a five-year attempt to keep defendants from questioning their convictions that one judge called<strong> </strong>\u201ca fraud upon the court\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4Hk1lOGWIA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/X4Hk1lOGWIA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Carr first heard of the Dookhan scandal incidentally, during interviews for her film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/09/i-love-you-now-die-documentary\">I Love You, Now Die: The Commonwealth </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/09/i-love-you-now-die-documentary\">vs</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/09/i-love-you-now-die-documentary\"> Michelle Carter</a>, about another sensational Massachusetts trial, in 2016. Shortly afterward, she met journalist Paul Solotaroff, who was writing a <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/and-justice-for-none-inside-biggest-law-enforcement-scandal-in-massachusetts-history-253708/\">feature</a> on the attorney general office\u2019s misconduct and introduced her to the Farak case. Carr was familiar with the plea deal system in the US, which coerces drug defendants into plea-bargained sentences, lest they risk trial, and thus a harsher sentence. But she didn\u2019t understand how integral crime labs were to drug convictions, or the role of criminal defendants.</p> <p>Enter Luke Ryan, an amiable and dogged defense attorney from western Massachusetts who serves as How to Fix a Drug Scandal\u2019s guide through the thicket of appeals after Farak\u2019s arrest. Ryan pestered for years to get access to the attorney general\u2019s files, which confirmed his suspicion \u2013 one an actor retells in a recreation of Farak\u2019s grand jury testimony in the series \u2013 that Farak was using long before the incident leading to her arrest.</p> <p>\u201cI think a lot of people, when they encounter these cases, they\u2019re like, \u2018Well, you know, the people had drugs, and they\u2019re guilty,\u2019\u201d Carr said. \u201cAnd I say back to you: imagine spending a couple years in prison based on faulty evidence, and see if you feel the same way.\u201d It\u2019s not just the sentences hinging on accurate drug evidence tests; it\u2019s the challenges of life post-incarceration, in which life-building steps such as getting a job or finding adequate housing are jeopardized by a drug conviction. \u201cIt does not stop the day you get out of prison,\u201d said Carr.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae6527d0cba94500774600ddf050a167eaa3f1f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae6527d0cba94500774600ddf050a167eaa3f1f1/0_0_3840_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"1A still from How to Fix a Drug Scandal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from How to Fix a Drug Scandal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix @ 2020</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To that end, How to Fix a Drug Scandal features two of Ryan\u2019s clients, including Rafael Rodriguez, who struggled with drug addiction and was convicted based on a sample certified by Farak. Ryan tried for years to secure Rodriguez\u2019s freedom, which resulted in years of legal limbo and merry-go-round of prison stays which exacted a heavy toll. Rafael\u2019s children and wife recall a goofy, kind-hearted man, one evidenced in old cellphone footage, hamming for the camera. But the conviction, which a judge kept based on the attorney general office\u2019s withheld evidence, prevented him from moving forward.</p> <p>While the series delves into the impact of mishandled evidence and, more pressingly, the state\u2019s unrepentant \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, Carr also provides space for the motivations of Dookhan, a first-generation striver validated for her \u201cproductivity\u201d and helpfulness, and especially Farak. Farak\u2019s sister and mother explain her longstanding battle with depression and feelings of invisibility, which in part fueled her drug use. Offering context for their thought processes was \u201ca product of my sobriety\u201d, said Carr, who has been public with her own struggles with addiction. \u201cIn my program, you are not equal to your worst actions. It\u2019s how I was raised.\u201d Carr\u2019s father, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/13/david-carr-tributes-paid-to-unique-new-york-times-media-columnist\">David Carr</a>, was a storied cultural critic at the New York Times whose memoir The Night of The Gun details his own addiction to cocaine and alcohol. \u201cI\u2019ve always encountered true crime and criminal justice reporting from a place of radical empathy,\u201d said Carr, though she added: \u201cI want to be clear: addiction explains everything and excuses nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Still, How to Fix a Drug Scandal outlines a much larger picture: how one addict\u2019s actions crystallizes the arbitrariness of criminalizing addiction, how two chemists are not isolated bad apples, but symptoms of a rotten system which, of course, disproportionately and expeditiously convicts people of color. \u201cThese types of things only flourish when people assist in them,\u201d Carr said. Boston\u2019s Hinton Labs, now shut down, incentivized productivity and supportive relationships with prosecutors. \u201cShe was going through three, four, five times the number of cases that other chemists were \u2013 that was not normal, and it was OKed because there was such an incredible backlog in cases that they needed to get through it,\u201d said Carr. In Farak\u2019s case, the Amherst lab was so underfunded, understaffed and overburdened that her drug use went unnoticed for a whole decade.</p> <p>\u201cI think the system needed to be brought to task,\u201d said Carr. The Hinton Lab is now closed, Amherst lab shuttered, but the vulnerabilities of little-seen yet consequential drug labs aren\u2019t specific to Massachusetts. \u201cThis is a product of the war on drugs done on the cheap,\u201d said Carr. \u201cAnd we will continue to see cases like this if we don\u2019t really take a good, hard look at drug labs and what they\u2019re doing.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>How to Fix a Drug Scandal is now available on Netflix</p></li> </ul>",

It\u2019s something we\u2019re taking seriously because, yes, people expect the BBC to do the right thing \u2013 and quite rightly, given the way we\u2019re funded.\u201d</p> \n<p>Wenger is clearly pleased with the swiftness of the corporation\u2019s wider response to the pandemic, from the extended news coverage to an array of educational, health and cultural programming, not to mention the decision to bring back old favourites such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/spooks\">Spooks</a> to iPlayer. \u201cWe need to shape the output \u2013 whether you\u2019re school age, seeking escape, looking for drama at 9pm, or want a comedy that really makes you laugh and reflects the soul of the nation, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/17/this-country-series-three-review-bbc-mockumentary-charlie-and-daisy-may-cooper-cotswolds-comedy\">This Country</a>.\u201d</p> \n<p>That said, it\u2019s clear the past few days have brought a sea change. When we first talked, pre-lockdown, Wenger stressed the importance of \u201cdrama for me\u201d, as he called it. \u201cNot me personally, but rather for particular demographics instead of a broad mainstream.\u201d This is theme close to the 47-year-old\u2019s heart. Since leaving Channel 4 as head of drama in 2016, he has worked hard to overhaul how the BBC commissions drama, shifting from the general to the specific, to fulfil \u201cbespoke\u201d viewer needs.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>People take great comfort from watching together with the rest of the nation</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cIf you look at work we\u2019ve got coming up this year and compare it with what might have been commissioned for BBC One five or 10 years ago, you would see how we are making drama for a very diverse range,\u201d he said pre-virus. \u201cWe would never underestimate the power of communal viewing, but we have to be flexible in the terms of the way we platform our drama. I feel that our current slate is serving the whole population rather than just super-serving the heartlands.\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking now, he admits to a different focus. \u201cIt\u2019s very interesting to see the extent to which audiences are coming together to enjoy shows that have a really strong universal appeal. Whether it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/26/the-repair-shop-we-can-fix-anything-but-a-broken-heart-and-brexit\">The Repair Shop</a> or Ant and Dec\u2019s Saturday Night Takeaway, I think people are taking great comfort from watching together, and knowing they are watching along with the rest of the nation \u2013 whereas up to now, the general trend was to seek out stories that were more bespoke. Audiences will continue to want those very particular pieces, but this period will also be a reminder of the sense of community that television can bring to the nation.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc64d69af754b77fa5ab59e9d7685cc015911788\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc64d69af754b77fa5ab59e9d7685cc015911788/0_263_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the fixers of The Repair Shop.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sense of community \u2026 the fixers of The Repair Shop.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Peskett/BBC/Ricochet Ltd</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>So he\u2019s particularly pleased about two upcoming adaptations: David Nicholls\u2019 take on his bestselling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/01/us-david-nicholls-review-fiction\">marriage-in-crisis novel </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/01/us-david-nicholls-review-fiction\">Us</a>, starring Tom Hollander, Saskia Reeves and Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l; and Normal People, which tackles Sally Rooney\u2019s much-admired young-and-in-love second novel. \u201cUs might not be a super-tanker of a show, but it has a lot of heart and a lot to say about family. While Normal People is both a thrilling ride and incredibly emotionally honest. I think audiences will enjoy losing themselves in the lives of its protagonists.\u201d</p> \n<p>Not that he\u2019s back-pedalling his support of the year\u2019s most innovative dramas, including the sleek period crime thriller The Serpent; Michaela Coel\u2019s provocative contemporary drama January 22nd; and Small Axe, Steve McQueen\u2019s anthology series about black British history. Interestingly, all will air on BBC One.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ff30817255e1ea42ce686be0c3705d552a25b77\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ff30817255e1ea42ce686be0c3705d552a25b77/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jenna Coleman and Tahar Rahim in The Serpent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleek \u2026 Jenna Coleman and Tahar Rahim in The Serpent.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roland Neveu/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWhy should a voice like Michaela\u2019s be confined to the margins?\u201d Wenger says. \u201cStories like this and Small Axe haven\u2019t been given the big platform they deserve. We\u2019re looking to give the mainstream audience as much stimulation as we can. It makes sense to embrace the most diverse range of storytellers that we can. Having Michaela and Steve on BBC One in the same year is massive for the BBC.\u201d</p> \n<p>Is he concerned that the lockdown might lead to delays? \u201cWe\u2019re in the very early stages,\u201d he says. \u201cWith Small Axe, Steve has finished shooting and has been editing each episode. We are currently on course, although much will depend on how long the lockdown lasts. Steve has been incredibly pragmatic but there are also obviously things he\u2019s going to be incredibly rigorous about. So it\u2019s hard to say for sure, although the signs are positive.\u201d</p> \n<p>He is, however, prepared for a backlash when the shows do air. The recent adaptation of Malorie Blackman\u2019s best-selling young adult novel Noughts + Crosses, about a world where black people rule over white people, was called a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-8076381/The-BBCs-Noughts-Crosses-recipe-division-Calvin-Robinson-argues.html\">recipe for division</a>\u201d in the Daily Mail. Meanwhile, the casting of Vinette Robinson, who is black, as Mary Cratchit in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/22/a-christmas-carol-review-twee-free-torment-fest-is-a-tonic-for-our-times\">A Christmas Carol</a> led to predictable complaints.</p> \n<p>\u201cOh, the whole woke thing,\u201d says Wenger laughing. \u201cFor us not to choose Vinette Robinson, who was the best actress put up for that part, is like saying there weren\u2019t any black people in London in the 19th century, which is just historically inaccurate among other things.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e3554e3c-0b5d-49a7-ba95-1b1ab3f69e3a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VnfQZLhdeDU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He pauses. \u201cSome people like work to be adapted in a quite conservative way. But, you know, we do that as well. The adaptations of A Suitable Boy [due later this year] and Normal People are extremely faithful to the text because they haven\u2019t been adapted before. There were complaints about A Christmas Carol and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/17/the-war-of-the-worlds-review-doom-dystopia-and-a-dash-of-downton\">War of the Worlds</a> but those stories had been adapted so many times. If we adapted them in their most faithful form, people might ask, \u2018Well, why bother?\u2019 It\u2019s not so much about being deliberately woke as about having a range of approaches.\u201d</p> \n<p>While the pandemic has put talk of cuts and threats to the licence fee on hold, are there still concerns? \u201cOf course. None of us can ignore the discourse around the BBC. For me, conversations about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/05/bbc-facing-funding-cut-as-licence-fee-consultation-launched\">decriminalisation</a> of licence fee non-payment and a subscription model for the BBC just point back in the direction of the importance of being a universal service.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe serve the heartland, but you have to think about young audiences and diverse audiences and audiences across the whole nation to justify the licence fee. Quite often when I\u2019m thinking about what to commission, I think who are the hardest people to convince? Which are the toughest nuts to crack? How can I give them a show that will be irresistible to them?\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4637ea899ab1899bf2e9efb0b298e9ce9e528389\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4637ea899ab1899bf2e9efb0b298e9ce9e528389/0_286_5120_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On course \u2026 Steve McQueen is making Small Axe, a period drama about black British history.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On course \u2026 Steve McQueen is making Small Axe, a period drama about black British history.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/McQueen Limited</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Small Axe, a little-told history that speaks to an audience Wenger feels has been ignored, is crucial in this regard. The first episode of McQueen\u2019s anthology series focuses on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/nov/29/mangrove-nine-40th-anniversary\">Mangrove Nine</a>, a group of black activists who were tried in 1970 for inciting a riot; they had been protesting against police targeting the Mangrove Restaurant in Notting Hill, London, a gathering place for intellectuals and activists. \u201cIt gave me the same visceral thrill as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/mar/06/hunger-reel-history-bobby-sands-hunger-strike\">Hunger</a>. It\u2019s a defining piece of work from Steve McQueen, told with such purpose and drive and anger that you are stopped in your tracks.\u201d</p> \n<p>He hopes it will address the ongoing exodus of black British actors to America. \u201cThe more work like Small Axe, the more work like January 22nd, the more work like Noughts + Crosses, the more we send a positive message that they don\u2019t have to go. Clearly this has been an awfully long time coming. We\u2019ve got to sustain that supply line of work for a bond of trust to build up, so we hang on to that talent.\u201d</p> \n<p>This does not mean ignoring the BBC\u2019s other shows, though. There will still be room for Line of Duty to get viewers across the country wound up, as well as such quietly beautiful family dramas as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/23/the-a-word-review-bbc1-drama-autism\">The A Word</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/23/last-tango-in-halifax-review-a-brilliant-bittersweet-sunday-comfort\">Last Tango in Halifax</a>, not to mention state of the nation shockers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/18/years-and-years-2019-terrifying-tv-show-russell-t-davies\">Years and Years</a>, and epics such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/08/world-on-fire-thrilling-tv-that-shows-the-true-terrifying-cost-of-war\">World on Fire</a>.</p> \n<p>What about a show about a global pandemic? There\u2019s ahuge laugh. \u201cWell, never say never \u2013 though I have to say, a pandemic drama is not what I\u2019d want to watch when I turn on the TV this evening by any means. But if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/russelltdavies\">Russell T Davies</a> phoned me tomorrow and had a completely brilliant genre-busting idea for one, I\u2019d find him very hard to turn down.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>\ufeffA woman who wants to have surrogate children through commercial agreements in California has won her claim that the NHS should pay for the treatment.</p> <p>The woman, identified only as XX, cannot bear her own children following earlier medical mistreatment.</p> <p>Whittington hospital NHS trust in north London has admitted negligently failing to detect signs of cervical cancer for more than four years. That oversight led to the woman developing highly invasive malignancy, which required chemo-radiotherapy treatment and left her infertile at the age of 29.</p> <p>She was awarded \u00a3580,000 in damages but further payments to cover the costs of surrogacies in California were refused because such commercial arrangements are illegal in the UK.</p> <p>XX, now in her mid-30s, has said one of her \u201ccentral ambitions in life\u201d is to have a family and that, despite the \u201cprofound, distressing and life-altering injuries\u201d caused by her treatment, her loss of fertility is her \u201cmajor concern\u201d.</p> <p>Her lawyers argued during the hearing that she should be granted the costs of surrogacy in California, where the practice is legal and binding, saying that \u201cin 2019, the civil courts should no longer have any role in censuring a woman\u2019s reproductive choice\u201d.</p> <p>In Wednesday\u2019s judgment, delivered via video-link, a majority of three to two the supreme court found in favour of XX.</p> <p>Lady Hale, the former president of the supreme court who gave the majority decision, said: \u201cThe courts have bent over backwards to recognise the relationships created by surrogacy, including foreign commercial surrogacy. The government now supports surrogacy as a valid way of creating family relationships, although there are no plans to allow commercial surrogacy agencies to operate here.</p> <p>\u201cIt is no longer contrary to public policy to award damages for the costs of a foreign commercial surrogacy. However, that does not mean that such damages, still less damages such as are claimed in this case, will always be awarded. There are some important limiting factors.</p> <p>\u201c \u2026 The proposed programme of treatments must be reasonable. There may be good reasons to think that, but for the negligence, the claimant would have had the number of children now proposed, but there may not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSecond, it must be reasonable for the claimant to seek the foreign commercial arrangements proposed rather than to make arrangements within the UK. This is unlikely to be reasonable unless the foreign country has a well-established system in which the interests of all involved, the surrogate, the commissioning parents and any resulting child, are properly safeguarded.\u201d</p> <p>But delivering the dissenting judgment, Lord Carnwath said: \u201cThe fact that the laws of other jurisdictions and other systems may reflect different policy choices seems to me beside the point. It would in my view be contrary to [the] principle [of consistency between civil and criminal law] for the civil courts to award damages on the basis of conduct which, if undertaken in this country, would offend its criminal law.\u201d</p> <p>Cara Nuttall, a solicitor in children and fertility law at JMW Solicitors, said: \u201cSome people prefer to go abroad to undertake commercial surrogacy because it is generally quicker, as it removes the lengthy wait for an altruistic surrogate that many face when undertaking a domestic arrangement.</p> <p>\u201cMuch of the current law that governs surrogacy in the UK dates to the mid 1980s....

Unusually for a virus that has made the jump from one species to another, it appears to transmit effectively in humans. The virus also appears to have a higher mortality rate than common illnesses such as seasonal flu. The combination of coronavirus\u2019s ability to spread and cause serious illness has prompted many countries, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/from-mere-advice-to-full-lockdown-the-week-when-it-all-changed-fast\">including the UK</a>, to introduce or plan extensive public health measures aimed at containing and limiting the impact of the epidemic.</p> \n<h2><strong>How can I stop myself and others from getting infected?</strong></h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/02/how-to-protect-yourself-coronavirus\">Wash your hands with soap and water</a> for at least 20 seconds and do this often, including when you get home or into work. Use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/hand-sanitiser-or-hand-washing-which-more-effective-against-coronavirus-covid-19\">hand sanitiser gel</a> if soap and water are not available. Avoid touching your face. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or the crook of your elbow (not your hand) and put used tissues straight in the bin. Avoid close contact with people who are showing possible symptoms. Follow NHS guidance on <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-advice/\">self-isolation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/advice-for-travellers/\">travel</a>. Many countries, including the UK, have imposed lockdown conditions in order to try and limit the spread.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"04fcb605-dc6b-400f-9a32-dea28497dcee\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sMtzWVTPmLI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>How can you tell the difference between flu and Covid-19?</strong></h2> \n<p>The coronavirus outbreak hit amid flu season in the northern hemisphere and even doctors can struggle to distinguish between the two \u2013 the overlap in symptoms probably contributed to slow detection of community infections in some countries, including Italy.</p> \n<p>Typical flu symptoms, which normally come on quickly, include a high fever, sore throat, muscle aches, headaches, shivers, runny or stuffy nose, fatigue and, more occasionally, vomiting and diarrhoea. Doctors are still working to understand the full scope of symptoms and severity for Covid-19, but early studies of patients taken to hospital found nearly all of them developed a fever and dry cough, and many had fatigue and muscle aches. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/29/to-hell-and-back-my-three-weeks-suffering-from-coronavirus\">Pneumonia (lung infection) is common in coronavirus patients</a>, even outside the most severe cases, and this can lead to breathing difficulties. A runny nose and sore throat are far less common, reported by just 5% of patients. The only real confirmation of having Covid-19 is taking a test though.</p> \n<h2>What should I do if I have symptoms?</h2> \n<p>In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should <strong>stay at home for at least 7 days</strong>. If you live with other people, <strong>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</strong>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.</p> \n<p>You should look on the dedicated <a href=\"https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19\">coronavirus NHS 111 website</a> for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.</p> \n<p>Many countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try and halt the spread of the virus. <strong>You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance.</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>If I get coronavirus, how sick will I get?</strong></h2> \n<p>A large study in China found that about 80% of confirmed cases had fairly mild symptoms (defined as no significant infection in the lungs). About 15% had severe symptoms that caused significant shortness of breath, low blood oxygen or other lung problems, and fewer than 5% of cases were critical, featuring respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ problems. However, it is possible that a larger number of very mild cases are going under the radar, and so this breakdown in severity could change over time as wider screening takes place. Older people and those with respiratory problems, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/why-are-some-people-at-greater-risk-from-coronavirus\">heart disease or diabetes</a> are at greater risk.</p> \n<h2><strong>What is the mortality rate of the new coronavirus?</strong></h2> \n<p>It is probably about or a bit less than 1%. Much higher figures have been flying about, but the UK\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, is one of those who believes it will prove to be 1% or lower. The World Health Organization\u2019s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, talked of 3.4%, but his figure was calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the number of officially confirmed cases. We know there are many more mild cases that do not get to hospital and are not being counted, which would bring the mortality rate significantly down.</p> \n<p>Deaths are highest in the elderly, with very low rates among younger people, although medical staff who treat patients and get exposed to a lot of virus are thought to be more at risk. But even among the over-80s, 90% will recover.</p> \n<h2><strong>Can you get infected on public transport?</strong></h2> \n<p>Most infections happen in families, where people live at close quarters. You need to be within one to two metres of somebody to be infected by viral-loaded water droplets from their coughs or when they are speaking. That is less likely on public transport. However, it would be possible to pick up the virus on your hands from a surface that somebody with the infection had touched. The virus can linger for 48 hours or even possibly 72 hours on a hard surface, such as the hand rail in the tube \u2013 though less time on a soft surface. That is why the advice is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face, to prevent the virus getting into your nose, mouth or eyes.</p> \n<h2><strong>Is there a cure for Covid-19?</strong></h2> \n<p>Not at the moment, but drugs that are known to work against some viruses are being trialled in China, where there are thousands of patients, and new trials are starting in the US and other countries. Large numbers are needed to find out whether they work in a few people or a lot of people or nobody at all. The most hopeful are Kaletra, which is a combination of two anti-HIV drugs, and remdesivir, which was tried but failed in Ebola patients in west Africa in 2013 and 2016. Some Chinese doctors are also trying chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, which is off-patent, therefore cheap and highly available, and would be very useful in low-income countries. The first results are expected in mid-March and should indicate if the drugs will at least help those who are most severely ill. A miracle cure is not expected.</p> \n<h2><strong>When will we get a vaccine?</strong></h2> \n<p>Efforts to develop an effective vaccine for Covid-19 have been quick compared with historical epidemics, such as Ebola. A number of teams are already testing vaccine candidates in animals and preparing to carry out small trials in people. The US company, Moderna Therapeutics, is already recruiting and hopes to enrol 45 volunteers between 18 and 55 and launch the trial imminently. Phase one trials like this look at whether the vaccine triggers an immune response and whether the given dose causes adverse effects and could be completed quite quickly. However, the subsequent phases, which will involve thousands of volunteers and will look more closely at efficacy, will take longer and obtaining a commercially available vaccine within a year would be extremely quick. The government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said he did not think a working vaccine to protect people from the coronavirus would be produced in time for the current outbreak, but that a timeframe of a year or 18 months <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51764225\">\u201cwas not unreasonable to assume\u201d</a>.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects as best as possible the current situation at the date of publication.

  "<p>HS2 is beginning an operation to remove soils from ancient woodlands at a catastrophic time of year for wildlife, according to the Woodland Trust.</p> \n<p>Undertaking the controversial \u201ctranslocation\u201d operation \u2013 which also involves felling numerous trees \u2013 in six woods in April and not during winter as the high-speed railway originally said it would, was a \u201cbetrayal of trust\u201d said the charity\u2019s ecologist.</p> \n<p>The relocation of soils from the Warwickshire woodlands, including Broadwells Wood and Crackley Wood, is supposed to quicken the establishment of new woods nearby. But HS2 Ltd <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hs2-phase-one-ancient-woodland-strategy\">agreed in official plans</a> published as part of the hybrid parliamentary bill authorising the high-speed line that it would conduct soil translocation in winter, when plants and trees are dormant, to minimise damage.</p> \n<p>\u201cEverything is growing in April. It\u2019s completely the wrong time to be doing this and HS2 know it\u2019s the wrong time to be doing this,\u201d said Luci Ryan of the <a href=\"https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/protecting-trees-and-woods/campaign-with-us/hs2-rail-link/\">Woodland Trust</a>.</p> \n<p>There is one study of the efficacy of soil translocation in establishing new woods in Britain and Ryan said there was as yet no evidence it would be successful in the long term. She also said the contractor undertaking the translocation in Warwickshire had never performed such work before.</p> \n<p>She added: \u201cWe\u2019ve engaged with the hybrid bill process all the way through. HS2 has promised at various stages that they will do X or Y and we\u2019ve taken it in good faith. When it comes to doing the works, they\u2019ve said they are actually doing A or B. It\u2019s heartbreaking and it\u2019s a betrayal of trust.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a government-backed project. It should be done to the highest possible standards. If a government project is doing things wrong, what does that say to other developers?\u201d</p> \n<p>Five campaigners have spent the past week living up trees in Crackley Wood in an attempt to halt the destruction, with HS2 \u201cenabling\u201d works to continue despite the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n<p>Joe Rukin, a spokesperson for <a href=\"http://stophs2.org/tag/crackley-woods\">Stop HS2</a>, claimed the destruction of bird-nest habitat was happening \u201con an industrial scale\u201d in ancient woodlands \u201cin a desperate attempt to claw back some time\u201d after delays to the \u00a3106bn railway.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cHS2 don\u2019t seem to have noticed that the whole country is on standstill. Covid-19 has handed HS2 the opportunity to do the right thing [and delay the works] but instead HS2 have done exactly the wrong thing.

The union said: \u201cEmployees are kept in this precarious financial situation because it benefits management to not give us regular or consistent schedules. I was already barely making rent, and now 20% of my income is gone. Why should they be able to create conditions that make it hard for their employees to survive, and not be held responsible at a time of crisis?\u201d</p> <p>In a statement, Odeon said: \u201cNone of our colleagues have been dismissed but in these unprecedented times, we believe that the best course of action is to place some of our cinema-based colleagues into furlough. This will ensure that they can benefit from the government-backed scheme at a time when all of our cinemas across the UK are temporarily closed, with no incoming revenue.\u201d</p> <p>An employee of the Empire Cinemas, which operates 14 venues, told the Guardian that they had also been furloughed with 80% pay, with the company considering whether to top up the remaining 20% \u2013 but they had no confirmation of whether they would receive any money.</p> <p>In a statement, Empire Cinemas said: \u201cFollowing the chancellor\u2019s welcome introduction of the coronavirus job retention scheme, Empire Cinemas have now moved to place the majority of its cinema employees within the remit of the scheme.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The government encouraged small businesses to set up and operate.

However, as the vast majority of film crew are freelance or self-employed, the UK government\u2019s initial set of measures did not offer any help. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-uk-offers-self-employed-80-of-earnings\">A follow-up scheme</a>, which offered to pay 80% of income to those earning \u00a350,000 and under, is designed to plug the gap.</p> <p>Many in the sector, however, fear they are still falling through the cracks. Art director and production designer Blair Barnette says that tax regulations encouraged large numbers of industry personnel to set up as limited companies and operate as contractors, taking minimal PAYE salary and using the dividend as income \u2013 which, under the rules of the new scheme, means that Barnette will only receive a tiny grant. \u201cWe operate and earn inside the guidelines and the law. And the same government encouraged small businesses to set up and operate. Now when we need something back, we are told we don\u2019t qualify. There are a lot of us drowning right now.\u201d</p> <p>The accounting systems employed by major Hollywood studios has reportedly only muddied the waters. A location manager, who also operates as a limited company and asked to remain anonymous, told the Guardian: \u201cI\u2019ve worked for one massive company for the last five years, but as each production sets up a new company to trade under, it looks like I\u2019ve kept changing employment even though the umbrella company is the same. I can\u2019t get access to any help at all, not even the mortgage holidays. There\u2019s no reward for loyalty in film and TV!\u201d</p> <p>Bectu also points out that the stop-start nature of freelance work mean many workers were not under contract on 1 March, the government\u2019s cut-off point to receive help. <a href=\"https://bectu.org.uk/news/paye-freelancers-fear-they-wont-qualify-for-government-support/\">A recent survey by the union</a> suggests that almost 50% of film industry freelancers won\u2019t qualify. Bectu head Philippa Childs said in a statement: \u201cThe Treasury should make it clear that these workers can and should be rehired and furloughed by their last engager \u2026 It also needs to make the funds available for companies that are furloughing before the end of April as well as insisting employers furlough people rather than allowing them the choice.\u201d</p> <p>However, Bectu have praised Disney for its decision to furlough employees until May, which it announced on Tuesday after telling crew on 20 March their contracts would be terminated.

  "<p>It is 40 years since Howard Brenton\u2019s play The Romans in Britain, directed by Michael Bogdanov, opened at London\u2019s National Theatre. Set in ancient Rome, it deals with themes of imperialism and abuse of power, and became infamous for a brief episode in its first act when actors Peter Sproule and Greg Hicks portrayed an act of male rape.</p> <p>The play made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/oct/28/theatre\">legal and political history</a> when morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse tried to prosecute Bogdanov using the Sexual Offences Act 1956, alleging that he had procured an act of gross indecency between two men by directing the two actors. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/feb/12/landmarks-in-law-how-the-profumo-affair-became-modern-britains-most-disgraceful-legal-event\">Landmarks in law: the disgraceful legal history of the Profumo affair</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The controversy reflected the cultural wars of the time. Thirteen years before the play had opened, the Sexual Offences Act 1967 decriminalised homosexual acts in private between two men. Yet as Geoffrey Robertson QC, who was a junior barrister for the defence, says, \u201cthe attitude of the law was that it was not to be encouraged or legitimised\u201d.</p> <p>Theatre censorship became less common after the Theatres Act abolished the lord chamberlain\u2019s historic role of censor in 1968, but homophobic attitudes were still the norm. In 1976, Whitehouse, described by Robertson as the self-appointed \u201cconscience of the nation\u201d, sent her solicitor Graham Ross-Cornes to see The Romans in Britain, and then sought to bring her case.</p> <p>The director of public prosecutions, Thomas Hetherington, advised the attorney general, Michael Havers, that the play did not contravene the Theatres Act. So Whitehouse tried another route and sought to prosecute Bogdanov under the Sexual Offences Act 1956. The legislation was designed to prevent men soliciting in public lavatories which is why, according to Robertson, the prosecution treated the National Theatre as \u201ca large public toilet\u201d.</p> <p>Defence barrister Jeremy Hutchinson compiled a list of actors who were willing to give evidence for Bogdanov, while the prosecution only planned to call Ross-Cornes.</p> <p>His evidence in the trial at the Old Bailey, Robertson says, prompted \u201cone of the most amazing piece of cross-examination ever heard\u201d. Giving his evidence, Ross-Cornes had not said where in the theatre he had been sitting.</p> <p>Barristers are reluctant ever to ask a question in court to which they do not know the answer, and Hutchinson had to be persuaded to ask Ross-Cornes to mark on a map of the theatre where he had watched the production from.</p> <p>The plan came back showing he had been sitting in the back row of the upper circle, 90 yards from the action. This exchange followed:</p> <blockquote> <p>Hutchinson: You know that theatre is the art of illusion?</p> <p>Ross-Cornes: If you say so, Lord Hutchinson.</p> <p>Hutchinson: And as part of that illusion actors use physical gestures to convey impressions to an audience?</p> <p>Ross-Cornes: Yes, I would accept that.</p> <p>Hutchinson: And from the back row, 90 yards from the stage, you can be certain that what you saw was the tip of the actor\u2019s penis?</p> <p>Ross-Cornes: Well, if you put it that way, I can\u2019t be absolutely certain. But what else could it have been?</p> </blockquote> <p>At this point Hutchinson balled up his fist, placed his hand by his groin and his gown over his hand, stuck out his thumb and made a thrusting action. He then asked: \u201cAre you sure you did not see the tip of the actor\u2019s thumb?\u201d Ross-Cornes\u2019s subsequent admission that he \u201cmight have been mistaken\u201d halted the trial.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/dec/19/landmarks-in-law-the-office-christmas-party-that-ended-in-court\">Landmarks in law: the office Christmas party that ended in court</a> </p> </aside>  <p> As Robertson says, the case put an end to Whitehouse\u2019s \u201ccourtroom crusades\u201d. Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, meanwhile, says the case\u2019s impact went beyond the play itself: \u201cThe failure of the prosecution was a huge victory, not just for LGBT+ people and the theatre world, but also against censorship and for liberal Britain. It struck a blow for gay visibility, against the homophobes and puritans.\u201d</p> <p>But Lord Michael Cashman, the actor who played Colin Russell on Eastenders and portrayed the first ever gay kiss in a UK soap opera, says: \u201cThe case was a very clear indicator that homosexuality would not even be tolerated, let alone expressed on a theatre stage.\u201d</p> <p>He is unsure that the case accelerated the campaign for equality but says it was a \u201cvivid reminder that our rights were non-existent\u201d.</p> <p> He says the support that the defence received from senior figures across the creative industries was \u201cheartening and encouraging\u201d, but adds: \u201cIt must be remembered that they were defending not particularly homosexual issues but the right to artistic independence, as well as challenging the notion of censorship via the imposition of another\u2019s perspective on morality.\u201d</p>",

Germany, Austria and Luxembourg have opened their hospitals to treat patients from the hardest-hit countries.

The pandemic has reopened the wounds of the eurozone crisis, resurrecting stereotypes about \u201cprofligate\u201d southern Europeans and \u201chard-hearted\u201d northerners. \u201cEach crisis has reduced trust between member states and within the whole system and this is a real problem,\u201d said Heather Grabbe, a former adviser to the EU enlargement commissioner.</p> <p>The Dutch finance minister, Wopke Hoekstra, <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/dutch-finance-minister-acknowledges-lack-of-empathy-on-corona-bonds/\">voiced contrition </a>this week after infuriating his neighbours by asking why other governments didn\u2019t have fiscal buffers to deal with the financial shock of the coronavirus.

France, Italy, Spain and at least half a dozen others want to break with convention by issuing joint eurozone debt, so-called \u201ccorona bonds\u201d. Germany, Austria and the Netherlands continue to shun the idea. At a summit last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/eu-leaders-clash-over-economic-response-to-coronavirus-crisis\">European leaders failed to reach a decision</a>, passing the problem to finance ministers, who have been instructed to find a way out of the impasse by next week.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the all-consuming coronavirus crisis threatens to divert EU attention from the erosion of democratic standards in Hungary.

He introduces new measures and waits for the fuss to die down.\u201d</p> <p>Luuk van Middelaar, a professor of EU law who worked for the European council president during the eurozone crisis, believes the EU can improvise a way out of current divisions. \u201cThe EU is internally ill-equipped to deal with any crisis or unforeseen circumstances, and yet each time under the pressure of events it improvises solutions.\u201d</p> <p>During the eurozone crisis it took \u201ctwo years of drama and near-death experiences\u201d to fashion the solution of European banking union, \u201cas it always takes time for interests and minds to converge ... This time we don\u2019t have that much time so that is worrying.\u201d</p> <p>Tocci, director of Italy\u2019s Institute for International Affairs, thinks the EU can rescue the situation by moving the coronabonds debate on to more \u201ccool-headed, technical\u201d terrain. \u201cWho is actually going to emit these bonds \u2026 What are these bonds going to be for? And if one actually manages to give specific technical answers to these questions then it could be an opportunity to break the ice on a debate that has become so polarised.\u201d</p> <p>Letta envisages a \u201ccorona deal\u201d that avoids the divisive question of mutualised debt by having bonds issued by the European Investment Bank, the EU\u2019s lending arm. But Germany and the Netherlands also need to move, according to the Italian former prime minister. \u201cThe key point to the Germans and the Dutch: please don\u2019t block, don\u2019t stop European measures that we can take together.\u201d</p> <p>Any deal carries the seeds of a future argument. Every time the EU has strengthened its hand in response to a crisis, whether centralised refugee policy or oversight of national budgets, there has been resistance and resentment, according to Middelaar. \u201cThe Germans have still not fully digested the role of the European Central Bank as the lender of last resort,\u201d he said while mandatory refugee quotas deepened the cleavage between western and central European countries. \u201cIt\u2019s just worth remembering that Italy does not have a monopoly on Eurosceptic politicians. In Germany and the Netherlands there are also Eurosceptics waiting to exploit this issue.\u201d</p> <p>European leaders\u2019 response will ultimately shape public opinion. When Italians felt they had been left alone by Europe in the early phase of the pandemic, confidence in the European project shrank. A <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_whatever_it_takes_italy_and_covid_19_crisis\">poll conducted on 12-13 March</a> found that 88% of Italians felt Europe was failing to support Italy, while 67% saw EU membership as a disadvantage - a remarkable result for a founding member state, where the EU once basked in high levels of support.</p> <p>If European division prevails, the memory will stick of the time when China and Russia rushed to Italy\u2019s aid, thinks Tocci. Italian confidence in the EU \u201cdepends more on what Europe does than what the Chinese and Russia do\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think that the jury is still out as to whether Europe is going to do what it takes to come out stronger from this.\u201d</p>",

Chris Smalls, an assistant manager and organizer, had led a walkout demanding Amazon temporarily shut the facility for cleaning after multiple workers tested positive for Covid-19.</p> <p>It was a move that spoke to the inherent inhumanity of the trillion-dollar corporation, one that will need to be brought to heel by a future presidential administration. The workers were seeking hazard pay and more protective gear as they labored during the pandemic. This, along with Smalls\u2019 willingness to challenge the company, was apparently too much to take.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/instacart-workers-risk-their-health-to-do-their-job\">Why is Instacart making its contract workers risk their health to do their job? | Sarah Polito</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amazon claimed Smalls was dismissed because he had close contact with a worker diagnosed with Covid-19 but refused to stay home for 14 days. According to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/30/amazon-workers-strike-coronavirus\">company\u2019s previous statements</a>, the infected co-worker in question last reported for work on 11 March. Had Smalls been exposed that day, a 14-day mandatory quarantine would have made him eligible to return as soon as 25 March. Smalls, however, claimed Amazon did not send him home until 28 March, three weeks after the exposure.</p> <p>Smalls is rightfully considering legal action and the New York state attorney general\u2019s office is calling on the National Labor Relations Board to investigate. It\u2019s likely Smalls was dismissed because he was a worker who dared to raise the consciousnesses of those around him. For a corporation as virulently anti-union as Amazon, workers like Smalls are particularly dangerous: they are the future leaders of a labor movement.</p> <p>Amazon, perhaps the most successful corporation on Earth, can more than afford to turn a profit and treat their warehouse workers with dignity. Jeff Bezos will remain a billionaire if he chooses to pay every worker a middle-class salary with healthcare benefits and a pension. But doing so would require a slight reduction of his world-historical wealth and be a violation of the iron law of greed: more is always better.</p> <p>There is no greater illustration of the moral decay of 21st-century corporate America than Amazon. Past behemoths trafficked in noblesse oblige, tolerating unions and even investing in their workforce. Automobile plants and steel mills accepted that the price of doing business was guaranteeing their workers more than a subsistence wage.</p> <p>Amazon, which employs a well-compensated white-collar workforce and a vast range of warehouse workers who labor in punishing conditions to get products shipped all across the world, is not interested in the social contract. Rather than collaborate with their New York warehouse workers to safeguard their health amid the worst pandemic in a century \u2013 more American lives have been lost than on 9/11 and hundreds of thousands more could die \u2013 Amazon would rather leave an employee without a job at the worst possible moment.</p> <p>The firing sends a clear message: come against us and you will be crushed. It\u2019s raw authoritarian logic, instilling fear to smother all dissent. If Amazon merely eviscerated brick-and-mortar stores across America, triggering massive job losses, it would be an unfortunate company. But kneecapping the competition was never enough for Bezos. He needs to pit the nation\u2019s cities against each other in a race to the bottom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/14/amazons-retreat-from-new-york-represents-a-turning-point\">for extraordinary tax breaks</a>, depriving them of revenue they could use to fund schools and public infrastructure.

An America without guaranteed sick leave and universal healthcare is particularly ill-equipped to protect its inhabitants during a pandemic. Into this void steps Amazon, a corporation that cares even less about the fates of those who serve it.

  "<p>On Wednesday night the players of Diriang\u00e9n, the oldest club in Nicaragua, will put on their face masks before they line up for kick-off and hope for the best. They are third in the country\u2019s Liga Primera and a home match against fourth-placed Walter Ferretti offers a chance to put the heat on those ahead while widening the six-point gap between the sides.</p> <p>It is tight at the top but Diriang\u00e9n have little appetite to compete and will do so from obligation alone.

We want to suspend the tournament but all the clubs have voted and the majority want to continue.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/31/uefa-fears-football-season-unlikely-to-resume-before-end-of-june\">Football authorities fear season is unlikely to resume before start of June</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although circumstances are being reviewed weekly in a country that has publicly confirmed five cases of Covid-19, Diriang\u00e9n were the only club to oppose the league\u2019s continuation at its 10 clubs\u2019 latest meeting on Tuesday. The line from most of their rivals, including Wednesday\u2019s opponents, is that they will play until the ministry of health says it is unsafe to do so. It is virtually impossible to find anyone elsewhere in the division who will go on record to deviate from that view.</p> <p>Unpicking the situation requires a journey into the complex and murky world of Nicaraguan football. A condensed explanation is that almost all roads lead to the country\u2019s president, Daniel Ortega, a strongman for whom football represents a potent arm of internal power and a vision of stability to the outside world. </p> <p>Diriang\u00e9n are understood to be the only top-flight club with little or no funding from an arm of the state, although four would describe themselves as privately owned. It makes them outliers in a deeply repressive environment in which most of those competing are entirely dependent on direction from above.</p> <p>Ortega\u2019s regime <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/16/nicaragua-protest-ortega-government-one-year\" title=\"\">wobbled in April 2018</a> when a protest movement took to the streets; it was neutralised bloodily but a series of general strikes followed and the country\u2019s economy has nosedived.

Coronavirus became a big threat because they are scared of a general strike and shutting everything down would pretty much allow that.\u201d</p> <p>So football carries on. The Guardian interviewed two players from other teams and neither expressed doubts about persisting. \u201cThere is no concern on my part,\u201d says the Walter Ferretti forward Dshon Forbes. \u201cMy job is to play and while the institution in charge of health does not suspend these activities everything continues as normal.\u201d</p> <p>Pablo G\u00e1llego, a Spanish winger playing for Managua, adopted a near-identical tone and described himself as \u201csuper-happy\u201d with the club\u2019s care. \u201cIf I felt my physical integrity was at risk I\u2019m sure I could talk to them but we feel safe and feel appropriate measures are being taken,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Walter Ferretti are owned by the Nicaraguan police force, and Managua\u2019s players are paid by the capital city\u2019s mayoral office. That is not to reject the footballers\u2019 opinions out of hand but the incentives to opt against dissent are significant in a country believed to have 73 political prisoners.</p> <p>\u201cPlayers are very, very scared,\u201d explains Vel\u00e1squez, who says a number have messaged him privately to say they feel helpless and forced to play. \u201cWhen their income is football and the state is paying their salary, you can understand why they\u2019ll remain quiet.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61717af2b30e5b55631ee91709583522adb95db1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61717af2b30e5b55631ee91709583522adb95db1/0_237_5341_3204/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A fan with a face mask watches Managua take on Diriang\u00e9n.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fan with a face mask watches Managua take on Diriang\u00e9n.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Inti Oc\u00f3n/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There have been a few flickers of support for Diriang\u00e9n\u2019s stance. Real Madriz, who are seventh in the league, appeared to have stuck their head above the parapet when they announced on social media they would not fulfil their match at Real Estel\u00ed on 22 March. But that message was mysteriously taken down; Madriz turned up and lost the game, traditionally a home banker, 4-0.</p> <p>Public opinion, already low after a perceived lack of support from the nation\u2019s players during the uprising of 2018, appears firmly in favour of a pause. But, while club Twitter accounts remind their fans \u201cQu\u00e9date a casa\u201d (\u201cStay at home\u201d), their teams continue to compete, albeit behind closed doors since the most recent round of games. \u201cIt is uncomfortable for the players but they prefer to use masks,\u201d Salazar says. It is an arresting, uneasy image and one that brings the situation\u2019s absurdity home.</p> <p>One of Diriang\u00e9n\u2019s stars, the Costa Rican forward Sebasti\u00e1n Barquero, has been allowed to return home and players have been told there will be no recriminations if they decide to down tools.</p> <p>In the meantime everyone else awaits evidence that Ortega\u2019s version of normality bears some resemblance to the reality inside the country\u2019s hospitals and on the streets. \u201cThe first thing we have to take care of is the health of our people,\u201d Salazar says. \u201cWe continue to think we should not play.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The Labour peer and former MP Ted Graham, Lord Graham of Edmonton, who has died aged 94, was one of the foremost figures in the British co-operative movement in the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. He owed his own advancement to the movement, which he had joined as an errand boy at Newcastle upon Tyne Co-operative, delivering groceries on a Co-op bike after leaving school at 14. Raised in prewar poverty in the Scotswood Road area of the city, he had passed the 11-plus but his family could not afford for him to attend grammar school.</p> <p>His lifetime journey to become the Labour party\u2019s chief whip in the House of Lords (1990-97) and to many of the major offices of the co-operative movement was one he never forgot. He was a kindly, popular man without a trace of self-importance. \u201cMy name is Ted Graham,\u201d he would say at public meetings, \u201cbut you can call me Lord.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/14/letter-lord-graham-of-edmonton-obituary\">Letter: Lord Graham of Edmonton obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When elected to the House of Commons in February 1974 as the Labour and Co-operative MP for the north London constituency of Edmonton, Graham devoted his maiden speech to education and the need for more public spending on schools and teacher training in order to reduce the disadvantages that still existed for many families in his constituency. He disclosed then that he himself got up in the early hours of every Sunday morning to study for a degree with the recently established Open University. He became the first MP to qualify for an OU degree two years later and in 2005 told the Lords that he was still the only parliamentarian to have graduated from \u201cthe university of the second chance\u201d.</p> <p>Born in Newcastle, the eldest of five children of an unemployed railway porter and his wife, Graham received elementary education at Westgate Road school. An episode seared in his childhood memory was when he was one of six boys called out of class to be given a pair of boots; an act of charity that made his mother cry at the humiliation of him being identified as among the poorest children in the school. After two years as a delivery boy, he became an office boy in 1941 and then joined up with the Royal Marines. In 1944, training for D-day on the English south coast, he was seriously injured when he was accidentally caught in a hail of machine gun fire. His life was saved by an American military surgeon in a US army field hospital.</p> <p>When demobilised in 1946 he returned to the co-op movement in the north-east. He started going to night school, doing correspondence courses with the Workers\u2019 Educational Association and attended the Co-operative College at Stanford Hall, Loughborough. In 1952 he became the organiser of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jan/26/peter-shea-obituary\">British Federation of Young Co-</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jan/26/peter-shea-obituary\">operators</a> and the following year he moved south to a post with the Enfield Highway Co-operative Society. In 1962 he was appointed the southern secretary of the Co-operative Union. He was national secretary of the Co-operative party from 1967 until his election to parliament.</p> <p>Graham had first entered party politics in 1961 when he joined Enfield borough council, becoming leader. He understood the importance of local government, which he said later had taught him in a modest way \u201cboth the art of government and the constraints that prevail in government\u201d. He stood against Iain Macleod, then shadow chancellor, at Enfield West in the 1966 election before winning Edmonton.</p> <p>At Westminster he was immediately appointed parliamentary private secretary to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/23/alan-williams\">Alan Williams</a>, minister of state at the Department of Prices and Consumer Protection, and when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/28/guardianobituaries.politics\">James Callaghan</a> succeeded as prime minister in 1976, Graham was made a senior government whip. This caused some minor unhappiness in the whips\u2019 office as he had been parachuted in over the heads of others, but he was a good organiser and hard-working. In 1980 he became an environment spokesman on the opposition front bench. When he lost his seat in 1983 he was promoted to the Lords, where he was Labour chief whip from 1990 to 1997 and then chaired the Labour peers\u2019 group until 2000. In 1998 he was made a member of the Privy Council.</p> <p>Graham continued to work closely with the co-op. He worked with the organisation to develop co-operative housing and he was also involved with the movement\u2019s attempt to resist the change in shop-working hours to allow Sunday trading in the early 1990s. He was a moderate rightwinger within the Labour party and was not afraid to stand up to some of the more radical trade unions, asserting his belief that \u201cprofit\u201d was not a dirty word. He was president of the Co-operative Congress in 1987 and chaired the UK Co-operative Council, the umbrella group for the movement, for a period from 1997.</p> <p>He was a humanist and told the Lords in a debate on faith issues in 2007: \u201cMy faith is in the human spirit and the ability of ordinary people to control their affairs.\u201d He was a keen swimmer and football enthusiast and supported Millwall. As a lad in the Co-op society shop, he once served Jackie Milburn, who promised to get him tickets if Newcastle United made it to Wembley. Ten years later, in 1951, Milburn delivered the ticket as well as the two winning goals in the Cup final \u2013 \u201ca real gent,\u201d said Graham.</p> <p>Graham was much admired for the courage with which he handled a family tragedy. His wife, Margaret (nee Golding), whom he married in 1950, was diagnosed with myotonic dystrophy, a muscular wasting genetic disorder. Their two sons both inherited the condition. Margaret died in 2005 and their sons shortly thereafter.</p> <p>\u2022 Thomas Edward Graham, Lord Graham of Edmonton, politician, born 26 March 1925; died 21 March 2020</p>",

With a catalogue of more than 75 albums and 15 film scores, his is a daunting discography.</p> <p>The soundtrack to his 1971 autobiographical film Raga is the perfect place to start. Since Indian classical is a live and largely improvised music, these live recordings \u2013 including some from 1967\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/07/da-pennebaker-on-making-monterey-pop-festival-documentary\">Monterey Pop festival</a> \u2013 are an invigorating, condensed introduction to the crescendos of the raga song structure. With performances that in India might have lasted five hours or more, here Shankar provides his own highlights, with snatches of ragas lasting closer to three minutes than 30.</p> <p>Opening with the rhythmic foundations of the genre on East/West Introductions, Shankar counts the 13-beat <em>ardha jaital</em> cycle while virtuoso tabla player Alla Rakha fires out polyrhythms with the force of a man with at least four hands. Other highlights come on the Medley of Raga Parameshwari and Raga Rangeshwari where we skip straight into some of Shankar\u2019s most intricate harmonic phrasings before segueing into the calm meditations of Banaras Ghat.</p> <p>On The Spirit of the Raga, we hear Shankar explaining the spiritual import of his music, its deeper meaning beyond technicality. It is a combination of \u201creverence, fear and humility, since the ragas, he says, are like people \u2013 you have to be awestruck by them\u201d in order to open up to the power of the improvisation. \u201cIt is only then that listeners enter into something they are not aware of, an adventure \u2026 where I feel they are with me.\u201d This is the real power of Shankar\u2019s music \u2013 to allow a deeper meaning to envelop as you listen.</p> <h2>The three albums to check out next</h2> <p><strong>Live: Ravi Shankar at the Monterey International Pop Festival</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/3sXkygk2kpWlNAA2neCvW0?si=fxHx9yROS1O5QvnZttEKPg\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3sXkygk2kpWlNAA2neCvW0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>Shankar\u2019s 1967 show at the Monterey Pop festival is perhaps Shankar\u2019s most famous live performance, and certainly the one that cemented him as a somewhat unwilling hippie figurehead. Captured in part in Raga, this subsequent release features his 53-minute show in full.</p> <p>The 27-minute opener Raga Bhimpalasi features Shankar solo, taking his time with the free-form alap intro before moving into the deeper register of his sitar and percussively plucking to the intricate crescendo of the closing <em>jhala</em>. A half-hour solo is a bold opening move \u2013 and yet this is the essence of Shankar\u2019s playing: you can hear him easing into the composition and then approaching his improvisation to grasp at the notes of his expression. Before long, you can picture him in a free-flow rapture, playing in an otherworldly communing with his instrument.</p> <p>Alla Rakha\u2019s tabla solo then adds a more earthy form of virtuosity before the closing Dhun, which builds with such intensity that you can hear the rapturous applause swelling from the crowd as Shankar and Rakha exchange passages with lightning intensity. With both Shankar and Rakha now long gone, this is the closest we can get to experiencing the magic of their deeply felt musical telepathy.</p> <p><strong>Improvisations and Theme from Pather Panchali</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/6rjHQgpwNVSnJFvBbRz1R8?si=Pc_q05LZRYKukd3OMUJdMA\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6rjHQgpwNVSnJFvBbRz1R8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>Shankar was not only a distinguished performer but also an accomplished composer of orchestral works and film scores. One of his earliest and most notable works was for Bengali director Satyajit Ray\u2019s revelatory Apu Trilogy.</p> <p>In his music for the first film of the trilogy, Pather Panchali, Shankar chose to largely improvise his scoring work in the studio, as opposed to the norm of rigorously writing out arrangements. It hits the sweet spot between free-form expression and precision, providing an ideal backdrop to the visual saga of Ray\u2019s protagonist Apu. Mixing Indian tradition with western classical \u2013 a theme Shankar would go on to explore with violinist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/apr/21/yehudi-menuhin-100-facts-to-celebrate-his-centenary\">Yehudi Menuhin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/philip-glass\">Philip Glass</a> \u2013 he veers from the bright melody of the theme to the fast-paced melodrama of Fire Night and then the sweeping build of Raga Rageshri to mirror the bildungsroman journey of young Apu. A masterclass in instrumental scene-setting.</p> <p><strong>Chants of India</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/7cR7QlEd0b51sSKesnRbGZ?si=yLCwla9HQQKuCllKkjeh_Q\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/7cR7QlEd0b51sSKesnRbGZ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>A late-period passion project, Chants of India explores Shankar\u2019s enduring commitment to the spiritual import of Indian classical, as well as providing a record of his close friendship with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/georgeharrison\">George Harrison</a>.</p> <p>Harrison produced the record, which puts ancient Sanskrit invocations for peace, love and harmony into new musical settings, including the track Prabhujee, which features a rare vocal performance from Shankar himself along with his wife Sukanya. The result is a deeply calming and moving collection; the perfect balm for your possible isolation anxiety, as well as a reflection on Shankar and Harrison\u2019s partnership.</p> <h2><strong>One for the heads</strong></h2> <p><strong>Jazzmine</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/2E7veUdgKp8vnQOKJc7wSD?si=-nymyhBaQvGFe8F4wn4dsw\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2E7veUdgKp8vnQOKJc7wSD\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>Shankar\u2019s work has long been admired by jazz musicians for its use of improvisation and complex rhythm \u2013 most notably by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/john-coltrane\">John Coltrane</a>, whose late-period spirituality caused him to seek out Shankar and ultimately name his own son Ravi.</p> <p>Jazzmine is the only jazz recording Shankar made.

While the recording quality is poor, the musicians\u2019 enthusiasm, especially on the finale Mishrank, is palpable and kinetic.</p> <h2>The primer playlist</h2> <p>For Spotify users, listen below or click on the Spotify icon in the top right of the playlist; for Apple Music users, <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/gb/playlist/listeners-digest-where-to-start-with-ravi-shankar/pl.u-xlyNqM3TkD51o9M\">click here</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4R7jqtpTj8fUQ9VcPN22Sc\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/4R7jqtpTj8fUQ9VcPN22Sc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/26/alice-coltrane-jazz-spiritual-back-catalogue\">Alice Coltrane: where to start in her back catalogue</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Further reading</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.foyles.co.uk/witem/music-dance/indian-sun-the-life-and-music-of,oliver-craske-9780571350858\">Indian Sun, by Oliver Craske</a><br></strong>The first biography to be written about Shankar, pieced together by dozens of interviews with the man himself, as well as hundreds with his family and friends.

  "<p>A British charity that employed the murdered aid worker Alan Henning failed to properly safeguard him and other other volunteers on convoys to war-torn Syria, a government report has found.</p> <p>Henning, 47, was beheaded by the Islamic State militant known as Jihadi John after being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/04/alan-henning-failed-by-british-government-brother-in-law\">held captive for nine months in Syria</a> along with other western hostages in 2014.</p> <p>The taxi driver, from Eccles in Greater Manchester, was among <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/14/alan-henning-isis-syria-hostage-aid-worker\">a group of volunteers</a> who raised money to purchase medical equipment for a hospital in Idlib, north-west Syria.</p> <p>He was volunteering for the Worcester-based charity Al-Fatiha Global when he was kidnapped soon after crossing the Turkish border into Syria in December 2013, according to an inquiry by the Charity Commission.</p> <p>Its report, published this week after a seven-year inquiry, said it had seen no evidence that the charity raised the alarm with UK authorities after Henning\u2019s abduction.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/charity-inquiry-al-fatiha-global/charity-inquiry-al-fatiha-global\">inquiry</a> said the charity\u2019s trustees initially claimed that Henning was not volunteering for their organisation but was instead working for another charity, Aid4Syria, when he was snatched.</p> <p>However, the Charity Commission found that Henning was in fact a volunteer for Al-Fatiha Global at the time, according to police records.</p> <p>The report said: \u201cThe fact that they did not know or regard him as a volunteer of the charity when he was, and his safety was in their custody whilst on the convoy was further evidence of lack of adequate oversight and management of the charity\u2019s activities and risks arising from them.\u201d</p> <p>The commission said it found no evidence of any attempt by Al-Fatiha Global to assess the skills and suitability of volunteers, or carry out risk assessments or due diligence before undertaking extremely high-risk aid convoys through Turkey and into Syria.</p> <p>It also found that volunteers on the convoys each carried with them between \u00a32,000 and \u00a33,000 of unattributed cash, despite the obvious risks in doing so.</p> <p>The report added: \u201cThe trustees were unable to explain why they had not submitted a Serious Incident Report to the commission as soon as they had learned of the abduction. The inquiry also did not see any evidence of the expected liaison with the FCO and UK or local authorities.\u201d</p> <p>The Charity Commission said Al-Fatiha Global\u2019s trustees failed to \u201cproperly safeguard their volunteers by failing to exercise any due diligence or risk management procedures, to provide any meaningful training, instructions and/or guidance to its volunteers\u201d.</p> <p>It said the trustees also failed to make sure its funds were only used to support, put in place adequate financial controls \u2013 despite its income rocketing from \u00a34,000 to \u00a31.2m between 2012 and 2013 \u2013 and failed to protect its volunteers, assets and property.</p> <p>Al-Fatiha Global has been contacted for a response.</p>",
  "<p>The Hungarian parliament, which has a two-thirds majority in favour of the prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/hungary-emergency-law-incompatible-with-being-in-eu-say-meps-group-viktor-orban\">passed a bill on Monday</a> 30 March that extended his already strong powers. The bill, not supported by most opposition MPs, gives parliamentary authorisation to prolong the state of emergency the government declared on 11 March in light of the coronavirus pandemic. As a result, the few remaining checks and balances in Hungary will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">cease to exist</a>, with the government ruling by decree with hardly any legal supervision. No elections and no rallies can be held. Hungary has become a textbook case of how coronavirus can be abused for authoritarian ends.</p> <p>There is no sunset clause in the text, so the<em> </em>state of emergency will be in force for as long as the government wants. Changes to the criminal code mean the publication of facts that interfere with the \u201csuccessful protection\u201d of the public could be punished by five years in prison \u2013 a clear message to journalists. The government now also wants to effectively take over the running of local municipalities through supervising the decisions of directly elected leaders.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Viktor Orb\u00e1n is a role model for other illiberal leaders</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The constitutional court could theoretically overrule the decisions implemented during the state of emergency, but given that its rights have been curbed and it has been stuffed with pro-government loyalists in recent years, we cannot expect that it will serve as an effective counterweight to the cabinet\u2019s power. Likewise, although the parliament could officially terminate the state of emergency, it won\u2019t. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz-KDNP has a comfortable and loyal majority; there has been not a single case in the past 10 years when Fidesz MPs have not supported a governmental decision.</p> <p>Why is Orb\u00e1n doing this? For two reasons. The first is to label the opposition as the \u201csupporters of the coronavirus\u201d, instead of supporters of the people, winning the political debate in advance.</p> <p>Second: he sees this as the ideal opportunity for a power grab. When death is in the air, people tend to rally around their national flag, and their attention is narrowed. While the opposition and the free media covered the enabling act widely, the average Hungarian has seemed less concerned. He or she is more interested now in where to buy face masks.</p> <p>Strategically, Orb\u00e1n knows that this is the perfect time to act: every country is dealing with how to save the lives of their citizens and at the same time avoid total economic collapse. In times of such crises, countries are becoming more inward-looking. Foreign policy, in general, becomes less important. Human rights and the rule of law in other countries are issues of little importance for most politicians and citizens.</p> <p>But they should be. There are many reasons why this is not only a domestic issue for Hungary, and why the international press, politicians and institutions should pay attention.</p> <p>First, Orb\u00e1n is a role model for other illiberal leaders. If this experiment proves successful, many others will be encouraged to follow his path. If Hungary is not put in a political quarantine, a new wave of illiberalism will sweep through Europe, especially in the east. While there was strong criticism for Orb\u00e1n\u2019s latest move from many directions, the most important leaders of the biggest EU member states have remained silent about the enabling act. The president of the commission <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1244960501085491202\">tweeted</a> that emergency situations will be examined in all member states \u2013 without naming Hungary.</p> <p>Second, Orb\u00e1n is working hard to tarnish the image of western alliances. While Hungary received \u20ac5.6bn to help protect it from the pandemic, members of its ruling class have been loudly accusing the EU of doing nothing but lecturing Hungary about democracy. Orb\u00e1n justifies his eastern geopolitical shift, claiming that the EU is unable to help now \u2013 unlike China and members of the <a href=\"https://hungarytoday.hu/coronavirus-foreign-minister-thanks-turkic-council-countries-for-delivering-protective-gear-to-hungary/\">Turkic Council</a>: Uzbekistan and Turkey. Hungary buys masks and respirators from the former and also receives some from the latter two. Also, the general consensus that authoritarian regimes such as Russia and China are dealing with coronavirus much better than democracies is receiving a lot of airtime in the pro-government media.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/coronavirus-is-a-chance-for-authoritarian-leaders-to-tighten-their-grip\">Authoritarian leaders may use Covid-19 crisis to tighten their grip</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Third, and this has received less attention, Orb\u00e1n will use this as an opportunity to refashion the economy in his image. This could be bad news for some foreign investors in Hungary \u2013 especially when the economic problems worsen. The government is currently deploying a military taskforce to oversee the operation of 140 companies providing critical services (for example energy and retail) in the public and the private sectors alike. There are plans for the government to save companies \u2013 on condition that it owns the company in turn. We can expect the coming global economic slowdown and the decline of budget revenues to usher in some \u201cunorthodox\u201d economic measures that go against mainstream economic policies. Multinational companies will likely face levies, as has been done before, but this time without any meaningful legal obstacles. EU funds may be redirected to line the pockets of pro-government cronies more than ever before.</p> <p>The nature of extraordinary legal measures is that they are easy to introduce, but hard to undo. The \u201crally around the flag\u201d effect won\u2019t last for ever. And as the economic consequences of the pandemic become worse, Orb\u00e1n may become increasingly unpopular \u2013 and the situation more desperate. The temptation to keep the emergency measures in place may become even stronger as the 2022 elections approach.</p> <ul> <li><p>P\u00e9ter Krek\u00f3 is a political analyst and social psychologist.

She made her name with a number of prestigious state commissions in the 1980s, including <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/creating2000/235861605\">Karachi\u2019s finance and trade centre</a>, a <a href=\"https://dome.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.3/61592/153673_cp.jpg?sequence=1\">vast hotel</a> and a host of military barracks, as well as a <a href=\"https://archnet.org/sites/64\">low-income housing project</a> that favoured low-rise high-density over the fashion for concrete-slab blocks. Then, in 2000, she retired, primarily to focus on writing books about Pakistan\u2019s architectural history and put her energies into the <a href=\"http://www.heritagefoundationpak.org/Hf\">Heritage Foundation</a>, which she had founded with her husband in 1980.</p> <p>\u201cCorruption levels in the country had greatly increased and I was sick of always struggling to try and please the big corporate clients,\u201d she says, \u201cespecially when they had no understanding of architecture. Writing seemed like a much more attractive option.\u201d</p> <p>But her quiet life wasn\u2019t to last. In 2005, an earthquake of 7.6 magnitude on the Richter scale <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/oct/20/naturaldisasters.internationalaidanddevelopment\">hit northern Pakistan</a>, killing 80,000 people and leaving 400,000 families displaced. \u201cI felt I had to go and help,\u201d says Lari. \u201cI had no idea what I could do as an architect. I\u2019d never done any disaster work, or any projects in the mountains. I had no workforce, I\u2019d given up my practice. But I found that, if you do something beyond your usual comfort zone, then help will always come.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everything I do is a collaboration, so I shouldn\u2019t be known as the author of my work</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While international aid agencies busied themselves erecting costly prefab housing with concrete and galvanised iron sheets, Lari worked with dispossessed families to rebuild their homes using mud, stone, lime and wood from the surrounding debris. Working with volunteers, she trained local people how to use whatever materials were to hand to rebuild in a better, safer way.</p> <p>\u201cI think we often misunderstand what kind of help is needed,\u201d she says. \u201cAs an outsider, you do things that you think are appropriate, but the reality here is different. The aid mindset is to think of everyone as helpless victims who need things done for them, but we have to help people to do things for themselves. There\u2019s so much that can be done with what\u2019s already there, using 10 times less money.\u201d</p> <p>She says that the process of co-creation can also be a crucial part of healing. \u201cDisasters can be truly devastating and people easily fall into deep depression. But if you give them something to do, it really helps with recovery. Something people have helped to make is much more valued than something simply given.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"82fcb0a02497bbf386f3a36bee6bdf344dd860d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82fcb0a02497bbf386f3a36bee6bdf344dd860d6/0_0_3315_3089/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I think female architects in the UK have a much tougher time\u2019 ...

Testing the prototype on a shaking table at NED University in Karachi, they found the structure was capable of withstanding an earthquake more than six times the strength of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/12/this-is-not-a-what-if-story-tokyo-braces-for-the-earthquake-of-a-century\">1995 Kobe disaster</a>. If the homes ever did begin to crumble, they could be easily rebuilt using the same organic materials \u2013 unlike their concrete and steel counterparts.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much money in disaster relief,\u201d says Lari, \u201cbut we need to put much more effort into disaster preparedness.\u201d She is critical of the \u201cuniversal solutions\u201d offered by aid agencies and the siloed ways in which they work, as well as the urbanised mindset imposed on rural communities, insisting instead that responses should follow \u201cforms based on age-old wisdom\u201d.</p> <p>Beyond disaster reconstruction, her foundation has developed a programme of what she calls \u201cbarefoot social architecture\u201d for impoverished communities in Sindh province, running training programmes to get rural villagers to make building components and products that they can sell on to each other. Each village specialises in making a different item, from bamboo panels to glazed tiles, mud bricks and ceramic goods, as well as fuel briquettes and soap, minting a new class of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.pioneerspost.com/news-views/20200213/meet-pakistan-s-barefoot-entrepreneurs\">barefoot entrepreneurs</a>\u201d in the process.

Traditionally, cooking is done on open-flame fires on the floor, which can cause serious respiratory infections and eye problems, while food is easily contaminated, leading to diarrhoea. Lari\u2019s design features enclosed stoves on a raised podium, built and decorated by local women, which makes cooking cleaner, safer and bestows a new status on the cooks. The women are now raised up on a throne-like platform, rather than squatting on the floor, which has had an impact on men\u2019s attitudes towards them.</p> <p>\u201cI really wasn\u2019t expecting this,\u201d says Lari, \u201cbut it has transformed the women\u2019s self-esteem. They\u2019re so proud of their stoves, which they decorate beautifully and keep absolutely spotless.\u201d Following the barefoot entrepreneur model, a cohort of women were trained to build the <em>chulahs</em>, in turn training other women for about \u00a32, creating a chain of artisans who can monetise their new skills. Since 2014, more than 60,000 stoves have been built, improving the health of more than 400,000 people \u2013 and the local female entrepreneurs earn 25 times their original income.</p> <p>On a four-acre campus in Makli, on the edge of a Unesco-listed necropolis, the Heritage Foundation now has a dedicated space to train up the next generation of craftswomen, many coming from the nearby mendicant communities, who had always relied on begging for alms.

I think female architects in the UK have had a much tougher time.\u201d</p> <p>She says she often struggles to reconcile her privileged background with the nature of her work, as the daughter of a senior civil service bureaucrat, born into a world of open doors. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m a rebel,\u201d she insists. \u201cSometimes I feel I should be living like the women in the villages that I work with \u2013 but I enjoy my comforts too much.\u201d</p>",

As a nation whose traumatic past is still coming to light \u2013 through victims\u2019 previously untold stories or even the discovery of their unburied bones \u2013 it is safe to say Ireland remains a haunted place.</p> <p>The landscape isn\u2019t short on haunted vibes, either \u2013 between the ravaged fields and the dilapidated houses; the bogs bloated fat with the mulch of history. There is also our unique relationship with the supernatural \u2013 not just the churchy stuff, but all the myth and superstition. We can be fierce believers in the sinister.</p> <p>Four years ago, I started writing <a href=\"https://www.ruthgilligan.com/fiction\">The Butchers</a>, a novel set in the borderlands during the 1996 BSE crisis. Ireland\u2019s dark folktales clash with its modern aspirations, while the threat of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/bse\">mad cow disease</a>\u201d ghosts across the land.</p> <p>Here are 10 \u201cIrish gothic\u201d offerings from which I drew eerie inspiration:</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/24/100-best-novels-picture-dorian-gray-oscar-wilde\">The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde</a> (1890)<br></strong>Over the course of the 19th century, Irish gothic spawned the immortal (quite literally) figures of Count Dracula and Melmoth the Wanderer. My favourite of the shady old-schoolers, however, has to be Dorian Gray, who sells his soul for a life of eternal youth and decadent pleasure. A possessed portrait, the emergence of the suppressed \u2013 these had long been gothic staples. But for Wilde, the result was much more sinister. The novel\u2019s homosexual allusions were later used as evidence when he was convicted of gross indecency; most sinister of all, it would be another century before homosexuality in Ireland was officially decriminalised.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1992/apr/16/fiction.reviews\">The Butcher Boy by Patrick McCabe</a> (1992)<br></strong>The dysfunctional tale of Francie Brady \u2013 a border-town native growing up in the 1960s \u2013 is not for the fainthearted. We follow Francie from childhood (cue alcoholic father and suicidal mother), through to industrial school (cue abusive priests), all the way to working life in an abattoir (cue a <em>lot</em> of dismembered pig carcasses). A disturbing portrait of a disintegrating mind, The Butcher Boy gave rise to the phrase \u201cbog gothic\u201d and revealed the sordid realities that often lurked behind romanticised depictions of rural Ireland.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062408914/other-words-for-smoke/\">Other Words for Smoke by Sarah Maria Griffin</a> (2019)<br></strong>Griffin\u2019s second novel for young adults is laced with gothic tropes \u2013 a pair of twins, an eccentric great aunt, a banjaxed old house creaking with mysteries (not to mention some exceptionally malevolent wallpaper). It is also a beautiful coming-of-age story and a fierce attack on archaic attitudes towards reproductive rights and the incarceration of women. Griffin is among a number of stellar YA authors (check out <a href=\"https://deirdresullivanbooks.com/\">Deirdre Sullivan</a>, too) using witchcraft and fantasy to engage with the horrors of Ireland\u2019s not-too-distant past.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/aug/18/fiction.reviews1\">No Bones by Anna Burns</a> (2001)<br></strong>Turning to the North, Burns is best known for her \u201cdifficult\u201d (or just inventively brilliant) Booker prize-winning Milkman. Her debut, No Bones, was also a darkly comic tale about a young Belfast woman. Amelia Lovett \u2013 who reads like the female answer to Francie Brady \u2013 struggles with the inherited curse of Troubles violence and ultimately suffers a complete psychological breakdown. A former Sinn F\u00e9in figure dismissed Burns\u2019s novel as a \u201cmisanthropic portrayal [\u2026] completely blown by its surrealist affectations\u201d, but it is the book\u2019s idiosyncratic voice that makes it such a unique take on the legacies of trauma.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"89ea28e381f5a8e9814a3487752a2d1a5367baf3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89ea28e381f5a8e9814a3487752a2d1a5367baf3/0_0_1600_2400/667.jpg\" alt=\"Holly Hunter and Gordon MacDonald in The Bog of Cats at Wyndhams theatre, London.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Holly Hunter and Gordon MacDonald in The Bog of Cats at Wyndhams theatre, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/23/by-the-bog-of-cats-review-spirit-of-medea-haunts-the-irish-wilds\">By the Bog of Cats by Marina Carr</a> (1998)<br></strong>Carr\u2019s reworking of Euripides\u2019s Medea begins with Hester Swane dragging a dead black swan across the stage. Rejected by her former lover (and baby daddy) on account of her \u201ctinker\u201d blood, Hester has been banished from her beloved bogland so that he can remarry in peace. But Hester is waiting for her mother \u2013 the witchlike Josie Swane \u2013 to return. Anyone familiar with Medea knows things don\u2019t end tremendously well. Combining gothic fears of the barbaric other with Ireland\u2019s longstanding aversion to female autonomy, Carr creates a world in which occult forces offer the only means of escape (not to mention a script that is so compelling you can read it like a novel and be spooked).</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/23/himself-by-jess-kidd-review\">Himself by Jess Kidd</a> (2016)<br></strong>If all this talk of repressed suffering and hidden wounds is sounding a bit grim, Kidd\u2019s debut manages to be both gothic and great craic. Having grown up in a priest-ridden orphanage, handsome devil Mahony now returns to the small Mayo town of his birth to investigate his mother\u2019s untimely death. The cast of local misfits he encounters are a hoot, as are their predecessors, for Kidd brings to (half) life the town\u2019s quirky legions of ghosts; Mahony charms them all, the living and the dead.</p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"Dark%20Lies%20the%20Island%20by%20Kevin%20Barry\">Dark Lies the Island by Kevin Barry</a> (2012)<br></strong>Barry\u2019s second collection, with a title that Irish gothic could do well to nick as its tagline) features a spectacular host of oddballs \u2013 from aspiring terrorists to real-ale enthusiasts and the rampantly horny staff of an edge-of-the-world hotel. Even the rain is \u201cparticularly violent\u201d, falling \u201clike handfuls of nails flung hard and fast by a seriously riled sky god\u201d. The image conjures Barry himself, hurling his spiky prose across the page, channelling modern depravities and pagan rites with a wicked smirk.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/21/the-wych-elm-tana-french-review\">The Wych Elm by Tana French </a>(2019)<br></strong>Given that Irish gothic is so often concerned with uncovering ancient transgressions, it is no surprise that crime writers have thrown some baleful bangers into the mix. The first standalone novel by Tana French \u2013 author of the Dublin Murder Squad series \u2013<em> </em>features a skeleton, not in the closet, but in the trunk of a gnarled old tree. Starring Toby Hennessy, a Dublin art-world type who has recently returned to his family\u2019s country pile, The Wych Elm is also an examination of male privilege and how secrets can be passed down from one damaged generation to the next.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/23/top-10-books-about-the-night-nightwalking\">Top 10 books about the night</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/15/nothing-on-earth-by-conor-ocallaghan-review\">Nothing on Earth by Conor O\u2019Callaghan</a> (2017)<br></strong>For a while, it seemed the dark times were over \u2013 the Celtic Tiger was roaring and, for many, it felt time to leave the past behind (as if, somehow, it could be so easy). Then came the financial crash, and Ireland was transformed into a country of \u201cghost estates\u201d and \u201czombie banks\u201d, haunted all over again by the spectre of its own arrogance. Nothing on Earth is set on one such estate where, amid the eerily empty houses, a young girl shows up on a priest\u2019s doorstep. O\u2019Callaghan creates an atmosphere of such intense unease your heart will be going like the clappers.</p> <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/10mFkW7KsW64q4M1scssNcn/close-reading-a-world-of-love-by-elizabeth-bowen\">A World of Love by Elizabeth Bowen</a> (1954)<br></strong>At first, this seems like just another of the gothic wartime tales for which Bowen was famous. On closer inspection, it gives the genre an unexpected twist. After the death of her cousin Guy, Antonia inherits an old estate \u2013 you know the drill \u2013 a crumbling house in the middle of nowhere with letters hidden in the attic full of secrets . Over the course of the novel, these secrets are revealed and Guy\u2019s memory is acknowledged and mourned in full, affording the other characters, eventually, a degree of peace. In this way, Bowen demonstrates how Ireland could come to terms with its troubled history; how it might exorcise its demons in order to look forward to the future with something, perhaps, resembling hope.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.ruthgilligan.com/fiction\">The Butchers by Ruth Gilligan is published by Atlantic Books</a>.</p>",

  "<p>The Scottish government has dropped plans to suspend jury trials for up to 18 months during the coronavirus lockdown after an outcry from lawyers, Scottish National party MPs and UK cabinet ministers.</p> <p>Mike Russell, the Scottish constitutional affairs secretary, told MSPs the proposals had been withdrawn because of complaints and would start urgent talks with other parties, victims organisations and the legal profession on alternative options.</p> <p>At the start of a debate on emergency legislation to help public services cope with the coronavirus crisis, Russell said new measures would be tabled at Holyrood\u2019s next sitting on 21 April after \u201cintensive and wide-ranging discussions on alternatives\u201d.</p> <p>Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, confirmed on Tuesday that her government wanted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/31/scottish-lawyers-call-plan-to-suspend-jury-trials-kneejerk-reaction\">suspend jury trials </a>to ensure courts were able to hold trials in the most serious cases during the coronavirus lockdown.</p> <p>The proposals were backed by Lord Carloway, the lord justice general, Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, <a href=\"http://www.scotland-judiciary.org.uk/25/2366/LJG-response-to-Coronavirus-Bill\">who said the judicial system would be overwhelmed</a> unless the courts were allowed to carry on with significant cases.</p> <p>However, the proposals were condemned from across the legal profession and faced significant opposition from other parties at Holyrood, which threatened to break the political consensus on responding to the pandemic.</p> <p>The bill, which is due to be passed in a single sitting, also includes temporary measures to allow the early release of prisoners to relieve pressure on prisons; allowing councils to evict dementia patients from hospital beds without their consent; and a ban on landlords evicting tenants who cannot afford their rent.</p> <p>In a further policy reversal, the Scottish government indicated it was amending plans to dramatically relax the rules and deadlines on freedom of information requests after advice from the Scottish information commissioner.</p> <p>The Law Society of Scotland, which represents solicitors, said early on Wednesday it understood the need for extraordinary measures during the crisis but said the case for one of the most dramatic changes to the legal system ever considered had not been made.</p> <p>John Mulholland, the society\u2019s president, said there was <a href=\"https://www.lawscot.org.uk/news-and-events/law-society-news/coronavirus-scotland-bill/\">\u201cdeep concern\u201d across the professio</a>n after the Scottish criminal bar association, which represents court room lawyers of all ranks, denounced them on Tuesday as \u201cpremature, disproportionate and ill advised\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe fully appreciate the desire to avoid any backlog in cases which might interfere with the proper administration of justice. However, we have not reached that point and so there is not sufficient justification to warrant trials without jury for serious criminal offences,\u201d Mulholland said.</p> <p>Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, urged Sturgeon to reconsider the \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d proposals.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelgove/status/1245099799503872005\"> In a tweet, he said</a>: \u201cI applaud the Scottish government for their generous co-operation in the fight against Covid-19 but is it wise to take this position on jury trials?

Social distancing regulations during the lockdown meant it was impossible for juries to sit together, while illnesses and self-isolation would affect witness availability and safety.</p> <p>Russell told MSPs there was a pressing need for a plan to get the courts working again. \u201cThe courts must be allowed to function. By the end of the month, we must have the means to ensure that can happen but we want, and I stress this, we want those means to command the widest support possible,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>One morning toward the end of January 2019, Steve Lewis, a US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) biologist in Juneau, Alaska, logged on to the website Movebank.org to check the whereabouts of some golden eagles that he had tagged with GPS trackers.</p> <p>Lewis, a lanky, outdoorsy 49-year-old, usually tried to look at the location data once a week, but he had spent most of the month at home on furlough, unable to work as a result of the government shutdown. Eager to catch up with his birds, Lewis beelined it to his office when he got back to work. \u201cThe first thing I did,\u201d he says, \u201cwas go and check on my eagle tags.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/22/florida-python-action-team-snake-epidemic\">Python wars: the snake epidemic eating away at Florida</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One bird in particular, Golden Eagle 1703, gave him pause. Lewis knew the animal well. He had tagged it on 26 July 2017, when it was still a nestling on a rocky outcrop in Denali national park and preserve. Even before it knew how to fly, 1703 displayed its might by leaping from its nest and gliding a quarter mile down a valley to evade Lewis\u2019s initial attempt at tagging it. After a short hike, Lewis and his team retrieved the squawking bundle of black and white feathers, outfitted it with the tracking device, and returned it safely to its nest.</p> <p>In the 18 months that followed, 1703 flourished. The bird traversed about 8,000 miles, from Denali to Wyoming, all the way back up to Alaska\u2019s North Slope, where it probably feasted on waterfowl and perhaps a straggling caribou calve of two. From there, it carved a long, treacherous path south through the wilderness of western Canada and worked its way back to the lower 48 to hunker down for its second winter on Earth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"001574e33585518534fd1945c9aebb3d21f6e8b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/001574e33585518534fd1945c9aebb3d21f6e8b5/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Lewis tagging Eagle 1703 .\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Biologist Steve Lewis getting ready to return Golden Eagle 1703 to its nest in Denali national park and preserve after outfitting the bird with a solar-powered GPS device in July 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carol McIntyre, National Park Service</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Little is known about what golden eagles do in the liminal years between leaving their parents\u2019 nest and settling down to build a nest of their own. Each ping from 1703\u2019s solar-powered GPS revealed a tiny part of the picture, offering a rare glimpse of an apex predator as it learned the ropes of the natural world. \u201cIt takes four or five years for them to reach maturity,\u201d Lewis says, \u201cand it\u2019s unknown how long it actually takes them to then compete and get into the breeding population. So you have to follow a bird for years.\u201d</p> <p>But now, staring at his computer screen on that January morning, Lewis could see that 1703\u2019s location device was stationary in Sully county, South Dakota, and had been so for two days. \u201cIt was seeing the sun and talking to the satellites,\u201d Lewis says, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t moving.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not uncommon for Lewis to lose a bird. Since 2014, he, along with colleagues from the National Park Service and the US Geological Survey, have tagged 49 golden eagles in Alaska as part of a broader effort to understand their biology, behavior and population trends. Of those birds, only 17 are still being monitored. Sometimes the GPS device malfunctions or the eagle shakes free from it. Other times the bird dies.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tough world out there,\u201d Lewis tells me, \u201cespecially for eagles.\u201d They can starve to death or get electrocuted by high wires or be decapitated by wind turbines. None of those fates, however, seemed likely in the rolling farmland of Sully county.</p> <p>Hoping to get a sense of what went wrong, Lewis opened a souped-up version of Google Earth, plugged in the last GPS coordinates he had for 1703, and began looking around the virtual landscape. There was a nearby road, a line of trees, acres of empty land, and what looked to be a farmhouse. \u201cIt definitely felt suspicious,\u201d Lewis says.</p> <p>He called up a Fish and Wildlife office in Pierre, South Dakota, and asked if anyone could go check on a downed eagle tag.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Richard Bare wasn\u2019t sure whether to be pissed off or deeply disappointed by the prospect of having to retrieve yet another dead eagle. \u201cI first and foremost suspected a shooting because we were having a rash of eagle shootings,\u201d says Bare, a special agent with FWS\u2019s office of law enforcement, who was stationed in South Dakota at the time. In the five weeks leading up to 1703\u2019s death, he had responded to a bald eagle shooting and two separate golden eagle shootings. None of the birds survived, and he found no evidence to suggest the incidents were related. The case of 1703 seemed like more of the same.</p> <p>While the average American might be shocked to learn of an eagle being intentionally blasted from the sky, those who work in wildlife law enforcement know it\u2019s an alarmingly common problem. According to one <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/pdf/management/EagleRuleRevisions-StatusReport.pdf\">FWS report</a>, somewhere in the range of 1,000 golden eagles are shot each year. Sometimes it\u2019s poachers who want to sell the bird\u2019s feathers on the black market, other times it\u2019s ranchers who want to keep the dive-bombing predators from snatching their livestock.</p> <p>Bare, who has been a special agent since 2016 and before that spent close to a decade in the field as an FWS game warden (the outdoor world\u2019s equivalent of a beat cop) ballparks that over the course of his career he\u2019s dealt with upwards of 200 cases involving eagles \u2013 shootings, poisonings, collisions with cars, starvations. \u201cIf you asked me about any other eagle, I probably wouldn\u2019t remember it,\u201d he says. But 1703 \u201cwas a flashbulb event\u201d because the weather was memorably miserable, even by South Dakota standards. A punishing cold snap had plunged temperatures well below zero while sustained winds of 50mph ripped across the plains.</p> <p>After a quick chat with Lewis, Bare loaded his cold-weather gear into his truck and hit the road. 1703\u2019s GPS tracker was pinging about five miles north-west of where the Oahe Dam cuts across the Missouri River to form Lake Oahe, one of the nation\u2019s largest man-made reservoirs and fertile hunting ground for birds of prey.</p> <p>When Bare arrived at the location, he saw all the same features that had popped up on Lewis\u2019s computer screen \u2013 the quiet country road, the shelter belt of trees and the farmhouse, which in real life was dilapidated and long ago abandoned. A firm layer of snow crunched under his boots as he walked across the field, scanning the ground for any signs of an eagle or an errant GPS tag. Then, among the knee-high wheat reeds that poked through the frozen landscape, Bare spotted what looked to be a clump of tail feathers. He took out his camera and began documenting everything. \u201cEven though something might not be a criminal investigation, I have to treat it as such and maintain the integrity of the evidence,\u201d he says, \u201cthe evidence being the eagle in this case.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5999c7ad4afaaf65630b39bc463c737a754f9cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5999c7ad4afaaf65630b39bc463c737a754f9cd/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eagle 1703 found in a field in South Dakota.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bundle of 1703\u2019s feathers poke through the ground in Sully county, South Dakota.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FWS Special Agent Richard Bare</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Only two species of eagles are native to the US \u2013 the bald eagle and the golden eagle \u2013 and few animals in the world enjoy as many legal protections as they do. In addition to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Lacy Act, which regulates the trade of wildlife, they are privy to the <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/midwest/eagle/history/protections.html\">Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act</a>, a federal statute that threatens steep fines and jail time for anyone caught killing eagles, disrupting their nests, or generally interfering with the birds.</p> <p>Passed in 1940, the law was originally designed to protect only bald eagles. At the time, the species was teetering on the edge of extinction in the contiguous US as a result of hunting, habitat loss and the toxic effects of DDT. In 1962, Congress amended the act to include golden eagles. Nearly 50 years later, the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act has proven to be a godsend, at least for bald eagles. The national bird is widely considered one of the 20th century\u2019s greatest environmental comeback stories: in 1963, a mere 417 nesting pairs lived in the lower 48. Today well over 10,000 pairs can be found from the suburbs of Boston to garbage dumps near Seattle.</p> <p>Golden eagles haven\u2019t been as lucky. While they are not classified as an endangered or threatened species, they certainly aren\u2019t thriving. FWS estimates that in 1967, there were 31,813 golden eagles in the US. In 2014, the most recent year for which data is available, the agency estimated there were 31,477 golden eagles in our skies. It\u2019s a remarkable stretch of stability, but it\u2019s unclear if the numbers can hold as wind farms rise across the western US and myriad pressures from habitat loss, environmental degradation and the climate crisis push down on raptors and the animals they prey upon.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>In 1963, a mere 417 nesting pairs of bald eagles lived in the lower 48. Today, well over 10,000 pairs exist</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With so many threats looming, Bare knows as well as anyone that the last thing golden eagles need are people shooting them out of the sky. After a few minutes of photographing the area, he dug 1703\u2019s frozen carcass out from under the snow and gave it a once over in the wind-whipped field. Much to his surprise, there were no overt signs of trauma \u2013 no bloody bullet hole or broken wing or spilled guts. The bird weighed more than 7lb and, aside from being dead, looked to be in good shape. Still, there was no telling what type of damage might be lurking under its plumage. Bare zipped 1703 into a small body bag and chewed over the possibilities on his drive back to the office.</p> <p>A day or two later, a preliminary X-ray seemed to support his original hunch when it revealed two metal fragments near one of 1703\u2019s wings. \u201cIt resembled the approximate diameter of buckshot,\u201d Bare says. Following protocol, he packed 1703 on ice and FedExed it to the National Fish &amp; Wildlife Forensics Laboratory in Ashland, Oregon.</p> <p>Like that, 1703 had gone from a high-flying predator to commercial cargo.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>On any given day, a menagerie of dead animals passes through the FWS\u2019s forensics lab. From the outside, the building looks like most any other government facility \u2013 squat, gray, plenty of parking. Inside, it\u2019s filled with sophisticated laboratory equipment and staffed by a small, exquisitely specialized team of scientists whose disciplines range from herpetology to ornithology to ballistics to genetics. When it comes to analyzing evidence of animal-related crimes and building scientifically sound prosecutions against wildlife traffickers, poachers and others who inflict harm on nature\u2019s inhabitants, there is no better place on earth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dbd18a3d2dd917acafbe70e6f54bcd66d8cfef02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbd18a3d2dd917acafbe70e6f54bcd66d8cfef02/507_0_1506_1784/844.jpg\" alt=\"A group of bald and golden eagles feed on a fish on the frozen surface of the Mississippi River near LaCrescent, Minnesota.\" width=\"844\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A group of bald and golden eagles feed on a fish on the frozen surface of the Mississippi River near LaCrescent, Minnesota.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Fredrickson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like any potential murder victim, 1703 underwent a full postmortem in hopes of pinpointing the cause of death. That task fell to Rebecca Kagan, one of two staff pathologists at the lab. If there\u2019s a federally protected animal that dies under mysterious circumstances, there\u2019s a decent chance it will end up on Kagan\u2019s exam table. One day it\u2019s an endangered Mexican gray wolf; the next day an eagle.</p> <p>\u201cWe get a lot of bald and golden eagles,\u201d Kagan laments. In 2019, she and the other pathologist at the lab necropsied about 100 eagles total, including 1703. Managing an endless stream of suspiciously dead animals can be bleak. But Kagan keeps a sharp sense of humor \u2013 she jokes that she always carves the bird at Thanksgiving \u2013 and finds comfort in knowing that her work is ultimately in service of conservation. Sometimes a necropsy yields evidence that helps finger the bad guy. Other times her efforts reveal that there wasn\u2019t any foul play, just the lethal hand of Mother Nature at work.</p> <p>Kagan unpacked 1703 on 13 February 2019, roughly three weeks after Lewis first noticed its GPS at a standstill. Dribs of a red-brown fluid leaked from the bird\u2019s mouth when she tilted its carcass. She checked the esophagus and it was empty. She checked the crop, a pouch-like structure near the upper part of the digestive tract, and found a 3.5oz blob of partially masticated muscle and fat mixed with a few white hairs that looked like they came from a deer. \u201cThe nutritional condition was good,\u201d Kagan recalls. \u201cThis bird didn\u2019t starve to death.\u201d</p> <p>Slowly and methodically, she worked 1703 over, inspecting and documenting every inch of its insides and outsides. A large amount of \u201cwatery, red-tinged\u201d excrement pooled in its cloaca and its gall bladder contained \u201cscant, yellow-green, watery bile\u201d, according to the necropsy report.</p> <p>Kagan eventually arrived at the two metal pellets that showed up on the preliminary X-ray only to discover that they were nothing more than tiny remnants from the GPS harness. Hours spent deconstructing 1703, and the cause of death wasn\u2019t any clearer. \u201cIt\u2019s a little frustrating,\u201d she tells me. \u201cWe really checked everything with this bird.\u201d</p> <p>As a final step, she shipped 1703\u2019s liver to Michigan State University for a detailed toxicology analysis. A few weeks later the results came back positive for bromadiolone, better known as rat poison.</p> <p>Even if you\u2019ve never heard of bromadiolone or its chemical counterparts \u2013brodifacoum difenacoum and difethialone \u2013 chances are you\u2019ve been in close proximity to them. They are known as \u201csecond-generation anticoagulant rodenticides\u201d, a popular class of poisons that essentially kills a rodent by making it bleed to death from the inside out. Exterminators stuff these poisons in those black plastic bait boxes that you see everywhere in cities \u2013 down alleys, on the sides of restaurants, in condo buildings\u2019 parking lots \u2013 and they are deployed throughout the agricultural sector to keep germ-carrying rodents away from food supplies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"56d64ac6fd464002669cdfb0e583d8e523081343\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56d64ac6fd464002669cdfb0e583d8e523081343/0_0_3400_2403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A juvenile male golden eagle flies back into the wild at the Starr Ranch Sanctuary after being released on Friday, July 1, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"707\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A juvenile male golden eagle flies back into the wild at the Starr Ranch Sanctuary after being released on 1 July 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty Images/MediaNews Group via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These poisons came to prominence in the late 1970s and early 1980s and were \u201cextremely widely embraced\u201d from the get-go, says Bobby Corrigan, an esteemed rodentologist who has spent his career studying and consulting on pest control practices. \u201cIt was kind of a magic bullet of advanced chemistry.\u201d</p> <p>Corrigan frequently preaches the importance of addressing the root causes of rodent infestations \u2013 improving trash storage and collection, addressing degrading infrastructure \u2013 and is unsettled by the widespread reliance on second-generation anticoagulants and lax enforcement efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency to restrict their use. But \u2013 and this is an important, he says \u2013 the sad truth is that we are dependent on these poisons. Forgoing them entirely would lead to an explosion in rodent populations that could usher in \u201ca public health catastrophe\u201d.</p> <p>One reason these poisons are so effective is because, in most cases, the rat or ground squirrel or vole or whatever the target vermin happens to be only needs to eat a single dose. The poison works quickly, and the critter typically doesn\u2019t have time to excrete any of the poison before it keels over. In other words, a rat that dies from a second-generation anticoagulant often dies with a belly fully of poison. And if a scavenger comes along and plucks up the rodent corpse, it, too, will be exposed to the poison. It\u2019s a process that scientists call bioaccumulation, and it occurs all the way up the food chain.</p> <p>Just like mercury in the ocean, these rat poisons have seeped into ecosystems far and wide. A<a href=\"https://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/registration/reevaluation/2018_investigation_anticoagulant.pdf\"> 2018 study</a> from the California department of pesticide regulation found detectable levels of second-generation anticoagulants in roughly 85% of mountain lions, bobcats and Pacific fishers that were examined. Birds of prey, including eagles, are especially at risk for these types of \u201cnon-target animal\u201d exposures. Maureen Murray of the Cummings school of veterinary medicine at Tufts University <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28669046\">analyzed</a> 94 birds of prey from New England and found traces of these poisons in a stunning 96% of them. \u201cWe can say confidently that there\u2019s widespread exposure,\u201d Murray says. \u201cBut how that translates into mortality or deaths is still very much an unanswered question.\u201d</p> <p>The toxicology report for 1703 showed that it had 0.05 parts per million of bromadiolone in its liver. Murray says it\u2019s unlikely that\u2019s enough to directly kill an eagle, but there\u2019s not really any good data on what the lethal threshold is for a bird of that size. If the poison didn\u2019t deal the fatal blow, I ask, could it have impaired 1703 in a way that made the bird less capable of hunting or migrating or withstanding the winter and thus contributing to its death? Again, Murray says, it\u2019s an important question to which there\u2019s no answer. And even worse, it\u2019s becoming an increasingly difficult question to study because, Murray explains, so many raptors in the wild now have rodenticide in them that it\u2019s almost impossible to find enough birds that are free of rat poison to serve as a control group.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"461aff0e5f7b8b3dbb604d376d3a285e4f10c281\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/461aff0e5f7b8b3dbb604d376d3a285e4f10c281/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wildlife repository specialist Dennis Wiist looks for a place to hang eagles ready to be sent out in one of the two freezers.

It\u2019s a fate that many golden eagles suffer. While data is scarce, FWS scientists estimate that poisonings are now the leading cause of anthropogenic-induced death among golden eagles, possibly killing as many as 2,000 a year.</p> <p>Kagan\u2019s exam table was the end of the line for 1703. Sometimes an eagle can be sent to the <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/eaglerepository/\">National Eagle</a><a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/eaglerepository/\"> Repository</a>, which distributes deceased eagles to Native American tribes so they can use the animals for ceremonial purposes. 1703 would not find any such greater meaning in death, however, because the eagle repository, according to an FWS spokesperson, cannot distribute eagles exposed to rodenticides.</p> <p>On 7 March 2019, Kagan filed the official necropsy report and moved on to the next animal carcass in her queue.</p> <p>Without any evidence of a clearcut crime and an ever-expanding caseload, Bare closed the file on 1703 and retrained his focus on the spate of eagle shootings.</p> <p>And out in Juneau, Lewis logged 1703\u2019s data and carried on monitoring the 17 other golden eagles that are still tagged and up in the air, hoping they avoid the wind turbines and high-voltage wires and blasts of buckshot and poisoned prey that have made the natural world so unnaturally dangerous for the species.</p> <p>\u201cI know that death is a reality,\u201d Lewis says, \u201cbut it\u2019s really frustrating when it seems like it\u2019s a senseless death.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 10 April 2020 to correct the name of the National Eagle Repository. </p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>I was 12 in a time before there was streaming, before there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/may/17/i-manager-the-last-blockbuster-store-in-the-world\">Blockbuster</a>, when someone with a VCR in their home boasted playground status roughly equivalent to the captain of the football team combined with the kid whose parents ran a newsagent and could get you free sweets. So your favourite film was either one you had seen a single time in the cinema, or one you had seen on one of the three television channels. In practice it was likely to the latter, because they were the only ones you were able to see more than once.</p> <p>Certain films retained their blockbuster status on TV. Even though they had been made years before, they were repeated frequently over public holidays. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/01/great-escape-sholay-what-makes-film-national-favourite\">The Great Escape</a> was one, but my favourite \u2013 the one that thrilled me to the bone \u2013 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/06/geoff-dyer-where-eagles-dare\">Where Eagles Dare</a>. I say it was my favourite film when I was 12, but it was my favourite film when I was 10 as well, and when the great film writer David Thomson asked me a few years ago to name my three favourite films, it was still one then. I\u2019ve just rewatched it, and while I accept there are more emotionally rewarding movies, it was 155 minutes I didn\u2019t begrudge.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that Where Eagles Dare was a family favourite, one we all sat down to watch together. My mother never much cared for action films; my dad fancied himself a bit of an arthouse buff \u2013 the films I recall watching with my family were the old seasons that BBC Two used to show: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/alfredhitchcock\">Hitchcock</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/12/claude-chabrol-obituary\">Chabrol</a>, Malle and so on. (I just tried thinking of sitting in the living room with my whole family, and the film that sprang to mind was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacombe,_Lucien\">Lacombe, Lucien</a>. Pretentious, moi?) Maybe I loved Where Eagles Dare because it was mine, my solitary pleasure.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to credit now, but when I was a kid in the 1970s and 80s, the second world war was pretty much the heart of childhood entertainment: I am of the generation that grew up assuming \u201cSchnell!\u201d and \u201cAchtung!\u201d were pretty much the only words anyone from Germany ever spoke. I watched <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057811/\">633 Squadron</a> and <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064110/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\">The Bridge at Remagen</a>; I read novels by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/02/sven-hassel\">Sven Hassel</a>; I played with Airfix Afrika Korps soldiers and built models of HMS Hood and the battleship Tirpitz; in the playground, we played the game simply known as \u201cWar\u201d, in which everyone divided into English and German and pretended to shoot each other. (It was tacitly agreed that, whichever side you were on, the English got to win.) But Where Eagles Dare seemed to stand, somehow, above that. It was \u2013 and I use the word advisedly \u2013 classier than the competition.</p> <p>Even when I was young, Where Eagles Dare looked different. Unlike so many shoot-\u2019em-up-and-churn-\u2019em-out war movies, it was filmed largely on location, in Austria and Bavaria. The Schloss Adler is <a href=\"https://www.salzburg-burgen.at/en/hohenwerfen-castle/\">a real castle</a>; the Alpine village is a real village; the cable car to the castle is a real cable car. It had a brilliant theme tune by Ron Goodwin, over a brilliant opening-credits sequence of a Junkers Ju 52 flying through the Alps at night. It had a pair of proper A-list stars, in Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood (albeit the script required Burton to do little more than bark orders and Eastwood merely to shoot anyone who crossed his path). It had a screenplay by Alastair MacLean, then the king of adventure novelists. And it had stunts \u2013 the most daring stunts seen in movies when it was made in 1968, which still looked spectacular more than a decade later: the jump from the cable car, which was real, though to my mind not as thrilling as the sight of Burton and Eastwood (well, their stunt doubles) riding the roof of the car, the valley far beneath them, as they ascend to the Schloss Adler.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05b9c5dfe7c400b13d3ad1e067e4d924a4993d7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05b9c5dfe7c400b13d3ad1e067e4d924a4993d7b/0_222_2421_1453/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It depends on plot and scenario much more than it does on explosions\u2019 \u2026 Mary Ure in Where Eagles Dare.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It depends on plot and scenario much more than it does on explosions\u2019 \u2026 Mary Ure in Where Eagles Dare.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cine Text/Allstar/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Where Eagles Dare is more than a war film, though. I\u2019m not about to claim it\u2019s a meditation on the human condition, because it plainly isn\u2019t, but it skips across genres with a kind of abandon. At various times it is a heist movie (get into impregnable target, get goods, get out), an odd-couple movie (Burton and Eastwood are clearly a very odd couple, even if they don\u2019t ever argue), a suspense movie (will the evil Gestapo major figure out that Mary Ure is One of Ours? Will she give the game away by mistake?) \u2013 and it has the brilliant and bonkers central sequence in which Burton bamboozles everyone by swapping sides again and again as he both explains and unravels the plot. That section has more in common with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/25/comedy.drama\">Sleuth</a> than it does The Dirty Dozen.</p> <p>By modern standards, it\u2019s a leisurely film. The first shots are fired after 50 minutes; the first action sequence is after 59; it\u2019s an hour and 24 minutes in before Burton reveals his multiple-cross; and only after that does the movie enter the period of maximum shooting. It depends on plot and scenario much more than it does on explosions, even though the last hour is constant explosions. It\u2019s the kind of action film I still like, in which you don\u2019t get a headache from constant gunfire.</p> <p>It\u2019s often terrible, too. The dialogue is cursory (\u201cSome people have a sixth sense. He has a sixth, a seventh and an eighth. He\u2019s our best agent\u201d); poor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2010/nov/24/ingrid-pitt-career-in-pictures\">Ingrid Pitt</a> appears to have been cast as a pair of tits; it rather strains credulity that a group of men who, Eastwood apart, look more like a bank\u2019s darts team than hardened killers have been sent to storm a Nazi fortress. But if you can\u2019t suspend disbelief at the movies, where can you?</p> <p>A few years ago I made my son sit down with me one half-term to watch Where Eagles Dare. He was the right age for it, I told him. He\u2019d understand why I\u2019d spent years telling him what a great film it was, how much more exciting it was than the things he liked. At the end I turned to him and explained how the stunts were real, how dangerous it all was, what a pioneering film it had been. \u201cThey should have used greenscreen,\u201d he replied. \u201cMight have actually made it interesting.\u201d</p>",

Most people followed like a Pavlovic dog just like they do now \u2026 Hearing the confused mush of political talk while under the bowels of Trumpotus made me use a presidential stage as my platform.

  "<p>For 900 years, Lugg and Hampton wildflower meadows in Herefordshire have bloomed into a wash of colour in spring. These fertile meadows were highly prized, and the Norman lords who owned them used the hay crop to help fund Hereford\u2019s cathedrals, churches and castles. The secret to their wonderful bounty was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/nov/10/top-10-winter-wild-swimming-spots-in-britain\">River Lugg</a> flowing through the middle, fertilising the valley floor with lime and silt each winter it flooded.</p> <p>But this longstanding system is broken. This winter the valley was submerged under several feet of chocolate-coloured water. It has been flooded almost continuously since October, turning the 120-hectare (297-acre) reserve into an inland lake, with just the tops of gates and fence posts peeping out of the water. Now, as spring approaches, the water is still several inches deep and swans and gulls frolic where mice and rabbits would have burrowed six months earlier.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/lugg-zip/giv-3902YD0Lv95egvWX/\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/lugg-zip/giv-3902YD0Lv95egvWX/\">map</a> </figure>  <p>The damage flooding does to humans has been well-documented, but wildlife populations are unseen casualties, with some ecosystems taking decades to recover. \u201cIt is frightening to think that we have only just begun to see what might be ahead with our climate.

Worms and other insects suffocate and come to the surface where they are picked off by scavengers such as foxes and crows, reducing the larder of food for rarer species that rely on the reserve in spring. Many delicate grass species like vernal grass and red fescue are likely to be weakened by the floods, leaving a flush of resistant weed species such as thuggish dock leaves and thistles to take their place. In 2012, conservationists resorted to weedkiller to get rid of the dock leaves because the valley had been too wet.</p> <p>These meadows are highly valuable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/22/more-than-one-in-10-of-englands-wildlife-sites-lost-since-2009\">sites of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/22/more-than-one-in-10-of-englands-wildlife-sites-lost-since-2009\"> special </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/22/more-than-one-in-10-of-englands-wildlife-sites-lost-since-2009\"> scientific </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/22/more-than-one-in-10-of-englands-wildlife-sites-lost-since-2009\"> interest</a> (SSSIs) and were home to Herefordshire\u2019s only fledged curlew chick last year.

Kingfisher nests normally built into the muddy banks have been submerged under several feet of water. Soil in the water also chokes filter feeders such as dragonfly and damsel larva.</p> <p>The decline of this rural valley, once rich in meaning and memories, is part of what Hitchcock calls the \u201chomogenisation of the countryside\u201d. All over the country, generalist species like rooks, crows and gulls thrive at the expense of specialised species that are picky about their habitat. Only around 1,200 hectares of species-rich flood plain meadows remain in the whole of the UK, with most of them lost due to the intensification of agriculture. Many of these rare species have nowhere to migrate to if their habitat is destroyed.</p> <p>\u201cThis flooding is one element in a general narrative of decline. When flooding is this prolonged, insects and vertebrates start to die and that includes things like earthworms. It then takes years to recover. In that intervening period you have less food for birds and potentially the loss of some species. Everything is getting hit from every angle,\u201d says Hitchcock.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f07b636bffdfdafc123f236ecd40f26790a17994\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f07b636bffdfdafc123f236ecd40f26790a17994/0_0_5464_3640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flooded fields following Storm Dennis in February 2020 at Symonds Yat, Herefordshire, England.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A series of storms over the winter of 2019-20 caused repeated flooding in Herefordshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Farther down the Lugg at Bodenham Lake, prolonged flooding may have drowned 1,500 young reeds, planted in 2019 as part of a \u00a3520,000 project managed by the Herefordshire Wildlife Trust to create more habitats for declining wetland species such as warblers and bearded tits.</p> <p>Sophie Cowling, senior project officer at Lugg Living Landscape, says: \u201cThe lake\u2019s water levels have been extremely high since the end of October, due to repeated flooding. The floodwaters have fully submerged the young reed plants; if they drown it will be costly to replace them and the conservation of declining wildlife that relies on reedbeds will be delayed by several years.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Damage to river ecosystems</strong></h2> <p>Thirty miles south-west is the village of Llanwenarth in the Abergavenny district in Monmouthshire, Wales. Two 16th-century manor houses and a church perched on land raised from the flood plain are a nod to former rural communities that once thrived in these valleys. The 16th-century houses had never flooded until earlier this year when they had three feet of water running through. The damage to the valley exceeded the three previous large floods in 1853, 1947 and 1979.</p> <p>Fortunately these floods were not at a time when fish were spawning but their regularity worries Simon Evans, chief executive of the Wye and Usk Foundation. \u201cIn the Usk we\u2019ve had record floods in 2018, 2019 and now in 2020. That\u2019s three massive floods in the last 20 months. Imagine each one as a bang on the ecology \u2013 if you keep hitting it it just goes away. Rivers just cannot survive flood after flood after flood.\u201d</p> <p>Fast-moving water causes gravel at the bottom of rivers \u2013 which is key for river ecosystems \u2013 to be ripped away and spat out farther downstream. Macroinvertebrates such as bull head, stone larch and marsh brown lose their homes, says Evans. \u201cThese animals are the life-support systems in the river. They provide food for the dippers and the fish, which provide food for the kingfisher, so if you don\u2019t have the macroinvertebrates because you have taken away their houses then your whole ecology is done.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"070046a1416315e2e80b5193742172ce4475fb79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/070046a1416315e2e80b5193742172ce4475fb79/0_0_3508_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Courtship behavior of a pair of kingfishers.

A single flood can impact populations for decades to come; the 1977 flood at Selkirk in the Scottish Borders washed away salmon eggs that had just been laid in the gravel and the effects were apparent on spring salmon catches in the River Tweed 25 years later, according to Evans.</p> <p>In September 2012 more than 200,000 tonnes of soil left the Lugg in one flood, the equivalent of 26 hectares of top soil. There is up to 150mg of soil per litre of water in many of these rivers, and roads are visibly stained red after the water has subsided. This is caused by water flooding agricultural land \u2013 much of which is bare after being harvested for maize or root vegetables \u2013 and washing valuable topsoil into rivers. This soil is often doused in pesticides and fertilisers which cause additional damage to river ecosystems.</p> <p>\u201cOur rivers are not adapted to these elevated sediment loads, and our ecology is not adapted to elevated sediment loads. We should not see big brown rivers sliding past but what we see is big brown rivers sliding past and that\u2019s because of how we manage our land. We\u2019ve got this shifting baselines thing going on \u2013 people think the Lugg has always been brown but it hasn\u2019t,\u201d says Evans.</p> <p>Eggs in the gravel rely on flowing water to bring them oxygen and remove waste, but soil blocks up these holes and reduces the amount of water reaching the eggs, meaning they can suffocate and die. It also reduces visibility so river creatures cannot hunt so easily.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d62d29cb23ecccaa68962e8fd08980f550591ce9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d62d29cb23ecccaa68962e8fd08980f550591ce9/0_0_6240_4160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Record breaking high water levels in the river Wye at Monmouth, February 2020.2B06R6P Record breaking high water levels in the river Wye at Monmouth, February 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Record-breaking high water levels in the river Wye at Monmouth in February</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cheshire/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Divided communities</strong></h2> <p>Historically these traditional farming communities would have been centres for human trade, migration and settlement, but the battle to control water is dividing communities. Tris Pearce, an ecologist and trustee of the Badger Trust, grew up in the Welsh borders where the Severn and Vyrnwy rivers meet. He monitors badger setts near Pentre, Shrewsbury, which sits close to the border between England and Wales. Here, the roads have turned into rivers intersected with islands of tarmac. Some areas have been underwater for more than three and a half months.</p> <p>For badgers, late winter storms come at the worst time because cubs are in underground dens and will drown unless the sow can get them out (which she does by picking them up in her mouth one by one). Pearson feels increasingly concerned about the future of these valleys for both the wildlife and people that live here. His parents were farmers and Pearson kept livestock himself but two years ago turned vegan due to concerns about the environmental impacts of livestock farming.</p> <p>\u201cClimate change is the big thing. We can\u2019t keep ignoring it. You look up at the overgrazed hillside from six feet of water and everything you can see is being propped up by government money. It\u2019s not sustainable. This prolonged flooding is starting to turn into an annual event \u2013 it was once in a lifetime, then once every decade and now it\u2019s all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Samantha Somers, environment manager at Natural England, says the organisation will continue to support natural flood management measures, including creating space for temporary ponds and restoring rivers.</p> <p>\u201cRecent flooding unfortunately caused significant distress and disruption for communities and businesses. However as flooding is a natural process, flood plains can generally continue to support ecosystems which are rich in wildlife and can accommodate floodwaters when rivers burst their banks,\u201d she says.</p> <p><em>Find more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction\">age of extinction coverage here</a>, and follow biodiversity reporters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phoeb0?lang=en\">Phoebe Weston</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgreenfielduk?lang=en\">Patrick Greenfield</a> on Twitter for all the latest news and features</em></p>",
  "<p> In experiments, people perceive an approaching spider to be moving much faster than it really is, and faster than a ping-pong ball or other neutral object moving at the same speed. It is reasonable to deduce, then, that humans generally have an unconscious bias against spiders. Nothing too depressing about society follows from this. But the idea that we are prey to unconscious bias in more important areas \u2013 to do with decision-making, and how we treat our fellow bipeds \u2013 has in recent decades become a hot topic. It is at the root of what is called \u201cbehavioural science\u201d and \u201cnudge politics\u201d, which reports suggested were driving the British government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/uk-covid-19-strategy-questions-unanswered-coronavirus-outbreak\">laissez-faire early coronavirus strategy</a>. But how strong is the evidence that it exists?</p> <p>It was the field of behavioural economics, as described in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/13/thinking-fast-slow-daniel-kahneman\">Daniel Kahneman\u2019s bestseller </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/13/thinking-fast-slow-daniel-kahneman\">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a></em>, that demonstrated that humans do not make mathematically perfect decisions about probability; they instead rely on rough rules of thumb, and often go wrong. Some of these habits are uncontroversial, such as confirmation bias (you tend to notice only the evidence that confirms what you already believe). But the inference by the field that such biases mean \u2013 as Pragya Agarwal uncritically repeats here \u2013 that \u201chumans are not naturally rational\u201d is extremely dubious, especially since it depends heavily on which definition of rationality you use.</p> <p>For example, the finding that people care about the possible loss of some money more than they care about the possible win of the same amount is considered an irrational bias, because mathematically they are equal sides of the same bet. So trying harder to prevent the loss is called the bias of \u201closs aversion\u201d \u2013 at least among comfortably tenured academics. On the other hand, if you have very little money in the first place, it is perfectly rational to care very deeply about losing an amount that might ruin you, and it is sensible not to risk that for a 50/50 chance of winning.</p> <p>Agarwal, a data scientist who has worked on the dynamics of social interactions, also endorses some of the wilder claims of evolutionary psychologists in the area of rationality. My favourite among these is the crazy theory that, as she endorses it, \u201cour brains have evolved to reason adaptively rather than rationally or truthfully\u201d, which is the fashionable modern version of the Cretan liar paradox. If it\u2019s true, after all, then I have no reason to believe it is true.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say that we are not prey to any failures of rationality at all, of course \u2013 a fact already conceded by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jonathanswift\">Jonathan Swift</a> when he sardonically modified <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/17/how-aristotle-is-the-perfect-happiness-guru\">Aristotle</a>\u2019s definition of man as the rational animal to man as \u201cthe animal capable of rationality\u201d. And Agarwal tells some colourfully persuasive stories about how such potential bugs in our mindware contribute to the degradation of our public sphere. The flipside of confirmation bias, she explains, is the less snappily named \u201cdisconfirmation bias\u201d, which is when we \u201cspend considerable energy in denigrating arguments that run counter to our existing beliefs\u201d. Remind you of any particular social media platform? \u201cOften when we are picking up our phones or tablets and browsing, we are doing so while waiting in a queue or having our coffee or pretending to be working, and so we skim, share and retweet quickly,\u201d she writes, almost as though she has had a crack surveillance team following me for years, and it is this very rapidity that makes biased responses more likely. Cleverly, Agarwal also notes an asymmetry in terms for the phenomenon whereby people on social media end up hearing only from people who think like themselves. I, an intellectual, lament the fact that I am in a \u201cfilter bubble\u201d, while you, a bigoted yahoo, live in an \u201cecho chamber\u201d.</p> <p>Evolutionary explanations must be part of the puzzle here, but it is often tempting to exceed their proper scope. Prejudice against people not like ourselves, for example, doubtless originated in early humans for perfectly good reasons. \u201cHumans appear to have a bias that members of out-groups or competitive tribes are less magnanimous and more dangerous than those who belong to our in-groups,\u201d Agarwal writes, which was fair enough on the savannah. But such explanations might imply that these biases are innate, so she also denies that they are \u201cnecessarily hardwired\u201d, and suggests they can be unlearned. This optimistic message, though, can sit in awkward tension with the simplistic neuro-determinism by which she claims that specific brain regions (such as the amygdala) or hormones (oxytocin) programme our responses.</p> <p>For issues of racial and other discrimination, do we really need the idea of \u201cunconscious\u201d bias at all? Someone scrawling Islamophobic graffiti on a wall is obviously quite conscious about it. Agarwal has chosen throughout to use the terms \u201cimplicit bias\u201d and \u201cunconscious bias\u201d interchangeably. The first is linked to a controversial psychological tool called the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/mar/07/implicit-association-test\">Implicit Association Test</a>, the arguments over which show the difficulty of proving the existence of something that is, ex hypothesi, unconscious and so unavailable to the subject\u2019s introspection. So the IAT uses reaction times as a proxy for the assumed bias: if a white person is slower by some number of milliseconds to associate a black face with a desirable social role, for example, then they are said to have an implicit bias against black people.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nearly a fifth of people in Britain who are stopped and asked to prove their immigration status are, in fact, British</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite doubts over particular methodologies, we can agree that there must be something to the idea that racist and sexist prejudice can operate below conscious awareness, and <em>Sway</em> succeeds impressively in its drive to show that justice is undermined by a rich array of social biases about age, gender, race, accent, and so forth. Unconscious bias is a plausible explanation for why so many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/13/how-us-law-enforcement-is-failing-to-police-itself\">white American policemen</a>, even those who are not explicitly racist, end up shooting so many unarmed black men; why hurricanes given women\u2019s names (eg, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hurricane-katrina\">Katrina</a>) are perceived as less frightening than those with men\u2019s names; and why nearly a fifth of people in Britain who are stopped in the street and asked to prove their immigration status are, in fact, British. (Agarwal is appropriately scathing about the \u201cpost-racial\u201d claim that there is no racism in Britain any more: an idea, I have noticed but she is too polite to say, that tends to be most eagerly promoted by those who are, in fact, racists.) One can disagree with her presentation of the science, but Agarwal\u2019s diagnosis of the political harms of bias is passionate and urgent.</p> <p>What can we do about our own biases? The key is to pause, breathe, and realise that the spider is not really racing towards us so fast. Research on \u201cdebiasing\u201d has attracted scepticism from those invested in the \u201cnudge politics\u201d model \u2013 understandably, because for nudge politics to work, we must remain biased automata vulnerable to its paternalistic guidance. And yet many biases can be overcome if we are made aware of them, and incorporate a check for them into our slow, deliberative thinking. \u201cWe need time, intention and adequate cognitive capacity and resources to be aware of the activation of stereotypes,\u201d Agarwal writes hopefully, \u201cand then to significantly reduce the application of any stereotypical beliefs on others around us.\u201d Her own book can, perhaps, help readers do the same.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Sway is published by Bloomsbury (RRP \u00a316.99). </em></p>",

Leaders naturally wanted to act quickly to avoid a dramatic Italian scenario in their territories. Bear in mind, though, that these decisions to limit the free movement of people were made by politicians not by doctors. Just as when Donald Trump imposed his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-global-recession-fears-intensify-as-trumps-europe-ban-fails-to-reassure\">European travel ban</a> selectively at first, the closing of frontiers in central and eastern Europe has a political significance that goes beyond mere sanitary demands. Politics in the time of plague is still politics.

These are testing times, and crises are not limited by national borders. But then neither are we. <br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The sequence in which the Schengen provisions were suspended in central and eastern Europe tells us something important about societies in this region and perhaps even about the EU in general.</p> \n<p>First, there is the collective psychological dimension. The question of borders here is not just about geography or history, it is an existential one. For decades, post-communist countries have sought to escape Soviet influence in order to \u201creturn to Europe\u201d. The reasons were only partially economic. In all those memorable pictures of the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, one can see crowds of east Germans who believed they were literally escaping the trap of history. Poles, Hungarians, Czechs and many other nations felt the same. In the 20th century, their central experience was that of cyclical collapse of their states, downfall of sovereignty and existential threat coming from two totalitarian systems. Their desire to join organisations such as Nato or the EU after the collapse of communism derived from their view that the west was a guarantor of institutional stability and personal safety. Joining the Schengen zone in particular, was seen as a way of finally leaving the geopolitical danger zone.</p> \n<p>Those countries should theoretically then have been the last, not the first, to close their borders in 2020. One of the reasons for this is that \u201creturning to Europe\u201d brought on the one hand modernisation and prosperity, but on the other a profound cost. One outcome of Schengen has been the <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.eu/specials/what_europeans_really_want_five_myths_debunked\">mass emigration</a> of well-educated workers. </p> \n<p>The brain drain of doctors has contributed to the dramatic situation facing many healthcare systems in the region. Long before the pandemic, Hungary had considered special contracts for young doctors to stop them emigrating en masse. In Poland, according to official OECD and Eurostat data, the number of practicing physicians per 1,000 inhabitants is <a href=\"https://data.oecd.org/healthres/doctors.htm\">only 2.4</a>. Whenthe UK announced new recruitment for the NHS of doctors from the EU, the understanding in Poland was that Britain\u2019s target was not France or Germany but farther east. Closing the borders has in fact been in the central and eastern European air for quite some time and the arrival of Covid-19 is just a catalyst.</p> \n<p>In spite of their extraordinary transformation since 1989 the post-communist states are also still perceived (including by their own citizens) as weak. True or false, this provokes neurotic reactions to almost any political threat. Radical political language and radical measures are taken because fear of another collapse of the state is still deep rooted. These real anxieties may gradually be eroding faith in joint EU solutions, such as the Schengen zone, which were previously seen as benign.</p> \n<p>The same reasons may explain why, for example, the response of Poles to their lockdown has turned out to be so disciplined and relatively well organised. If the state is weak \u2013 including the healthcare system \u2013 we want to stay at home and where possible organise for others. Voluntary networks in Poland cooking free meals for doctors or preparing additional Covid-19 tests are examples of such behaviour.</p> \n<p>There is therefore something of a perverse relief to the closing of borders in central and eastern European countries because of the pandemic. It might be only a fleeting feeling that will soon give way to a longing for European normality. However, it could also be the other way around.</p> \n<p>The second point relates to the way in which exceptional powers are a source of immense temptation for politicians, especially the illiberal populists in our part of Europe. Could they resist the lure of this extraordinary centralisation of power?</p> \n<p>In our city, Warsaw, like others around the globe, almost total silence reigns; drones take photographs of empty streets from above. But silence in the public sphere matters. In classical political philosophy it was associated with the danger of despotism. In The Spirit of the Laws Montesquieu writes about the deadly silence in the cities when the enemy is scaling the walls. Our adversary today has no legions. It is invisible \u2013 but that does not mean it is less threatening. Contrary to democracy, characterised by a robust and lively public sphere, in despotism people\u2019s interests and activities shift to the private sphere, where they focus on material goods and forget about the community. This threatens democracy, because while people are preoccupied, irreversible changes can be made to the political system.</p> \n<p>Silence in the public sphere will not be compensated for by the din online. In a more romantic era we thought the web and social media would give citizens better tools and make them more active. Today the passivity of citizen-followers is a well-established phenomenon, and our worries are about privacy and the lack of regulation of tech platforms. It is hard to assume that the internet will automatically become a remedy for the deserted public sphere.</p> \n<p>The spectre of a sanitary cataclysm effectively pushes democracy to the sidelines. In those countries where respect for democracy has been established over many years, it does not have to be dangerous. But things look different in places where illiberal populists have already started to translate the 2020 health emergency as the victory of the nation-state over a helpless EU, and the liberal rules-based multilateral order. In Hungary Viktor Orb\u00e1n has been allowed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">rule by decree</a> during this state of emergency without any clear time limit and special measures include jail terms for spreading misinformation. Since 1989 no politician has been so powerful in the region.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/solidarity-members-eurozone-coronavirus-dutch-coronabond\">Without solidarity between members, the eurozone won't survive coronavirus | David Adler and Jerome Roos</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In Poland, the government <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-poland-election/polish-presidential-challenger-urges-boycott-of-may-vote-halts-campaign-idUSKBN21G0NQ\">changed the electoral law</a> overnight to make sure the 10 May presidential elections go ahead, hoping that the only candidate able to organise a campaign is the current president, Andrzej Duda.

The inactions of previous governments have escalated the urgency of the challenge we face; and it is a challenge we can only meet by addressing the crisis in our living standards and the crisis of faith in our democracy.</p> \n<p>As leader I will continue the work I\u2019ve been doing with trade unions, Labour activists and technical experts to develop a plan on how we do this, for example, developing our policies such as insulating 27m homes, using public ownership to transition to a green, affordable energy system, creating an industrial strategy to deliver high-quality, unionised jobs across the country and developing a detailed, properly funded plan to make sure no one loses out from this transition.</p> \n<p>As a Labour party we need to work with communities about what policies they want to see that would transform their lives and meet the climate crisis. We need to continue to harness the energy and enthusiasm of campaigners and young climate strikers who have helped push the climate crisis to the top of the political agenda through their actions, and work with them to show the world we are opposed to Trump\u2019s climate crisis denial when our country hosts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-26-glasgow-climate-change-conference-2020\">C</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-26-glasgow-climate-change-conference-2020\">op26</a> this year.</p> \n<p><strong>Lisa Nandy</strong></p> \n<p>Yes. As prime minister I would make reaching climate safety the top priority for the whole of my government. I know it is not beyond us not only to build a zero-carbon economy but also to lead the global effort required to reach climate safety. I know that solving the climate crisis means integrating the solutions into every part of what the government does and that means hard-wiring the answers into the very foundations of our country\u2019s economic and foreign policies.</p> \n<p>One of the first things I did on becoming Labour\u2019s shadow energy secretary back in 2015 was to read Elizabeth Kolbert\u2019s book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/aug/12/scienceandnature.features\">Field Notes From A Catastrophe</a><em>. </em>It brought home to me the scale of the risks from the climate emergency. Climate breakdown isn\u2019t just a far-off threat to other people in other places in some distant future. You can already see the impact that even the warming to date is having in terms of the horrific fires raging across Australia and California, the shifting rain patterns damaging livelihoods for millions of people across Asia and Africa, and the unprecedented flooding we\u2019ve seen here in Britain in recent years. We don\u2019t have the luxury of time so yes it would be a top priority for me during this parliament too.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea6232cb-2804-49b6-b1eb-3c34a2cf366f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The European Green Deal is the EU\u2019s answer to what the European commission\u2019s new president, Ursula von der Leyen, called the \u201cexistential issue\u201d of the climate emergency.

We all have a common interest in rapid decarbonisation, so it needs to be a guiding thread across all policy areas: from foreign policy to local government, from transport to housing.</p> \n<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>As Labour leader, how will you tackle the climate crisis between now and the next general election [ie what can be done while you are in opposition?]. Can you give three specific examples?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RL</strong><strong>B</strong></p> \n<p>As leader I will continue my record of forcing the Tories to U-turn and back down on some of their most destructive policies, such as their support for fracking. It was Labour that meant parliament declared a climate and environmental emergency, work that I led. In parliament we need to keep piling the political pressure on the Tories, for example, using our presence there to bring an end to the ban on onshore wind in England and fighting any attempt to water down our environmental commitments in any trade deals we strike, particularly with the US.</p> \n<p>At the Cop26 later this year as Labour leader I will be stood shoulder to shoulder with campaigners and activists fighting for a landmark series of commitments and agreements. The eyes of the world will be on us when Trump, the climate breakdown denier, arrives and our prime minister gives him a warm welcome. Moves to curb the civil liberties of, or label peaceful activists as extremists, must be resisted.</p> \n<p>As Labour leader I also want to give prominence to what Labour can do in power. Many Labour local councils and mayors are declaring climate emergencies and developing their own Green New Deals with their local communities. The Labour councillors and community activists taking this lead are examples of how we can reach into local communities, organise and campaign \u2013 lessons we need to learn ahead of the next general election.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d82a3fc3-3759-4182-b187-1a6732deadd7\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Labour's 'green new deal' - or 'green industrial revolution' - proposes a massive programme of state investment to rapidly decarbonise the economy, creating hundreds of thousands of green jobs, and transforming the way people live - from upgrading the housing stock to revitalising public transport,&nbsp;tackling the UK\u2019s air pollution crisis to moving towards a more sustainable agricultural model.</p>\n    <p>Although the initial investment would be huge, advocates say that would be dwarfed by the cost of not tackling the escalating climate crisis and point to wide-ranging&nbsp;economic benefits in the medium term,&nbsp;positioning the UK at the forefront of the emerging green industries, which are expected to dominate in the coming years.</p>\n    <p>Crucially, the green new deal would tie radical environmental action to a worker-led \u201cjust transition\u201d, where the rapid move from a carbon-based economy to a sustainable system is led by \u2013 and benefits \u2013 ordinary people. Its advocates say jobs in carbon-intensive industries would be replaced by \u2013 among others \u2013 those in wind, solar, house building and transport infrastructure.</p>\n    <p>Labour's manifesto put the green new deal at the centre of its&nbsp;2019&nbsp;election campaign. The idea has also been championed by leading Democratic presidential candidates in the US&nbsp;2020 race.&nbsp;Internationally, its supporters say any such proposal must also recognise the west\u2019s historic responsibility for the crisis - and its global nature - and support a just transition in the developing world through transfers of technology and finance, while welcoming migrants.</p>\n    <p><b>Matthew Taylor</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>As shadow energy and climate secretary, before the Paris summit, I initiated a collaboration between more than 60 Labour councils across Britain to cut the UK\u2019s carbon footprint by 10% through action in the places where Labour is in power. Before the next election there is the opportunity to build on this with more on-the-ground activism to deliver on the Paris agreement through everything from solar energy coops to community tree-planting schemes and investment in bus services. By showcasing the solutions in our communities, and seizing on the opportunity for good new jobs in every town, Labour can help build out the climate movement into the more broad-based, society-wide force that we need it to be. Only through a movement will we stop a reckless Trump trade deal, which would threaten decades of hard-won rights and protections, and pave our way back to No 10 Downing Street.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>The climate crisis cannot wait until 2024. So, I will work with Labour administrations wherever they are in power \u2013 from councils, city mayors to devolved governments \u2013 as they involve communities, trade unions and businesses, to design their own pathways to zero net carbon by 2030.</p> \n<p>We need to encourage bottom-up solutions through supporting climate assemblies and green cooperatives.</p> \n<p>We must also be an effective opposition in parliament, holding the government to account on the basis of the pace of decarbonisation our planet needs \u2013 not the unambitious targets they have set themselves.</p> \n<p><strong>3. Will Labour under your leadership commit to:</strong></p> \n<p><strong>\u2022 R</strong><strong>etrofitting all UK homes [27m] and buildings by 2030 and fight to ensure all new buildings are zero carbon by the end of this parliament?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>\u2022 </strong><strong>Producing 90% of the UK\u2019s electricity from renewable sources [through 7,000 offshore</strong><strong>, 2,000 onshore turbines and 3x expansion of solar] by 2030?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>\u2022 Producing 50% renewable heating through 8m heat pumps and investment in hydrogen?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>Yes, I commissioned the expert report, <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ThirtyBy2030report.pdf\">Thirty by 2030</a><a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ThirtyBy2030report.pdf\"> (pdf)</a>, these recommendations are based on. It gives us a real plan to not only hold the government to account on what they are failing to do \u2013 but also helps turn what can be abstract targets to most people into real, everyday changes for the better.</p> \n<p>Insulating homes will end fuel poverty. An active industrial strategy will make sure that Britain is the producer of the wind turbines and other technologies we need for the future, creating good jobs and apprenticeships in our towns, cities and regions. The opportunities for large-scale renewal are endless \u2013 we just need to be ambitious and creative. It is a central part of how I believe Labour can sell our aspirational socialism to people across the country.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>I know we need a wholesale transformation in the way we power and heat our homes and businesses but that this is possible and necessary and offers huge economic opportunities. As a windswept nation we can be the Saudi Arabia of clean energy, but all too often we are losing out on the jobs and factories to other countries with a different approach to industrial strategy and that has to change.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>I fully support Labour\u2019s Green New Deal and the proposals for a <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Green-Transformation-Fund.pdf\">Green Transformation Fund (pdf)</a> and a <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/National-Investment-Bank-Plans-Report.pdf\">National Investment Bank</a><a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/National-Investment-Bank-Plans-Report.pdf\"> (pdf)</a>. The proposals offer a pathway to a greener economy married to social justice, which our country badly needs. It should be hardwired into everything we do as a country and as a party.</p> \n<p><strong>4. If yes, how should this work be financed and organised?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>These are huge challenges and it requires bold and ambitious thinking. We already have deepening wealth inequality in this country and a crisis in living standards. The Conservative approach has been to load costs on to households that are already struggling, while letting energy companies profiteer. We can\u2019t have this approach if we are going to turn this into an opportunity to deliver better lives and a better Britain.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s why the proposal I set out at the 2019 election had public ownership and public investment in our energy system as a central plank, so we can be strategic and make sure that extra costs are not loaded on to homes that can\u2019t afford it. For example, when it comes to insulating homes, it makes sense for the government to pay for the work upfront, and for the costs to be repaid by households who can afford it over time through savings on their energy bills. Lower-income households should not have to repay the cost of the works, so they can benefit from all the bill savings immediately. Delivering such a large programme in partnership with local communities, with local councils and public bodies playing a central role, can guarantee the quality of work to people\u2019s homes and the quality of jobs we create.</p> \n<p>When it comes to developing the renewable energy sector and where the public is helping to provide the investment, the public should also get a long-term stake in what are profitable enterprises. The UK, as the world\u2019s largest offshore wind market, should have a far greater role in manufacturing the technology, creating good, skilled jobs here, rather than relying on imports, as is currently the case. We should use our public stake to make sure these projects benefit communities, with local procurement boosting local supply chains.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>I would like to see a bigger role for people in every part of the country to influence and shape the transition so I\u2019m fascinated to see what ideas will emerge from the first national citizens assembly on climate change. What\u2019s clear is that the transition to date has not been funded fairly because low-income households have paid a disproportionately high contribution and the debate so far has been too technocratic and too driven from Brussels and Westminster. For the transition to work the solutions in the next phase must have broad support and benefit communities across the country and that\u2019s more likely to happen if everyone can get involved.</p> \n<p><strong>KS </strong>(see previous answer) </p> \n<p><strong>5. How will you ensure </strong><strong>the poorest people in the UK and around the world are not made to pay disproportionately for the climate crisis?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>For too long in this country, too many of our communities have been ignored and seen the erosion of their local public services. We cannot tackle the climate crisis by loading the costs on to the shoulders of those just making ends meet. As leader I will continue to pursue progressive mechanisms, such as public ownership and strategic public investment in the infrastructure we need for the future, in a way that delivers our broader goals of aspirational socialism.</p> \n<p>For example, expanding our bus networks and creating a public transport system that is integrated, accessible and affordable will improve our air quality and cut emissions, while improving regional connectivity, making life more convenient for millions.</p> \n<p>Internationally, we need to make sure the UK is a world leader not a world lagger \u2013 as the first in the world to industrialise and one of the wealthiest, we need to reduce our emissions at a rate that takes our fair share of the global responsibility to avoid more than 1.5 degrees of warming, as well as ensuring we are doing it in a way that is just and equitable at home.</p> \n<p>Social justice and aspiration go hand in hand with global justice. When Trump comes to this country for Cop26 Labour needs to join the voices from around the globe calling for urgent action. The poorest parts of the globe are already experiencing the worst impacts of climate breakdown, which they are least responsible for creating. That is why I support increasing the amount of international public climate finance the UK provides for mitigation and adaptation, and channelling these funds through the UN\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.greenclimate.fund/\">green climate fund</a>, and away from the World Bank. Rather than welcome Trump to our country, we should be leading international efforts to establish a new fund to compensate countries in the global south for loss and damage suffered due to climate impacts. We can ensure the technologies developed in the UK and create jobs here through our green industrial revolution are also made available at reduced cost in the global south.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>It\u2019s a tragedy and an injustice that it is the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world who are most exposed to the impacts of the climate crisis around the world. Their voice must be heard as we debate the solutions to the crisis, not just because it\u2019s the right thing to do but also because it will help unlock the answers to a just transition. It was Europe\u2019s approach of working together with the small island states of the South Pacific and the vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa, which built the global alliances that unlocked the Paris agreement. Britain\u2019s leadership in international development helped to build these special relationships and shows why social justice and environmental justice go hand in hand. We should never see offsets as a cheap alternative to reducing pollution here at home and we must pay for the investments needed by ensuring the wealthiest who did most to cause the problem invest the most in fixing it, and by exploring the role that well-designed pollution taxes could play to ensure the fossil fuel industry helps clean up the mess it caused.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>The Green New Deal needs to be married to social justice both domestically and internationally. Domestically we need a just transition which provides good unionised green jobs, addresses regional inequalities and does not leave workers behind. The UK has profited from burning fossil fuels in the past, so we must assist developing countries in their leap forward, skipping our bad habits, building renewables rather than coal power stations. We should use our development budget \u2013 and work for greater international financial assistance \u2013 to help developing countries grow their own low-carbon economies.</p> \n<p><strong>6. Do you support more new nuclear power stations after Hinkley C is completed and, if so, how will they be funded?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>I support new nuclear power where it is needed for the UK\u2019s future energy security. We need to find the right funding model that will guarantee value for money for the taxpayer and ensure any public stake is used in a way that benefits local communities.</p> \n<p><strong>Lisa Nandy</strong></p> \n<p>I\u2019m not writing my manifesto for the next general election just yet but I have argued consistently and for many years that now \u2013 right in the middle of a climate emergency \u2013 is not the time we should rule out a role for nuclear power or any other low-emission technology. The biggest challenges for the nuclear industry are the high costs associated with new nuclear stations, and their lack of a long-term sustainable solution to deal with the harmful waste they produce, but we will have to weigh these problems against the contribution nuclear power can make to meeting our energy demands in a way that creates good jobs and is consistent with building a zero-carbon economy and it is most important that we are guided by the science and the evidence on this.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>I support the Labour position that nuclear power is part of the mix of moving away from fossil fuels. But our overwhelming focus must be on increasing the energy share of renewables including solar, wind and tidal energy, and with decentralised energy.</p> \n<p><strong>7. Do you support HS2?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>Yes. The government\u2019s mismanagement of the cost and delivery date is a national scandal, and much more needs to be done to manage the local environmental impacts. However, HS2 is needed to increase the UK\u2019s rail capacity, reducing reliance on our roads for passengers and freeing up capacity for more freight travel. This should be part of a more ambitious programme for public transport. For example, we should be building high-speed rail down from Scotland, projects like Crossrail for the north, connections between our towns and reopening branch closures.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>The government has completely mishandled the HS2 project. They have let costs spiral and failed to make the argument for the merits of the scheme. HS2 should never be allowed to justify any failure to invest in the bus networks and other clean public transport projects, which should be a higher priority than this single railway, but it should be possible to both improve the capacity of the existing rail and bus network and expand it too so yes, it should go ahead.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>If we are serious about the climate emergency, we must invest in green public transport. For that to work effectively there has to be a national plan for an integrated public transport network, and HS2 should have been a part of that. I voted against HS2 because of the social and environmental impact it will have on Euston in my constituency. But the project is now inevitably going ahead, and my focus is compensation and mitigation locally. I recognise the need for connectivity in the north and Midlands but the project should have started there, not from London. HS2 should not proceed at the expense of other really important rail upgrades like Crossrail for the north.</p> \n<p><strong>8. Do you support or oppose the third runway at Heathrow and/or all airport expansion?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>Labour was clear in our manifesto that any expansion of airports must pass our tests on air quality, noise pollution, climate change obligations and countrywide benefits, including the current proposals for Heathrow expansion. We need to be rigorous in upholding these tests; as leading scientists have again pointed out the proposals do not meet Labour\u2019s tests, particularly on climate change and as such I do not support them.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>I voted against a third runway at Heathrow because of the extraordinary environmental damage it would clearly cause, not just to our climate but to Londoners\u2019 air quality too. I was a councillor in west London and the experiences I witnessed of people suffering from asthma was already shocking many years ago, and it absolutely can\u2019t be allowed to get so much worse because of a failure of imagination in fixing our transport system. On airport expansion elsewhere in the country, we must be guided by the expert advice of the <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/\">Committee on Climate Change</a> in terms of what level of aviation growth could be consistent with our climate change laws and international commitments.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>I voted against Heathrow expansion because of the impact on climate change. We need to be serious about the climate emergency and our commitments under the Paris agreement. I personally don\u2019t think that\u2019s consistent with approving airport expansion but, of course, I\u2019ll look at any proposals and measure them against climate tests.</p> \n<p><strong>9. Do you back financial support specifically for rewilding projects and commit to Labour\u2019s existing policy to create 10 new national nature parks; rewild the 10 existing national parks and create \u201cnatural corridors\u201d in the form of local parks, walking pathways, cycling lanes and canals?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>Yes. These are examples of actions we need to take to tackle the climate crisis, but will also make our cities, towns and local communities nicer and healthier places to live, bringing public luxury to the spaces and services we care about.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>Tackling the climate emergency needs to go hand-in-hand with restoring our natural environment. Our country is one of the least wooded in the whole of Europe, and yet we know that trees lock up carbon, provide vital habitat for wildlife, and improve air quality in towns and cities. I also believe that every child deserves to have access to trees and green spaces as they grow up, wherever they live and whatever their parents\u2019 income.</p> \n<p>So I would absolutely create 10 new national nature parks and back natural corridors. I would also enable more people to take control of the management of their local parks, and ensure that local government had the powers and funding to maintain them.</p> \n<p>Rewilding is something I think we need to explore with local communities in the places where schemes like this might go forward. I am convinced we can find the right mixture of natural regeneration, new tree-planting and support for sustainable farming in this country, but to do so we first need to see off the risks of a Trump trade deal that would sacrifice environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards and throw many UK farmers on the scrapheap.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>Rewilding is an essential part of the fightback against the climate and environmental emergency. I support ambitious tree-planting schemes and new nature parks to halt the devastating loss of biodiversity and to help in the fight against air pollution which plagues our streets. Our children are breathing toxic air in 71% of UK towns and cities - this is a national scandal and more green spaces must be part of the solution.</p> \n<p><strong>10. Do you support a post-Brexit agricultural subsidy regime to support environmental schemes such as tree planting, soil and peat restoration and flood protection? Should that funding be at least \u00a31bn a year, ie a third of the current EU CAP scheme?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>I support maintaining the current level of funding support to British farming and farmland management. However, I will pursue a \u201cpublic money for public goods\u201d approach, and would want to see agricultural subsidies conditioned on sustainable land use practices like tree planting, soil and peat restoration, flood protection and biodiversity promotion. Under my leadership, Labour would invest in forestation and landscape restoration, for example, our commitment to invest \u00a33.7bn over a decade in tree planting, but this funding would be additional to payments in the agricultural subsidy regime.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>It\u2019s bonkers that millionaires on the rich list are still raking in vast subsidies of taxpayers\u2019 cash from farm subsidies. Investing public money should always be about securing public goods, not offering backdoor handouts to wealthy Tory donors. Our farmers will need to play a crucial role in restoring nature, storing carbon to cut emissions, and growing healthy and sustainable food, and these are public goods our subsidy regime should be helping us to meet. With Boris Johnson pursuing such a hard Brexit, there is a real risk that these goals could be undermined in the pursuit of a low-standards, reckless trade deal with Trump and we must fight that every step of the way.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>Trees, soil, and peat are natural carbon sinks so restoring and replanting them will be key to our aims of net zero carbon emissions. As the recent floods across much of England and Wales demonstrate, the UK\u2019s flood protections are already insufficient, and the worsening climate crisis promises even more violent weather and rising sea levels. Significant investment in flood defences is therefore a priority to mitigate the worse effects of climate change.</p> \n<p><strong>11. Do you support the implementation of policies to reduce red meat consumption in the UK? If so what form might that take?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>Growing numbers of people are cutting down on red meat, or becoming vegetarian and vegan, as people think about the environment and their health. It\u2019s been really positive how we\u2019ve seen businesses respond to that growing demand in producing substitutes for old favourites like the sausage roll. Too often the green movement has been painted as telling people what they can and can\u2019t do. We need to find a different way of having discussions as a country on these issues while not losing focus on the most urgent questions facing us. Fighting climate change is about key players across the world coming together to collectively address the challenge we face, and working out in this country how we can restructure our economy so that it is both sustainable and able to support a high quality of life for everyone.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>The priority for governments must be to focus on the biggest driver of emissions, which is the global fossil fuel industry; but the Committee on Climate Change has made it clear that we also need to think about how we manage our land and produce our food.</p> \n<p>In my view this is not about telling people what to eat \u2013 it\u2019s about tackling food waste, working with farmers to reduce pollution from things like artificial fertilisers and pesticides, and protecting high-quality food production in the UK from the impacts of reckless trade deals. I also think we have to have a much stronger focus on food poverty. Children going to school hungry in one of the richest countries in the world is both heart-breaking and shameful.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>After fossil fuels, the food industry \u2013 particularly the meat and dairy sector \u2013 is one of the most significant contributors to climate change and, in many countries, to deforestation. All of us should therefore think about how we might reduce our consumption of red meat. But changes in behaviour, important as they are, should not distract us from the systemic nature of the problem of climate change. That\u2019s why I support Labour\u2019s plans for a radical Green New Deal to combat the climate and environmental emergency.</p> \n<p><strong>12. Do you support a frequent flyer</strong><strong> tax to reduce air travel?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>At the moment the vast majority of the population fly once a year or less \u2013 they shouldn\u2019t be unfairly taxed. We don\u2019t want to penalise or make it harder for people to go on holiday. But it is right to consider how we ask wealthy frequent flyers to shoulder more responsibility, or reduce the frequency of their flights. In government as Labour leader I would ensure we review aviation taxation and consider and consult on the development and implementation of proposals recommended by the Committee on Climate Change.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>It cannot be right that when 70% of flights are taken by just 15% of the public, the wealthiest people who are polluting the most do not pay a level of tax to reflect this and instead pay the same as the family taking their hard-earned rest once a year, so yes as prime minister I would look to make the system fairer and greener.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>Air travel is a particularly fossil fuel-intensive form of travel so, especially while we do not have the technology for green flights, we should encourage people to use alternative forms of transport where possible. We need to make sure that our tax system encourages that.</p> \n<p><strong>13. Will you commit to greater funding for public transport, cycling and walking than for road building?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>Yes. We need greater funding for and an expansion of public transport, cycling and walking for all sorts of reasons \u2013 not just in tackling the climate crisis, but to improve our economy, the connections between cities and towns, and rural areas, making our public transport more accessible and to encourage healthier lives and cleaner air.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>It is absolutely scandalous that when 60% of journeys are by bus, literally thousands of local bus routes have been cut since the Tories came back to power, hundreds just in the last year, and fares have been allowed to rocket too. I would invest properly in public transport \u2013 and yes nationalise the railways, but also give councils the power to run bus routes for people not profit so they can set the fares and the routes and ensure all the buses in the fleet are zero carbon by 2025. I know that where Labour is in power, our mayors and councils are paving the way on cycling and as a result the number of cyclists is going up, so I would work with them to ensure communities get the investment they need to build on these successes.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>The government has made a political choice to spend transport budgets on roads rather than greener and cheaper forms of transport. I would lead a Labour government with different priorities: building a more sustainable, affordable, accessible and integrated transport system \u2013 with investment in bus services, renationalisation of our railways, and support for cycling and pedestrians.</p> \n<p><strong>14. Do you back clean air zones that charge or ban polluting vehicles in urban areas, which government research shows are the most effective policy to reduce air pollution?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>Yes, I support a new Clean Air Act enshrining the World Health Organization\u2019s advisory air quality standards into domestic law. This would include clean air zones around schools. I was proud to announce Labour\u2019s electric car revolution at Labour conference last year, setting out how an industrial strategy can support the sector to transition to manufacturing electric vehicles and batteries, and proposing creative measures such as electric community car clubs. So alongside an expansion in public transport we are also ensuring that we are transitioning over to zero emission vehicles, and that transition supports jobs and industries here in Britain.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>It is truly shocking that one in 19 deaths in our largest cities and towns are linked to air pollution when we can and should do much more to prevent this. In London, Oxford, Reading and most of the south-east, levels are above the limits recognised as safe by the World Health Organization and on some days many kids can\u2019t even play outside in their school playgrounds without a high risk of suffering an asthma attack caused by the toxic state of the air. Labour in local government is leading the way on tackling this through schemes like [London mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s] Ulez [ultra-low emission zone] and [Bristol mayor Marvin Rees\u2019s] diesel ban in Bristol. We need the new clean air legislation expected this year to ensure our air is healthy to breathe, in line with WHO advice, and to bolster the strong local government action Labour is leading.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>Air pollution already contributes to over 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK, and is particularly damaging to the health of our children, who are breathing unsafe levels of air pollution in 71% of our towns and cities. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve called for an immediate Clean Air Act to tackle air pollution by creating clean air zones.</p> \n<p><strong>15. The Committee on Climate Change says the UK is unprepared for the impacts of climate change. Will you increase funding for adaptation and what policies do you support to prepare for the inevitable increases in flooding, heatwaves and summer water shortages?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>Yes. I stand by Labour\u2019s 2019 commitment to invest an additional \u00a35.6bn to level up flood defences over 10 years, paid for through public capital investment. The new fund will prioritise areas of need, particularly in regions such as the north-west, Yorkshire and the east Midlands that have been neglected under the Tories.</p> \n<p>Climate change will place huge pressures on our freshwater resources. But the UK\u2019s privatised water companies have done a terrible job managing that resource, with only 14% of rivers safe for swimming, record fines issued for sewage leaks, and 20-25% of our water wasted before it even reaches our taps. That is why managing our water security in a warming climate will require publicly owned, democratically accountable water companies.</p> \n<p>Better insulated homes, delivered through Labour\u2019s mass retrofitting programme, will be better adapted to extreme summer heat as well as keeping us warm in winter.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>Short-term Tory cuts to flood budgets left scars on communities across the country and are one of the worst impacts of their damaging austerity programme. We\u2019re lucky to have some of the foremost experts in the entire world in the Met Office, the Committee on Climate Change, and in many of our universities, to advise us on what we should do to prepare for climate change and so we should heed their advice about what dangerous impacts we must prepare for to ensure we are limiting the damage from worsening extreme weather wherever we can and that means properly investing in flood defences.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>As demonstrated by the recent flooding of much of England and Wales and the fact that the last five years have been the hottest five years on record, the effects of climate breakdown have already begun. Mitigating those effects will be essential and funding needs to match our new needs \u2013 but it should not distract from our absolute commitment to prevention through urgent emission reductions and a Green New Deal.</p> \n<p><strong>16. What direct diplomacy should Labour under</strong><strong>take with international partners to help make C</strong><strong>op26 a success?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>The eyes of the world will be on us at Cop26; we need to show them we reject those who deny the climate crisis or continue to fail to act on its urgency. World leaders have to heed the warnings of young climate activists whose future is at stake; the world is increasingly in flames as we have seen in the Amazon, California, Australia and in Scotland last spring. As Labour leader I will work directly with our sister parties in Europe and across the world, both in power and in opposition, to help make sure an ambitious set of demands and commitments are agreed at Cop26.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>I was proud to lead Labour\u2019s international delegation to the historic Paris summit and to meet the civil society leaders and diplomats who worked so tirelessly to secure that deal. So I know how precious and hard-won it was and is and why it is essential we now defend it and see it implemented in full.</p> \n<p>Across the world it is gutsy, young women like the prime ministers of Finland and New Zealand, who are carrying the hopes and dreams of Greta and the youth movement into the global diplomatic arena and making strides forward and if I am prime minister I promise to join them.</p> \n<p>Ahead of the Cop26 summit in Scotland later this year, there is an opportunity for Labour to build on the initiative I kick-started five years ago to showcase climate solutions where we are in power in local government, city halls and the Welsh assembly and to share the learning from these experiences internationally, as I know Sadiq has been doing with London\u2019s experiences through the C40 network of cities who helped secure the Paris agreement.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>We know that climate change is an unavoidably international problem. So we must match our efforts for a Green New Deal at home with our efforts abroad. The UK should use our Cop26 presidency to build and lead an international net-zero coalition. On 8 March 2020, I\u2019m meeting with activists and experts in Birmingham to begin co-designing the demands that we think the Labour party should make of our government and of governments around the world at Cop26. We will be there in Glasgow alongside our European sister parties to hold governments to account for future generations.</p> \n<p><strong>17. Would you support a progressive alliance with the Liberal Democrats, SNP, Greens and Plaid </strong><strong>Cymru around climate action and backing for a green new deal?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s green industrial revolution is one of the most ambitious policy platforms in the world for how a country can decarbonise and be sustainable. It can be a rallying call for the concrete demands we need to implement to meet our climate targets, and put the achievement of social justice and the creation of good, unionised jobs at its heart. I will work with anyone who supports those demands in parliament, across our trade unions, the labour movement, civil society and activists. As Labour leader I will make sure that Labour is part of the coalition keeping this issue high on the political agenda and will resist any moves to restrict the civil liberties of peaceful activists and campaigners ahead of Cop26. At Cop26 I think Labour should push for the UK to adopt more ambitious national targets on climate change, to provide increased levels of public climate finance, and to lead international efforts to establish a new fund for loss and damage.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>I have seen the leadership [Green party MP] Caroline Lucas has brought to the climate debate, and I know that like me she has championed a Green New Deal so yes of course I would work with her and MPs from all parties to make it a reality.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>We need a Labour government to implement a Green New Deal, hardwired into all our policies to mitigate the damage of climate and environmental breakdown, while empowering communities and creating good, green jobs across the country. Every community deserves the right to vote for a Labour government. But we will work with other parties in parliament where they share our aims.</p>",
  "<p>Supporting two very old parents, especially when you live some distance away, brings challenges at the best of times.</p> <p>For the last couple of years, I\u2019ve been ordering Mum and Dad\u2019s weekly online shopping from Sainsbury\u2019s, making sure the pharmacy has delivered their medicines, arranging menus from Wiltshire Farm Foods, checking their care workers have turned up, trying to pop over for a social visit every other weekend, and phoning nearly every day. We\u2019ve often joked I have a second job, as their personal assistant.</p> <p>But in the current crisis, the safety net I\u2019ve tried to build around them over the years is full of potential holes. Reports from <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52014023\">Spain of staff abandoning a retirement home </a>do little to qualm fears, though I can\u2019t imagine that would happen here. But reports that some care homes in the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/uk-care-homes-stopped-from-buying-in-bulk-from-supermarkets\">can\u2019t get hold of enough food</a> are a little alarming.</p> <p>So far, my parents have been getting excellent support \u2013 Mum in a nursing home, Dad in the family home. But what happens if their care staff get sick?</p> <p>Last November, my 93-year-old mum spent two months in hospital. She eventually moved to a nursing home in Thurrock, Essex, owned by the <a href=\"https://www.runwoodhomes.co.uk/\">Runwood Homes Group</a>, in late January.</p> <p>The home closed its doors to unnecessary visits on 9 March, ahead of government advice. I managed to see Mum just before the ban came into effect. \u201cThere\u2019s not much you can do about it, is there?\u201d she said, with a stoicism that reminded me she survived the blitz.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>But what happens if this fragile network of care workers breaks down as staff start to get sick or need to self-isolate?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mum\u2019s nursing home is doing all it can to ensure highest infection control measures are in place, which is reassuring. Staff have to change into clean uniforms at work and must not wear them outside the homes, says Alyssa Kelleher, spokeswoman for the Runwood Group, which runs 70 nursing, residential and specialist care homes across the UK.</p> <p>Each home has been issued protective masks by the government and the group is also trying to source more fluid-repellent face-masks and gloves itself. \u201cWe would like to have more stock as soon as possible for protection,\u201d says Kelleher. \u201cCurrently, masks are only being used in a suspected or confirmed case, which we\u2019ve had none of so far.</p> <p>\u201c[We] check the temperatures of every resident and staff member daily,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>Runwood buys food on a group-wide basis, so it can boost supplies to homes where there may be a shortfall. It has also devised a \u201cno-cook\u201d menu of pre-cooked food that any member of staff can prepare if catering staff become ill.</p> <p>Keeping residents\u2019 morale high is also important. \u201cHomes have seen some external entertainers performing outside their windows,\u201d Kelleher adds, \u201cwhile local communities have been invited to contact residents with letters, pictures and postcards.\u201d</p> <p>Both Dad and I feel happy that Mum is as safe as possible, and that she is comfortable. My bigger concern is Dad, 92, who is supported by a team of care workers from <a href=\"https://www.manorcourtcare.co.uk/\">Manorcourt Homecare</a>, an agency that has 12 branches providing domiciliary care across the east of England, including Thurrock.</p> <p>Dad\u2019s care arrangements work well. The morning care workers wash, dress and toilet him, and prepare his breakfast. The frozen meals delivered every week are heated up daily by the lunchtime care worker, who also prepares his teatime snack. He gets an evening visit to prepare him for bed. Dad also has some additional support from <a href=\"https://www.ageuk.org.uk/services/in-your-area/home-help/\">Age UK </a><a href=\"https://www.ageuk.org.uk/services/in-your-area/home-help/\">home helps</a>, who clean the house, wash clothes and bedding, and generally offer social support.</p> <p>But what happens if this fragile network of care workers breaks down as staff start to get sick or need to self-isolate? Will a time come when he doesn\u2019t get the crucial help in the mornings?</p> <p>And, given the number of people coming through his home, is he \u2013 and are his care workers \u2013 putting themselves at added risk of catching coronavirus?</p> <p>So far, so good. Although one of Dad\u2019s usual Age UK home helps had to self-isolate last week, someone else came instead. I\u2019ve made sure Dad has hand gel strategically placed for his care workers to use if they wish. \u201cBut most are washing their hands,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThey have told me they\u2019ve been given gel to use. And some have started wearing masks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe are closely monitoring all clients and any changes to their health,\u201d says Janice King, operations director at Manorcourt Homecare. \u201cWe are also conscious of every client\u2019s mental wellbeing \u2013 it\u2019s a hugely unsettling time and our care workers may be the only person they are now seeing day to day. We are doing all that we can to keep our clients and care workers safe during these unprecedented times.\u201d</p> <p>The agency has always prioritised its clients under a RAG (red, amber, green) system, adjusting services as necessary if staffing levels drop. It continues to do that now.</p> <p>\u201cIf someone is living in isolation and has no family or friends support network around them, or perhaps a client has an urgent medication that needs administering at specific times of the day, they would be rated red and therefore a priority for our care workers,\u201d King explains. \u201cSocial visits and those clients with supportive families close by would be rated green.\u201d</p> <p>Clients with family living nearby or even living in the same household would be approached to see what help they might be able to offer if necessary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46917a3ba71b4bfe89f5b4de1a9b4bd68c66feba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46917a3ba71b4bfe89f5b4de1a9b4bd68c66feba/0_0_3264_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lynn Eaton with her parents\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lynn Eaton with her parents</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If staffing levels should drop significantly, they would reduce the amount of time spent with a client, or the office-based staff (all of them trained in practical care) will go out on a visit. In Dad\u2019s case, the Thurrock branch has 10 office staff who could provide cover as needed. If care workers need to remind a client to take their medication, they might phone rather than visit in person. Ultimately, says King, they\u2019d call on social services for support if they had to reduce services to a client who was extremely high risk.</p> <p>While Manorcourt Homecare routinely trains its staff to work with personal protection equipment (PPE), including gloves, aprons, arm sleeves, foot covers and masks, ensuring there is enough of it is a worry, says King. \u201cWe are fortunate that we continue to have a supply of PPE equipment in every branch office and all frontline staff have the appropriate PPE for every client they visit,\u201d she says. \u201cOur concern is to ensure that stocks are maintained and so our office team is working hard to ensure these supplies continue to reach us and can be distributed across all of our different locations.\u201d</p> <p>Keeping staff safe, well and working is a high priority for both agencies. They are keen to promote their increased recruitment drives, as they need to find new staff who can cover should existing staff get sick. Both Manorcourt and Runwood are recruiting new care assistants, and Runwood also has vacancies for nurses, domestic staff and wellbeing/activity leads.</p> <p>But getting sick is not something these care workers will want to do. No one does this job for the money: the rate of pay is around \u00a39-\u00a310 an hour. Neither company offers occupational sick pay \u2013 the care workers are only entitled to the statutory minimum, which is \u00a394.25 a week for both sickness and self-isolation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/uk-care-homes-stopped-from-buying-in-bulk-from-supermarkets\">UK care homes stopped from buying in bulk from supermarkets</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No doubt other people like me, who have frail, elderly parents, are wondering what they\u2019ll do if a parent\u2019s care package should break down.</p> <p>I can\u2019t do much about my mum given she is in a home, but I\u2019ve already told my dad and the team at Manorcourt I\u2019d help out if needed.

  "<p>Transforming the energy efficiency of every home, mass rewilding of the countryside, huge investment in cycling, walking and buses, and a \u201cfrequent flyer\u201d tax are among a raft of green policies being put forward by the politicians vying to replace Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour party.</p> <p>In answers to 17 questions put by the Guardian before the coronavirus outbreak, all three remaining candidates \u2013 Rebecca Long-Bailey, Lisa Nandy and Keir Starmer \u2013 set out detailed plans on how they would go about tackling the dual environmental crises of climate breakdown and mass extinction, and shed light on how the party under their leadership would tackle some of the biggest challenges facing the UK, and the world.</p> <p>In the 2019 election, the climate crisis was more prominent than it has been in any previous contest, and voters and green campaigners are increasingly putting pressure on the leadership candidates to stick to the ambition of the Labour manifesto, which for the first time put tackling the climate emergency at the heart of its offer.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the Labour for a Green New Deal group, which campaigned for the party to adopt a radical economic plan to deal with the crisis in the run-up to the election, sent <a href=\"https://www.labourgnd.uk/leadership-2020\">five questions to each candidate and scored their answers out of 10</a>: Long-Bailey came out on top, with Starmer second and Nandy third.</p> <p>The Guardian also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/oct/11/guardian-climate-score-how-did-your-mp-do\">scored all MPs on their record on the climate crisis</a> as part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-polluters\">The polluters series</a> last year. In that analysis, Long-Bailey and Nandy both came out with the maximum score of 100%. Starmer had only been present for two votes, meaning there was insufficient information for him to be given a score.</p> <p>In a clear sign of how deeply embedded a radical environmental agenda has become in Labour policy, all three candidates, answering before the Covid 19 outbreak said the climate crisis was the biggest challenge facing the UK. Both Long-Bailey and Nandy highlighted their previous experience \u2013 Long-Bailey as the architect of Labour\u2019s Green New Deal at the last election and Nandy from her time as the party\u2019s shadow energy secretary and her role leading Labour\u2019s team at the Paris climate talks in 2015.</p> <h2>The Green New Deal</h2> <p>All the candidates pledged broad support for Labour\u2019s comprehensive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/06/tom-bailey-on-labours-green-plans-we-just-need-to-get-on-with-it\">Green New Deal agenda</a>. Both Long-Bailey and Starmer supported the specifics of the plan set out in the 2019 manifesto, spelling out how the UK could rapidly decarbonise the economy and create hundreds of thousands of secure, unionised green jobs.</p> <p>Starmer said the project should be \u201chardwired\u201d into everything a future Labour government did \u201cfrom foreign policy to local government, from transport to housing\u201d, and he flagged up the role of the \u201cgreen transformation fund and a national investment bank\u201d to pay for it.</p> <p>Long-Bailey said that under her leadership Labour would organise and pay for such an ambitious scheme through public ownership and investment in the energy system to ensure \u201cextra costs are not loaded onto homes that can\u2019t afford it\u201d.</p> <p>Nandy did not commit to the details of the plan but agreed there needed to be \u201ca wholesale transformation\u201d in the way homes and businesses were powered and heated, adding that \u201cthis is possible and necessary and offers huge economic opportunities\u201d.</p> <h2>Public transport</h2> <p>Asked whether they would commit to greater funding for public transport, cycling and walking than for road building, Long-Bailey said she would, saying it was necessary not just to tackle the climate crisis, but to improve \u201cour economy, the connections between cities and towns, and rural areas, making our public transport more accessible and to encourage healthier lives and cleaner air.\u201d</p> <p>Neither Nandy nor Starmer specifically committed to spending more on public transport, walking and cycling than roads although both said they would increase investment in those areas.</p> <p>Nandy said she would nationalise the railways and hand over control of buses to local councils so they were run \u201cfor people not profit\u201d.</p> <p>Starmer said the government had made a \u201cpolitical choice to spend transport budgets on roads rather than greener and cheaper forms of transport\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cI would lead a Labour government with different priorities: building a more sustainable, affordable, accessible and integrated transport system \u2013 with investment in bus services, renationalisation of our railways, and support for cycling and pedestrians.\u201d</p> <h2>Airport expansion and frequent flyer tax</h2> <p>All the candidates expressed interest in a frequent flyer tax to ensure that the <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/economy/do-15-people-take-70-flights/\">15% of wealthy UK residents who are estimated to take 70% of domestic and international flights</a> pay more for the environmental damage they cause.</p> <p>Nandy said she would look to \u201cmake the system fairer and greener\u201d. Long-Bailey said it was right to \u201cask wealthy frequent flyers to shoulder more responsibility, or reduce the frequency of their flights\u201d.</p> <p>Starmer said the tax system should encourage people to use alternatives to flying.</p> <p>All three said they were opposed to expansion at Heathrow and were sceptical about aviation expansion elsewhere in light of the UK\u2019s legal commitments to reduce carbon emissions.</p> <h2><strong>Nuclear power</strong></h2> <p>None of the candidates came out against nuclear power. Long-Bailey said she supported it where necessary for the UK\u2019s \u201cenergy security\u201d. Nandy said that the middle of a climate emergency was the wrong time to rule it out definitively. Starmer said nuclear power should be \u201cpart of the mix\u201d in the transition away from fossil fuels, but the \u201coverwhelming focus\u201d should be on renewables.</p> <h2>Red meat</h2> <p>Asked whether they would support policies to reduce red meat consumption, Nandy said the focus should be on the fossil fuel industry. \u201cThe priority for governments must be to focus on the biggest driver of emissions, which is the global fossil fuel industry; but the Committee on Climate Change has made it clear that we also need to think about how we manage our land and produce our food.\u201d</p> <p>Long-Bailey highlighted the growing number of people who are cutting down on red meat \u201cas people think about the environment and their health\u201d, but stopped short of any specific policy commitments.</p> <p>Starmer acknowledged that the meat and dairy sector was \u201cone of the most significant contributors to climate change and, in many countries, deforestation\u201d, adding that everyone should think about how to reduce their consumption.</p> <p>But he added: \u201cChanges in behaviour, important as they are, should not distract us from the systemic nature of the problem of climate change.\u201d</p> <h2>Rewilding and biodiversity</h2> <p>Nandy said tackling the climate emergency went \u201chand-in-hand with restoring our natural environment\u201d. She backed Labour\u2019s existing policy of creating 10 new national nature parks, adding: \u201cI would also enable more people to take control of the management of their local parks, and ensure that local government had the powers and funding to maintain them.\u201d</p> <p>Starmer agreed rewilding was an essential part of the \u201cfightback against the climate and environmental emergency\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI support ambitious tree-planting schemes and new nature parks to halt the devastating loss of biodiversity and to help in the fight against air pollution which plagues our streets.\u201d</p> <p>Long-Bailey also backed Labour\u2019s existing plans to create new parks and rewild existing ones, as well as \u201cnatural corridors\u201d across the country.</p> <p>\u201cThese are examples of actions we need to take to tackle the climate crisis, but will also make our cities, towns and local communities nicer and healthier places to live, bringing public luxury to the spaces and services we care about.\u201d</p>",

In Zhejiang, all asymptomatic patients undergo mandatory medical observation at a hospital for 14 days.</p> <p>Those concerns were reflected on Tuesday by Robert Redfield, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), who said in a rare interview that as a many as one in four cases have no symptoms. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/31/824155179/cdc-director-on-models-for-the-months-to-come-this-virus-is-going-to-be-with-us\">He told NPR</a>: \u201cThat\u2019s important because now you have individuals that may not have any symptoms that can contribute to transmission, and we have learned that in fact they do contribute to transmission.\u201d</p> <p>As a result, the CDC was now \u201caggressively reviewing\u201d its recommendations on use of face masks, potentially extending their use based on the assumption that more people in \u201chigh transmission zones\u201d were already infected but without symptoms.</p> <p>US healthcare workers are already facing acute shortages of personal protective equipment, and Dr Anthony Fauci, the head of Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus task force, warned on Tuesday that, although widening use of masks was being considered, it must not come at a cost to frontline health workers.</p> <p>Trump advised the public on Tuesday to \u201cuse a scarf if you want ... rather than going out and getting a mask.\u201d</p> <p>Chinese researchers estimate that 59% of those who contracted the virus had mild or no symptoms. Documents seen by the South China Morning Post reportedly showed more than 40,000 asymptomatic patients that would not have been included in China\u2019s total number of infections of more than 80,000.</p> <p>By Monday, the latest day for which data is available, total infections stood at 81,518 in mainland China, with 3,305 deaths.</p> <p>Fears in China have increased after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/chinese-citizens-fear-catching-coronavirus-from-silent-carriers\">case emerged in Henan province</a> in which a women was confirmed to have been infected after coming into contact with an asymptomatic patient.

  "<h2>Top story: UK ministers under pressure on lack of testing</h2> \n<p>Morning everyone. This is Martin Farrer bringing you all the news you need this Wednesday morning.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump has warned Americans to brace for a \u201cvery, very painful two weeks\u201d after he said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefing-painful-us-deaths\">up to 240,000 people could die in the US</a> \u2013 and keeping deaths to that number depended on people observing social distancing. In an unusually sombre White House media briefing overnight, the US president said the country had to be prepared for \u201cthe hard days that lie ahead\u201d as the death toll from coronavirus passed 3,800. The worst-case scenario, where rules were not followed, could see up to 2.2 million people die.</p> \n<p>The death toll in Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/green-shoots-visible-in-uks-fight-against-covid-19-says-powis\">climbed by 381 to 1,789</a> yesterday, and included the youngest victim so far \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/boy-13-die-london-after-testing-positive-for-coronavirus\">a 13-year-old boy from south London</a> who was reported as having no underlying health issues. However, NHS officials offered some hope that the nationwide lockdown might be having some impact because there had been a \u201cbit of a plateau\u201d in the number of people testing positive for coronavirus. The government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/green-shoots-visible-in-uks-fight-against-covid-19-says-powis\">is under renewed pressure to improve Britain\u2019s testing rates</a>, which are still well short of the 10,000-a-day target.</p> \n<p>Britain\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/31/uk-care-home-staff-at-breaking-point-as-coronavirus-cases-rise\">care homes are at risk of being overrun</a> by the virus and staff say they are at breaking point, according to the country\u2019s biggest charitable provider. MHA, which runs more than 220 facilities, said more than one in 10 staff were unable to work because they were sick or in self-isolation. NHS staff have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/31/nhs-staff-gagged-over-coronavirus-protective-equipment-shortages\">warned not to voice concerns</a> about a lack of protective personal equipment, a doctors\u2019 group has claimed. Workers have been sent threatening emails and told they could face disciplinary action if they don\u2019t keep concerns private. Police chiefs have reissued guidance about how officers should enforce lockdown rules after reports of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/uk-police-reissued-with-guidance-on-enforcing-coronavirus-lockdown\">heavy-handed interventions such as road checkpoints</a>.</p> \n<p>More than 40,000 people have died from Covid-19 around the world and 855,000 have been infected.

The cancellation of the 2019 dividends will give the banks additional funds they can use to increase lending to businesses and households during the Covid-19 lockdown. Another economic consequence of Covid-19 could see the government scrap plans to increase the national living wage to two-thirds of average earnings by 2024, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/31/uk-minimum-wage-rise-of-6-to-go-ahead-despite-coronavirus-pay-freeze-call\">the Low Pay Commission warned</a>.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Opencast verdict \u2013 </strong>Ministers will decide next week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/government-set-to-make-decision-on-uks-largest-coalmine\">whether to give the green light for the UK\u2019s largest coalmine</a> after years of fierce opposition from environmentalists. The verdict on the Highthorn opencast mine near the Northumberland beauty spot of Druridge Bay will be made by next Tuesday, according to a letter from government lawyers seen by the Guardian. The developer, Banks Group, which wants to mine three million tonnes of coal at the site, told ministers the mine was \u201cvital\u201d because the coronavirus crisis could lead to a fall in coal imports.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Wings clipped \u2013 </strong>Nightingales have had their wings clipped by the climate crisis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/nightingales-at-risk-due-to-shorter-wings-caused-by-climate-crisis\">scientists have discovered</a>, and more of the birds are choosing not to make their epic 7,000-mile annual migration every year between Africa and Europe.

  "<p>Eight hours into a 35-mile cycle across the Namib desert, Namibia, for Sport Relief in February, Nick Grimshaw developed severe heat exhaustion. A medical team put him into a car to shield him from the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11141969/judge-rinder-nick-grimshaw-nearly-died-sport-relief/\">44C (111F) temperature</a>, and explained what was happening: he was at risk of organ failure. Grimshaw\u2019s body started \u201cvibrating\u201d, as he puts it, and he began to panic. He needed a sedative injection to calm him down. The next morning, he had recovered, but sat out that day\u2019s challenge.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna be one of those annoying people who does a trek and is like: \u2018I was changed in Africa,\u2019\u201d says the 35-year-old Radio 1 DJ. \u201cWhen I got back to London, I wrote everything down \u2013 exactly how I was feeling \u2013 so I didn\u2019t forget it. Because it felt really good, and I just want to feel like that for ever.\u201d</p> <p>The expedition was originally scheduled to take place in Mongolia, with the celebrities \u2013 which included the news presenters Louise Minchin and Krishnan Guru-Murthy and the actor Samantha Womack \u2013 expected to complete a 60-mile (100km) trek across the frozen Lake Kh\u00f6vsg\u00f6l. The threat of Covid-19 meant the challenge shifted at short notice to biking, skiing (down sand dunes) and walking across the world\u2019s oldest desert. What did he make of the switch? \u201cI thought: \u2018Wicked. It will be dead warm,\u2019\u201d Grimshaw says, with his typical deadpan delivery.</p> <p>We meet in Clissold Park, in north London, not far from Grimshaw\u2019s house, and sit down on a bench to talk. Grimshaw says that the challenge, which was set up to raise money for mental health services, is the hardest thing he has ever done. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying that [Sport Relief] is going to solve everything, but it\u2019s good that mental health is in the public consciousness more,\u201d he says. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m quite lucky in that I\u2019ve not been as severely affected as some people on the trip were,\u201d he continues. \u201cI\u2019ve had horrible anxiety that won\u2019t go, and have been feeling down, with really horrible panic attacks. I\u2019m not here being like: \u2018I\u2019ve got severe anxiety.\u2019 But I suffer with anxiety, and when it\u2019s bad, it\u2019s bad.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4af0461a96a47c01753033ad06981a0987015491\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4af0461a96a47c01753033ad06981a0987015491/0_188_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grimshaw in the Namib desert for Sport Relief.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grimshaw in the Namib desert for Sport Relief.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Comic Relief/Comic Relief via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Grimshaw first experienced anxiety at university, with flashpoints occurring at the times in his career when he has been working too hard and partying harder \u2013 taking on the job of replacing Chris Moyles on the Radio 1 breakfast show in 2012 was a definite strain. Although he has not had a panic attack in years (Namibia aside) he still sees a therapist, although he recognises not everyone can afford to pay for talking therapy. \u201cMost people don\u2019t have the luxury of a spare Thursday afternoon to pop round and see their therapist,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s a real privilege that I do.\u201d</p> <p>His mental health has become more manageable as his social life has slowed down. \u201cI drink, but I won\u2019t get drunk like I used to,\u201d he says. \u201cI used to just go out all the time, but I guess that\u2019s what you do in your 20s. I used to think my mum and dad were crazy not being in Ibiza. But something happens where you turn 32, I think, and you\u2019re like: \u2018Fuck this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>This year has been especially tough for Grimshaw: he has lost two close friends, one of whom was the presenter Caroline Flack, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/16/caroline-flack-obituary\">died in February</a>. Her death prompted an astonishing outpouring of grief from the public. </p> <p><em>\u201c</em>I knew she was very loved,\u201d he says. \u201cShe was so funny, engaging and open. And also really vulnerable. I think a lot of people, me included, saw her in themselves. And it was the most horrible, shocking news.\u201d</p> <p>Grimshaw was in his car on the way to the gym when heard on the radio that Flack had died. He remembers checking his phone and seeing messages come in from his friends. He drove home and cried alone.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to take,\u201d he says. \u201cWe weren\u2019t best friends, but we were close and we\u2019d speak all the time. We\u2019d spoken earlier that week. We had plans to hang out, and I\u2019d been messaging her when all the shit had gone down.\u201d Flack was facing trial, for an alleged attack on her boyfriend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/16/caroline-flack-boyfriend-lewis-burton-heartbroken-by-her-death-love-island\">Lewis Burton</a>. She had been forced to step back from presenting Love Island, and had become a tabloid target. \u201cShe was going through a tough time.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f92841de9a0ee2d2e0169f1340aa94268c5e80c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f92841de9a0ee2d2e0169f1340aa94268c5e80c1/193_31_4268_2560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grimshaw on The X Factor with Rita Ora, Cheryl and Simon Cowell in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grimshaw on The X Factor with Rita Ora, Cheryl and Simon Cowell in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Grimshaw met Flack in 2007 at the Hawley Arms pub in Camden \u2013 a famed hangout for the mid-00s north London set, including Amy Winehouse and Noel Fielding. He was doing an internship at MTV nearby, so they would drink there most weeknights. The two went on to work together in 2015 on the 12th series of The X Factor \u2013 Grimshaw as a judge and Flack as a host. Flack was also a regular guest on Grimshaw\u2019s Radio 1 show.</p> <p>\u201cMy experience of Caroline was nothing but joy and fun,\u201d he says. \u201cShe was always one of those people who, if you were having a fine night out, would make it a brilliant night out.\u201d</p> <p>What has he been thinking about since he found out about her death? \u201cThat it could have been avoided,\u201d he says. \u201cI know that always happens when someone dies young, and when I\u2019ve had friends who have passed away before they should have. You always play a bit of \u2018what could I have done?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Flack\u2019s death put the spotlight on the tabloid press, with many angry at the way her personal life was covered so incessantly by some publications, particularly after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/13/caroline-flack-arrested-charged-with-assault-x-factor\">her arrest</a> in December. A petition to introduce \u201c<a href=\"https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/flacks-law\">Caroline\u2019s law</a>\u201d (which seeks to make it a criminal offence for the media to knowingly bully a person by sensationalising their misfortune) has received more than 860,000 signatures.</p> <p>\u201cWith Caroline, no one was reporting on facts,\u201d says Grimshaw. \u201cThere\u2019s this constant need to dig things out about people. It felt really unnecessary. It felt relentless. It\u2019s really dark. It\u2019s not a funny thing to cover.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s life was on the line here. And their relationship, and their family\u2019s lives. I just thought there was no \u2026\u201d he pauses. \u201cWe\u2019re taught about duty of care at Radio 1. I just can\u2019t imagine making light of something like that on the radio, so why would you write it down and print it?\u201d</p> <p>Grimshaw is no stranger to the tabloids himself. In the early days of his career, he would be papped leaving parties with A-listers such as Harry Styles, Kate Moss and Rita Ora. And he\u2019s still photographed when out and about.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t indulge in it,\u201d says Grimshaw. <strong>\u201c</strong>I think girls get it on a totally different spectrum to guys. I remember when Fearne Cotton was at Radio 1; there were paps outside every single day, and every single day she\u2019d be in the paper. It\u2019s the same with Maya Jama now. Boys don\u2019t really get that. I think with girls there\u2019s so much more to comment on, like: \u2018Oh, they look tired,\u2019 or: \u2018How dare they have roots.\u2019 There\u2019s so much more interest in gossiping about their sex lives or what they\u2019re posting.\u201d</p> <p> Grimshaw\u2019s path to radio began on his childhood bedroom floor in Oldham. He remembers it vividly: creaky wooden floors, a giant Prodigy poster, incense and the voice of John Peel coming out of the speakers on his hi-fi with a double tape deck (which he still has).</p> <p>\u201cI thought I discovered John Peel,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought no one else had heard of him and he was really niche. And everyone was, like: \u2018What, the most famous DJ in the world?\u2019 I vividly remember sitting on the floor with the radio on, like people in the war. Now, I can\u2019t imagine a young person just listening to the radio and not doing something else.\u201d</p> <p>He inherited his love of music from his older brother and sister (13 and 12 years his senior), and would listen to Chris Evans and Sara Cox on his way to school. Away from music, he describes his childhood as fun, his household as noisy, and his school reports as consistent: \u201cNick could be actually really good, and he\u2019s smart, but he will not do any work and he\u2019d rather be the class clown.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bce3dd8b353904dda6910afcfff36ff07a458a28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bce3dd8b353904dda6910afcfff36ff07a458a28/0_68_1723_2153/800.jpg\" alt=\"With Agyness Deyn in 2008.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Agyness Deyn in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Curley/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Grimshaw never felt the need to come out as gay to his parents \u2013 he suggests it was obvious enough for him not to have to spell it out. \u201cI used to just do Cher and Gloria Estefan shows,\u201d he says, before launching enthusiastically into an anecdote about the time he recreated one of Estefan\u2019s album covers for his bemused parents.</p> <p>\u201cI also remember seeing a picture of David Beckham,\u201d he continues. \u201cHe was in a bath, and it was in black and white, and there was foam on him. I must have been so young because I didn\u2019t find it sexually attractive; I just couldn\u2019t stop looking at it. I remember running out to my dad in the garden being like: \u2018Can I put this on my wall?\u2019 And him being like: \u2018Yes, but with Blu-Tack \u2013 don\u2019t ruin the wall.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In 2002, he went to the University of Liverpool, where he studied communication and media studies. He spent much of his degree heavily involved in the student radio station and distracted by parties. He never showed up to the graduation ceremony and only found out what he\u2019d left with <a href=\"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/nick-grimshaw-fails-degree-18744781\">more than a decade later</a> live on Radio 1. (He\u2019d failed his final year and left with a DipHE.)</p> <p>After a brief spell with a music management and PR agency in Manchester, Grimshaw moved to London, where he helped run club nights while interning at MTV. He got his first shot at TV on E4, hosting daily shows, before moving over to Channel 4 to do its breakfast show, Freshly Squeezed, with Alexa Chung and, later, Jameela Jamil.</p> <p>In September 2007, he was poached by Radio 1 to host the 10pm-midnight slot. He had been there for nearly five years when Ben Cooper, the station\u2019s then controller, offered him the biggest job in radio: replacing Moyles on the Breakfast Show.</p> <p>It was a gig Grimshaw had for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-44312738https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-44312738\">nearly six years</a>, making himself a household name in the process. It wasn\u2019t until he stood down from it in 2018, to be replaced by Greg James, that he realised how much of a mental strain the 4am starts and intense criticism of his performance was having.</p> <p>\u201cI was burnt out,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I realised until a few months later. When you do that show, you\u2019re under a lot of scrutiny \u2013 people are slagging you off at 5.30 in the morning. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d taken in that element of it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I was a kid, I only wanted to do the Radio 1 Breakfast Show. I never listened to anything else. I still don\u2019t</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Grimshaw was a hit with critics, but ratings dropped during his tenure \u2013 according to Rajar<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-44312738\">, 5.1 million</a> people listened to the show when he announced he was leaving, the second-lowest audience since records began. The response from Grimshaw and station executives was always the same: they wanted to attract the younger listeners who had left the station during the Moyles years, even if it meant a drastic drop in overall listeners.</p> <p>\u201cRatings are important, although I never paid too much attention to them,\u201d says Grimshaw. \u201cIt was hard to know exactly what they were measuring it against because our bosses were saying at the time: \u2018Our average listener is too old. We want young people.\u2019 So I had a specific brief. When I look back \u2026 that\u2019s a bit of a shitty brief for the Nick Grimshaw brand,\u201d he says, knowing that he was essentially being asked to dramatically reduce the overall listeners to narrow the age bracket. \u201cWas that a good idea for me?\u201d</p> <p> It certainly doesn\u2019t seem to have done his career much harm. On leaving the Breakfast Show in 2018, he was given a comfortable drive-time slot. And, after a year that began with announcements of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/29/bbc-announces-450-jobs-will-go-in-newsroom-shake-up\">job losses and aggressive budget cuts</a>, the BBC has received praise for the way it has adapted to the coronavirus pandemic. <strong>\u201c</strong>Loads of people are messaging into Radio 1 being like: \u2018You guys are really helping us. We\u2019re bored at home and we\u2019re really liking this,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cIt feels like the thing that first made me want to do radio. The only brief we\u2019ve had is to just be yourself, be honest.\u201d</p> <p>Does he think he will remain at the BBC when the time comes to move on?</p> <p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I was a kid, I only wanted to do the Radio 1 Breakfast Show. I never listened to anything else. I still don\u2019t listen to anything else: I have Radio 1, 1Xtra and 6 Music, and that\u2019s pretty much it.\u201d</p> <p>No plans to move back to television, then? \u201cI definitely still want to do radio,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never not liked it, and I\u2019ve never gone into work and felt worse \u2013 because I just love chatting to people. The only two things I like are listening to songs and chatting shit.

A<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2592352494339076\"> video posted on Facebook </a>of the Van der Valk hotel near a hospital in Bernhoven describes how three rooms were turned into a delivery suite.</p> <p>Lucia Rocca-Ihenacho, the chief executive of MUN, said: \u201cWe could be creating pop-up birth centres like the Dutch.

Many are not allowed partners on the postnatal ward, which is especially worrying for mothers of twins.</p> <p>\u201cOthers who have suffered PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder] are having homebirths cancelled but told they can\u2019t have partners with them on the postnatal ward. Some are asking if trusts have a duty of care to attend their birth at home if they go ahead anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Lucy Tuohy, from Edinburgh, is currently 38-weeks pregnant and was hoping to have a vaginal birth. But due to the restrictions placed on birthing partners she came to the conclusion that a planned caesarean-section delivery would give her more control over her birth.</p> <p>She was told that if she were to be induced she would have to go through the early stages of labour without her partner and he may not be allowed on the postnatal ward.</p> <p>She told the Guardian: \u201cWith my first baby I had a long traumatic birth. The thought, if I had to be induced, of spending time in hospital without my partner petrifies me. What is meant to be this lovely, magical time now has a grey shadow over it.\u201d</p> <p>Soo Downe, a professor of midwifery studies at the University of Central Lancashire, is among academics supporting the idea of pop-up birth centres.</p> <p>\u201cWe know from the<a href=\"https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/birthplace\"> UK Birthplace Study</a> that women without complications have less risk if they give birth outside hospital \u2013 at home or in birth centres \u2013 and there is no increased risk for babies in the vast majority of cases,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWhile some maternity services in the UK have reacted to the Covid-19 crisis by centralising services, other UK regions and countries \u2013 including the Netherlands, Canada, and Iceland \u2013 have done the opposite and found creative solutions to keep community services open or even to expand birth centre or homebirth facilities.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-tributes-and-memories\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-tributes-and-memories&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus-tributes-and-memories&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Speaking recently on the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51898207\">BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show</a>, the health secretary Matt Hancock said empty hotels across the country would help ease the pressure on hospitals filling up with patients, although he did not comment on hotels being used as birth centres. </p> <p>An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cIt is important that visiting is restricted to help stop the spread of coronavirus, but our guidance is absolutely clear that a specific exception should be made for birthing partners when a woman is in labour.\u201d</p> <p>NHS England said it was due to publish guidance in response to the Birthrights statement.

By some combination of arrogance and incompetence the government excluded itself from one piece of European cooperation that no one could reasonably denounce as a compromise on sovereignty.</p> <p>That mistake doesn\u2019t yet carry a political penalty. Details of what the EU actually does has never much excited public opinion, except when it can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/11/boris-johnson-launches-the-vote-leave-battlebus-in-cornwall\">be caricatured</a> as an affront to cultural autonomy. But the urge to cut every fibre of every thread that binds the UK to Europe is also a minority compulsion. Johnson\u2019s electoral mandate was to get Brexit done, mainly so that sweaty European debates might be relegated back to their pre-referendum position on the political fringes. If the prime minister now decided that the small print needed amendment I doubt there would be uproar. If there is one person in Britain capable of serving hard Brexiteers something softer while claiming the taste is the same, Johnson is that man.</p> <p>In the longer term, events have a way of proving everyone right in their own imagination. Pro-Europeans will see the pandemic as confirmation that modern threats know no borders, and that cooperation on a continental scale is the inevitable solution. Eurosceptics will point to the primacy of national responses in every country to argue that the plot for a federal superstate goes against nature\u2019s grain. Each side will find evidence to support their view. The crisis offers examples of cross-border solidarity and nationalist self-isolation.</p> <p>It has demonstrated the logic of continental cooperation and probed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/eu-leaders-clash-over-economic-response-to-coronavirus-crisis\">continental fault lines</a>. There is renewed tension within the eurozone because German and Dutch taxpayers don\u2019t like underwriting Italian debts. There is dismay at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">Vikor Orb\u00e1</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">n using the cloak of emergency powers</a> to suffocate what democratic spirit is left in Hungary. The virus will also be a shared trauma that might, as in the past, cultivate the sense of common destiny that underpins collaborative European politics.</p> <p>EU structures will evolve through Covid-19, as will the character of the European project. Britain will have to define its relationships in this new context, although plenty of people in Westminster would rather resume the old debate or pretend there is no debate to be had \u2013 that campaign rhetoric from 2019 answers questions unasked before 2020.</p> <p>The thing called \u201cEurope\u201d that has dominated British politics in recent years is a creature of the Eurosceptic imagination, with only cartoon resemblance to the real EU, animated by exaggeration of powers held in Brussels and paranoia about the way they are wielded.</p> <p>Now that the nation faces a truly frightening menace it should be obvious that EU membership never belonged in that category. The downsides <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/23/10-best-euro-myths-from-custard-creams-to-condoms\">were too banal</a> to justify the bellicose frenzy against it. The reasons people gave for separation have not gone away, but it gets harder to mould that cause as the stuff of national glory. Escaping continental regulations for processed fish is not in the same bracket as <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/03/jacob-rees-mogg-compares-brexit-battles-agincourt-waterloo-trafalgar/\">Agincourt</a> and Dunkirk.</p> <p>Eurosceptics will claim vindication if coronavirus plunges the EU into an existential crisis, but history might also judge them harshly. They waged a generation-long battle against imaginary threats, claiming victory on the eve of meeting a real one. Coronavirus has not just bumped Brexit down the political agenda, it makes the whole project look parochial and self-indulgent. Britain\u2019s EU membership expired on 31 January, but the doctrine that cast Europe as a national affliction should be buried alongside it.</p> <p>\u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</p>",

  "<p>On Sunday the federal government strongly recommended that people over 70 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/coronavirus-two-person-rule-what-we-know-about-australias-new-social-distancing-measure\">should go into self-isolation</a> \u2013 meaning they should avoid contact with anyone outside their home, and should leave the home only if absolutely necessary.</p> <p>For older Australians, many of whom are not used to ordering groceries or pharmaceuticals online, this presents logistical challenges.</p> <p>Additional funding for My Aged Care and telehealth, a partnership with Australia Post for pharmaceutical delivery services, and private enterprise services such as Woolworths and Coles\u2019 priority delivery for seniors are rapidly mobilising to help, as are charitable organisations such as the Red Cross and Meals on Wheels.</p> <p>But the situation is a moving target, and many of these systems are new so older Australians seeking help may face delays.</p> <p>\u201cI think the reality is at the moment, people will have to expect that they might have to spend time on the phone for a whole variety of reasons,\u201d says Ian Yates, the chief executive of Council of the Ageing Australia, \u201cbut it may well be worth it.\u201d</p> <p>To access many of the new and existing services you may need your Medicare card, pensioner concession card, seniors card or My Aged Care card, so it is best to have one or more of these cards to hand before you get on the phone.</p> <h2>How can I get groceries?</h2> <p>Woolworths is offering priority delivery on a limited range of items to seniors and others who have to self-isolate. You will have to <a href=\"https://www.woolworths.com.au/shop/discover/priorityassistance\">apply online</a> to be eligible for priority assistance, and will need your Australian seniors card (all states), companion card (ACT, WA, NSW, Qld, Tas, Vic), senior savers (NSW), MyPost Senior card, My Aged Care card ID, carer cards (Qld, ACT, NSW, WA, Vic, Tas) or Woolworths kindness card (all states).<br><br>Woolworths in NSW, the ACT and Victoria is also offering an $80 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.woolworths.com.au/shop/discover/community/news/basics-box\">basics box</a>\u201d, which contains about a week\u2019s worth of non-perishable food, including snacks, and some other essential items \u2013 with more regions forthcoming. You cannot substitute items in a basics box.</p> <p>Coles has trialed a priority delivery service with a small number of customers, and have announced <a href=\"https://shop.coles.com.au/a/alexandria/content/priority-service-information\">a further roll-out</a> will be forthcoming. Coles advised Guardian Australia that, when it launches, you may be able to access this service using pensioner concession cards or commonwealth seniors health cards, disability or companion cards, aged care cards, health care cards, or if you have compromised immunity or have been placed into mandatory isolation.</p> <p>It is not possible to apply over the phone for priority delivery services from Woolworths or Coles, and you may experience long waiting times if you require technical assistance with their websites. It is, however, possible to ask a family member or trusted friend to apply online for you.</p> <p>Many smaller and independent grocery stores and vegetable box delivery services operate all over Australia, and some are still offering same-day or next day delivery. If you\u2019re uncertain about a grocery provider, <a href=\"https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/types-of-scams/buying-or-selling/online-shopping-scams\">ScamWatch</a> has detailed information about how to avoid online shopping scams.</p> <p>Meal kit services \u2013 which supply uncooked ingredients and a range of recipes \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://support.hellofresh.com.au/hc/en-us/categories/115001320187-My-Deliveries\">Hello Fresh</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.marleyspoon.com.au/marley-spoon-update-covid-19\">Marley Spoon</a> are also still operating, although Marley Spoon has had some unexpected delays in deliveries.</p> <p>If buying groceries for online delivery is not possible for you, and you cannot ask a friend or neighbour to help, <a href=\"https://www.myagedcare.gov.au/\">My Aged Care</a> \u2013 which can be reached on 1800 200 422 \u2013 should be able to connect you with a relevant local agency or care provider, who already help many older Australians with their shopping.</p> <p>You can also get in touch with your local Meals on Wheels provider, through one of its directories (<a href=\"https://nswmealsonwheels.org.au/Find-Us/Service-Locator/?latitude=-33.860300000000002&amp;longitude=151.20160000000001&amp;distance=10&amp;location=2000\">NSW</a>, <a href=\"https://mealsonwheelswa.org.au/find-us/\">WA</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mealsonwheelssa.org.au/\">SA</a>, <a href=\"http://mowtas.org.au/find-us/\">Tas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mealsonwheelsvictoria.org.au/find-us.htm\">Vic</a>, or through the Red Cross in <a href=\"https://www.redcross.org.au/get-help/community-services/meals\">the ACT</a>). While you will need to register with My Aged Care to use a Meals on Wheels service, Chris Watt, the president of NSW Meals on Wheels and vice president of Meals on Wheels Australia, says that the service is happy to commence deliveries before your paperwork is finalised. Meals on Wheels is experiencing a rise in demand, combined with a decline in volunteers, so there may be delays.</p> <h2>Will my delivered groceries be safe?</h2> <p>Prof Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician and microbiologist at Canberra hospital, says: \u201cBasically we don\u2019t know where the virus could be, and it survives on surfaces. That includes bags etc. But the bottom line here is we need to take care with our hands.\u201d</p> <p>He recommends washing your hands or using alcohol hand rub after handling delivered hot food or groceries. \u201cThat way, if you\u2019ve touched anything and got a bit of virus on your hands, then that should have got rid of it.\u201d</p> <p>Proper hand hygiene \u201cmeans even if we come in contact with the virus, it\u2019s likely to be low level\u201d.</p> <p>Collignon also advises contactless delivery \u2013 where you ask the delivery person to leave the packages at your door \u2013 \u201cparticularly if you\u2019re over the age of 70\u201d. \u201cBefore you touch your mouth, your nose or your eyes, make sure you decontaminate your hands,\u201d he says. But he says: \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence this is transmitted by food.\u201d</p> <p>Brett Mitchell, a Professor of Nursing at the University of Newcastle, recommends you wash your hands before and after unpacking groceries, as well as when you are preparing food, and after disposing of unnecessary packaging from shopping. He says that \u201ccooking food using usual processes will be enough to kill viruses.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFresh fruit and vegetables, can be eaten raw, after thorough rinsing in running water\u201d he continues, no is soap needed. \u201cThis should be enough to minimise risk \u2013 provided you are also practicing good hand hygiene.:</p> <h2>How can I get prescriptions?</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2020/03/covid-19-national-health-plan-home-medicines-services-information-for-consumers.pdf\">home medicines service</a> provides a free, contactless monthly delivery of prescription medication for older and vulnerable Australians. You can also get other pharmaceutical goods delivered if they are ordered at the same time as prescriptions for PBS and RPBS medicines.</p> <p>This service is provided through Australia Post, but you must access it through your local pharmacist. The health department advises anyone wishing to use the service should speak directly to their pharmacist for information about delivery times and the availability of other goods.</p> <p>If you are unable to reach your regular pharmacist, Yates recommends calling My Aged Care. While they cannot directly arrange these services for you, they can connect you to the Commonwealth Home Support Programme\u2019s aged care providers in your area. Once you have an aged care provider or agency supporting you, they may be able to assist with issues like picking up scripts.</p> <h2>How can I get medical assistance?</h2> <p>All Australians now have access to bulk-billed <a href=\"https://www.pm.gov.au/media/11-billion-support-more-mental-health-medicare-and-domestic-violence-services-0\">telehealth services</a> \u2013 meaning consultations over the phone, or via video chat \u2013 for their medical concerns.</p> <p>During a telehealth consultation, a doctor will be able to write prescriptions, which can either be sent directly to your pharmacy via mail, fax or email, or sent to you.</p> <p>To arrange a telehealth consultation, make sure you have your Medicare card on hand, and call your practice just as you would to arrange an ordinary appointment. Your practice will be able to guide you through the system it will be using.</p> <p>If you have trouble finding a telehealth provider, you should call My Aged Care. Not all medical issues can be addressed through telehealth but you should determine whether you need a face-to-face appointment in consultation with your GP. In an emergency, dial 000.</p> <h2>What about my mental health?</h2> <p>There has been <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/news/covid-19-supporting-senior-australians-and-those-who-care-for-them\">additional funding</a> allocated to the commonwealth home support program and My Aged Care. You can find out how to access these support services by contacting <a href=\"https://www.myagedcare.gov.au/\">My Aged Care</a>. If you already have a home care package, there may be <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2020/03/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-older-australians_4.pdf\">some changes</a> to the way your services are provided, which you can find out about by contacting your agency or provider.</p> <p>If you need someone to talk to, the Red Cross is ramping up its <a href=\"https://www.redcross.org.au/get-help/community-services/telecross\">Telecross</a> calling service \u2013 where a volunteer will call to check in on you every day. You can apply online <a href=\"https://www.redcross.org.au/get-help/community-services/telecross\">here</a> or call 1300 885 698 to see if you are eligible. Make sure to have a seniors card, Medicare card or concession card on hand. You can also make a free call to <a href=\"https://www.lifeline.org.au/\">Lifeline</a> 24 hours a day on 13 11 14.</p> <p>Finally Yates says you should not be afraid to draw on your community for help: \u201cIt\u2019s really helpful if family, friends and neighbours are pitching in. Yes we have a lot of older people who are isolated and don\u2019t have close-by family, but a lot of them do. The family needs to be checking regularly, but so can neighbours. We are hearing stories of a lot of people whose neighbour is going and doing the shopping for them.\u201d</p> <p>He says while no one was fully prepared for a pandemic on the scale of Covid-19, \u201cWe do have that network of services out there.\u201d</p> <p><strong>This feature was amended on April 1 to update information about Coles priority online delivery service.</strong></p>"
