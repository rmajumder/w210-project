One likely casualty of a paired-down budget: an expansion to the state\u2019s health care program for undocumented immigrants over 65. </p> \n  <p>To help close some of the budget gap, the state will draw from $16 m in \u201crainy-day\u201d funds over three years. It will also attempt to negotiate a 10% pay cut with government workers -- cuts that will also impact Newsom and his staff.</p> \n  <p>But throughout the presentation, Newsom implored the federal government to take action, calling for support for the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/12/house-democrats-pelosi-new-3-trillion-coronavirus-relief-plan-251407\">sprawling Heroes Act</a> package, which includes $875 billion for cash for state and local governments</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe federal government, we need you.

After initial blips, which saw police break up crowds in popular areas and a sudden alcohol ban in public places after Parisians celebrated their freedom after eight weeks in lockdown, one rule was relaxed on Wednesday: from now more than 10 people can gather in a private home, but only if its primary use is as a residence.

You may have seen this photo doing the rounds of late. Initially, we had no intention of sharing the photo but now that Matt\u2019s been laughing and talking on the radio about it, I thought I'd tell you how I came to take this photo. We were out for a family swim and we bumped into Matt and his family. It was all very cool - no one else around\u2026just his (and my family) enjoying the freezing cold water and having a laugh! As we were all leaving, he very politely obliged for a photo, leaning in with his @supervalu_irl bag keeping the social distance! . As he confirmed on the radio, he was holding a bag of swim gear and towels - not cans!! Both my husband and I agreed not to share the photo publicly but it got leaked through a family WhatsApp group a few days later and boom! it was then all over social media. We felt awful and really sorry about the whole situation; we wrote an apology letter to him but never got to deliver it. After hearing him on radio today, he obviously sees the funny side and the fact that the photo ultimately turned into one of the feelgood stories of the early summer. . While we never intended that the photo should leak anywhere, we were delighted that so many people \u2013 Matt included \u2013 got so much entertainment from the result. And the result? Irish people were delighted to welcome such a friendly and globally respected actor and activist to live amongst us while enjoying his privacy and one of the few good things that the virus has thrown up \u2013 precious and hassle-free time with his family in a country that respects and cherishes the important things in life. . Also, my daughters Ashleigh &amp; Jessica @cookingwithjessica_ (aged 9 and 11) learnt a very valuable lesson. They now see how something private can so quickly go viral and spin out of control. . Anyhow, all\u2019s well that ends well. . #mattdamon #cookingwithjessica #dalkey #lockdownlife</a></p> \n     <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mummycooks/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Siobhan Berry</a> (@mummycooks) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-05-13T12:10:36+00:00\">May 13, 2020 at 5:10am PDT</time></p>\n    </div>\n   </blockquote> \n   <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-14T08:58:51.217Z\">at 9.58am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebd03728f08a55ecde59b6b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-14T08:41:07.764Z\">9.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>One of <strong>Australia\u2019s</strong> largest brewers is tipping 90,000 kegs of beer down the drain.</p> \n  <p>Lion, which manufactures Tooheys, James Boag, XXXX and other well-known Australian beers, collected the untapped kegs from pubs and clubs in March, after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/23/job-losses-from-australias-coronavirus-shutdown-will-be-devastating\">Australian government declared pubs and restaurants had to shut to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.</a></p> \n  <p>The beer has now passed its shelf life and will be tipped into the wastewater treatment plants at the Tooheys and XXXX breweries, which will produce biogas to offset the breweries\u2019 natural gas use and be used to brew fresh beer.</p> \n  <p>The amount to be emptied is equal to 7.8m pints, 10.5m schooners, 11.8m stubbies, or 1.8 Olympic swimming pools.</p> \n  <p>Calla Wahlquist reports here:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/14/australian-brewers-tip-78m-pints-of-beer-down-the-drain\">Australian brewers tip 7.8m pints of beer down the drain</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebcfae88f08a55ecde59b3c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-14T08:03:54.761Z\">9.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More on the expulsion of the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) team from <strong>Burundi</strong>, days before the country\u2019s presidential election,<strong> </strong>has come from AFP: </p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>The foreign ministry, in a letter to WHO Africa headquarters and seen by AFP, said the UN agency\u2019s representative in Burundi and his three colleagues \u201care declared persona non grata and as such, must leave the territory of Burundi\u201d by Friday.</p> \n   <p>The directive, dated May 12, expels WHO\u2019s top official in Burundi, Doctor Walter Kazadi Mulombo, the country\u2019s coronavirus coordinator Dr Jean Pierre Mulunda Nkata, communicable diseases head Dr Ruhana Mirindi Bisimwa, and a laboratory expert in the testing for Covid-19, Professor Daniel Tarzy. </p> \n   <p>\u201cIt is the whole WHO team responsible for supporting Burundi in its response against COVID-19,\u201d a Burundian official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cThey are expelled and the health minister has totally excluded WHO, accusing it of unacceptable interference in its management of the coronavirus.\u201d</p> \n   <p>The letter does not provide a reason for the decision.

There are 4,348,246 confirmed infections.The true figure is likely to be significantly higher as a result of underreporting or differing definitions of what constitutes a death from coronavirus.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Moscow ascribes over 60% of coronavirus deaths in April to other causes. </strong>The city of Moscow said on Wednesday it had ascribed the deaths of more than 60% of coronavirus patients in April to other causes as it defended what it said was the superior way it counted the number of people killed by the novel virus. At 242,271, Russia has the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world after the United States, but with 2,212 coronavirus deaths, it also has one of the world\u2019s lowest reported mortality rates.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump criticises Fauci\u2019s warnings over reopening. </strong>US President Donald Trump on Wednesday has criticised a warning given by top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci this week about the dangers of reopening the economy too quickly. \u201cTo me it\u2019s not an acceptable answer especially when it comes to schools,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House, noting he was surprised by the response Fauci gave to lawmakers in testimony to the US Senate on Tuesday.</li> \n   <li><strong>Italian doctors find link between Covid-19 and inflammatory disorder. </strong>Doctors in Italy have reported the first clear evidence of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">link between Covid-19 and a rare but serious inflammatory disorder</a> that has required some children to undergo life-saving treatment in intensive care units. The mysterious condition emerged last month when NHS bosses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/nhs-warns-of-rise-in-children-with-new-illness-that-may-be-linked-to-coronavirus\">issued an alert</a> to doctors after hospitals admitted a number of children with a mix of <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/toxic-shock-syndrome/\">toxic shock</a> and symptoms seen in an inflammatory disorder known as Kawasaki disease.</li> \n   <li><strong>China begins testing every resident in Wuhan. </strong>Chinese authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/10-days-battle-wuhan-covid-19-testing-plan\">have plans to test every resident in Wuhan</a>, after a small outbreak was reported this week. The city in Hubei province, where the virus is believed to have originated with the first recorded cases, had reported few daily cases since early March and none since early April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/now-it-starts-again-new-coronavirus-outbreaks-spark-unease-in-china\">until a cluster of six was confirmed at the weekend</a>. There is serious concern over the outbreak in Wuhan, despite the small size. He Qinghua from the bureau of disease prevention and control, told a press conference disease control was generally stable across the nation, but there were still challenges.</li> \n   <li><strong>Hong Kong to test hundreds of families. </strong>Hong Kong authorities are going to screen hundreds of families, local media is reporting, after its 23-day run of no local infections was broken with the diagnosis of Covid-19 in a 66-year-old woman with no recent travel history, and her five-year-old granddaughter.</li> \n   <li><strong>Japan is expected to lift the state of emergency for 39 of 47 prefectures. </strong>Japan is expected to lift the state of emergency for 39 of its 47 prefectures on Thursday, local media reported. The world\u2019s third-largest economy declared a nationwide state of emergency a month ago, urging citizens to reduce person-to-person contact by 80% in an effort to slow the pace of new infections and ease the strain on medical services.</li> \n   <li><strong>Japan suicides decline as lockdown causes shift in stress factors. </strong>Suicide in Japan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/japan-suicides-fall-sharply-as-covid-19-lockdown-causes-shift-in-stress-factors\">fell by 20% in April compared to 2019, the biggest drop in five years</a>, despite fears of the coronavirus pandemic causing increased stress and many prevention helplines either not operating or being short-staffed. People spending more time at home with their families, fewer people commuting to work and the start of the school year being delayed are seen as factors in the fall.</li> \n   <li><strong>New Zealand announces NZ$50bn fund. </strong>Finance minister Grant Robertson has unveiled an unprecedented NZ$50bn fund to save jobs and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/new-zealand-budget-robertson-lays-out-50bn-plan-to-return-jobs-to-pre-covid-19-levels\">reduce unemployment to pre-coronavirus levels within two years</a>. The huge figure, announced alongside the annual Budget on Thursday, equates to about 17% of the nation\u2019s GDP and 17 times more than what a New Zealand government usually allocates to new spending in its budgets. Underscoring the massive challenges facing the economy as it emerges from lockdown, Robertson said the fund was \u201cthe most significant financial commitment in modern history\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Virus may never be eradicated \u2013 WHO. </strong>The coronavirus that causes Covid-19 could become endemic like HIV, the World Health Organization has said, warning against any attempt to predict how long it would keep circulating and calling for a \u201cmassive effort\u201d to counter it. \u201cIt is important to put this on the table: this virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/global-report-who-says-covid-19-may-never-go-and-warns-of-mental-health-crisis\">and this virus may never go away</a>,\u201d said Michael Ryan, the WHO\u2019s emergencies chief.

From this perspective, the best we can hope for from most people under crisis is selfish indifference; at worst, they will swiftly turn to violence. Our worst instincts must be repressed. This becomes a justification for authoritarianism and heavy-handed policing.</p> \n  <p>But studies of historical disasters have shown that this is not how most people actually behave. There are nearly always selfish and destructive people, and they are often in power, because we have created systems that reward that kind of personality and those principles.

There are 4,347,015 confirmed infections.The true fatalities figure is likely to be significantly higher as a result of underreporting or differing definitions of what constitutes a death from coronavirus.</li> \n   <li><strong>Moscow ascribed over 60% of coronavirus deaths in April to other causes</strong>The city of Moscow said on Wednesday it had ascribed the deaths of more than 60% of coronavirus patients in April to other causes as it defended what it said was the superior way it and Russia counted the number of people killed by the novel virus. At 242,271, Russia has the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world after the United States, but with 2,212 coronavirus deaths, Russia also has one of the world\u2019s lowest mortality rates.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump says Fauci\u2019s warning over reopening the economy too soon as \u201cnot an acceptable answer\u201d</strong>US President Donald Trump on Wednesday described as not acceptable a warning given by top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci this week about the dangers of reopening the economy too quickly. \u201cTo me it\u2019s not an acceptable answer especially when it comes to schools,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House, noting he was surprised by the response Fauci gave to lawmakers in testimony to the US Senate on Tuesday.</li> \n   <li><strong>Italian doctors find link between Covid-19 and inflammatory disorder</strong>Doctors in Italy have reported the first clear evidence of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">link between Covid-19 and a rare but serious inflammatory disorder</a> that has required some children to undergo life-saving treatment in intensive care units. The mysterious condition emerged last month when NHS bosses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/nhs-warns-of-rise-in-children-with-new-illness-that-may-be-linked-to-coronavirus\">issued an alert</a> to doctors after hospitals admitted a number of children with a mix of <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/toxic-shock-syndrome/\">toxic shock</a> and symptoms seen in an inflammatory disorder known as Kawasaki disease.</li> \n   <li><strong>China begins testing every resident in Wuhan</strong>Chinese authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/10-days-battle-wuhan-covid-19-testing-plan\">have plans to test every resident in Wuhan</a>, after a small outbreak was reported this week. The city in Hubei province, where the virus is believed to have originated with the first recorded cases, had reported few daily cases since early March and none since early April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/now-it-starts-again-new-coronavirus-outbreaks-spark-unease-in-china\">until a cluster of six was confirmed at the weekend</a>. There is serious concern over the outbreak in Wuhan, despite the small size. He Qinghua from the bureau of disease prevention and control, told a press conference disease control was generally stable across the nation, but there were still challenges.</li> \n   <li><strong>Hong Kong to test hundreds of families</strong>Hong Kong authorities are going to screen hundreds of families, local media is reporting, after its 23-day run of no local infections was broken with the diagnosis of Covid-19 in a 66-year-old woman with no recent travel history, and her five-year-old granddaughter.</li> \n   <li><strong>Japan is expected to lift the state of emergency for 39 of 47 prefectures </strong>Japan is expected to lift the state of emergency for 39 of its 47 prefectures on Thursday, local media reported. The world\u2019s third-largest economy declared a nationwide state of emergency a month ago, urging citizens to reduce person-to-person contact by 80% in an effort to slow the pace of new infections and ease the strain on medical services.</li> \n   <li><strong>Japan suicides fall sharply as Covid-19 lockdown causes shift in stress factors</strong>Suicide in Japan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/japan-suicides-fall-sharply-as-covid-19-lockdown-causes-shift-in-stress-factors\">fell by 20% in April compared to 2019, the biggest drop in five years</a>, despite fears of the coronavirus pandemic causing increased stress and many prevention helplines either not operating or being short-staffed. People spending more time at home with their families, fewer people commuting to work and the start of the school year being delayed are seen as factors in the fall.</li> \n   <li><strong>New Zealand announces NZ$50bn fund</strong>New Zealand\u2019s finance minister Grant Robertson has unveiled an unprecedented NZ$50bn fund to save jobs and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/new-zealand-budget-robertson-lays-out-50bn-plan-to-return-jobs-to-pre-covid-19-levels\">reduce unemployment to pre-coronavirus levels within two years</a>. The huge figure, announced alongside the annual Budget on Thursday, equates to about 17% of the nation\u2019s GDP and 17 times more than what a New Zealand government usually allocates to new spending in its budgets.

The newspaper added that it understands the UK\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care is in negotiations with Roche to buy millions of the kits.</li> \n   <li><strong>Afghanistan reached 5,000 confirmed cases</strong>, as the country\u2019s health ministry warned that easing lockdowns would bring a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d. Out of 619 suspected patients tested in the last 24 hours, 259 came back positive, pushing the total number of infections to 5,226. The death toll reached 132, after five more patients died overnight. The number of recoveries is 648.</li> \n   <li><strong>Sweden announced it would hire up to 10,000 more care workers </strong>to address shortcomings in elderly care exposed by the pandemic. About half of the Sweden\u2019s 3,460 coronavirus-related deaths have been among nursing home residents, and another quarter among those receiving care at home.</li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico said it would reopen parts of economythe economy after 51 days of lockdown</strong>, despite the country reporting its highest number of daily deaths so far. Mexico has confirmed 1,992 new cases and 353 deaths, bringing the total death toll to 3,926 and the total number of cases to 38,324.</li> \n   <li><strong>Hotels and restaurants across Europe have been asked to enforce physical distancing</strong> between guests to allow Europeans to take their annual summer holiday.

Some of the training McMichael lacked included required courses on use of force and firearms.</p> <p>The personnel records, which have been reported <a href=\"https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2020/05/14/retired-da-investigator-accused-in-arberys-death-missed-critically-important-training/\">by local media</a>, come to light as McMichael faces murder charges for chasing down Arbery, who was jogging through a residential neighborhood. McMichael and his son Travis claimed they believed Arbery looked like a suspect in a string of neighborhood break-ins.</p> <p>The records also shed light on McMichael\u2019s close relationship with Jackie Johnson, the district attorney for the Brunswick judicial circuit, who recused herself from the case and is now subject to a state investigation of how the case was handled.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"09f682d11a3c466340be6e236ee1c146eedc7ff5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09f682d11a3c466340be6e236ee1c146eedc7ff5/0_43_1029_1286/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ahmaud Arbery was shot and killed in Brunswick, Georgia, on 23 February.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ahmaud Arbery was shot and killed in Brunswick, Georgia, on 23 February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The pair were eventually charged after state investigators were brought on to the case following the emergence of video showing Arbery\u2019s death.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s office declined to comment.</p> <p>\u201cWe are confident that any investigation will ultimately show that our office acted appropriately under the circumstances,\u201d her office said in a statement. \u201cThere is a public misconception about this case due to false allegations against our office by those with an agenda.\u201d</p> <p>In Georgia, law enforcement officers are required to complete <a href=\"https://www.gapost.org/waiver_information.html\">20 hours</a> of training each year, including certain<a href=\"https://www.gapost.org/pdf_file/20_hour_update_2016.pdf\"> mandated courses</a>, to maintain their power of arrest \u2013 a critical authorization that gives officers legal authority to do essential law enforcement functions.</p> <p>\u201cWithout those powers of arrest, you have no further or no additional power than any other citizen has,\u201d said Mike Ayers, the executive director of the Georgia Peace Officers Standards and Training council (Post), which oversees the certification.</p> <p>But McMichael didn\u2019t alert his supervisors to the deficiency until 2014, according to the records. The problem was so severe, Post considered suspending him indefinitely. He was stripped of his gun and departmental vehicle while he applied to the state for a waiver.</p> <p>In an April 2014 memo to Johnson, Mark Melton, another investigator in her office, warned that because McMichael lost his power of arrest \u201cany improper actions by Greg would fall on Greg, the district attorney\u2019s office, and you personally.\u201d</p> <p>McMichael ultimately had his certification restored. But Johnson, the district attorney, wrote to the agency responsible for overseeing the certification process that the episode was \u201ca great embarrassment to me and Investigator McMichael\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt has negatively impacted my office and I have taken measures to ensure that this doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d Johnson added, stating she was grateful that the state\u2019s law enforcement standards and training [Post] director had reinstated the license after she met him in person to lobby on McMichael\u2019s behalf.</p> <p>In February 2019, months before he retired, McMichael again lost his certification from Post for failing to complete the required training in 2018. Weeks later, his supervisors reassigned him to work as a staff liaison in the Camden county district attorney\u2019s office and noted that he would \u201cnot engage in any activity that would be construed as being law enforcement in nature\u201d. His supervisors noted he would not carry a badge or firearm in his new role.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3924974f6ba1e93907675ca4a3397413b55ada7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3924974f6ba1e93907675ca4a3397413b55ada7f/0_167_6192_3715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators protest the shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery at the Glynn county courthouse on 8 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators protest the shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery at the Glynn county courthouse on 8 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Rayford/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The records highlight the multiple medical and personal issues that McMichael cited for missing various training programs. In a letter authored by McMichael to explain his absences between 2005 and 2010 and request a training exemption, he states that in 2006, following a heart attack, he experienced clinical depression.</p> <p>\u201cThe depression made me unable at times to focus on important tasks \u2026 I immediately sought treatment, which continues to this day,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>He writes that in 2009 he and his wife filed for bankruptcy and later that year he experienced a second heart attack: \u201cI believe that this heart attack was brought on in large part by the stress that I was experiencing both at home and at work.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/09/ahmaud-arbery-father-marcus-georgia-running\">'They lynched him': Ahmaud Arbery's father on the killing of his son</a> </p> </aside>  <p>McMichael\u2019s personnel file, which stretches back to the year he was employed by the Brunswick district attorney\u2019s office, also gives insights into his general performance as an employee and other training he received on the job.</p> <p>For example, the records indicate McMichael completed only one training course in the use of de-escalation tactics, but completed four courses devoted to \u201cunderstanding Islamist terrorism\u201d and another on \u201cintroduction to terrorism\u201d.</p> <p>His annual reviews from superiors present a mixed track record and his overall performance is never rated above \u201cgood\u201d.

Other suits from businesses challenging stay-at-home orders in other states have been largely unsuccessful, so far.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/13/wisconsin-supreme-court-stay-at-home-order\">Wisconsin supreme court strikes down governor's stay-at-home order</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The decision was the latest in a nasty partisan battle in Wisconsin between Republicans and Democrats that has shaped the last decade. The state is narrowly divided politically and seen as a crucial state to win for both campaigns in the November presidential <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">election</a>.</p> <p>The case also shows the extreme significance of state supreme court races, long overlooked, in shaping state policy. Justice Daniel Kelly, a conservative on the court, <a href=\"https://projects.jsonline.com/topics/election/2020/4/13/wisconsin-spring-election-results-april-7.html\">lost his seat</a> to Jill Karofsky, a liberal challenger, last month. Kelly, who is set to leave the court this summer, cast the deciding vote in the Wednesday ruling.</p> <p>In Wisconsin, conservatives hold a 5-2 majority on the state supreme court, and all but one of the conservative justices voted to strike down the order on Wednesday, saying Tony Evers, the Democratic governor, didn\u2019t follow proper procedure when he issued the order. Some businesses immediately opened after the ruling and some bars were<a href=\"https://www.wgmd.com/wisconsin-bars-flooded-with-patrons-hours-after-state-supreme-court-strikes-down-coronavirus-stay-at-home-order/\"> flooded</a> with patrons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"583760fc84822f618b735e68a77327cb83e5b18b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/583760fc84822f618b735e68a77327cb83e5b18b/0_130_4607_2765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dairyland Brew Pub opens following the Wisconsin supreme court\u2019s decision to strike down Tony Evers\u2019 safer-at-home order amid the coronavirus pandemic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dairyland Brew Pub opens following the Wisconsin supreme court\u2019s decision to strike down Tony Evers\u2019 safer-at-home order amid the coronavirus pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William Glasheen/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cRepublican legislators have convinced four justices to throw our state into chaos,\u201d Evers said in a statement.</p> <p>In a remarkable passage in a concurring opinion, Justice Rebecca Bradley drew comparisons between the case and <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/323/214\">Korematsu v</a><a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/323/214\"> United States</a>, the 1946 US supreme court decision allowing the internment of Japanese-Americans during the second world war. She cited the case \u201cto remind the state that urging courts to approve the exercise of extraordinary power during times of emergency may lead to extraordinary abuses of its citizens\u201d.</p> <p>Since 2012, Republicans have held significant majorities in both chambers of the state legislature, in large part because they drew boundaries for districts at the beginning of the decade that gave them a severe political advantage. They have maintained that advantage even though the state is extremely competitive politically \u2013 Trump narrowly won the state in 2016, but Evers and other Democrats swept statewide races in 2018.</p> <p>Republicans have been trying to strip Evers of power even before he took office. During a 2018 lame duck session, Republicans quickly passed laws that stripped Evers and the state\u2019s incoming attorney general of some of their power. The move was ultimately upheld by the state supreme court in a <a href=\"https://madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/wisconsin-supreme-court-ruling-upholds-lame-duck-laws/article_3ca70585-a462-5faa-97c7-37b1e25543b9.html\">4-3 vote</a> along partisan lines.</p> <p>The state supreme court also voted along partisan lines last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/06/wisconsin-primary-election-in-person-voting-coronavirus\">to override</a> a last-minute order from Evers to cancel in-person voting for the state\u2019s 7 April election. The decision was widely seen as a partisan effort to boost Kelly, who was on the ballot, but he wound up losing handily to Karofsky.</p> <p>The state supreme court is also expected in the near future to take up a closely watched case deciding whether Wisconsin election officials need to remove more than 200,000 people from the voter rolls ahead of the November election \u2013 a decision that could have huge political consequences in the state.</p> <p>Justice Rebecca Dallet, a liberal on the court, wrote in a dissenting opinion on Wednesday that the supreme court had done \u201cthe legislature\u2019s bidding\u201d in striking down the measure.</p> <p>\u201cThis decision will undoubtedly go down as one of the most blatant examples of judicial activism in this court\u2019s history,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd it will be Wisconsinites who pay the price.</p> <p>\u201cA majority of this court falls hook, line and sinker for the legislature\u2019s tactic to rewrite a duly enacted statute through litigation rather than legislation.\u201d</p>",

He says he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about reaching a deal with TfL (Transport for London) and the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, who has said he will have to cut services unless he gets more funding. Shapps said he was confident that the trains and buses in the capital would continue to run. But, asked if he expected fares to have to go up, he signalled that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/tfl-fares-to-stay-frozen-for-fourth-year-running-sadiq-khan-confirms-a4289311.html\">the four-year fare freeze that Khan has implemented since he became mayor in 2016 </a>would have to end. Shapps said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On higher fares, it is very important in providing a rescue package for TfL that the London mayor can work with, that we don\u2019t end up in a situation where the people from outside the capital are unfairly carrying the burden. By which I mean - sadly I do have to do them each year - fares do end up having to rise by inflation, otherwise everyone knows there\u2019s less money going into the system.</p> \n   <p>And if you have consistent fare freezes it means that more money isn\u2019t going into the system. You can\u2019t then have an unfair settlement where other British taxpayers are effectively bailing out the system, albeit that the system in this case is in trouble because, clearly, of coronavirus. So there is the right balance to be made. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Shapps claimed the \u201cvast majority\u201d of care homes had not had any coronavirus infections.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In the vast majority of care homes, Covid-19 hasn\u2019t been reported at all.

The bespoke coronavirus packages interact with the pre-existing benefit system in each country. Here, the UK stands out by offering a relatively low level of income support to employees without children who become unemployed. This is especially true compared with other European countries, whose insurance-based systems already provided a much greater level of insurance before any bespoke coronavirus schemes were implemented ...</p> \n   <p>[Taking the higher costing] the UK package represents 5.9% of national income or \u00a3123bn, comprising \u00a3118bn of spending increases and \u00a35bn of tax cuts.

Boris Johnson chaired cabinet this morning, and ministers were given an update on coronavirus, from Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser and Sir Patrick Vallance, its chief scientific adviser, and an update on Brexit from David Frost, the PM\u2019s chief Europe adviser. Surprisingly, you might think, we got a read-out on the Brexit discussion, but not on the coronavirus discussion.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Downing Street restated its claim that the EU is making unreasonable demands of the UK in the post-Brexit trade talks.</strong> David Frost, the PM\u2019s Europe adviser, gave the cabinet an update on the talks, the spokesman said. The spokesman went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>David reiterated that we weren\u2019t asking for anything special, bespoke or unique from the European Union. We\u2019re looking for a free trade agreement based on precedent similar to those the EU has already got with other countries like Canada. He said, however, that the EU had asked far more from the UK than they have from other sovereign countries with whom they have reached free trade agreements. For instance, they have asked for the same access to our waters as they did when we were still in the EU, for the UK to stay bound to their laws and rules .... Cabinet agreed that we won\u2019t agree to demands to give up our rights as an independent state, especially when the EU has shown through their agreements with other countries like Canada that these controls are not necessary. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Downing Street conceded that there will be checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland from next year.</strong> This is a requirement under the EU withdrawal agreement, but until recently the government had been reluctant to confirm publicly that the checks will take place. But yesterday Northern Ireland assembly members were told that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/13/brexit-will-mean-checks-on-goods-crossing-irish-sea-government-admits\">the UK government had agreed to the need for \u201cphysical posts at ports of entry\u201d in Northern Ireland under the deal</a>, and this afternoon the spokesman confirmed that this was the case. The spokesman said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There will be requirements for live animals and agrifood, building on what already happens at ports like Larne and Belfast, where checks already take place. Beyond the limited changes introduced by the protocol, there will be no changes to GB/NI trade. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>(The final line of that is a masterpiece of spin: \u201capart from the changes, there will be no changes.\u201d) The spokesman said that Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, had already made this clear to a committee last week. And Gove said it was possible to have \u201clight-touch checks which will ensure all requirements can be met\u201d, the spokesman said. </p> \n  <p>When it was put to the spokesman that this seemed to contradict what Johnson told business leaders in Northern Ireland during the general election, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/08/boris-johnson-goods-from-northern-ireland-to-gb-wont-be-checked-brexit\">when he said anyone asked to fill in new forms under the terms of his Brexit deal should just throw them in the bin</a>, the spokesman said the government was committed to ensuring the new procedures were \u201cstreamlined and efficient\u201d. (Johnson\u2019s comment came in response to a question about exports from Northern Ireland to Britain, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/13/brexit-will-mean-checks-on-goods-crossing-irish-sea-government-admits\">even trade going in that direction will be subject to new requirements under the Brexit deal.)</a><br></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the government was at \u201can advanced stage\u201d in talks about a bailout for Transport for London.</strong> Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has said TfL will have to reduce services if it does not receive further funding by the end of today. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/14/uk-coronavirus-live-antibody-test-approved-for-use-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ebd31e98f080c727453accd#block-5ebd31e98f080c727453accd\"> 1.05pm.)</a> The spokesman said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is a commercial discussion. We remain in close contact with the mayor and TfL to look at how we can support them.</p> \n   <p>Our priority is on reaching an agreement which keeps critical services running for those passengers who must use public transport to get work, ensuring we keep London moving safely.</p> \n   <p>That means protecting key routes, rapidly increasing the number of services available and protecting the interests of taxpayers in the long term.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman confirmed that Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, has had coronavirus - without the public being told.</strong> Sedwill, who is also national security adviser, is the most powerful civil servant in Britain. He was ill around the time the PM was ill. But Sedwill continued working, the spokesman said. When it was put to him that journalists had been misled, because they weren\u2019t told at the time that Sedwill was ill despite questions being asked at lobby, the spokesman said that he personally only became aware recently that Sedwill had been ill and that Sedwill had continued to work over that period. This is from Sky\u2019s <strong>Sam Coates.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SamCoatesSky/status/1260913102255730694\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Mark Sedwill did have Coronavirus roughly at the same time as the PM.<br><br>Number 10 failed to come clean on this in those critical moments.

Or when they have someone who has tested positive, they know to use that... if they are accepting a discharge back to the care home, they know to put in place those isolation rules and those isolation procedures.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Earlier, the former health secretary<strong> Jeremy Hunt </strong>told the programme that it was \u201cpretty clear now\u201d that community testing should not have been abandoned on 12 March. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important not to finger point at the individuals, and I think the government is getting excellent scientific advice,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cBut actually, to ask why it is that Sage, the government\u2019s scientific advisory committee, didn\u2019t model the South Korean test, track and trace approach that we are now adopting right at the beginning?</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe government was given two very extreme options, the sort of extreme lockdown we\u2019re just coming out of, or kind of mitigated herd immunity.

It\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/simon-murphy\">Simon Murphy</a></strong> here kicking off the UK live blog coverage today. It emerged last night that an antibody test which can determine whether someone has had Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/public-health-england-approves-roche-test-for-coronavirus-antibodies\">has been approved by Public Health England</a>. </p> \n  <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong> has previously described antibody testing as a \u201cgame-changer\u201d as it can help determine how much of the population has been infected, raising the prospect those who have had the disease may be immune. However, whether a person who has overcome Covid-19 is immune and if so, how long that immunity lasts, are still very open questions.</p> \n  <p>The test, made by the Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche, detects whether antibodies are present in someone\u2019s blood. Prof John Newton, national coordinator of the UK coronavirus testing programme, told the Daily Telegraph that experts at PHE\u2019s Porton Down labs had evaluated the test and confirmed the 100% accuracy. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThis is a very positive development, because such a highly specific antibody test is a very reliable marker of past infection,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This in turn may indicate some immunity to future infection, although the extent to which the presence of antibodies indicates immunity remains unclear.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Later this morning at 9.30am MPs on the <strong>Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy</strong> select committee will look into the impact of the pandemic on businesses and workers. It comes days after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/manual-workers-likelier-to-die-from-covid-19-than-professionals\">official figures showed </a>that people in low-paid, manual jobs face a much greater risk of dying from coronavirus than higher-paid, white-collar workers. </p> \n  <p>At 11am cabinet will meet to discuss the ongoing pandemic. This afternoon at 2pm, the <strong>Office for National Statistics</strong> is expected to give the clearest picture yet of how many people in England have currently got Covid-19 when it releases the results of its infection survey. <strong>The Health and Social Care Committee</strong> will hold an evidence session on delivering core NHS services at 2.30pm.

  "<p>Stock market investors spent most of 2019 obsessing over the state of trade <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/01/global-markets-donald-trump-us-china-trade-war-coronavirus-covid-19\">relations between the US and China</a>. Now they can return to the subject in 2020. As the US presidential election approaches, Trump\u2019s anti-China stance on Covid is intensifying and this week produced a highly unusual piece of policy-making in Washington.</p> <p>The extraordinary episode was the order, more or less, from the US administration that a $600bn US federal pension fund should drop a long-planned investment in Chinese shares. Strictly speaking, the intended investment by the Thrift Savings Plan was merely a re-allocation of a portion of its portfolio into a global share index that includes China. But it was enough to enrage the White House.</p> <p>Investing in Chinese companies exposed the fund to the \u201cpossibility that future sanctions will result from the culpable actions of the Chinese government with respect to the global spread of the Covid-19 pandemic\u201d, said its blistering letter.</p> <p>Trump appeared to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/china-communist-party-coronavirus-us-trump\">threaten further action</a> in the same vein on Thursday by saying he would be \u201clooking at\u201d Chinese companies listed on US stock markets that do not follow US accounting rules. What does that mean? Forced de-listings? For good measure, he wondered what would happen if US just \u201ccut off the whole relationship with China\u201d.</p> <p>If a fresh front in the financial war with Beijing has been opened, what\u2019s next? Imposition of the sanctions threatened in the Thrift letter? A campaign to encourage patriotic Americans to rid their own pension plans of exposure China? Rip up phase one of the trade deal that was signed with Beijing in January?</p> <p>Any of the above would risk further turmoil in stock markets, which is probably not what Trump would prefer going into the polls. On the other hand, the real economy matters more and Trump seems resigned to the idea that recovery won\u2019t start in the US until the fourth quarter of this year, which may be too late for his electoral ambitions. More protectionist measures could become a serious campaigning option.</p> <p>For investors, it\u2019s yet another factor to consider amid the economic fallout from the pandemic. US-China relations have been merely a background theme this week to the appalling economic news. That could quickly change.</p> <h2>Once you\u2019re in, you\u2019re committed</h2> <p>The Takeover Panel is one of the faster-moving City watchdogs, so we should expect a ruling soon in a small but intriguing case: should the bidders for Moss Bros be allowed to drop their \u00a322.6m offer?</p> <p>If it were to happen, it would be a historic concession because the bidding principle is usually strict: once you\u2019re in, you\u2019re committed.</p> <p>One can understand, of course, why the bidder wants to invoke the \u201cmaterial adverse change\u201d, or MAC, clause, and wriggle out. The outfit called Brigadier \u2013 essentially a vehicle for a few wealthy investors \u2013 makes two main arguments. First, that Moss Bros\u2019s prospects have been damaged. Second, that the damage goes beyond what could have been imagined when the bid was launched on 12 March.</p> <p>The first point definitely seems correct. Moss Bros\u2019s shops are closed and physical distancing rules will be a killer for the summer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/uk-watchdog-vows-to-get-tough-with-uk-firms-over-stalled-refunds\">wedding season</a>, one big driver of demand for dress gear. Even Royal Ascot, though it\u2019s likely to happen next month, won\u2019t be open to punters in costumes.</p> <p>The effects of social distancing could also last for ages, Brigadier can argue, making the pandemic different from the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US in 2001, the last time a bidder tried to invoke a MAC clause. In that instance, the Panel forced WPP to follow through with its offer for advertising agency Tempus.</p> <p>But Brigadier is surely on very weak ground in pleading that it was all unimaginable. One passage in the WPP/Tempus ruling still seems crucial: a bidder must show that exceptional circumstances \u201ccould not have reasonably been foreseen at the time of the announcement of the offer\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s true that the UK authorities were woefully relaxed about Covid on 12 March \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/02/wrong-to-play-liverpool-v-atletico-says-citys-public-health-director-matthew-ashton\">Liverpool played Atletico Madrid</a> at Anfield the night before. But, come on, it was within the range of reasonable possibilities that the pandemic could rapidly get worse.</p> <p>Brigadier was free to await developments before bidding, but chose not to. Common sense says it should be held to its offer.</p>",

He added: \u201cWithout clear planning and implementation of the steps that I and other experts have outlined, 2020 will be darkest winter in modern history.\u201d</p> \n<p>The warning came as Covid-19 deaths continued to mount in the US, with more than 83,000 people perishing from the virus, which has infected more than 1.3 million to make the US the world\u2019s most serious coronavirus hotspot.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/14/unemployment-us-data-coronavirus\">Mass joblessness</a> has swept the US as businesses shut down to slow the pandemic, with 36 million people filing for unemployment benefits in the past two months.</p> \n<p>This death toll would probably be much lower had the Trump administration acted far more quickly to address the crisis, Bright told the hearing.

  "<p>The UK\u2019s largest pubs group has agreed to help tenants pay rents following widespread criticism that the industry is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/10/we-wont-survive-the-coronavirus-lockdown-without-rent-relief-publicans-say\">leaving publicans in the lurch</a> during the Covid-19 lockdown.</p> <p>Ei Group \u2013 formerly known as Enterprise Inns \u2013 has said that any of its more than 4,000 pubs that are not receiving government grants will get a three-month \u201crent credit\u201d, amounting to a discount on future payments.</p> <p>Those receiving grants of \u00a310,000 or \u00a325,000 will be given credit on future stock purchase, to the value of either 50% or 75% of the value of rents for the period.</p> <p>A group of 60 MPs had earlier urged Ei Group to give publicans a rent-free period to keep them afloat, as the industry wrestles with a crisis that threatens to put thousands of pubs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/20/thousands-uk-pubs-go-under-without-bailout-industry-warns-coronavirus-lockdown\">out of business</a>.</p> <p>MPs from both sides of the House of Commons had singled out the company for particular criticism, saying they were \u201cdismayed\u201d it had agreed only to defer rents rather than offering a rent holiday.</p> <p>\u201cThis will put many tenants deep in debt, making it financially more difficult for them to reopen,\u201d the MPs said in a letter to the company.</p> <p>The Guardian understands that Ei Group was working on the rent credit proposal when it received the letter.</p> <p>Greg Mulholland, chair of the British Pub Confederation, said Ei\u2019s proposal was a \u201cclever ruse\u201d that still meant charging rent on closed pubs.</p> <p>He added that credit on future stock purchases was an easy sacrifice for Ei to make given that pubcos typically charge huge markups on the beer they sell tenants.</p> <p>Ei\u2019s offer followed an outcry from publicans at being charged rent during the lockdown, with the groundswell of anger prompting two warnings from the government\u2019s Pubs Code Adjudicator (PCA) to companies who it said should do more to help tenants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The PCA oversees the relationship between large pub companies and tenants subject to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/31/tied-up-pub-landlords-battle-law-that-was-meant-to-help-them\">controversial \u201cbeer tie\u201d</a>, under which they buy their beer from the company in exchange \u2013 supposedly \u2013 for lower rents.</p> <p>Of the UK\u2019s \u201cbig six\u201d pub companies, only Admiral Taverns had already agreed to a rent-free period for tied tenants.</p> <p>Some other rivals have said they will agree reductions on a case-by-case basis with individual pubs.</p>",
  "<p>How much will this pandemic cost us? And how will we pay? The mounting cost of Britain\u2019s coronavirus response is astounding. The furlough scheme alone could cost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/12/uk-furlough-scheme-extended-rishi-sunak-coronavirus\" title=\"\">an estimated \u00a380bn</a>; overall, the package will result in a deficit of nearly \u00a3300bn in the current financial year, up from \u00a355bn in March\u2019s budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/14/uk-budget-deficit-to-rise-to-300bn-this-year-obr-says\" title=\"\">forecast</a> on Thursday.</p> <p>Yet Britain looks entirely unremarkable in the global context; in fact, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says the response of other G7 nations has <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14845\" title=\"\">typically been larger</a>. The International Monetary Fund <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f9932d4-5bf0-425d-b536-135d834ad20c\" title=\"\">expects</a> average debt-to-GDP ratios to be above 120% in advanced economies next year, above the levels seen in the 2008/9 financial crisis, as support packages and plummeting tax income take their toll.</p> <p>Britain is being sensible, not spendthrift. In the short term, the Bank of England is footing the bill; in the medium term, unlike some nations, it is trusted to pay its debts. What happens in the longer term? The former chancellor George Osborne had already <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-20/architect-of-u-k-austerity-says-retrenchment-needed-post-crisis\" title=\"\">predicted</a> that coronavirus spending would prompt the government to turn the page back to his austerity strategy. This week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/13/treasury-tax-hikes-pay-freezes-covid-19-costs-budget-deficit-spending\" title=\"\">leaked Treasury report</a> on options for funding the package \u2013 including a two-year public sector wage freeze \u2013 has raised suspicion of future cuts and invigorated debt hawks.</p> <p>Such an approach would be disastrous. Austerity choked off growth following the financial crisis, delaying and weakening the recovery. And its true costs went deeper. Punitive cuts reduced the capacity of the NHS and social care to cope with shocks, and even the stockpiles of PPE. It damaged public health and increased inequality, leaving communities more vulnerable.</p> <p>The spectre of a renewed round might well prompt voters who lent Boris Johnson their votes to snatch them back, as the prime minister surely knows. Last year\u2019s election and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/11/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnsons-budget-we-are-all-keynesians-now\" title=\"\">this spring\u2019s budget</a> demonstrated that the government understood the mood had changed: the public had lost its tolerance for more state-shrinking. Electors didn\u2019t put their weight behind Mr Johnson so that he could hammer public services. That shift has surely been intensified by the current crisis. A pay freeze for essential workers sounds obscene at this of all times. Commerzbank warned that additional fiscal austerity would make matters worse for the British economy. Jim O\u2019Neill, a junior Treasury minister under Mr Osborne and former Goldman Sachs chief economist, argued on Thursday that the government should consider converting loans into long-term equity support, which might help it reach structural goals such as a greener economy.</p> <p>But while the terms of public debate have shifted, the Tory right has not, and Mr Johnson may yet need them again. Their familiar argument is that any responsible individual can only spend what they have; and that governments must do likewise. This apparently common-sense observation is in reality entirely misleading. The state is the last remaining pillar of the economy when households and businesses cannot or will not spend. If it too retrenches, there is no way to check the downwards spiral. If it spends, then others are more able and likely to do so. The government\u2019s cash does not crowd out private spending; it encourages it.</p> <p>The most cavalier course of action in this case would be to slash public spending. The most responsible would be to take the opportunity to remodel and create a fairer and more sustainable economy. No one doubts that the appetite exists. But for it to be realised, an argument that appears to have been won will need to be made and made again.</p>",
  "<p>The official documents consisted of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/revealed-uk-scientists-fury-over-attempt-to-censor-covid-19-advice\" title=\"\">line after line of blacked out information</a>. They gave every appearance of top secret cold war papers from which the slightest hint that might be useful to an enemy had been redacted. In reality, though, they were nothing more than part of <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/884013/28-easing-restrictions-on-activity-and-social-distancing-comments-suggestions-spi-b-01042020.pdf\" title=\"\">a report by behavioural scientists</a> on how the British public might respond to Covid-19 lockdown measures. With heavy irony, they were published last week as part of an attempt to be more transparent.</p> <p>The language of war has been too common throughout the Covid-19 crisis, never more than in the mouth of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/mar/17/boris-johnson-invokes-wartime-language-in-fight-against-coronavirus-video\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson</a>, a leader who is happier trading in florid metaphors than in plain facts and practical details. Yet there is a huge difference between a war and the pandemic. In a real war there is a human enemy. In the pandemic there is a viral one. This difference is crucial when it comes to mobilising the public\u2019s support.</p> <p>In a war, the enemy craves vital information. As a result, the national effort must indeed often be kept secret, plans concealed and information controlled. In a fight to preserve the national health, however, openness is all. Transparency is fundamental to good decision-making about an elusive enemy. It is also vital to ensuring national confidence, so that the public cooperates with evidence-based restrictions and sacrifices \u2013 including control over their own data \u2013 that can help bring the viral scourge to an end.</p> <p>British governments have never been at ease with openness, and this continuing unease is now significantly affecting and weakening the national effort, especially as the lockdown is loosened in England. Too much is being subordinated to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/it-will-cost-lives-experts-decry-uk-governments-mixed-covid-19-messaging\" title=\"\">\u201ccomms strategy\u201d</a>. This is not just wrong in principle, but counterproductive in practice. It is wrong because the public has a right to know about the threat and to take highly personal decisions which are laden with risk. And it is counterproductive because it disables ministers from the very task \u2013 gathering information in order to act rationally and effectively to combat the virus \u2013 in which public confidence and cooperation are most essential.</p> <p>But the secrecy persists. It was always ridiculous that the membership of the government\u2019s Sage advisory committee was kept secret. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/coronavirus-whos-who-on-secret-scientific-group-advising-uk-government-sage\" title=\"\">The Guardian\u2019s revelation</a> of the names this month has had no adverse public consequences and at least one positive one, since we now know that Sage members were not asked to approve the new message to England to stay alert. Whitehall has now published <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/04/no-10-facing-fresh-calls-for-transparency-over-sage-pandemic-advice\" title=\"\">an incomplete list</a> of names.</p> <p>Even less defensible is the fact that the government continues to keep most of Sage\u2019s key papers and some of its most recent conclusions secret, despite occasional promises to publish them. The findings of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/revealed-the-secret-report-that-gave-ministers-warning-of-care-home-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">Exercise Cygnus</a> test drill in 2016, which exposed a health sector that could be overwhelmed by a pandemic, have long been suppressed, when they could have made possible a more effective resilience strategy that might have saved lost lives. The documents published last week revealed only that No 10 is politically paranoid about losing hold of the debate.</p> <p>Yet these papers and conclusions are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/23/the-guardian-view-on-following-viral-science-why-did-we-go-it-alone\" title=\"\">\u201cthe science\u201d</a> that the government still claims to be following in its Covid-19 policy. They are documents which ought ideally to provide a gold standard of credibility that ministers are doing the right thing.

  "<p>More than 140 world leaders and experts have called for future <strong>Covid-19 vaccines</strong> to be made available to everyone free of charge, amid growing tensions between drug companies and governments and a boycott of vaccine summits by the US.</p> <p>Vaccines and treatments for the virus should not be patented, say the signatories to an <a href=\"https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2020/may/20200514_covid19-vaccine-open-letter\">open letter</a> published in the run-up to next week\u2019s meeting of the World Health Assembly, the policy-setting body of the UN\u2019s World Health Organization. Instead, scientific breakthroughs must be shared across borders, they urge.</p> <p>The signatories include <strong>South Africa\u2019s</strong> president, Cyril Ramaphosa; <strong>Pakistan\u2019s</strong> prime minister, Imran Khan; and the former <strong>UK</strong> prime minister Gordon Brown. </p> <p>\u201cGovernments and international partners must unite around a global guarantee which ensures that, when a safe and effective vaccine is developed, it is produced rapidly at scale and made available for all people, in all countries, free of charge,\u201d the letter says, adding that poorer countries should not be left at the back of the vaccine queue.</p> <p>The plea came as a French pharmaceutical company stirred outrage by saying any vaccine it discovered would be reserved for Americans in the first instance, and as global confirmed deaths from the virus passed 300,000, <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker</a>.</p> <p>Paul Hudson, the British chief executive officer of <strong>Sanofi</strong>, said any vaccine would go to the US first since it had done the most to fund the company\u2019s research. \u201cThe US government has the right to the largest pre-order because it\u2019s invested in taking the risk,\u201d Hudson told Bloomberg.</p> <p>The European commission and health experts responded furiously, pointing out that Paris-based Sanofi has received tens of millions of euros in the form of research credits from the French state in recent years. </p> <p>The French government described Hudson\u2019s remarks as unacceptable, while the German press pasted the firm as a soulless and disloyal multinational willing to blackmail governments to extract lucrative subsidies.</p> <p>Last week Britain, China, Canada, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Japan, and numerous African countries took part in a <strong>global Covid-19 summit</strong>. The virtual meeting raised more than $8bn for a potential vaccine. The Trump administration refused to send a representative, however, and appears determined to pursue its own unilateral vaccine path.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/14/gordon-brown-coronavirus-must-be-eradicated-in-every-continent\">report published on Thursday</a>, Brown pointed out that a second or third wave of Covid-19 infection could come from poor countries with undeveloped health systems. The solution to the problem was global, he said, adding that the pandemic would end only when the virus was \u201ceradicated in every continent\u201d.</p> <p>As many as 100 forms of vaccine are being tested. The WHO sees seven or so as frontrunners. On Wednesday its emergencies chief, Michael Ryan, said the coronavirus \u201cmay never go away\u201d and could become a regular endemic disease like the flu.</p> <p>The WHO\u2019s director for Europe, Hans Kluge, said vigilance was needed to keep the virus at bay, as well as cooperation between people and politicians. He noted that new virus clusters had emerged in places where Covid-19 had apparently vanished, such as Wuhan in <strong>China</strong>, and <strong>South Korea</strong>.</p> <p><strong>France</strong>\u2019s prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, said the French could take holidays this summer but only in France and French overseas territories. This would be allowed if there were no second wave of coronavirus, he said</p> <p>Philippe promised a decision by 25 May as to whether French restaurants, bars and caf\u00e9s could open on 2 June. The aim would be for premises to reopen in areas designated \u201cgreen\u201d, where the virus is not circulating and hospital intensive care units are not \u201csaturated\u201d with Covid-19 patients. He gave no date for those in \u201cred\u201d areas.</p> <p>The government announced a generous financial rescue plan for France\u2019s tourism industry, which used to welcome 90 million tourists a year. Philippe said tourism was suffering its \u201cgreatest challenge in modern history\u201d.</p> <p>Since Monday, French shops have reopened and some children are back at school. The relaxation of lockdown has caused a few blips, with police breaking up crowds in popular areas. An alcohol ban has been imposed in public places after some Parisians over-celebrated their freedom. On Wednesday another rule was relaxed: more than 10 people can now gather in a private home.</p> <p>In other developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Japan</strong>\u2019s<strong> </strong>prime minister, Shinzo Abe, lifted a state of emergency in large parts of the country, including a majority of prefectures.

When I returned from my trip around Central Europe I isolated myself (in a borrowed apartment away from my mother and sister) since the number of cases of COVID-19 (in Germany for instance) were similar to Italy in the beginning. Around ten days ago I started feeling some symptoms, exactly the same time as my father - who traveled with me from Brussels. I was feeling tired, had shivers, a sore throat and coughed. My dad experienced the same symptoms, but much more intense and with a fever. In Sweden you can not test yourself for COVID-19 unless you\u2019re in need of emergent medical treatment. Everyone feeling ill are told to stay at home and isolate themselves. I have therefore not been tested for COVID-19, but it\u2019s extremely likely that I\u2019ve had it, given the combined symptoms and circumstances. Now I\u2019ve basically recovered, but - AND THIS IS THE BOTTOM LINE: I almost didn\u2019t feel ill. My last cold was much worse than this! Had it not been for someone else having the virus simultainously I might not even have suspected anything. Then I would just have thought I was feeling unusually tired with a bit of a cough. And this it what makes it so much more dangerous. Many (especially young people) might not notice any symptoms at all, or very mild symptoms. Then they don\u2019t know they have the virus and can pass it on to people in risk groups. We who don\u2019t belong to a risk group have an enormous responsibility, our actions can be the difference between life and death for many others. Please keep that in mind, follow the advice from experts and your local authorities and #StayAtHome to slow the spread of the virus. And remember to always take care of each other and help those in need. #COVID #flattenthecurve</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gretathunberg/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Greta Thunberg</a> (@gretathunberg) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-03-24T15:22:26+00:00\">Mar 24, 2020 at 8:22am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Without Thunberg, the panel for \u201cCoronavirus Facts and Fears\u201d \u2013 which includes the CNN broadcasters Dr Sanjay Gupta, 50, and Anderson Cooper, 52; Kathleen Sebelius, 71, the former health secretary; and Richard Besser, 60, the former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director \u2013 has an average age of 58.</p> <p>That makes sense: expertise often takes years to accrue.

It is hard to imagine the same outrage if the journalist Chris Cuomo \u2013 who was recently diagnosed with Covid-19 \u2013 was invited to the town hall. In fairness, Cuomo had proof that he had the coronavirus. But isn\u2019t that kind of the point? Most people who aren\u2019t wealthy or famous simply aren\u2019t able to get tested \u2013 certainly many young people won\u2019t. Medical guidelines also encourage people without severe symptoms not to get tested.</p> <p>Viewed in this light, Thunberg \u2013 a young person who showed symptoms that weren\u2019t bad but decided to stay home anyway \u2013 has one of the most important experiences on the panel.</p>",

The state has recorded the seventh highest number of Covid-19 cases, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, and Wayne county, which holds the city of Detroit, has seen some of the <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/health/2020/03/26/michigan-detroit-coronavirus-testing-covid-19/2914611001/\">US\u2019s highest rates</a> of infection.</p> \n<p>Whitmer has instituted strict emergency orders in an attempt to control the virus\u2019s spread, and while that has led to protests that received national attention, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/many-governors-win-bipartisan-support-for-handling-of-pandemic-but-some-republicans-face-blowback-over-reopening-efforts/2020/05/11/8e98500e-93d2-11ea-9f5e-56d8239bf9ad_story.html\">recent polling</a> shows bipartisan support for her management of the crisis.</p> \n<p>Still, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/michigan-protests-coronavirus-lockdown-armed-capitol\">tensions </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/michigan-protests-coronavirus-lockdown-armed-capitol\">ratcheted up on 30 April</a> when armed militia members glared and shouted at lawmakers from the Senate gallery during an emotional debate over extending Whitmer\u2019s stay-at-home order through the end of May.

State police and the attorney general, Dana Nessel, responded with warnings that those who brandish weapons, obstruct police or did not follow social distancing guidelines would be ticketed or arrested.</p> \n<p>But the protest was largely calm. Some demonstrators wore masks, but few followed social distancing guidelines. Police mostly stayed inside the capitol building or in small groups along the capitol grounds\u2019 perimeter.</p> \n<p>Phil Robinson, a member of the Michigan Liberty Militia, carried an assault rifle and wore full armor. He told reporters that the idea that militia members were there to intimidate was wrong and characterized his group as peacekeepers and \u201claw-abiding citizens\u201d.</p> \n<p>Whitmer\u2019s stay-at-home orders have so far survived legal challenges in federal court. But the Republican-controlled legislature filed a suit that the Michigan supreme court will soon hear. Though conservatives hold a 4-3 majority on the court, it frequently does not rule along party lines.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the Republican congressman Paul Mitchell and well-funded conservative groups have <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/michigan-gop-power-grab_n_5eb4214bc5b646b73d290c4b\">launched</a> a citizen-initiated ballot drive that would exploit a loophole in Michigan\u2019s constitution to allow the GOP-controlled legislature to repeal the 1945 state law that gives governors their emergency powers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"344bdc4b-6f96-4fbb-b794-31be5382176e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TKqymsBdllg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

Welcome to dining out in the age of coronavirus.</p> <p>That\u2019s the experience the Inn at Little Washington, a restaurant in northern Virginia, is planning for diners as they experiment with what dining in could look like amid the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>With the idea that guests may feel lonely eating at a restaurant that can only reach 50% capacity \u2013 the maximum mandated by Virginia\u2019s social distancing regulations \u2013 the restaurant will be placing mannequins throughout its dining rooms.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we needed to solve the problem of social distancing and reducing our restaurant\u2019s occupancy by half, the solution seemed obvious \u2013 fill it with interestingly dressed dummies,\u201d Patrick O\u2019Connell, the star chef who heads the restaurant, <a href=\"https://www.fox5dc.com/news/inn-at-little-washington-to-fill-empty-seats-with-1940s-themed-mannequins\">told</a> a Fox 5 DC, a local news station.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always had a thing for mannequins \u2013 they never complain about anything, and you can have lots of fun dressing them up.\u201d</p> <p>As states experiment with partial reopening measures, restaurants are having to get <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/11/us/coronavirus-restaurants-reopening-creative-trnd/index.html\">creative</a> about ways to encourage social distancing measures without ruining the intimate experience of dining in at a restaurant. Some have installed dividers, like clear shower curtains or plants, to keep distance between guests.</p> <p>Of course, the approach to social distancing the Inn at Little Washington is slightly more unique.</p> <p>A picture the restaurant posted on their Instagram page shows a preview of the mannequins dressed in tuxedos and long dresses, facing each other in presumed conversation, their wine glasses half-full. The restaurant plans on having its staff treat the mannequins as if they were guests, engaging in conversation and occasionally filling their glasses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAGu1ILhB4A/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

  "<p>Off to play tennis or purchase fresh dahlias?

It now includes taking exercise with your household or \u201cone member of another household\u201d.</p> <p>Public open spaces can be visited in similar company to promote \u201cphysical or mental health or emotional wellbeing\u201d. Trips to estate agents and to view properties are now permissible, as are visits to waste or recycling centres, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/gardening-helps-me-to-deal-with-things-englands-garden-centres-reopen-lockdown-coronavirus\">garden centres</a> and outdoor sports courts.</p> <p>Those categories are in addition to the already allowed activities of obtaining food and medical supplies, seeking medical assistance and providing care to a vulnerable person.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/13/golf-tennis-players-return-to-action-after-coronavirus-lockdown\">'It\u2019s a way of life' \u2013 relief and elation as golf and tennis resume across England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is also permitted to attend a funeral of a close family member, move house and keep up any existing arrangements for access between separated parents and children. Travel for the purposes of work where it cannot be carried out from home is also legal, as is the provision of voluntary services.</p> <h2><strong>Have there been disagreements over these rights?</strong></h2> <p>As the pandemic crisis continues there have been an efforts to make government guidance \u2013 as articulated by ministers and public health officials \u2013 align more closely with the underlying law.</p> <p>There is nothing in the English regulations about social distancing. <a href=\"https://www.polfed.org/media/15852/health-protection-regulations-amendments-england-changes-130520.pdf\">Revised police advice</a> issued by the College of Policing and National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council makes that clear: \u201cOfficers should only enforce the Health Protection Regulations \u2013 government guidance is not enforceable, for example two-metre distancing, avoiding public transport or the wearing of face coverings in enclosed spaces.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/wsi/2020/452/contents/made\">amended Welsh regulations </a>do, however, specify that social distancing of two metres must be observed between people from different households. </p> <p>Because they are new, there has been concern that courts, police and prosecutors do not understand the emergency laws. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/12/judge-questions-coronavirus-case-against-homeless-london-man\">Crown Prosecution Service </a>is examining all charges in relation to Covid-19 to ensure there have been no miscarriages of justice.</p> <h2><strong>What punishments can be imposed?</strong></h2> <p>Fines for failure to comply have risen significantly. Fixed penalty notices, which were previously \u00a360, are now \u00a3100 (\u00a350 if paid within 14 days). For subsequent penalty notices, fines can rise to as high as \u00a33,200. Those who do not pay can be taken to court.</p> <p>Anyone who feels they have been fined inappropriately can contest it. Courtroom challenges are likely to see police interpretations of the law questioned.</p> <h2><strong>Is there public consent for these powers?</strong></h2> <p>The amended regulations, made under the executive\u2019s powers to create statutory instruments, have not yet been scrutinised by MPs or peers. The initial version of the regulations were only debated by parliament the day before they were replaced by the current laws.</p> <p>Clare Collier, of the civil rights organisation Liberty, said: \u201cIt\u2019s concerning that now [these powers] have finally received parliamentary oversight, the government elects to replace these powers. It\u2019s a blatant evasion of parliamentary process.</p> <p>\u201cInstead of narrowing those sweeping powers, the government is ramping up fines for falling foul of the lockdown \u2026 This pandemic is a public health crisis \u2013 not a criminal justice issue.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 May 2020 to remove a reference to house moves being allowed \u201cwhere reasonably necessary\u201d, as this is no longer a stipulation. </p>",
  "<p>Regulators are attempting to seize control of a care home on Skye at the centre of a Covid-19 outbreak that has led to seven deaths and dozens of coronavirus cases on the island.</p> <p>The Care Inspectorate, which regulates the industry in Scotland, said it had asked a sheriff to strip the care home\u2019s owners, HC-One, of its licence to operate after finding serious shortcomings in its management.</p> <p>The facility, Home Farm in Portree, Skye\u2019s main town, has been under intense scrutiny after it emerged earlier this month that nearly all its 34 residents and half its staff had contracted Covid-19. Over the last 10 days seven residents have died, with dozens of staff sent home and told to self-isolate.</p> <p>Scottish authorities have been grappling with an escalating crisis in the country\u2019s care homes, with 45% of all Scotland\u2019s 3,213 Covid-19 deaths occurring in them.</p> <p>An inspectorate spokesman said that if HC-One lost its licence, new management could be installed. \u201cAn inspection has identified serious and significant concerns about the quality of care experienced by residents at Home Farm care home in Skye,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe understand this is a difficult and distressing time for residents, their loved ones and staff at the home. However, our first priority is always the health and wellbeing of residents.</p> <p>Kate Forbes, the MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, and the Scottish government\u2019s finance secretary, said she was told on Wednesday that NHS Highlands, the region\u2019s health board, had effectively taken over the running of the premises.</p> <p>\u201cThe serious concerns raised by the Care Inspectorate about HC-One\u2019s management is a matter of grave importance,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cOur oldest and most vulnerable citizens deserve the highest levels of care, and the situation at Home Farm affects everybody in the local Skye community.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for HC-One confirmed it faced losing its licence at Home Farm. \u201cWe have accepted the shortcomings at Home Farm and apologise to our residents, their families, and the local community,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are fully committed to making significant improvements at the home and determined to put things right.

This must be a turning point and the first minister [Nicola Sturgeon] and the health secretary [Jeane Freeman] must ensure that every possible action is taken to save lives within care homes.\u201d</p> <p>Alex Cole-Hamilton, the Scottish Liberal Democrat health spokesman, said the health secretary needed to update parliament on what had happened there. The regulator\u2019s findings were \u201ctruly devastating for worried friends and family of residents\u201d, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere are huge questions to be answered about why serious failings in care have been discovered so late on. We have known about the crisis in this home since late April. The people who live in Home Farm have been terribly let down.\u201d</p> <p>Scottish health secretary Jeane Freeman said that the government\u2019s thoughts were with those affected and that she was \u201cdirectly engaged with developments at the home to ensure we continue to act as necessary for the wellbeing of residents and staff.\u201d</p> <p>Saying that she could not comment on the details of the case while it was before the Sheriff Court, she added: \u201cthe Scottish government strongly supports action to ensure all care homes provide a safe home for their residents and we are actively working to ensure we are doing everything possible to ensure that is the case.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>On his primetime show on Wednesday night, the Fox News host Sean Hannity addressed a federal judge who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/michael-flynn-us-judge-ex-trump-aide-contempt-perjury\">put a hold</a> on a justice department attempt to drop its case against the former Trump aide Michael Flynn.</p> <p>\u201cYou reek of ignorance,\u201d he said. \u201cYou reek of political bias.\u201d</p> <p>Hannity might have been aware of the irony at play. In recent days, the US president\u2019s favourite network has elevated the spurious \u201cObamagate\u201d scandal over all other subjects, most obviously the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/may/10/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">deaths of more than 84,000</a> Americans in a pandemic which the Trump administration has failed to contain.</p> <p>According to research compiled by the Internet Archive, analysed by GDELT and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/11/trump-his-allies-are-much-more-interested-talking-flynn-than-coronavirus/\">released on Wednesday</a>, since last week Fox News and Fox Business have mentioned Flynn, the FBI and Obama far more often than the coronavirus.</p> <p>Nor has such coverage just been pursued by opinion hosts like Hannity, Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson. Hosts of supposedly straight news content have happily followed suit.</p> <p>Critics and other media outlets have been quick to call out the supposed scandal, which the former Obama adviser David Plouffe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidplouffe/status/1260658468106563584\">called</a> a \u201csideshow to distract from the shitshow\u201d.</p> <p>But Trump and his supporters at Fox and in Congress are firing on all cylinders.

Judge Emmet Sullivan responded, asking a former federal judge to look at whether Flynn should face a criminal contempt charge for perjury, given that he had sought to withdraw his guilty plea, saying he had not lied to the FBI after all.</p> <p>On Wednesday night Hannity attacked Judge Sullivan.</p> <p>\u201cSo Judge Sullivan, you and you alone from this day forward are responsible for continuing what has been a travesty of justice that destroyed four years of an American hero\u2019s life, and it\u2019s time for a new venue and a new judge and someone unlike you that doesn\u2019t have political bias,\u201d he raged.</p> <p>\ufeff\u201cObamagate\u201d has shallow roots. Only last Thursday, the US justice department announced its intent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/michael-flynn-criminal-case-trump-russia\">to drop proceedings against Flynn</a>. On Friday, a leaked conversation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/09/obama-leaked-conversation-us-rule-of-law-at-risk-flynn-case-dropped\">showed</a> Obama saying the rule of law was under threat \u2013 and saying he would campaign hard for Biden.</p> <p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/trump-obama-biggest-political-american-history-russia-michael-flynn\">went into Twitter overdrive</a>, retweeting conspiracy-tinged accounts and making his own grandiose statements. He has regularly claimed \u201cObamagate\u201d is bigger than Watergate, the 1970s scandal which brought down Richard Nixon.</p> <p>Fox News and Fox Business swiftly followed his lead.</p> <p>Writing in his Reliable Sources email, the CNN analyst Brian Stelter said: \u201cThat Fox News would push a dishonest disinformation campaign against Trump\u2019s political opponents is reprehensible, but not surprising. The network has been pumping poison into the national conversation for quite some time.</p> <p>\u201cBut that Fox is engaging in such behavior as more than 83,000 Americans lay dead from a virus that has upended American life is particularly repugnant.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement on Thursday, Senator Graham pointed perhaps inadvertently to both Trump and Fox\u2019s real motivation, and the negative effects their behaviour may well have.</p> <p>\u201cBoth presidents,\u201d he said, referring to Trump and Obama, \u201care welcome to come before the [judiciary] committee and share their concerns about each other.</p> <p>\u201cIf nothing else it would make for great television. However, I have great doubts about whether it would be wise for the country.\u201d</p>",

Hopes that economic growth might rally later this year, boosting revenues and profits, are fading.</p> <p><strong>Seema Shah, </strong>chief strategist at<strong> Principal Global Investors, </strong>sums up the problem:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are some sectors which may be facing a prolonged period of weakness. Aviation being perhaps the most obvious example. In recent weeks, several airlines have announced that they do not expect to resume normal operations until 2022 and Boeing, the aviation bell weather, expects it to take five years and anticipates the failure of at least one major airline.</p> <p>Similarly, with retail having to comply with social distancing measures for the foreseeable future, this sector also faces serious challenges. In the UK, an Ipsos Mori survey found that almost 50% of Britons would feel uncomfortable shopping, other than in supermarkets, and the British Independent Retailers Association has forecast that up to 20% of smaller shops may not even reopen once government support schemes begin to fade. Even after lockdowns are lifted, market participants should anticipate a wave of business failures across many sectors and across countries.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the fallout from struggling businesses does not just stop there. Bankruptcies create negative feedback loops, particularly for the labour market.

Police have since said the officers knocked and announced themselves before entering.</p> <p>Lawyers for Taylor\u2019s family and her boyfriend Kenneth Walker, who was with Taylor that night, say they did not. Walker said he thought he was witnessing a home invasion, prompting him to pick up his gun and fire a shot that hit an officer in the leg after a battering ram plowed through the apartment\u2019s door.</p> <p>Police responded by firing more than 20 times. Taylor was hit by eight rounds. According to an affidavit filed by Walker\u2019s defense lawyer Rob Eggert: \u201cYou could look through one of the bullet holes and see into the next-door apartment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was incredible that Ms Taylor was the only one killed,\u201d he added later in the document.</p> <p>No drugs were found. Taylor died. Walker was arrested and charged with the attempted murder of a police officer and first-degree assault. Three officers involved were reassigned pending an investigation.</p> <p>In a suit against three Louisville police officers involved in the shooting, lawyers for Taylor\u2019s family accuse the police of negligence, excessive force and wrongful death. Additionally, they said police were searching for a suspect who had already been apprehended and that police lacked probable cause. In firing their weapons \u201cblindly\u201d, lawyers wrote, police showed \u201ca total disregard for the value of human life\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBreonna had posed no threat to the officers and did nothing to deserve to die at their hands.\u201d</p> <p>An affidavit for a search warrant obtained by the Guardian on Wednesday described how police had observed a car regularly operated by two suspected drug dealers make \u201cfrequent trips\u201d from a drug-dealing \u201ctrap house\u201d near the city center to Taylor\u2019s home, more than 10 miles away.</p> <p>According to the warrant, police believed one of the suspected dealers, Jamarcus Glover, was keeping either drugs or drug money in Taylor\u2019s home.</p> <p>In applying for the warrant for Taylor\u2019s apartment, police requested permission for a no-knock entry \u201cdue to the nature of how these drug traffickers operate\u201d.</p> <p>Lawyers for Walker and Taylor say neighbors in the building can attest that police did not knock or announce themselves.</p> <p>A Louisville police spokesperson did not respond to questions from the Guardian about how officers executed the search warrant.</p> <p>The police department often releases video captured by body-worn cameras after police-involved shootings.

  "<p>The British government has been ordered to pay the European commission\u2019s legal costs after being successfully sued for granting City traders a tax break without EU permission.</p> <p>The European court of justice ruled that the UK breached an EU directive by failing to notify Brussels of a zero rate of VAT given to commodities traders over the last four decades.</p> <p>The UK is now expected by Brussels to seek the authorisation of the 27 member states or drop the policy, which it is claimed has unfairly boosted the City of London at the expense of other EU financial centres.</p> <p>A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cWe are reviewing the decision of the European court of justice and will provide further details on next steps in due course.</p> <p>\u201cThe decision does not require businesses to pay any VAT on historic transactions, and the law applying to derivatives trades today means no VAT is due. That will remain the case while the UK considers next steps in light of the ruling.\u201d</p> <p>Separately, the EU has launched infringement proceedings against the British government for failing to comply with EU law on the free movement of its citizens and their family members.</p> <p>The government is accused of limiting the rights of first-time jobseekers from other EU countries, as well as putting restrictions on the rights of their family members. The charges, which date back to 2014, also include imposing \u201cillegal\u201d lifetime re-entry bans on some people.</p> <p>The British government has been given four months to notify the commission that it has fully transposed EU laws on free movement into UK law. There are concerns that the gaps might affect the implementation of citizens\u2019 rights under the withdrawal agreement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/19/threat-to-end-freedom-of-movement-overnight-reckless-say-eu-citizens\">after the end of the Brexit transition period</a>.</p> <p>The UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/31/brexit-day-britain-prepares-leave-eu-live-news-updates\">left the EU on 31 January</a> but under the terms of the withdrawal agreement the country remains under the jurisdiction of the bloc\u2019s court in Luxembourg until the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020.

The court added that the judgment held no sway on whether authorisation should be given if it was sought.</p>",

Inspections could be restarted with training, PPE and selecting the homes where concerns have been raised or which are known to be struggling.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow is the time they should be inspecting,\u201d said Ivan Pointon, who lost his father Donald Pointon, 91, to Covid-19 at Bupa\u2019s Priory care home in Solihull. \u201cHomes should at least be inspected for cross-infection procedures and cleaning procedures.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this month, lawyers for elderly and disabled groups also threatened legal action if inspectors do not return to care homes, claiming to withdraw may breach the CQC\u2019s statutory obligations.</p> <p>The pressure came as the government announced \u00a3600m in extra funding to improve infection control in care homes, which the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services said came \u201ctragically late in the day\u201d.</p> <p>Nadra Ahmed, the executive chairman of the National Care Association, also said on Thursday that care homes had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/ministers-abandoned-care-homes-to-coronavirus\">\u201cleft completely abandoned\u201d</a> in the government\u2019s strategy to protect the NHS, leaving them with \u201cdesperate\u201d shortages of PPE, \u201canxiety and depression\u201d among staff and Covid-positive patients being discharged into care homes.</p> <p>The CQC says it will still go into services if it sees a significant risk, but has developed an emergency process for monitoring care homes without inspections. It involves \u201copen and honest conversations\u201d via Microsoft Teams, but they are not part of the regulatory process. Usual steps such as \u201cthe factual accuracy process\u201d do not apply, and the outcome of any checks is not published, it says.</p> <p>Based on inspections before the pandemic, 228 care homes in England were rated as \u201cinadequate\u201d in terms of their safety and a further 2,386 were given an amber rating, saying they required improvement. If the CQC had continued at its previous rate it would have carried out checks on around 2,000 homes in the two months since it suspended inspections.</p> <p>Pointon said he had tried to raise concerns about infection control with the management of his father\u2019s care home, but cleaning did not appear to have been stepped up, carers were not wearing gloves when delivering food, some were wearing masks with their noses exposed and residents were being allowed to fraternise in communal areas and to share dining tables. He said: \u201cStaff were travelling and working in the same clothes.\u201d</p> <p>Bupa said rooms were cleaned daily and it had seen no evidence of staff wearing the same clothes in and out of the home.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone at the Priory is devastated,\u201d said Rebecca Pearson, the operations director for Bupa Care Services. \u201cThe home is like a big family, and Mr Pointon was very popular and held in great affection. Our heart goes out to his loved ones.</p> <p>\u201cThe safety of our residents and staff is our absolute priority, and we\u2019ve been working hard to ensure they are protected. We increased infection controls and staff training including around the use of PPE and social distancing.\u201d</p> <p>Shirin Koohyar, the daughter of Ameer Koohyar, 91, who died after being diagnosed with Covid-19 at Nazereth House nursing home in Hammersmith on 26 April, said the continued lack of inspections was \u201cshocking\u201d. The home\u2019s last inspection report in November concluded it was \u201cnot always safe\u201d and it had deteriorated with \u201can increased risk that people could be harmed\u201d. A postmortem is being carried out to establish the cause of Ameer\u2019s death.</p> <p>\u201cThey need to be inspecting equipment, hygiene, care and record-keeping,\u201d Koohyar said. \u201cThey should have been all over this with inspectors. Why did this happen? Carers and nurses are going in and out. Why not inspectors?\u201d</p> <p>Kate Terroni, the CQC\u2019s chief inspector of adult social care, said the regulator is aware that \u201cthere are increased risks to people, both to those with coronavirus and those without it, whose treatment and care is being directly or indirectly affected\u201d.<br><br>\u201cWe will continue to inspect where we see evidence of risk of harm, deliberate abuse, systematic neglect or a significant breakdown in leadership,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will continue to regulate services in a variety of ways so that we can identify where support is needed. We will use our powers, or work with the relevant system partners, to take action against those responsible where we find unsafe or poor care.\u201d</p>",

I had breast pads in because I was leaking milk, I hadn\u2019t shaved and I stood in front of my partner, Gorka, and, laughing, said: \u201cLook at me ... I used to be in FHM\u2019s 100 sexiest women!\u201d</p> <p>Despite what people might think, I\u2019ve never really felt sexy. I\u2019ve always enjoyed training and I like feeling physically strong, but when I got pregnant all I could think about was how to keep this little baby safe inside me for the next nine months. My appearance was the last thing on my mind.</p> <p>Gorka (M\u00e1rquez, a professional dancer who appears on Strictly Come Dancing) has always been very loving and reassuring \u2013 even more so when I was pregnant.

More jelly, more love.\u201d He\u2019s definitely the romantic in our relationship \u2013 to the point where sometimes I have to say: \u201cCalm down, we\u2019re not in a romcom!\u201d</p> <p>Mia\u2019s birth was quite traumatic. After a difficult labour in which her heart rate kept dropping, she was delivered by emergency caesarean, and afterwards I suffered a haemorrhage. It wasn\u2019t until a couple of weeks later that I actually looked at my body. The health visitor had been round during the day to check that I was healing properly and I was still very bruised and swollen. That evening, I took my nightie off and stood in front of the mirror for the first time. It was quite upsetting \u2013 the scar looked awful and my tummy was a complete mess.

I started with gentle walks when Mia was nine weeks old, but even those often left me feeling exhausted. I remember trying to walk home from the supermarket with bottles of water under the buggy and I ended up in tears, ringing my mum because I couldn\u2019t make it home. That made me realise that I really had to let my body heal in its own time.</p> <p>Before I started exercising, I went for a \u201cMummy MOT\u201d appointment, where a physiotherapist assessed my posture, pelvic floor and abdominals. I\u2019d done pelvic floor exercises from the moment I found out I was pregnant \u2013 I worked on my core and trunk and made sure I was strengthening my muscles. I knew the importance of my pelvic floor, thanks to my friends who\u2019d had babies, and from stuff I\u2019d read about pregnancy \u2013 everyone told me I should start early with the exercises. But it was still a relief when the physiotherapist told me that my pelvic floor was in good shape. She told me about women who came to her with incontinence later in life and had no idea it was linked to what happened to their pelvic floor during pregnancy.</p> <p>Once I had the all-clear, it was great to get back to training, even though my J-Lo bottom sadly disappeared. It was also important for helping me feel like myself again.</p> <p>While I loved the newborn phase with Mia, sometimes it felt like I\u2019d never feel \u201cnormal\u201d again. Stuck in the house, walking around slowly like a T rex, I couldn\u2019t imagine going out for brunch with the girls or even going to get a blow-dry. But gradually life did return to normal and I\u2019d love to tell other new mums who are feeling the same not to worry so much because you\u2019ll soon be out of that newborn bubble.</p> <p>Having a baby is really humbling because it makes you realise that little things don\u2019t matter. All I care about now is my family. I can see why babies put a strain on your relationship \u2013 you\u2019re doing everything on no sleep, sore boobs and all your focus is on keeping this little human alive. That\u2019s why Gorka and I actively try to make time for one another. If I ever feel overwhelmed, he steps in. And if I ever have a wobble about the way I look, he won\u2019t hear of it. He says: \u201cYou gave me a daughter. The last thing I\u2019m bothered about is a few stretch marks.\u201d</p> <p><em>As incontinence can affect women before and after pregnancy, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition.

  "<p>On 30 March, Big Bang Theory star Jim Parsons posted a selfie on Instagram holding up a painting of two vases \u2013 which he made himself.</p> <p>In the caption, Parsons told his followers that he created the artwork with the help of an online art class. \u201cThey\u2019re doing live classes via zoom and, quite to my delight, I was not only able to figure out how to use zoom, but I also painted this in the process!\u201d <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-XSvq4B1cH/\">he wrote</a>. \u201cNo museums are asking to display my first still life painting, but I feel just a little bit more peaceful from the process \u2026 and I got to see real life other people who were also taking the class \u2013 a real gift right now!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/13/immigrants-are-essential-coronavirus-health-workers\">Immigrants Are Essential: a vital art project shining a light on the frontline</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Parsons is not alone. Thousands of us have been turning to Zoom, the video conferencing platform, to get a creative workout. From life drawing art classes to small-town museums, pandemic cartoons and upcycled sculptures, it seems to be the perfect answer for cooped-up creativity in our current quarantine.</p> <p>Parsons took his class with <a href=\"https://www.theartstudiony.com/adult-classes/\">Art Studio NY</a>, which hosts painting classes, from watercolors, to oil, acrylic and a \u201cfear-free drawing 101\u201d. The school\u2019s virtual art classes draw the likes of international students (one artist recently tuned in from France). \u201cIt\u2019s really amazing to see people coming together from every corner of the earth to make art together,\u201d wrote one of the teachers <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_YToMAHGgW/\">on Instagram</a>. \u201cIn uncertain times like these, this is the least we can do to help keep our spirits alive and our feelings united.\u201d</p> <p>Some art schools have also been putting their curriculum online. The New York Academy of Art, known for classically training artists, is one of them. Their live model drawing classes have been held on Zoom since March.</p> <p>\u201cWe did it out of necessity,\u201d says the school\u2019s operations director, Mike Smith. \u201cWe wanted to see if it would be a good thing for the community, to not only do classwork but talk about art, make drawings and paintings from a live model and see each other.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-XSvq4B1cH/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

The South Arkansas Arts Center in El Dorado, which is hosting a regular stream of art workshops, has an idea. One teacher, Kelly Campbell, who is hosting a watercolor class called <a href=\"https://saac-arts.org/little-landscapes/\">Little Landscapes Everywhere</a>, claims that a selection of the Zoom paintings will potentially be included in their summer exhibition, Under Quarantine: Art Created Under Unprecedented Circumstances.</p> <p>The University of California, Berkeley, is offering <a href=\"https://artstudio.berkeley.edu/course/free-zoom-classes-2/\">free Zoom art classes</a>, among them DIY sculpture classes where garbage is upcycled into art.

It isn\u2019t just about putting the creative lens on our surroundings, but the sense of community that happens when we\u2019re being creative collectively.</p> <p>\u201cDuring this time, it\u2019s important that we support each other and come together through the arts,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.jamestownartcenter.org/education\">she says</a>. \u201cDrawing together in a group, even if virtually, creates community. Right now, we need our community more than ever.\u201d</p> <p>Over on the west coast, Long Beach-based arts studio Inspyr Arts is offering <a href=\"https://www.inspyrarts.com/live-virtual-classes\">visual art classes online</a> that appeal to tweens, from an anime class, which teaches the Japanese anime style of manga comics, to video game illustration. Meanwhile, museums are hosting online classes, such as the Solomon R Guggenheim Museum in New York, which is <a href=\"https://www.guggenheim.org/press-release/solomon-r-guggenheim-museum-offers-at-home-art-classes-for-students\">offering at-home classes for students</a>, while the <a href=\"https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/calendar/2020-04/art-making-drawing-landscapes\">Princeton Art Museum</a> is offering weekly drawing classes on Zoom, featuring a different artwork from its art collection (a curator reflects on the artwork in a corresponding lecture, as well). The Frist Art Museum in Nashville is offering <a href=\"https://fristartmuseum.org/calendar/detail/art-history-course-j.m.w.-turner-and-romanticism\">art history lectures</a> and <a href=\"https://fristartmuseum.org/calendar#C=6&amp;P=P0\">virtual talks with curators</a>, too.</p> <p>New York City has a long history with the art of cartooning, which is the topic of one class hosted by the Upper East Side\u2019s 92nd Street Y community center. Cartoonist <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/joshmbayer/\">Josh Bayer</a> is teaching <a href=\"https://coursehorse.com/nyc/classes/art/drawing/comic-book-drawing/cartoon/cartooning-illustration-for-beginners\">cartooning and illustration via Zoom</a>, from anatomy to shadowing and building what he calls \u201ca vocabulary as a cartoonist\u201d.</p> <p>Some artists are also hosting classes straight out of their apartments, such as the queer artist and comedian <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bodyconfidence/\">Alex Schmidt</a>, who is hosting \u2013 and posing in \u2013 a selection of Zoom classes. Schmidt poses with props to a carefully selected class of <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/27/embracing-the-chaotic-side-of-zoom\">cis women, trans and queer folks</a>, and recently wore a platinum, 18th-century-esque <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_cxFjHj0pf/\">Marie Antoinette wig</a>.</p> <p>Artists might even see famous models. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dxristo/\">Christophe Nayel</a> \u2013 the same life model <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B1V4VGwH34U/\">who posed for</a> the viral painting of <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/08/20/model-behind-epsteins-bizarre-clinton-painting-revealed/\">Bill Clinton in a blue dress</a>, which was <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/08/16/artist-who-painted-bill-clinton-in-dress-and-heels-had-no-idea-it-was-hanging-in-epsteins-mansion/\">bought by Jeffrey Epstein</a> \u2013 says posing from home is not uncommon.

  "<p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother coming back to the office.\u201d It\u2019s the kind of message everyone dreads receiving, but for Twitter\u2019s employees it was benign. The tech company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/12/twitter-coronavirus-covid19-work-from-home\">announced this week</a> that home-working arrangements made for the pandemic would stay for good: nobody need ever commute in again, unless they particularly wanted to. In Britain, the telecoms giant BT also declared that staff could choose whether to come back to call centres or just carry on from home.</p> <p>The idea that office life is over is almost certainly overdone. Not everyone loves typing away on the sofa day after day, panicking about being out of the corporate loop. But for those lucky enough to have the choice to work from home, the collective near-death experience we\u2019ve endured as a nation may be prompting a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/keep-connected/2020/apr/23/lockdown-made-me-realise-whats-important-meet-the-families-reconnecting-remotely\">re-evaluation of what matters</a>.</p> <p>Commuter dads who once rarely saw their children awake have got used to the casual intimacy of being around them all day long. In the privacy of their personal Facebook feeds, more than one hard-hitting Westminster type has melted into a puddle of baby pictures. For the less sentimental, savings from seven weeks of raiding the fridge for lunch and not filling the car are adding up; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/climate-crisis-amid-coronavirus-lockdown-nature-bounces-back-but-for-how-long\">environmental benefits</a> of keeping traffic off the roads are a happy bonus. But if the shift to home-working has been relatively painless, that\u2019s merely the beginning.</p> <p>Modern working hours are in part a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/history-4-day-workweek-microsoft-japan-great-depression-2019-11?r=US&amp;IR=T#other-new-deal-legislation-was-a-way-to-keep-30-hour-workweek-activists-happy-like-the-works-progress-administration-and-the-federal-labor-standards-act-which-mandated-overtime-pay-past-40-hours-3\">legacy of the Great Depression</a> of the 1930s, when collapsing demand for labour encouraged companies to share around what work there was: what had been a six-day week for many shrank to five. Now it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-school-exams-five-day-week-pandemic\">may be shrinking again</a>.</p> <p>The world\u2019s largest law firm, Dentons, is among companies asking staff to work a <a href=\"https://employeebenefits.co.uk/dentons-asks-1100-uk-employees-to-work-four-day-week-on-80-pay/\">four-day week</a> for 80% of salary due to falling demand. The Adam Smith Institute, one of the more bracingly rightwing thinktanks, is pushing its <a href=\"https://www.adamsmith.org/research\">\u201cfour days on, ten days off\u201d</a> model designed by an epidemiologist for a safer return to work: companies would split staff into groups, each doing four days in the office or factory followed by 10 days off, with the groups rotated in order to limit numbers and help social distancing. (If you do get infected, the idea is that symptoms would be more likely to emerge during the days off, allowing people to self-isolate).</p> <p>It sounds hell to match with childcare, but at least it\u2019s evidence of right as well as left accepting that we cannot simply return to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/04/coronavirus-business-finance-work-property\">business as usual</a>. The next step, however is working out how to make any of this fair on people who can\u2019t afford a pay cut. Rishi Sunak made a big leap of imagination, for a Conservative chancellor, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/12/uk-furlough-scheme-extended-rishi-sunak-coronavirus\">embrace furloughing</a> \u2013 but to get us out of it will require another one.</p> <p>This week it emerged that from August, employers must start picking up some of the bill for furloughing their own people, currently met by the Treasury. The risk is that redundancies will follow, but the best hope of avoiding them is for the Treasury to allow part-time furloughing. People could be paid conventionally to work, say, three or four days a week, with the furlough scheme topping up their salaries.</p> <p>An enlightened government could effectively turn furloughing into a mechanism for spreading work around in lean times, while buying time to re-imagine working hours for the longer term.</p> <p>Around the world, people are already grappling with the question of how to shorten the working week. The organisation 4 Day Week Global has been experimenting for years in New Zealand with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/30/i-pioneered-the-4-day-week-now-it-must-be-used-to-fight-the-climate-crisis\">reorganising companies</a> so that five days\u2019 work can be done in four, giving employees a longer weekend for the same pay. (The reward for their bosses is better productivity, happier people, and lower staff turnover.) Now it\u2019s looking at adapting that model through the current crisis.</p> <p>In Scotland, the Post-Covid-19 Futures Commission, created by the Royal Society of Edinburgh, is <a href=\"https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/politics/scottish-politics/2192662/__trashed-119/\">examining four-day weeks</a>; Labour too could dust off its report on them, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/09/john-mcdonnell-shapes-labour-case-for-four-day-week\">commissioned by John McDonnell</a> long before the pandemic. But is the current government up to such bold thinking?</p> <p>This week\u2019s clumsy stab at thawing a frozen economy hardly inspires confidence. In England, the treatment of teachers has been a model of how not to encourage anxious people back, with unions accused of sabotage for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/12/plans-to-reopen-schools-on-1-june-in-jeopardy-as-education-unions-tell-staff-not-to-engage-with-prepartions-1\">daring to express concerns</a> about the risk of infection spreading and people dying. Social distancing on public transport visibly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/13/grant-shapps-would-not-get-on-crowed-bus-tube-coronavirus-lockdown-eased\">isn\u2019t working</a>, and mixed messages about what is now allowed have eroded trust.</p> <p>Why can an estate agent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/12/housing-market-in-england-to-reopen-for-socially-distanced-property-viewings\">visit your ho</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/12/housing-market-in-england-to-reopen-for-socially-distanced-property-viewings\">me</a>, but not your grandchildren? True, you\u2019re less likely to hug the former. That doesn\u2019t, however, explain why you can car-share with colleagues if going to work, but not sit next to them in the park. It looks horribly as if rules can be bent for anything that makes a profit.</p> <p>But there is still just about time to go back to the drawing board. When, and only when, it\u2019s safe to go back to the workplace, the return should be framed much as lockdown was seven weeks ago: as an act of social solidarity that helps others, while also benefiting individuals. It should come with encouragement for anyone who has dreamed of cutting their hours, focusing on working fathers who constantly tell surveys they\u2019d like to work less but feel they can\u2019t actually do it.</p> <p>But most of all, it should come with a promise of living better, and sharing the pain of slumping economic demand. Theresa May was once mocked for insisting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2017/may/22/nothings-changed-may-claims-as-she-announces-social-care-u-turn-video\">nothing had changed</a>. Her successor must acknowledge that something profoundly has.</p> <p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>When Janine Brown couldn\u2019t answer her daughter\u2019s question about her maths homework, she suggested instant messaging the teacher for help. He replied immediately, enabling her daughter to complete the task. Brown was impressed \u2013 it felt like one-to-one tutoring, but Daisy was attending school online via her Microsoft Surface, studying from the family\u2019s kitchen table.</p> <p>Before the school closures, it was impossible to imagine children decamping from classrooms to embark on online learning, and harder still to picture parents as proxy teachers. Yet for Brown and other parents, this is the new normal. Technology is making it possible; allowing teaching to continue uninterrupted, enhancing students\u2019 creativity, productivity and collaboration, and enabling parents to engage with their children\u2019s learning journey.</p> <p>Brown works as a support staff member at her daughter\u2019s school, and considers the school\u2019s remote-learning provision the silver lining to the cloud that is the current crisis. \u201cDaisy joins her form group every morning via video link, then follows her normal timetable \u2013 it\u2019s working fantastically,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely to hear her classmates chatting away and helping one another with their work.\u201d</p> <p>Distance learning isn\u2019t new. But the pandemic has drastically accelerated the development of online education, and technology is at the forefront of this modern educational reform. Microsoft Teams \u2013 <a href=\"https://educationblog.microsoft.com/en-us/2020/04/celebrating-the-heroes-of-remote-learning/#_ftn1\" rel=\"nofollow\">used in 175 countries by 183,000 institutions</a> \u2013 is equipping students with a learning environment that is accessible, inclusive and collaborative.</p> <p>For parents thrust into the role of home educator, it\u2019s natural to feel anxious. But supporting your child\u2019s online education doesn\u2019t mean replicating the school environment. Melanie Dalpra from Reading, whose daughter, Maia, is in year 11, says: \u201cEven Maia\u2019s school isn\u2019t trying to replicate it \u2013 she has three 45-minute online lessons and the rest of her day is given to independent study.</p> <p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a really good model \u2013 don\u2019t let Covid-19 push your child out of the centre of their education.\u201d</p> <p>Safeguarding is also a key consideration for parents. As education moves online and children rely on technology tools for learning, parents need peace of mind that the devices they use are equipped with world-class security measures. Microsoft offers tools for every task with security built in, from chip to cloud.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3ed207b22d61abfb707d732e2b2538708aeb0ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3ed207b22d61abfb707d732e2b2538708aeb0ca/0_0_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mother and two children using Microsoft Surface\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">For many parents, becoming a proxy teacher is the new normal</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A particular advantage of Windows 10 Pro is its inbuilt security solution, including streamlined security updates, safe searches and no retargeting of students with online adverts \u2013 features parents may already be familiar with through the tools they use at work.

Dalpra, whose three children have Asperger syndrome, ADHD and dyspraxia respectively, says quarantine can create opportunities to reconsider your child\u2019s needs. \u201cOne of the advantages of online learning is that you can control sensory stimulus and adapt learning materials to suit the needs of individual learners,\u201d she says.</p> <p>An inclusive learning experience is vital for all young people. Giving your child access to tools that include special features to address a range of individual needs is essential, especially for those with specific learning needs. Free accessibility tools \u2013 such as Immersive Reader \u2013 are built in to all Microsoft products to help empower students of all abilities to learn without stigma and at their own pace. Immersive Reader provides a full-screen reading experience, designed to increase readability of text \u2013 students can change spacing, read text aloud, and sound out words by syllable.</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to imagine schools reverting to business as usual, and the new educational landscape will surely continue posing challenges for parents. But whatever the future holds, the technology is on their side. For parents worried about how to adapt and survive, Dalpra has a pearl of wisdom: \u201cChildren develop if they\u2019re in a nourishing environment, and just feeling heard can transform a child\u2019s education.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Five tips to support online education</strong></p> <p>1. Put mental health and wellbeing above academic progress. If learning isn\u2019t going well, play a board game or go for a walk together and revisit the task later. The Do Not Disturb function in Teams can also help with children\u2019s concentration.</p> <p>2. Have fun. This is a difficult time for children, but learning should be enjoyable.</p> <p>3. Encourage your child to ask teachers for help \u2013 not all children are used to doing so.</p> <p>4. Stick to a daily routine but allow time for play, relaxation and boredom.</p> <p>5. Remember that you\u2019re dealing with a person, not just a student. Show your child that you\u2019re still learning too, and approach it together.</p> <p><em>Interested in finding out more about how to support your child\u2019s online learning experience? <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/home/online-learning-revolution?wt.mc_id=AID3012414_QSG_OLA_430977\" rel=\"nofollow\">Register here</a> to attend a webinar designed for parents on this topic, taking place on 4 June 2020 at 5.30pm.</em></p>",
  "<p>Dentists have warned that patients are being left in extreme pain and in need of urgent treatment as emergency facilities are overwhelmed by high demand during the coronavirus lockdown.</p> \n<p>In England, routine dental appointments were widely cancelled from 25 March to reduce the spread of coronavirus, with dentists only able to offer advice and prescriptions over the phone.</p> \n<p>For emergency cases, patients can be referred by NHS 111 or their dentist to urgent care dental hubs at regional centres which have been set up across the England.</p> \n<p>However, according to hundreds of accounts from dentists, dental nurses and patients submitted to the Guardian community team, a combination of high demand and a lack of personal protective equipment has caused severe delays at these hubs, leaving people with broken teeth, abscesses, and severe toothache unable to get face-to-face treatment.</p> \n<p>Some patients are struggling to eat and sleep despite trying multiple rounds of antibiotics, and for many others existing problems are getting more serious because of the lack of treatment caused by the closure of normal dental services.</p> \n<p>Dr Mojtaba Dehghanpour, a private dentist in Kent, said: \u201cToothache and earache are two of the worst kinds of pain, and people have gone on suffering for weeks. At the dental hubs, they have to prioritise the worst cases, and only treat really severe stuff that shouldn\u2019t [be allowed to] reach that level to begin with.\u201d</p> \n<p>The regulations are making patients and dentists alike desperate, Dehghanpour said. \u201cA friend of mine who\u2019s a dentist had severe toothache for more than a week, so he went into his practice and drilled his own tooth.\u201d</p> \n<p>In West Sussex, Brian Haddock, 67, had to make 26 phone calls in total to his dentist, the triage dentist and an emergency hub before he was able to be seen for \u201cunbearable pain\u201d that had left him without sleep for two days.</p> \n<p>When he was referred to a newly-opened hub in Brighton three days later, he was told that he needed a root canal, but as the procedure would take more than one trip to the dentist, the hub could only remove the tooth.</p> \n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s one of my main molars I use for chewing, but in an emergency, we do things we wouldn\u2019t normally agree to,\u201d Haddock said.</p> \n<p>Despite anecdotal evidence of hubs saying they can only remove teeth, this is not set out in their guidance given by the NHS, although it states that aerosol generating procedures should be \u201cavoided unless absolutely necessary\u201d.</p> \n<p>A dental nurse at a hub in Yorkshire, who asked not to be named, said her hub had been fully booked by NHS 111 patients each day and staff were unable to treat those referred by their dentists.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were seeing four patients a day, now we\u2019re seeing 20. There\u2019s no clear guidance on what should be worn when, and what conditions we should and shouldn\u2019t be treating. We\u2019re having to make up systems,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Like many healthcare professionals, the nurse\u2019s hub has experienced critical shortages of PPE. \u201cWe\u2019ve been without proper visors for two weeks. We wear gowns, masks, and reusable aprons,\u201d she said. \u201cWe remove the aprons after every patient, but not the disposable gown.\u201d </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e8a5d369-ef41-4b4a-adf8-f34313e47e32\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;<b>stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.<br></p>\n    <p>If you live with other people,&nbsp;<b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p>After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine.

Vladimir Jurowski conducts with a clear eye on the work\u2019s huge dimensions, and Benedetti, too, shapes the violin\u2019s restless music into long, sinewy paragraphs. Her interpretation may lack the introspective quality of the revelatory recording Nigel Kennedy made back in the mid 1980s, and you occasionally wish Jurowski would risk letting the orchestra run away from him, but the end result is a performance with a sure sense of direction and lots of heart.</p> <p>The pieces with piano \u2013 Salut d\u2019Amour, Sospiri and Chanson de Nuit \u2013 are almost the flipside to this. Benedetti and pianist Petr Limonov are quiet and pensive, her violin silky-toned, the sound scaled back but just as electric. Sospiri is beautifully done, Benedetti\u2019s tone silky and contained yet electric; it\u2019s an initially bleak picture of despair that lifts just slightly into something hopeful at the end. Salut d\u2019Amour sounds fresh, and is played with an understated sigh that draws the ear in. Unsurprisingly from such a tireless campaigner and educator, that\u2019s not quite all: Benedetti has filmed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsxcaCooOBA\">five video lessons</a> on Salut d\u2019Amour for her YouTube channel, inspiring lockdown practice material for violin or viola students of any age.</p> <h2>This week\u2019s other pick</h2> <p>Another Beethoven recording that urgently demands shelf (or disc) space. <strong><a href=\"http://www.stephenhough.com/\">Stephen Hough</a></strong>\u2019s long-awaited recording of the complete five piano concertos is a partnership with conductor <a href=\"http://www.hannulintu.fi/\">Hannu Lintu</a> and the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, and the sparks struck between their crisp responsiveness and Hough\u2019s immaculate blend of imagination and control are considerable.

  "<p>The sector \u201cmedical communications\u201d may not sound instantly recognisable, but its work is: a report on the latest clinical trials in colorectal cancer or a website dedicated to a specific disease, for example. That\u2019s because the work of professionals in medical communications, otherwise known as med comms, is a vital part of the health and pharmaceutical industries, and touches millions of people\u2019s lives every day. The output is particularly crucial for healthcare workers, who need timely access to clear and succinct information.</p> <p>One of the premium med comms companies in the UK is Oxford PharmaGenesis, an independent HealthScience consultancy with a global presence. Alongside numerous awards for its client work, the company has received recognition as <a href=\"https://www.pharmagenesis.com/news-and-views/oxford-pharmagenesis-celebrates-being-a-great-place-to-work\" rel=\"nofollow\">one of the UK\u2019s best workplaces and one of the best for women</a>. Oxford PharmaGenesis employs graduates across a variety of roles, such as writers, editors, project managers, account managers, designers and digital specialists.</p> <p>We spoke to some of its employees to learn about life in med comms at one of the UK\u2019s industry leaders.</p> <p>\u2018<strong>If you don\u2019t communicate the science well, it\u2019s not going to be taken seriously\u2019<br></strong>When Emma Wescott was finishing her science degree, she realised she really didn\u2019t want to work in a lab. In med comms, she found a role that allowed her to use her science background but one that also had creative elements.</p> <p>Her job as senior editor is \u201cmore than grammatical errors\u201d. Most editors have a science degree or a background in the field because they need to understand the content and check the overall sense. Editors also need strong attention to detail, good time management skills and the ability to work well under pressure, because sometimes timelines can be tight. \u201cObviously, medical information is important to share \u2013 and if you don\u2019t communicate the science well, it\u2019s not going to be taken seriously. It\u2019s good to feel that your job is important \u2013 and there\u2019s such a range of clients and subjects, it\u2019s never boring.\u201d</p> <p>Oxford PharmaGenesis has a large team of highly talented editors. For Wescott, this means colleagues with a great range of expertise to learn from. \u201cYou know the team has your back and will help you out if you\u2019re stuck.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u2018Everyone here is highly motivated\u2019<br></strong>Before she joined the PharmaGenesis London office, senior medical writer Hennah Patel obtained a master\u2019s degree in pharmacy and worked in the NHS as a pharmacist. When she was researching a change of career, Patel discovered Oxford PharmaGenesis\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfAIliulif67NRiemIEDB-w\" rel=\"nofollow\">YouTube channel</a>. \u201cThere are videos of team members from each office speaking about the type of work they do and why they enjoy it. It\u2019s an excellent selling point because it provides an insight into the company.\u201d</p> <p>Patel currently works on projects that focus on real-world evidence across a variety of disease and treatment areas. She sees herself as a HealthScience communicator whose job is to make complex scientific information understandable. She does this by contributing to scientific publications, developing online training solutions to increase knowledge of specific therapy areas or research methods, and supporting experts delivering presentations at medical congresses.</p> <p>The open and collaborative culture at Oxford PharmaGenesis is very positive, says Patel. \u201cEveryone here is highly motivated, aiming not simply to meet clients\u2019 needs but to do better than they expect.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fb864dda933c366425f43527389ad38f1b99859e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb864dda933c366425f43527389ad38f1b99859e/0_0_3744_5616/667.jpg\" alt=\"Medical communications professional using iPad\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medical communications professionals work on a wide variety of project types in a wide range of therapy areas</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: www.markbassett.co.uk/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>\u2018You definitely need to know your way around a scientific paper\u2019<br></strong>A PhD, preferably in a biological or medical-related science, is an advantage, according to Cardiff-based Alistair Ray, a senior consultant. \u201cYou definitely need to know your way around a scientific paper and be able to concisely summarise a large number of publications.\u201d</p> <p>Ray says the training he\u2019s received at Oxford PharmaGenesis is outstanding, and has sharpened his organisational skills considerably. \u201cThere\u2019s always an opportunity to learn and train \u2013 all the company asks is that you share what you have learned with the rest of the team.\u201d</p> <p>Whether Ray is working on a long document about lung cancer treatment, making changes to a presentation deck on type 2 diabetes or working on the economics of a multiple myeloma drug to help bring it to countries or territories where it hasn\u2019t yet been approved, he is fulfilled knowing his job is helping to make a difference to people\u2019s lives.</p> <p><strong>\u2018There\u2019s a clear progression path, so I know which steps I need to take\u2019<br></strong>Graphic designer<strong> </strong>Cat Coburn<strong> </strong>spends her days \u201cmaking complicated science easier to understand\u201d. She designs for print and digital media, creating everything from posters, animations and interactive brochures to social media posts. She works, too, on digital displays and booths for medical educational events, where healthcare professionals learn about new treatments.</p> <p>Having worked for a competitor, Coburn joined Oxford PharmaGenesis after a career break. \u201cBeing an independent company means there are fewer barriers to getting decisions made, which speeds things along quite a lot.\u201d</p> <p>Clarity around employee development is another strength: \u201cThere\u2019s a clear progression path, so I know which steps I need to take to get to the next tier.\u201d The company also provides her with opportunities for further training.</p> <p><strong>\u2018There\u2019s a lot of creative thinking and problem-solving involved\u2019<br></strong>Benedict Groves joined the digital team at Oxford PharmaGenesis as a graduate directly from university. He started as an intern in September 2019, before becoming a permanent information analyst in November. He describes his job as \u201ctaking abstract data and turning it into meaningful and useful insights to help inform people\u201d. While his job requires technical coding skills, Groves says that \u201csurprisingly, there\u2019s a lot of creative thinking and problem-solving involved\u201d.</p> <p>He says the sheer variety of projects and the opportunity to learn from experienced digital developers and producers have made the role really enjoyable. As his team is relatively new, it has a very entrepreneurial feel.</p> <p>\u2018<strong>When everyone\u2019s in the room together, you know what they\u2019re discussing is going to have an impact on patients\u2019<br></strong>Emily Wheeler joined the company as a project manager because she wanted \u201cmore responsibility and career development\u201d. Since then she has had \u201clots of opportunity to grow\u201d, and she was thrilled to be asked to pitch to a client when she had been in the role for just three months.</p> <p>Oxford PharmaGenesis, says Wheeler, is a very friendly company. \u201cEveryone knows each other. You can be in the kitchen with the CEO and he knows your name, he knows what you do, what team you are in and what that team is working on.\u201d</p> <p>Although she\u2019s based in the Oxford office, Wheeler\u2019s role takes her all over the world, organising and delivering events involving international healthcare experts. For her, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing quite like the moment when everyone\u2019s in the room together and you know what they are discussing is going to have an impact on patients, and that you got them there\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Downing Street has rebuked Conservative MPs, including a minister, for sharing a video from a far-right Twitter account that falsely claimed Sir Keir Starmer obstructed the prosecution of grooming gang members when he led the Crown Prosecution Service.</p> <p>A Downing Street spokesman said the MPs, including Nadine Dorries, a health minister, had been spoken to by whips after sharing the misleading 22-second clip.</p> <p>The video was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/peterwalker99/status/1260863326948593664\">shared by Dorries</a> as well as the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/peterwalker99/status/1260872944387067905\">Telford MP Lucy Allan</a> and Maria Caulfield, who represents Lewes. All commented at what the video purported to show, with Dorries calling it \u201crevealing\u201d.</p> <p>The No 10 spokesman said: \u201cThese tweets have rightly been deleted. The MPs involved have been spoken to by the whips\u2019 office and reminded of their responsibility to check the validity of information before they post on social media sites.\u201d </p> <p>The clip, from 2013, falsely claims to show Starmer apparently recounting reasons why victims of grooming gangs might not be credible, talking about \u201cthe assumption that a victim of child sexual abuse will swiftly report what\u2019s happened to them to the police; will be able to give a coherent, consistent account, first time; that they will not themselves have engaged in any offending or other behaviour; and that they will not have misused drugs or alcohol at any stage\u201d.</p> <p>The original tweeter, who also regularly posts anti-Islam messages and other far-right content, titled the clip: \u201cKeir Starmer explains why he didn\u2019t prosecute grooming gangs when he was head of the Crown Prosecution Service.\u201d</p> <p>However, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfyTWU-Hnek&amp;feature=youtu.be\">fuller version of the video</a> shows this is completely misleading.

It\u2019s doctored, it\u2019s false, it\u2019s not true.\u201d</p> <p>A Labour source said: \u201cThis is a doctored video tweeted by a far-right social media account. As a government minister, we hope <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nadine-dorries\">Nadine Dorries</a> acknowledges this and takes it down.\u201d</p> <p>Dorries later did remove her tweet, as did Allan. However, Allan did not delete an earlier reply to another tweet referencing the video in which the MP said: \u201cUnbelievable. This is what CSE victims were up against.\u201d</p> <p>Caulfield appeared to delete her entire Twitter account. None has yet apologised for sharing the misleading message.</p> <p>As director of public prosecutions, Starmer ordered a wholesale restructuring of how the CPS dealt with grooming cases, saying the legal system had failed victims.</p> <p>The issue of grooming gangs and authorities failing to properly target abusers has been regularly used by far-right activists such as Tommy Robinson to campaign against Muslims.</p> <p>In 2017, Dorries retweeted a post from Robinson.</p>",
  "<p>An aborted Chinese-led boardroom coup at a British technology firm is set to force the UK government to adopt stronger intervention powers to prevent hostile countries taking major stakes in strategic UK businesses.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/08/mps-launch-inquiry-into-potential-chinese-asset-stripping-of-uk-firms\">The coup</a>, involving putting four Chinese government-backed members on to the board of Imagination Technologies, has led Tory backbenchers to demand ministers toughen pre-existing plans to add a stronger national security element to UK takeover laws. It was abandoned after MPs called on ministers to intervene.</p> <p>They now want the government to have clearer powers to intervene in a company on national security grounds after a takeover, and not just at the point of a takeover. They also want ministers, possibly in coordination with other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/history-of-5-eyes-explainer\">Five Eyes</a> intelligence agencies, to have powers to look behind front companies that might be intervening on behalf of China, or other \u201chostile state actors\u201d.</p> <p>Ministers have privately acknowledged that current plans to toughen up takeovers of British firms will need re-examining.</p> <p>The proposals, reflecting a new, more combative mood towards China on the Tory backbenches, may worsen the already tense relations with China <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/chris-patten-urges-uk-investigate-coronavirus-origins-china\">over its handling of the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/chris-patten-urges-uk-investigate-coronavirus-origins-china\">coronavirus outbreak</a>.</p> <p>Ministers announced plans in December\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech for an as yet unpublished bill that would establish an independent body to examine takeovers of assets and entities through the lens of threats to national security, as opposed simply to the consumer interest. The new UK government scrutiny regime will look at issues wider than market share and turnover, the criteria set out in the existing <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/40/contents\">Enterprise Act</a>.</p> <p>The proposals stem from as far back as September 2016, when Theresa May complained that her intervention powers in relation to foreign takeovers were inadequate.</p> <p>But Tory backbenchers believe the proposed changes do not go far enough and have left a large gap for the Chinese to asset strip the intellectual property of a firm after a takeover has been approved.</p> <p>The government set out in a white paper various triggers for a takeover to be referred, including the acquisition of more than 25% of the votes or shares in an entity, the acquisition of significant influence or control over an entity.</p> <p>Tory backbenchers want the government\u2019s new intervention powers to be triggered not only at the point of takeover or greater investment, but also post-acquisition when the investor activities pose a threat to national security.</p> <p>Alicia Kearns, a Conservative member of the foreign affairs select committee currently investigating China\u2019s involvement in Imagination Technologies, said: \u201cGovernment needs to have a right to protect British technology not just when a firm is about to be taken over, but for perhaps up to a year afterwards by which time the shareholders\u2019 intentions are clearer.\u201d</p> <p>Jasper Helder at the international law firm Akin Gump said: \u201cThe current system of post-offer undertakings under the takeover code is clearly insufficient to hold state party investors to account post-investment.</p> <p>\u201cAt the same time subjecting post-acquisition activities to review would make UK intervention powers more wide-reaching than potentially any other country, including the US. It is also unclear what types of post-acquisition activity could be subject to review and whether the possibility of review could persist for a potentially unlimited period of time. That said, hostile actors do seem increasingly happy to sit in the long grass before implementing their intended strategy.\u201d</p> <p>He said the UK government had been late to the party on hostile state takeovers, but its proposals would provide the UK with remedies beyond anything proposed by the EU.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The defence select committee chairman, Tobias Ellwood, is also proposing the Five Eyes network take a more coordinated stance on national security and technology.

One\u2019s sense of self-worth became tied to the ability to generate capital. A 2017 survey revealed that millennials make up 40% of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahlandrum/2017/12/15/millennials-are-more-likely-to-identify-as-work-martyrs-and-heres-why/#66bcfb782904\">work martyrs</a>\u201d in comparison to 29% of all respondents. Statements related to work martyrdom include: \u201cNo one else at my company can do the work while I\u2019m away\u201d, \u201cI want to show complete dedication to my company and job\u201d, \u201cI don\u2019t want others to think I am replaceable\u201d, and \u201cI feel guilty for using my paid time off.\u201d In other words, if you aren\u2019t killing yourself working, you may as well be dead.</p> <p>Coming out of a recession, trading the domestic for the corporate seemed right. Rather than learning to cultivate a home life, we threw money at takeaway meals and \u201cdomestic vaporware\u201d (Alexa! Order Sweetgreen!). It\u2019s no coincidence that as millennials got their first jobs, the 2010s saw the rise of \u201cmommy apps\u201d. While <a href=\"https://qz.com/1129515/the-mom-on-demand-economy-is-indulging-our-inner-lazy-teenager/\">the media joked</a> that young adults were too lazy or dumb to cook (Blue Apron, Seamless, Soylent), shop (Postmates, Winc, Instacart), clean (Tidy, Handy), or walk their dogs (Wags, Rover), the reality was that these services enabled a generation of workaholics to spend more time at work and less at home.</p> <p>Maybe this was because we never believed that home was for us to begin with. Young adults are about <a href=\"https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/poor-millennials/\">half as likely to own a home</a> today as they were in 1975. Silicon Valley thought leaders told us that we were too \u201cYolo\u201d to be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70oQeqSKib0\">burdened by ownership</a> of goods, and were better suited to \u201cthe experience economy\u201d. As a group of people with a collective <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-1-trillion-debt-more-than-any-other-generation-in-history-2019-3\">$1</a><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-1-trillion-debt-more-than-any-other-generation-in-history-2019-3\">t</a><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-1-trillion-debt-more-than-any-other-generation-in-history-2019-3\">n in student loan debt</a>, this was all too convenient to believe. The experience economy was a lovely lie while it lasted, but now we are left with empty apartments, empty bank accounts and CANCEL RENT signs taped to windows. As millions have been laid off or are lucky to work from home, we have been forced to stop dreaming about <a href=\"https://news.airbnb.com/a-message-from-co-founder-and-ceo-brian-chesky/\">our next Airbnb</a>, and look at our surroundings.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As millions have been laid off or are lucky to work from home, we have been forced to stop dreaming about our next Airbnb, and look at our surroundings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What other cultures have known since the dawn of civilization is just now becoming apparent to young adults: home is not just a place to store your body between working hours. It is your center of gravity.</p> <p>This moment of economic pause and forced domesticity can transform our relationship with home and work. Our instinct coming out of a recession is to work harder, to place more merit on our ability to earn, all while drowning ourselves in Seamless takeout. But what if we\u2019re wrong?</p> <p>Perhaps the real lesson of quarantine is that home life matters. If we believe this, we must commit to it as a society: in 2017, France enacted a law giving employees the \u201c<a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/02/technology/france-office-email-workers-law/\">right to disconnect</a>\u201d after work hours. As millennials age into managerial roles and determine how we and others will spend working hours, we can decide that the future of work should not be one of martyrdom and 80-hour workweeks. And rather than outsource our domestic lives by buying into the experience economy and \u201cmommy apps\u201d, we may find ways to \u201cinsource\u201d home life: creating products and services that deepen our involvement with home.</p> <p>Let\u2019s use this economic pause to roll up our sleeves and cross the domestic divide as a society. If we decide that home matters as much as work does (or, is more important) let us agree and make a better domestic life accessible for all.</p>",
  "<p>As one of hundreds of volunteers involved in the University of Oxford\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/30/astrazeneca-partners-with-oxford-university-to-produce-covid-19-vaccine\">coronavirus vaccine trials</a>, Dan McAteer said he had a few nerves on the day of receiving the jab itself.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Italian doctors find link between Covid-19 and inflammatory disorder</h2> <p>Doctors in Italy have reported the first clear evidence of a link between Covid-19 and a rare but serious inflammatory disorder that has required some children to undergo life-saving treatment in intensive care units. The mysterious condition emerged last month when NHS bosses issued an alert to doctors after hospitals admitted a number of children with a mix of toxic shock and symptoms seen in an inflammatory disorder known as Kawasaki disease.</p> <h2>Deaths worldwide near 300,000</h2> <p>The number of lives lost worldwide in the pandemic is nearing 300,000, according to Johns Hopkins University figures, with 297,197 deaths reported. There are 4,347,015 confirmed infections. The true figures are likely to be significantly higher as a result of underreporting or differing definitions of what constitutes a death from coronavirus.</p> <h2>Japan lifts state of emergency for 39 of 47 prefectures</h2> <p>The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has lifted the state of emergency for 39 of its 47 prefectures, but said it would remain in place in Tokyo, as well as the second-largest urban area of Osaka, until the coronavirus is contained. Abe also said he would begin work on a second extra budget as part of his government\u2019s economic stimulus measures. \u201cWhile controlling the spread of the virus as much as possible by acting on the premise that the virus is all around us, we will restore ordinary work and daily life,\u201d Abe told a news conference.</p> <h2>French firm\u2019s pledge to prioritise US with vaccine causes outrage</h2> <p>The British head of a French pharmaceutical company has caused an outcry by saying any vaccine discovered by his firm would initially be reserved for the United States. Paul Hudson, chief executive officer of Sanofi, told Bloomberg News that any vaccine invented by his firm would go to the US first since it had done the most to fund the company\u2019s research. France\u2019s higher education minister, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Vidal, said Sanofi\u2019s plan to give the US priority access would be \u201cincomprehensible and disgraceful\u201d since a successful vaccine must be \u201ca public good for the world\u201d.</p> <h2>EU monitoring Hungary over emergency legislation</h2> <p>The European commission has said it is monitoring the Hungarian government over coronavirus laws that created a state of emergency with no end date. The commission, the body charged with upholding European Union law, said the absence of a clear time limit on the emergency decree raises \u201cpotential concerns as regards legal certainty\u201d, while a media law criminalising the spreading of misinformation about the pandemic \u201cmay have a chilling effect on freedom of expression in Hungary\u201d.</p> <h2>Burundi expels four-person WHO team ahead of elections</h2> <p>Burundi\u2019s foreign ministry, in a letter to the World Health Organization\u2019s Africa headquarters, said the UN agency\u2019s representative in Burundi and his three colleagues \u201care declared persona non grata and as such, must leave the territory of Burundi\u201d by Friday. The letter did not provide a reason for the decision. Diplomatic and administrative sources told AFP the foreign ministry aborted a similar attempt to expel the same four officials a month ago. The east African nation is scheduled to hold a presidential election on 20 May.</p> <h2>Afghanistan records biggest one-day rise in coronavirus cases</h2> <p>Afghanistan has recorded its biggest one-day rise of new cases as the health ministry warned of a second phase of transmission amid war raging with full intensity across the country. Wahid Majroh, the deputy health minister, has warned the nation that if it continued to break the lockdown there would be another phase of the virus. The health ministry recorded 413 new transmissions over the past day, the biggest one-day rise of new cases, and four deaths, raising the total number of infections to 5,639 and the death toll to 136.</p> <h2>Lloyd\u2019s of London expects to pay out up to \u00a33.5bn</h2> <p>Lloyd\u2019s of London, the world\u2019s biggest insurance market, expects to pay out between $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) and $4.3bn (\u00a33.5bn) to its customers due to the coronavirus pandemic, as it warned of a $203bn hit for the entire industry. The Lloyd\u2019s of London chief executive, John Neal, said the pandemic was an unparalleled event. \u201cWhat makes Covid-19 unique is the not just the devastating continuing human and social impact, but also the economic shock,\u201d he said. \u201cTaking all those factors together will challenge the industry as never before.\u201d</p> <h2>Burr\u2019s cellphone seized by federal agents</h2> <p>US federal agents have seized the cellphone of Republican senator Richard Burr as they investigate stock transactions made in the early days of the coronavirus crisis.

  "<p>I remember, right at the start of the coronavirus lockdown, thinking that Disney+ would be a godsend. Finally, I thought, some quality. I could spend all this newfound time with my children soaking up Disney\u2019s huge archive of old animated features. We could watch some of the most important movies ever made, and we could do it together. The first film I saw at the cinema was The Jungle Book, with my dad. It was a gift from my father, and now Disney+ was letting me give it to my children in turn. It was beautiful.</p> <p>Except last week we watched The Jungle Book, and it turns out that my memory of the film was much better than the film itself. I\u2019d forgotten the end, where Mowgli is essentially led back to his village by his own boner after <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYnbzXPAxNo\">catching a glimpse of an absurdly sexualised 10-year-old girl</a>.</p> <p>A similar thing happens in Bambi. Now, Bambi is a film with plenty of problems \u2013 it\u2019s painfully slow, and the famous scene of his mum getting killed is brushed off within seconds \u2013 but I\u2019d forgotten the bit where Bambi returns to the forest as an adolescent and a creepy owl basically tells him: \u201cWell, you\u2019re probably going to want to start humping things now.\u201d</p> <p>Pinocchio loses its nostalgic sheen almost immediately, when you realise that Geppetto\u2019s clocks variously depict a man trying to murder a bird, a man attempting to decapitate a turkey, an alcoholic person and a woman beating her own child.

Beauty and the Beast makes the list, possibly because it\u2019s a textbook manual for coercive control. So does <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jul/10/aristocrats-review-brian-friel-play\">The Aristocats</a> and Peter Pan, probably thanks to the respective depiction of Asians and Native Americans.

The crows are racial stereotypes (one of them is called Jim Crow). There\u2019s a song where the only black people in the entire film hammer pegs into the ground while happily proclaiming: \u201cWe slave until we\u2019re almost dead.\u201d There\u2019s the \u201cpink elephants on parade\u201d segment, where Dumbo gets drunk and hallucinates a menacing Technicolor human made of 17 disembodied elephant heads. And, don\u2019t forget, the happy ending of the entire film \u2013 the moral payoff to a story of enforced parental abandonment \u2013 comes in the form of the US government licensing Dumbo\u2019s likeness in order to produce a fleet of heavily armoured bombers in his image.</p> <p>Of course, these films are products of their time, and judging things from the past by today\u2019s standards is a fool\u2019s errand. And my children have accidentally watched much more immediately distressing things under lockdown \u2013 an innocent YouTube search for \u201cLego Avengers\u201d brought up a homemade video of Captain America getting stabbed by a burglar, for example.

  "<p>The non-meat chopping board I have used for more than a decade is awful. It is a mini butcher\u2019s block, at least 10cm thick, half a metre long and so heavy I cannot pick it up with one hand. It will not fit in the sink to be washed efficiently. And, of course, it\u2019s made of wood, which is never ideal. There\u2019s probably now more culture on its surface than on a whole night of BBC Four. It is dreadful in so many ways. I also can\u2019t imagine cooking without it.</p> <p>Like everyone else, I\u2019ve spent far too much time in the kitchen recently doing a culinary version of rinse and repeat. During this marathon cookathon, I\u2019ve come to realise that there are objects in there which aren\u2019t just useful. They are vital to my sense of self as a cook. I depend upon them. That stupid, cumbersome, ill-thought out, much-loved chopping board is only the start of it. For example, I have three sets of tongs in my utensil drawer. I say \u201cdrawer\u201d; I really mean \u201cyawning maw of wretched chaos that is a visualisation of my confused inner self\u201d. There\u2019s a long black plastic number with tips that are incapable of gripping. There\u2019s a springy metal set that are so short you\u2019ll also chargrill your hand on a flame if you try to use them over the cooker.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Oh, the stories that frying pan could tell. We\u2019ve been through so much together</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And then there\u2019s the pair I actually use: not too long so that they\u2019re cumbersome, but long enough to provide distance from the pan; a rounded plastic handle on each side; a manageable spring loading. Without these in my grip I am not in control. As one of the reasons I cook, apart from greed, is to project control on to a messed-up world by bending ingredients to my will, this is important.</p> <p>I have three frying pans. Two of them are really only there for use on violent intruders in the dead of night or, at a push, for emergency bacon sandwich action. The one I want to use, the one I reach for first, is a 35-year-old piece of dirty orange Le Creuset, with a wooden handle that\u2019s starting to come loose. It\u2019s a health and safety disaster. It\u2019s also the ideal size, and the cast iron surface is perfectly seasoned. Oh, the stories that frying pan could tell. We\u2019ve been through so much together, that pan and me. I\u2019ve watched it smoke furiously after 10 minutes on a roaring burner in preparation for a steak and then, after that job is done, seen flames leap from the surface, courtesy of half a glass of brandy chucked in to deglaze. At each point I\u2019ve always known how it would behave. I trust it.</p> <p>I have a square of thin, slightly bendy steel with a rubber handle, given to me by the chef Nick Nairn, which he told me is called a \u201cgosunder\u201d, because it \u201cgoes under\u201d chopped veg to get them to the pan. Without the gosunder, I am at a personal disadvantage. I favour my ancient, dowdy metal whisk over my newer, vibrant silicone one, even though the latter is clearly more acutely engineered. And don\u2019t get me started on the extreme prejudice with which I select a wooden spoon. There must be 20 in that drawer. Only holding the one with the myriad stove burn notches on the handle makes me feel secure.</p> <p>All of this is ludicrous. It is the magical thinking of a toddler. If I\u2019m any good at this whole cooking lark it shouldn\u2019t matter which board, pan or whisk I use. But right now, it really does. There are two explanations for this: first, cooking is not just functional. It\u2019s emotional. And second, I am currently in the process of losing the plot. </p>",

One dazzling study followed another as Dronke put his considerable mental powers to repositioning neglected philosophical approaches to the body and sexuality, to social justice and ethnic stereotyping, to redressing the picture of cultural exchange across social classes, and rehabilitating vernacular forms and popular expressions: songs, ballads, legends, myths \u2013 and film.</p> <p>His first book, for example, Medieval Latin and the Rise of European Love-Lyric (two volumes, 1965\u201366), argued that far from \u201ccourtly love\u201d originating with the troubadours in France, it developed within a stream of poetry and song from demotic Latin and the Arab world, with deep roots far from Provence \u2013 in ancient Egypt, Baghdad, Georgia, India and Iceland. Above all, Dronke believed in the power of imagination and acted with exceptional acuity to unfold the beauty and ethics of its creations, from a towering work such as Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy to a little known, anonymous lyrical Lament of Dido.</p> <p>The underlying resistance to hierarchies and unquestioned authorities was strengthened by his marriage in 1960 to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/25/ursula-dronke-obituary\" title=\"\">Ursula Brown</a>. She was a scholar of Icelandic and Old Norse, the editor and translator of the Poetic Edda, a collection of mythological and heroic poetry. Together they wrote Growth of Literature: The Sea and the God of the Sea (1997-98), a lively account of Tritons, selkies (seal folk) and sirens north and south. When she and Dronke were going on a visiting fellowship to the US, she was refused a visa \u2013 she had joined the Communist party at the age of 15.</p> <p>Born in Cologne, Peter came from a family of scholars, teachers, lawyers and civil servants \u2013 largely freethinkers \u2013 on his father\u2019s side, while on his mother\u2019s he inherited interests in poetry and psychology. She was Maria Kronfeld, an actor in Berlin, who continued performing after her marriage till 1936, when the racial laws prevented her \u2013 she was part Jewish, though herself a devout Catholic. Peter\u2019s father, Adolf Dronke, a judge, was opposed to the Third Reich, and dismissed on account of his wife\u2019s Jewish background.</p> <p>At the end of 1938, with the help of Catholic contacts, Maria left Germany for Britain. Four months later Peter and his sister followed her, accompanied by their nanny, who hid money between the stuck-together pages of an art book. Their father joined them, but too late for British work permits; the family was offered a choice of emigration to Brazil or New Zealand. The papers for the latter arrived first, and they sailed to Wellington, arriving in August 1939.</p> <p>Adolf worked in a prosthetic limb factory and \u2013 confidentially \u2013 as a government censor of German documents. He helped found the national orchestra, where he played double bass and cello; at home the family organised quartets of their friends. Maria increasingly directed plays rather than acted. Their Wellington household reproduced the hospitable and cultured world of Mitteleuropa before the Nazis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c5c2a330cba470d5cf066a389d42c0c661b0b8f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5c2a330cba470d5cf066a389d42c0c661b0b8f3/0_106_1139_1424/800.jpg\" alt=\"Born in Cologne and brought up in Wellington, New Zealand, Peter Dronke baffled colleagues at Oxford when he arrived as a polyglot Kiwi fired up by abstruse medieval writings, music and the latest Japanese movies\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Born in Cologne, Peter Dronke baffled those he met at Oxford when he arrived from Wellington as a polyglot Kiwi fired up by abstruse medieval writings, music and the latest Japanese movies</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Peter leapt a couple of years at Catholic schools and entered Victoria College, Wellington (now Victoria University of Wellington), when he was only just 16. When he won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1954, those he met there were baffled by this polyglot Kiwi who was fired up by abstruse medieval writings, music and the latest Japanese movies.</p> <p>After gaining an Oxford degree (1957) he became a junior research fellow at Merton College, and in 1961 moved to Cambridge as a lecturer in medieval Latin, rising to professor (1989-2001), and then emeritus. He told me he chose to become a fellow of Clare Hall, Cambridge, as it was then the only college to admit women fellows alongside men.</p> <p>Though his health declined after Ursula\u2019s death in 2012, he produced unstoppably: a new edition of the Roman 6th-century philosopher <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/boethius/\" title=\"\">Boethius</a> and a trailblazing in-depth introduction and commentary to the radical ninth-century theologian <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scottus-eriugena/\" title=\"\">John Scotus Eriugena</a> (the name means Irish-born). His Periphyseon (On the Natures of the Universe, five volumes, 2012-17) openly dismisses scriptural literalism: it was \u201ctoo simple-minded, thinking that paradise was some place on earth, that the trees were earthly and the fountains physically perceivable. True Reason laughs at this.\u201d </p> <p>During numerous hospital stays, Dronke continued another pioneering study, of <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/35977/35977-h/35977-h.htm\" title=\"\">Heloise\u2019s questions to Abelard and his responses</a>, after the 12th-century lovers were separated and confined in different religious establishments. In all these last works, he kept faith with seven decades of intellectual devotion to the cause of reawakening the voices of thoughtful, life-loving men and women whose controversial views brought them into trouble and, eventually, disrepute and silence.</p> <p>Dronke had a meticulous scholastic mind, and a vast appetite for difficulty and toil. He was also a hedonist, an ardent theatre-, concert- and filmgoer (especially to the screenings of work from Iran, for example, at the London Film festival) and an unwavering European (until Ursula\u2019s death they went every summer to their house in Brittany). He never attuned himself to the computer age: he must have been one of the last writers to post typewritten manuscripts to his publisher.

His counter-intuitive nature, as well as a ruthless approach to keeping costs low, built an airline that carried more than <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-lufthansa-traffic/lufthansa-usurps-ryanair-to-regain-place-as-europes-biggest-airline-idUKKBN1EZ271\">140 million passengers</a> a year at its peak, generating profits of more than \u20ac1.4bn (\u00a31.2bn).</p> <p>Personal pride, as well as near 4% ownership of the company and a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49751711\">bonus plan</a> that could pay him \u20ac99m if he gets the share price high enough by 2024, are incentives to get his aircraft back where he wants them. Ryanair went into this crisis with enormous cash reserves \u2013 of about \u20ac4bn \u2013 but they are being sucked away with 450 aircraft on the ground. </p> <p>From July O\u2019Leary plans to lead the recovery of the ailing European aviation industry by restoring about 40% of Ryanair\u2019s flights, which would be 1,000 flights a day, flying from as many as possible of its 80 bases around Europe. He announced a range of measures that he believes will make Ryanair flights safe.</p> <p>O\u2019Leary has to hope that enough customers will overcome their fears of contracting the virus and regard the protections offered on the flights as sufficient. He expects them to plump for the attraction of a holiday.</p> <p>He knows that many people will not be inclined to following official advice, particularly as their patience wears thin. He may be confident that they won\u2019t share the pessimism of the British health secretary, Matt Hancock, about the likelihood of taking a foreign holiday.

He may be hamstrung though by constraints beyond his control, whatever his reading of public desires.

  "<p>We\u2019re now in month two of the Great Coronavirus Lockdown of 2020. Of my friends without children, one half have become ninja masters of the sourdough arts, and the other half are practising mindfulness during their enforced solitude, as they hunker down quietly at home.</p> <p>My family is doing the precise opposite. The TV goes on at the beginning of the day. Laptops are set up in the dining room. Tablets and games consoles are whipped out at will, and the house is alive with the sound of typing and overlapping voices on video-conferencing software and Sonic the Hedgehog game walkthroughs (thank you YouTube Kids).</p> <p>It\u2019s a functioning, necessary chaos. I am in lockdown with my family \u2013 two full-time working adults, my husband and me, and our two small sons.</p> <p>Unlike the sourdough and mindful people, lockdown has given working parents less time in the day, not more. We\u2019re having to work full-time, as though our kids were in school or childcare; parent full-time, as though it were a weekend and work was the furthest thing from our minds; <em>and </em>we\u2019re also home-schooling our kids so their brains and social skills don\u2019t atrophy before term-time comes back around.</p> <p>Plus we\u2019re having to do all of this simultaneously<em>. </em>Our older son, at just five years old, is too illiterate to curl up with a book while we work. And his younger brother is only two, so he doesn\u2019t quite understand that he can\u2019t clamber all over me while I\u2019m in a virtual team meeting, \u201cplay piano\u201d on my laptop keyboard, or ask who \u201cthat ugly angry man\u201d is.</p> <p>So, how? How, in my home, do we manage this series of impossible tasks without the assistance of a magical, Harry Potter-style time-turner? First, by dramatically relaxing how we define working, parenting and, sometimes, \u201cthe acceptable length of time to leave a nappy unchanged\u201d.</p> <p>Second, we get up obscenely early so one of us can parent in the morning and work in the afternoon (and vice-versa). Finally, we squeeze our wireless broadband connection for every spare nanosecond it can give us. Here\u2019s how our broadband connection is helping us cling on to our sanity ...</p> <p><strong>Empowering our five-year-old<br></strong>Lockdown came six months into our older son\u2019s first year at primary school, just when he was beginning to imprint his own personality on the world. It has shut him away from his friends, and made him share his space, time and toys with a two-year-old.</p> <p>When he\u2019s good, we give our son total control over our smart TV, and tell him he can watch whatever he likes on YouTube Kids \u2013 providing he spells out the search terms himself. As a result, our son is much happier about sharing with his brother, and \u2013 as his teacher noticed during his Google Classroom sessions \u2013 his spelling is improving. I just hope she doesn\u2019t read this and figure out why.</p> <p>I don\u2019t like to imagine how we\u2019d cope without access to YouTube Kids, but I very much expect it would involve me spraying myself blue like Sonic and running around the house as fast as I could, until I keeled over.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/keep-connected/2020/may/12/lets-go-surfing-10-amazing-ideas-for-online-family-activities\">Let\u2019s go surfing: 10 amazing ideas for online family activities</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Socialising our toddler<br></strong>Although our younger son\u2019s nursery has ostensibly closed for the time being, its staff are still diligently posting videos to its Facebook page so that the kids can have dance sessions, storytime, and music lessons.

Totally.</p> <p><strong>Indulging our interests<br></strong>At the end of our long day, when the children are in bed and the work laptops finally closed, my husband and I wearily crack open a beer, catch up with a friend over our own video chat, and then \u2013 because we\u2019re determined to remain relevant, and maintain our identities as people and not just parents \u2013 flip on a streaming service and settle down to watch whichever prestige drama is trending.

  "<h2><strong>Anthony Bourdain\u2019s food and life lessons</strong></h2> <p>Anthony Bourdain every time. He was not perfect, and some episodes of his TV shows are hard to watch given what we know now about his mental health struggles. But he showed the joys of travel: a drink and a chat with the table next door; eating street food at the stalls with the longest queues; and navigating the morals of travelling with humility and open eyes when you\u2019re often richer than the local people. I started watching his shows in my 20s, and it was because of him that we roughed it across Morocco, landed in Mumbai with no plans, and went to the most expensive wineries we could on a shoestring in Italy (arriving sweaty on bikes \u2013 they weren\u2019t impressed). He changed my life.<br><strong>Lydia Taylor</strong></p> <h2>My brilliant Aunt Linda</h2> <p>Aunt Linda was from humble beginnings: growing up, a holiday for her was a day trip to Weston-super-Mare. On leaving school she became a nanny. My earliest memory is of Christmas Eve when I was two, and my aunt randomly turning up on our doorstep in Birmingham, fresh off a flight from Australia. As I grew up, I would get so excited when, every few months, we\u2019d receive a postcard from her from Jordan, the US, Germany, Lebanon, Greece or wherever. It was <em>so</em> exotic: no one from Erdington did that. Subsequently, I did a decent amount of travelling and have lived abroad. All because of those postcards, with their funny-looking stamps and indecipherable postmarks. I\u2019m looking at the boomerang she gave me that Christmas. I\u2019m 44 now.

  "<p>When Cameroonian author Daniel Alain Nsegbe first saw his debut novel for sale in his home city of Douala, the price was so high \u201cyou would have to ask someone to stop eating for two days in order to buy the book\u201d. It was around 16,000 CFA francs (\u00a320); the average monthly salary in Douala is \u00a3150. The book, <em>Ceux qui sortent dans la nuit </em>(Those Who Go Out at Night) was published by Grasset, a French imprint.</p> <p>This is not uncommon: Francophone African authors, whether classic or contemporary, are often published by French, not African presses. This arrangement began in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/colonialism\">colonial</a> times, but continues because of a number of factors that are particular to France. Publishers frequently push for world rights for all books written in French. Many African writers operate without agents, who would usually divide up rights territories on their behalf. Agents are still a new feature on the African literary landscape, meaning that many classics, such as 1953\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.lisez.com/livre-grand-format/lenfant-noir/9782259204316\">L\u2019enfant noir</a></em> (The African Child) by Guinean author Camara Laye, and Algerian writer Kateb Yacine\u2019s 1956 novel <em><a href=\"http://www.seuil.com/ouvrage/nedjma-export-kateb-yacine/9782020790383\">Nedjma</a>, </em>are owned by publishers in France (Plon and \u00c9ditions du Seuil respectively). As French publishers continue to control distribution and pricing, classic authors go missing from bookshelves while contemporary authors struggle to get their books in the hands of local readers. And in north and sub-Saharan Africa, there\u2019s also a lack of publishing infrastructure, so local pressesmust battle with issues such as distribution, piracy, cost and staffing \u2013 all of which can mean some authors simply prefer to be published in France.</p> <p>But a small movement is now under way, led by African authors who have realised that they don\u2019t need to hand over world rights to French publishers. Some are choosing to keep their African rights, ensuring that an African press (or even several) can publish their books locally at an affordable price. Others are opening their own publishing houses, such as L\u00e9onora Miano with Quilombo Publishing in Togo. And some are campaigning, like Ivorian author Armand Patrick Gbaka-Br\u00e9d\u00e9, who founded the <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2019/11/04/il-faut-rendre-son-independance-a-la-litterature-africaine_6017973_3232.html\">Front for the Liberation of African Classics</a> in 2019, a collective calling for French publishers to give up the African rights to classic literature.</p> <p>Nsegbe, who writes under the name Mutt-Lon, was helped by the Paris-based <a href=\"https://www.alliance-editeurs.org/?lang=en\">Alliance for Independent Publishers</a>, who renegotiated for him with his publisher Grasset; subsequently, <a href=\"https://www.alliance-editeurs.org/ceux-qui-sortent-dans-la-nuit,1405?lang=fr\">a pan-African edition </a>of <em>Ceux qui sortent dans la nuit</em> was put out by an alliance of seven African publishers in 2017. His most recent book was published by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EditionsEmmanuelleCollas/photos/rpp.547461715590559/1027592560910803/?type=3&amp;theater\">\u00c9ditions Emmanuelle Colas</a> in France \u2013 but also by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/editions.grainesdepensees\">Graines de Pens\u00e9es</a> (Togo), <a href=\"http://editionsganndal.blogspot.com/\">\u00c9ditions Ganndal</a> (Guinea) and <a href=\"http://editionsproximite.cm/\">Proximit\u00e9</a> (Cameroon).</p> <p>\u201cI understand now that my books need to be published in Africa as well so that they can reach my readers,\u201d says Nsegbe. Before the pan-African edition, his second novel was published by a Cameroonian publisher and struggled to get distributed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the publisher\u2019s fault, it\u2019s a structural problem with the publishing industry. It\u2019s a real battle.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's a process of negotiation, with the rights people, with the export division, and many publishers are unwilling</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe are working on a process of awareness with French publishers on rights in African territories,\u201d says Laurence Hugues, director of the Alliance. \u201cIt\u2019s a process of negotiation, with the rights people, with the export division, and many are unwilling [to negotiate],\u201d she says, adding that smaller publishers were more open to discussion. When they are, the Alliance helps the African publishers, finding funding and ensuring that the books stay affordable, usually priced around \u00a34. In Nsegbe\u2019s case, \u201che was able to travel to different countries in Africa to promote his book, and he saw the impact it had on publishers and readers.\u201d </p> <p>Ivorian author V\u00e9ronique Tadjo asked to keep her African rights nearly 20 years ago when she saw that her books were only affordable to an elite. \u201cAt first African authors were surprised that they could keep their rights for Africa and often were afraid to ask them of their French publishers, who can be very possessive,\u201d says Tadjo, who has had positive experiences with her French publishers, Actes Sud and \u00c9ditions Don Quichotte.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6df089ac5b261afdd9eed28966eae054fb8746d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6df089ac5b261afdd9eed28966eae054fb8746d4/0_178_6048_3629/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Developing movement \u2026 Hemley Boum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Developing movement \u2026 Hemley Boum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Marc Zaorski/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cameroonian <a href=\"http://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/Blanche/Les-jours-viennent-et-passent\">Hemley Boum</a> was \u201cdelighted\u201d to be able to keep her rights for Africa for the first time for her most recent book <em>Les jours viennent et passent</em> (The Days Come and Go), which was published by Gallimard in France and <a href=\"https://www.editionseburnie.com/Litt%C3%A9rature_g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale\">\u00c9ditions \u00c9burnie</a> in Ivory Coast. Her previous books were difficult to find in Africa, she says, and when they were, the prices were too high. She says she discusses this problem frequently with other African authors who are concerned about the cost and availability of their work. \u201cWith the developing professionalisation of African publishers, this trend [of publishing in Africa] will increase and become long-lasting,\u201d Boum says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s tricky terrain,\u201d says Pierre Astier of <a href=\"https://pierreastier.com/\">Astier-P\u00e9cher literary agency</a>, who, besides fighting for African rights for his contemporary authors, plans to \u201cdiplomatically\u201d approach French publishers who own rights to African classics and convince them to revert some rights to local publishers. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was clear that I should consider it an honour that Gallimard would even mention Cl\u00e9 as the original publisher</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cameroonian editor Marcelin Vounda Etoa ran one of Africa\u2019s oldest publishing houses, <a href=\"http://editionscle.info/\">\u00c9ditions Cl\u00e9</a>, until 2016. A few years ago, Gallimard, which holds rights to many of Congolese author Henri Lopes\u2019s books, tried to acquire the rights from Cl\u00e9 for his 1971 classic <em><a href=\"http://editionscle.info/index.php/catalogue/genres/romans/97-nouvelles/456-tribaliques\">Tribaliques</a></em>. Vounda Etoa says he suggested a co-edition, but Gallimard refused. \u201cIt was clear that I should consider it an honour that Gallimard would even mention Cl\u00e9 as the original publisher,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cWhy would Gallimard publish a co-edition?\u201d asks Jean-No\u00ebl Schifano, who in 1989 founded Gallimard imprint <a href=\"http://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/Continents-Noirs\">Continents Noirs</a> (Black Continents), which has since published 51 authors from African countries. \u201cFrom the start, we ensured that all books, whether 500 or 1,000 pages, were sold for the equivalent of \u20ac9.50 (\u00a38.50) on the African continent.\u201d</p> <p>When asked if he would consider returning authors\u2019 rights for Africa, Schifano says, \u201cI have never been asked this question by authors. They sign a contract for three books and have absolute freedom. They publish with Gallimard to be recognised, and have an echo on the [African] continent.\u201d</p> <p>Tadjo says: \u201cI think the movement is still too timid, but it\u2019s a question of adopting the habit, of getting organised, and putting pressure on [French] publishers.

One can\u2019t help but wonder what Australian politicians would do to protect their businesses under those circumstances and whether they would take a hard line against the US.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-14T09:11:44.764Z\">at 10.11am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebd03e98f08a55ecde59b6c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-14T08:43:45.895Z\">9.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And that has just been confirmed by the club, the Gold Coast Titans.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.titans.com.au/news/2020/05/14/cartwright-and-kelly-update/\">In a statement</a>, the club said that player <strong>Brian Kelly</strong> had received \u201cboth the influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccinations\u201d and is cleared to play. </p> \n  <p><strong>Bryce Cartwright </strong>has obtained a medical exemption and will be able to play without taking any vaccines. </p> \n  <p>The club said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><strong>Bryce Cartwright</strong> provided the club with medical documentation seeking an exemption from the influenza vaccine protocol. </p> \n   <p>This was subsequently passed on to Queensland\u2019s chief medical officer <strong>Jeannette Young</strong> for review.</p> \n   <p>Dr Young has granted Cartwright an exemption based on medical grounds.</p> \n   <p>Cartwright is now eligible to return to training with the playing squad in preparation for the season restart.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/14/bryce-cartwright-granted-medical-exemption-from-flu-shot-and-will-play-nrl-season\">Bryce Cartwright cleared to play NRL season after getting medical exemption from flu shot</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0360b4056c9ef1d371facec0f2b76a8e3b38d93f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0360b4056c9ef1d371facec0f2b76a8e3b38d93f/0_142_2881_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bryce Cartwright during the Gold Coast Titans training session 6 May 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bryce Cartwright during the Gold Coast Titans training session 6 May 2020.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-14T09:20:56.462Z\">at 10.20am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebcfd618f08d99d46a16a65\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-14T08:22:32.957Z\">9.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And in further sport news, the anti-vaccination NRL player, <strong>Bryce Cartwright</strong>, was initially given a deadline of 5pm today to decide whether he will get a flu vaccination, or walk away from his playing contract. </p> \n  <p>According to reports from Channel 7, Cartwright has written to the Queensland health officer and obtained a medical exemption to the vaccine, claiming that he has previously had a bad reaction.</p> \n  <p>This means he should be free to train and play.</p> \n  <p>We\u2019ll bring you more when it has been confirmed.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisGarry7/status/1260845423163400192\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: Bryce Cartwright has been given medical exemption to play in the NRL.

It might be worthwhile if Peter Dutton remembers that he has a day job that is to be the minister for home affairs in the government of Australia.

Penberthy wrote that it was \u201cdebatable\u201d whether Ressler should have been called to give evidence and that health minister <strong>Brad Hazzard</strong> should have been called instead. </p> \n  <p>He described the questioning as \u201can act of state-sponsored bastardry designed to ensure that whatever villains are found in this affair do not inhabit NSW cabinet\u201d, and called it \u201ca taxpayer funded show trial aimed at achieving a political end\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The counsel assisting the inquiry, <strong>Richard Beasley</strong> SC, said there were 10 valid reasons why they questioned Ressler, denied that any member of the NSW government had interfered with the inquiry, and said this language could constitute contempt. </p> \n  <p>The newspaper has now apologised, saying the op-ed was \u201cintended to be a discussion of political matters [and] was not intended to be critical of the inquiry itself or the commissioner\u201d.</p> \n </div> \n <p

He\u2019s not eligible for jobkeeper because he\u2019s a casual with less than 12 months\u2019 experience and his future contract is not taken into account.

At $1,100, this is effectively a doubling of that safety net that was previously in place. Now, Mr Speaker, as ... the honourable member will know, some six million Australians are now covered by the businesses that have formally enrolled for the payment, together with the jobkeeper payment, together with the 1.6m that are on the jobseeker payment. </p> \n   <p>We\u2019re talking over half the Australian workforce. </p> \n   <p>But I could also let the honourable member know through the PM\u2019s work, through the national cabinet, the work of the premiers and the chief ministers, they\u2019ve set out a three-stage framework for lifting restrictions. </p> \n   <p>Treasury have forecast that the benefit to the economy, and to jobs, from lifting those restrictions, based on the health advice, will be some 850,000 jobs and $9.4bn to the economy. </p> \n   <p>Now, in relation to those, who work in the arts and the recreation sector, if those three stages are followed through, 76,000 jobs will be created, or people will get back to work in that particular sector. When you look at opening pubs, cafes, and other entertainment venues and other venues you\u2019re looking at a $2.4bn dividend to Australia. </p> \n   <p>We know we needed to put in place temporary, targeted, proportionate measures in response to the biggest economic shock that Australia has ever seen.

However despite its unproven effectiveness in treating Covid-19, Australia\u2019s low number of Covid-19 cases, and a two-week waiting list at pharmacists for people who need the drug to treat autoimmune conditions, the Therapeutic Goods Administration said the drugs were imported under a specific exemption in the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and \u201ccannot be lawfully released for general use\u201d.</p> <h2>Queensland considers a $200m bid for Virgin Australia</h2> <p>The Queensland government is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/14/virgin-australia-queensland-government-could-join-multiple-bids-for-airline\">canvassing the possibility of partnering with other bidders for Virgin Australia</a>, one month after the struggling airline went into administration.

  "<p>When a new decade dawned a few short months ago, many predicted that the dominant theme would be China\u2019s continued emergence and role in a world that was changing quickly. Few suspected that the rivalry and antagonism between China and the west would be framed by a global pandemic, and by the challenges \u2013 and opportunities \u2013 that it has offered to countries around the world, not least China itself.</p> <p>China was where Covid-19 struck first; and it is where life is getting back to normal, albeit slowly. Manufacturing and production are rising, with factories open and starting to get back to similar levels to the second half of last year. Although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/09/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-approach-4-million-trump-us-unemployment-covid-19-lockdown-uk-italy-russia?page=with:block-5eb669f58f08c0a2409ba964\">fewer than three cases a day</a> had been reported, alongside a handful of asymptomatic cases in the past two weeks, the emergence of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/now-it-starts-again-new-coronavirus-outbreaks-spark-unease-in-china\">cluster of infections in Shulan</a>, in north-east China, and the announcement that the entire population of Wuhan is to be tested in the coming days, show how nerves are still jangling about new waves of the disease. Still, data released by customs authorities last week shows that although there was a large decline in imports, exports rose year on year for the month of April \u2013 largely due to massive shipments of healthcare products.</p> <p>It is quite a turnaround. The catastrophic handling of the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan led to infections on a global scale. Many outside China wondered whether the failings of the authorities in Hubei province and beyond would lead to major political change in the country. Instead, we find Li Keqiang, the premier of the state council, telling us that \u201cthe virus is the common enemy of mankind\u201d and saying that Chinese people are \u201cwilling to join hands with the people around the world\u201d in an effort to defeat the disease.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, China is less keen to talk about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/07/coronavirus-chinese-rage-death-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\">what it got wrong</a> than about what it is doing right: face masks, surgical gowns and ventilators have been distributed around the world, as we keep being reminded. China alone can\u2019t supply a pandemic-gripped planet with ventilators, one industrial ministry official was quoted as saying in April. It wants to play the role of saviour, rather than villain.</p> <p>Control of that narrative is helped by the own goals provided by countries that have \u2013 or perhaps had \u2013 reputations for competence. In the UK, the prime minister missed crucial meetings, boasted about shaking hands before being infected and taken to intensive care. In the US, where infections are well past <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/\">the million mark</a> and the death toll is anticipated to double this month alone, the president has said \u201cwe have it under control\u201d, urged citizens to \u201cliberate\u201d states that have locked down and recommended highly unusual areas of medical research as possible cures for the coronavirus.</p> <p>The high infection rates across many developed, democratic countries have helped divert the narrative away from China and its supposed \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/05/prevent-coronavirus-chernobyl-international-disaster\">Chernobyl moment</a>\u201d to one of why democracies have performed so badly with the pandemic. It is a message that falls on fertile ground in many parts of the world. For example, the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya news station remarked that \u201cChina is the only country that has performed well in dealing with this crisis\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-diplomacy-how-russia-china-and-eu-vie-to-win-over-serbia\">Solidarity in Europe \u201cdoes not exist\u201d</a>, said Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, the president of Serbia, in an angry statement about import restrictions imposed by the European Union. \u201cThe only country that can help us is China,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Such comments, made in the heat of the moment, can flatter to deceive \u2013 although China-watchers know how carefully Beijing has been cultivating its contacts in central and eastern Europe, including EU members, before the pandemic began. Likewise, the dispatch of medical equipment may well win short-term thanks, such as in Africa, where every country has <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/16/africa/jack-ma-donate-masks-coronavirus-africa/index.html\">received 100,000 masks (and more)</a> from Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma, but also strengthens the narrative of Chinese global leadership that has been articulated by Beijing in multiple countries, regions and formats for many years.</p> <p>It can be easy to over-emphasise the dividends, as a report by a thinktank affiliated to the Ministry of State Security in Beijing reveals. Despite the efforts to win hearts and minds, for all the investment and focus on other parts of the world, global anti-China sentiment is at its highest point since 1989 and the Tiananmen Square protests, according to sources familiar with the report, which was presented to the country\u2019s leadership. This has been led and fanned by the US. As a result, it warned, in the worst-case scenario, China needed to be ready for armed confrontation \u2013 and for war.</p> <p>That too needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. Although the threat of military conflict is one that Chinese president Xi Jinping has repeatedly spoken about, this is best understood as being designed for domestic consumption and as a means of framing an economy that was slowing before Covid-19. In fact, successive defence white papers issued by the Chinese military have emphasised both the low risks of serious confrontation, and the awareness that tensions need to be understood and managed carefully.</p> <p>In that sense, the reference to the potential for military conflict (and the fact that this was leaked) is most usefully interpreted as a sign of deliberate messaging: China recognises that the situation is serious, febrile and dangerous. Donald Trump\u2019s threat to seek \u201chundreds of billions\u201d in compensation is less of a concern, especially in a presidential election year, than his comments that \u201cwe can do something much easier than that \u2026 we have ways of doing things a lot easier than that\u201d. Even though Trump says many things that have to be retracted, clarified or dismissed, those words sounded ominous.</p> <p>Gathering reliable information from China has always been difficult and has become more so with the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/18/us-media-accuse-china-of-cold-war-mentality-after-move-to-expel-journalists\"> expulsion of highly experienced journalists</a> in recent weeks. Decisions about how to understand, let alone respond to, China are being taken blind, the result of educated guesswork and wishful thinking. When Trump\u2019s top Asia adviser made an<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/china-communist-party-coronavirus-us-trump\"> eloquent speech in Mandarin</a> in favour of pluralism, to mark the anniversary of the 4 May 1919 protests, it was met by excitable commentaries in the US suggesting it might seed a democratic political movement in China. Such thinking shows how much easier it is to see the patterns that westerners might want to see, rather than deal with the more prosaic realities.</p> <p>Ideological, political and security tensions between the US and China have a long history. But, as the distinguished scholar Evan Feigenbaum stresses, in the past coordination has been possible, not least economically, because of overlapping interests. Now the problem is that, for all China\u2019s talk of global leadership, it is doing little to lead international collective action. Nor, for that matter, is the US, the EU or anyone else. And in our me-first world, where states put their interests first, and find collaboration either increasingly difficult or unpalatable, this indeterminacy could have very significant consequences for global affairs.</p> <ul> <li><p>Peter Frankopan is professor of global history at the University of Oxford</p><p><br></p></li> </ul>",

Add a handful of grated provolone cheese and fresh basil, and mix until fully melted.</p> <p><br><strong>Cornershop noodles<br></strong>Carl Clarke, chef-founder of Chick \u2019n\u2019 sours, London, says to boil a full kettle, and make an omelette with two seasoned eggs and some finely sliced spring onion, then slice into strips. Slice and fry on a high heat for a few minutes half an onion, a pepper (any colour) and a handful of button mushrooms. If you like, throw in some cubed tinned meat (Spam, ham, corned beef etc). Add 4cm sliced fresh ginger and four cloves of garlic, along with a handful of green leaves. Pour over 170ml boiling water and add half a packet of chicken-flavoured instant noodles, along with the packet seasoning, and cook until most of the water is absorbed. Add the omelette. In another bowl, mix together 1 tbsp curry powder, 3 tbsp soy sauce, 3 tbsp fish sauce, 1 tbsp rice wine or dry sherry, 1 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp sesame oil and 2 tbsp cold water, and at the last moment, add to the noodles and stir. Garnish with sliced spring onion to serve.</p> <p><strong>Chicken noodle soup<br></strong>Food writer Molly Wizenberg, meanwhile, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/03/chicken-soup-recipe-parmesan-egg-noodles-molly-wizenberg-chef-taste-of-home-student\">this even simpler chicken noodle hack</a> (serves two), using tinned soup, vermicelli, egg and parmesan.</p> <p><strong>Buckwheat noodle salad<br></strong>As a post-home-schooling quick-fix for two, Nicholas Balfe of Salon, in Brixton, south London, says boil a full kettle then pour 1.5 litres into a saucepan on a high heat. Soft boil two eggs (six minutes \u2013 set a timer). Meanwhile, dress very thinly sliced carrot (use a peeler) with a pinch of salt and 50ml each of sesame oil and rice wine vinegar, some sesame seeds and some nori seaweed, cut up finely. In another bowl, season cucumber half-moons with 50ml soy sauce and a teaspoon of sugar. When cooked, plunge the eggs into cold water, then peel. In the reserved hot water, cook 250g buckwheat (soba) noodles according to the packet instructions (two to three minutes), then drain and rinse briefly. Divide the noodles between two bowls and place clusters of carrots, cucumber and protein (it could be shredded roast chicken, smoked fish, cubed silken tofu or red beans, seasoned with salt, lime zest and juice). Top each bowl with a halved egg, fresh herbs and toasted nuts, and serve with kimchi, pickles, and/or hot sauce on the side.</p> <p><strong>Spicy vegan bao buns<br></strong>These pineapple-glazed treats from chef Denai Moore (<a href=\"https://www.deestable.com/\">@dees_table</a>) are reason enough to keep a packet of ready-made bao buns in the freezer \u2026 In a saucepan, mix 120ml pineapple juice, half a de-seeded scotch bonnet chilli (or a milder one if you prefer), two tablespoons each of coconut sugar and soy sauce, and two thinly sliced garlic cloves. Bring to the boil, then reduce for six to eight minutes until sticky and glossy. Meanwhile, slice 10 asparagus spears and 10 button mushrooms and fry in olive oil until caramelised and brown (four minutes) and season with a pinch of sea salt. Add the pineapple glaze, then remove from the heat, stirring to coat evenly. Microwave four frozen buns according to packet instructions, then fill with thinly sliced cucumber topped with the mushroom and the asparagus on top. Garnish with fresh herbs to serve.</p> <p><strong>Eggs kagiana<br></strong>Asimakis Chaniotis, the Michelin-starred executive chef of Pied \u00e0 Terre, London, says: grate three large tomatoes into a pan, over a medium heat. Stirring continuously, add in seven whisked eggs to form a thick paste. Season to taste with salt, pepper and oregano and pour into an overproof dish. Top with 200g crumbled feta and bake at 220C, until the cheese begins to caramelise. Serves 2-3.</p> <p><strong>Chickpeas with feta and red onion<br></strong>Mix a drained tin of chickpeas in a large bowl with a sliced red onion, 100g of feta cheese, cubed, a handful of cherry tomatoes, some chopped black olives and fresh basil. Drizzle with olive oil and a teaspoon of sherry vinegar, and season to taste. Tom Kitchin serves this with roast hake portions, which you can easily do in the same 10 minutes (season then pan fry, skin side down, for a couple of minutes then place in a 180C oven for four minutes more). <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f53d10768890ee689fdc3330166e154aad0a5b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f53d10768890ee689fdc3330166e154aad0a5b9/274_164_3726_2236/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shawarma sandwich - fill a flatbread with spiced chicken and tomato.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shawarma sandwich - fill a flatbread with spiced chicken and tomato.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dmitriy Lukyanov/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Cheat\u2019s chicken shawarma<br></strong>After a long day, chefs Itamar Srulovich and Sarit Packer, of Honey and Co, London, often turn to this dish. Dice an onion and fry in a hot oily pan, add as much garlic and chilli as you want, dice a breast of chicken and toss it in, mixing until almost cooked. Then, they say, hit the spice rack: choose from baharat, Lebanese seven spice, ras el hanout, curry powder or a mix of cumin, paprika and a pinch of cinnamon with lots of black pepper. Serve with sliced tomato, flat breads and yoghurt. <br></p> <h2><strong>If you have 10 hours \u2026<br></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4efe8fa7397778e5d7876cf612df7aeef4b09523\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4efe8fa7397778e5d7876cf612df7aeef4b09523/0_550_7216_4330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gumbo, a rewarding investment of time. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gumbo, a rewarding investment of time. <br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LauriPatterson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Gumbo<br></strong>The night I spent meticulously following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/13/sara-roahen-chicken-sausage-gumbo-recipe-chef-interview-taste-of-home\">Sara Roahen\u2019s recipe</a> (live-chatting colour swatches with her to check my roux was asdone as it should be) is etched in my brain as <em>the</em> foundational culinary experience.

  "<p>On the surface, it is a classic tale of whistleblowing.</p> <p>A brave insider claiming to lay bare corporate power corrupting the US government. A truth teller courageously naming names who are part of what she calls a \u201ccircular cabal\u201d killing Americans.</p> <p>Seen from another perspective, the viral video of Dr Judy Mikovits blaming the coronavirus outbreak on a conspiracy led by big pharma, Bill Gates and the World Health Organization is the work of a discredited crank. But scientists fear that does not make her claims any less dangerous because, in an age of conspiracy theories, those about medicine have unusual potency.</p> <p>The film of Mikovits is taken from a soon to be released documentary, Plandemic, in which the virologist claims US health agencies buried her research showing vaccines weaken people\u2019s immune systems and made them more vulnerable to Covid-19. She also asserts that wearing masks is dangerous because it \u201cliterally activates your own virus\u201d.</p> <p>Mikovits\u2019s claims have gained currency in part because she points the finger at Dr Anthony Fauci, the face of the Trump administration\u2019s scientific advice on coronavirus and director of the agency she claims buried her research, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p> <p>In an added twist, Trump has given weight to Mikovits\u2019s claims with his own questioning about the origins and spread of Covid-19.</p> <p>The video racked up more than 7m views on YouTube before it was taken down for making false claims. Facebook followed suit after the film was pushed in particular by anti-vaccination groups. But conservative and rightwing media organisations have continued to promote Mikovits.</p> <p>Professor Eric Oliver, author of a book about conspiracy theories and the spread of false information, Enchanted America: How Intuition and Reason Divide Our Politics, said those about medical issues are the most widely circulated and believed.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we\u2019ve done surveys we\u2019ve consistently asked a question: do you think the Food Drug Administration has been deliberately withholding natural cures for cancer because of secret pressure from the pharmaceutical industry? Typically we get about 40% of people in our surveys who agree with that, and that is by far and a way the most commonly held conspiracy theory,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cMedical and health conspiracy theories do well because oftentimes they\u2019re not explicitly ideological in the way that other conspiracy theories are. They tend to cross ideological domains. The FDA conspiracy theory is endorsed as much by conservatives as it is by liberals.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday, Mikovits appeared for two hours on the <a href=\"https://truthnewsnet.org/\">Truth News Network</a> claiming that Covid-19 is only the latest in a series of false health crises created by the medical industry in league with the Gates Foundation to make money.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through swine flu, bird flu, Aids. All of the pandemics, epidemics are perpetrated fraud to control, to drive our healthcare system. Literally it\u2019s bankrupting our country,\u201d she said. \u201cA third of our gross national product is this medical cabal. Health insurance that we never had to have before that costs us thousands of dollars a month. Insurance for what? So you can buy their chemotherapies which literally help no one.\u201d</p> <p>Mikovits long ago lost credibility in the scientific community when the journal <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/fact-checking-judy-mikovits-controversial-virologist-attacking-anthony-fauci-viral\">Science</a> retracted a 2009 article the virologist co-authored claiming her research showed that a mouse retrovirus caused chronic fatigue syndrome .</p> <p>The controversy helped cost Mikovits her job at the Whittemore Peterson Institute. A few months later she was briefly jailed for allegedly removing a computer, notebooks and proprietary information from the institute although the charges were dropped on technicalities. Mikovits has since claimed she was arrested in an attempt by the \u201cdeep state\u201d to stop her revealing the truth.</p> <p>She has also been discredited over claims of having made a breakthrough in researching treatment for HIV only for Fauci to hijack it to make money off patents at the expense of millions of lives.</p> <p>But none of that stopped Mikovits\u2019s book, Plague of Corruption, from becoming an instant bestseller after it was published last month.</p> <p>Prof Oliver said that doubts frequently coalesce around fear of the unknown when it comes to medical conditions. </p> <p>\u201cThis sort of contagious disease that\u2019s invisible makes people extremely apprehensive. This is a profoundly displacing event and the uncertainty and anxiety it has generated in health, the economy and politics are just really deep. Some people are primed to seek out some sort of simple answer to very complex political and health issues and into that void conspiracy theories rush right in,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Medical conspiracy theories have particular potency and not only because they more directly touch on people\u2019s lives than claims about where Barack Obama was born or who really brought down the Twin Towers on 9/11. There is also a foundation to some of the claims.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/nov/08/the-making-of-an-opioid-epidemic\">The making of an opioid epidemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The drug industry wields a corrupting influence over politicians and the FDA, as seen in its facilitation of the rise of the opioid epidemic.

Many lack windows and proper ventilation.</p> <p>The Baja California reopenings came after weeks of pressure from US officials.</p> <p>The US ambassador to Mexico, Christopher Landau, has tweeted that \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/USAmbMex/status/1252602105556340736\">it is possible and essential</a>\u201d to preserve international supply chains while protecting workers\u2019 health.</p> <p>Much of the debate has focussed on defining which factories are engaged in essential work.</p> <p>The complexities of the global supply chain make it hard to determine which <em>maquiladoras</em> play essential roles: some produce minute electronics parts used in transportation or medical equipment, but labor organizers argue that most factories produce goods which have nothing to do with the fight against the pandemic.</p> <p>Many <em>maquiladoras</em> in the border area manufacture parts used in aerospace manufacturing, and the work stoppage has particularly affected supply chains in the defense industry.</p> <p>The undersecretary of defense for acquisitions and sustainment, Ellen Lord \u2013 the former chief of a defense contractor that owns <em>maquiladoras</em> along the border \u2013 said that shutdowns in Mexico were affecting supply chains \u201c<a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/2156378/dod-acquisition-leader-conducts-pentagon-briefing/\">especially important for US airframe production</a>\u201d.</p> <p>One of those factories is Collins Aerospace in Mexicali.</p> <p>The <em>maquila</em>, owned by a subsidiary of defense contractor Raytheon Technologies, produces equipment for aviation GPS systems. Sergio Ram\u00edrez, a quality control inspector at Collins Aerospace, said the factory shut down only for a few days after orders from the state labor secretary.</p> <p>\u201cThey called to say we should go back, and I asked, \u2018But what about this thing about essential businesses?\u2019\u201d said Ram\u00edrez, who asked not to be identified by his real name. \u201c\u2018No, well, the secretary said we can go back to work.\u2019\u201d By the end of April, the factory had returned to normal.</p> <p>Ramirez says the factory has taken sanitary measures to implement social distancing and provide protective gear. But less than two weeks after the opened, a worker was diagnosed with Covid-19.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bb38cde6189c377c6d8da5fa1f3a6106453b6b3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb38cde6189c377c6d8da5fa1f3a6106453b6b3d/0_170_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers during the construction of a provisional hospital in Tijuana.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers during the construction of a provisional hospital in Tijuana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A spokesperson for Collins Aerospace said that the factory\u2019s labors are considered essential because it produces parts for Mexican airline Aerom\u00e9xico, whose planes have been used to transport medical personnel.

But the state employs only 15 labor inspectors across all sectors. \u201cThose inspectors can\u2019t have hands and eyes everywhere,\u201d said Avalos.</p> <p>Autolite and Terminados Rogers did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>The fired Autolite workers say that they now face another obstacle: getting paid. According to the laid-off workers, Autolite has offered them just half of the severance pay they were owed.</p> <p>The state\u2019s labor arbitration boards are closed until June, so workers cannot file complaints for withholding of payment or wrongful termination.</p> <p>For the fired Autolite workers, that means months could pass before their situation is settled.

  "<p>We are still in the early chapters of the Covid-19 story and it\u2019s too soon to judge the full impact of the pandemic. But one can tentatively discern six negative trends for Europe. These had all emerged before the virus struck but are now accelerating. In various ways they are all likely to help the cause of anti-EU populists: greater economic autarky, stronger borders and more hostility to green policies.</p> <h2>Deglobalisation</h2> <p>Covid-19 has given extra ammunition to those arguing for greater national or European self-sufficiency. Long before it arrived, there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/28/era-globalisation-brexit-eu-britain-economic-frustration\">talk of \u201cdeglobalisation\u201d</a> and \u201creshoring\u201d of supply chains. This stemmed in part from politics: Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist policies threatened international supply chains, as did the UK\u2019s pursuit of a hard Brexit.</p> <p>Economics is also important: wage differentials between emerging economies such as China and rich countries are narrowing, reducing the advantages of off-shoring production.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/eu-faces-existential-threat-if-coronavirus-recovery-uneven-paolo-gentiloni\">EU faces \u2018existential threat\u2019 if coronavirus recovery is uneven</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now concerns about the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/human-use/docs/guidelines_isc_en.pdf\">security of the supply of drugs</a>, medical equipment and even key components for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-every-major-uk-and-european-carmaker-to-stop-or-cut-production\">car industry</a>, alongside greater suspicion of Chinese companies, have boosted the case for more national or European autonomy of supply chains.</p> <h2>Nation-first politics</h2> <p>National capitals are gaining more clout vis-a-vis the EU\u2019s institutions. For decades these institutions have been losing ground to the member states, which resent the powers that Brussels has accumulated.</p> <p>The key capitals assert their authority in hard times. They did it a decade ago during the financial and eurozone crises, when they had to provide the bailout money.</p> <p>Now they have done so again. The European commission has struggled to keep the 27 together and to coordinate their responses to Covid-19 \u2013 not only because most of the key powers on health, fiscal policy and frontiers reside at national level, but also because many people look to national leaders to navigate the difficulties.</p> <h2>Tighter borders</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/05/is-the-schengen-dream-of-europe-without-borders-becoming-a-thing-of-the-past\">EU has been strengthening</a> the Schengen zone\u2019s external border since 2015, when numbers of people seeking refuge in Europe first surged in significant numbers. Some governments also introduced checks on borders within the Schengen area.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"644803a71b6a67d388cbebf5ef84fa50972eb320\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/644803a71b6a67d388cbebf5ef84fa50972eb320/0_0_4000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vehicles wait in long lines to cross into Romania from Hungary at the Csan\u00e1dpalota border crossing on 22 March, after Hungary closed its borders to all but its own citizens.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vehicles wait in long lines to cross into Romania from Hungary at the Csan\u00e1dpalota border crossing on 22 March, after Hungary closed its borders to all but its own citizens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drone Media Studio/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The health emergency has increased suspicion of foreigners and in March the EU\u2019s Schengen-area countries<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-france-on-war-footing-as-europe-locks-down-macron\"> closed their external border</a> to non-essential travellers. More obstacles to movement within the Schengen area have also sprouted. At some point governments will have got the virus largely under control, but they will then be very wary of softening the Schengen border. Visitors from parts of the world where the disease may still be rampant will not be welcome. Many politicians will want to make life as difficult as possible for irregular migrants.</p> <h2>Green backlash</h2> <p>The pandemic is likely to strengthen opposition to policies that are designed to moderate the climate crisis and make us live greener lives. Before the virus arrived, populists such as the Sweden Democrats, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/climate-change-denial-germany-far-right-afd\">the AfD in Germany</a>, Nigel Farage in the UK and the <em>gilets jaunes</em> (yellow vests) in France were using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/29/elites-must-not-burden-gilets-jaunes-with-climate-change-says-eu-official\">hostility to green policies</a> as a means of drumming up support.</p> <p>Many voters whose standards of living are dropping dramatically will not want to take a further hit to jobs and incomes from measures designed to tackle the climate emergency. Europe\u2019s leaders insist that their plans for curbing carbon emissions are sacrosanct. But as the recession bites, the pressures on them to moderate their green agenda, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/27/carmakers-accused-of-using-covid-19-weaken-environmental-laws\">including from industry</a>, will strengthen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"51553a2c0317fcfc2bacad1ff7a4f439117943d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51553a2c0317fcfc2bacad1ff7a4f439117943d4/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gilets jaunes protesters gather at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris on 16 February 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Gilets jaunes</em> protesters gather at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris on 16 February 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julien de Rosa/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>East-west tension</h2> <p>For several years an east-west division has left Hungary, Poland and sometimes other central European states at odds with the rest of the EU. They have rowed over the distribution of irregular immigrants, with some eastern countries refusing to take any; targets for reducing carbon emissions, with the easterners tending to depend on coal; and the rule of law, with Poland and Hungary disregarding the independence of the judiciary and media pluralism.</p> <p>Covid-19 has widened the rift. Central Europeans fear that they will lose money from the EU budget to the southern countries most afflicted by the virus. Meanwhile Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n has used the pandemic as a justification for introducing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">rule by decree</a>, exacerbating fears that he is creating a de facto dictatorship.</p> <h2>North-south tension</h2> <p>The virus is widening the north-south fissure which emerged in the eurozone crisis 10 years ago. Germany, the Netherlands and their northern allies were reluctant to give substantial help to the southern countries in difficulty.</p> <p>Now the coronavirus has struck the EU asymmetrically. The southern countries, particularly Italy and Spain, have suffered more coronavirus deaths than most others, started the crisis with higher levels of debt and depend on industries such as tourism that are badly affected. They want solidarity from the north, ideally in the form of some sort of \u201ceurobond\u201d: the EU as a whole would borrow money and then disburse grants to the worst-affected countries.</p> <p>EU leaders have agreed to set up a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/eu-risks-break-up-over-coronabonds-row-warns-italian-pm\">recovery fund</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/eu-risks-break-up-over-coronabonds-row-warns-italian-pm\"> </a>to support the worst-affected regions. But this seems likely to provide more in the way of loans than grants, because the northern governments remain opposed to large-scale transfers to the south \u2013 although the southerners already have excessive levels of debt.</p> <p>This stinginess is rooted in northern voters\u2019 hostility to transfers. But it delights populists such as Matteo Salvini, in Italy, who is skilled at exploiting every perceived slight from the EU. One recent <a href=\"https://www.dire.it/10-04-2020/446061-sondaggio-dire-tecne-aumentano-gli-italiani-che-vorrebbero-uscire-dallue/\">opinion poll</a> found that 49% of Italians wanted to leave the EU.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77bc6c8806f6d8d60e7b08452fe3f83c6431d1bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77bc6c8806f6d8d60e7b08452fe3f83c6431d1bb/0_918_2385_2385/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lega party leader Matteo Salvini in Rome last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lega party leader, Matteo Salvini, in Rome last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessandro Serran\u00f2/AGF/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>None of these changes is to be welcomed. If Europe pushes self-sufficiency too far, it will impair the benefits that trade delivers to all continents. Closing frontiers within the Schengen zone or on its borders, once Covid-19 is under control, would achieve very little. And when the EU is faced with transnational challenges such as economic depression, a pandemic or climate change, it needs strong central institutions.</p> <p>EU leaders should not slacken in their efforts to tackle climate change. The east-west rift is alarming and cannot be resolved by tolerating disrespect for the rule of law. As for the north-south divide, the ECB may be able to do enough to keep Italy and other southern member-states in the eurozone. But the politics of an unresolved rift may turn very nasty, increasing anti-EU sentiment across the bloc \u2013 and could even trigger a country leaving the EU or the euro.</p> <ul> <li><p>Charles Grant is the director of the Centre for European Reform</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>A week before Sierra Martin\u2019s 27 February due date, she received an email. It was from the couple that Martin was carrying a baby for, as a gestational surrogate. This was Martin\u2019s first surrogacy; she was carrying a boy for a gay couple from China.</p> <p>Due to the coronavirus travel ban, the email read, the couple wouldn\u2019t be able to get into the US to collect their son. Would Martin look after him, until the restrictions were lifted?</p> <p>\u201cI waited a full day before replying, because I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d says Martin, who is 22 and works as a barista and childminder in Lake Bay, Washington. \u201cI have nothing to look after a baby!\u201d</p> <p>After thinking about it, she agreed. Martin gave birth to baby Steven on 23 February, and took him home. She is raising him alongside her two children, aged three and five, until his parents can get into the US, sort the paperwork, and bring Steven home to China.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dd7aaf722da69a15334ad95a5535e68fec0e8138\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd7aaf722da69a15334ad95a5535e68fec0e8138/0_184_828_1608/515.jpg\" alt=\"Sierra Martin with baby Steven, to whom she gave birth to \u2013 but will give back to his two fathers once travel restrictions are eased.\" width=\"515\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Surrogate mother Sierra Martin with baby Steven, to whom she gave birth \u2013 but will hand over to his two fathers once travel restrictions are eased.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sierra Martin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Spending nearly three months raising a baby she has given birth to, but who she is not biologically related to and will be giving back to his parents eventually, is emotionally wearing. \u201cI love having the baby snuggles,\u201d says Martin, \u201cbut it\u2019s definitely hard knowing that he is not mine. I love him, but I know that he has to go back to his own parents eventually.\u201d</p> <p>Martin and baby Steven are caught up in a nationwide surrogacy crisis of growing proportions. Commercial surrogacy is legal in some US states, making it a hotspot for parents looking to have children through assisted reproduction. But the coronavirus travel ban has seen President Trump close the country\u2019s borders to almost all international visitors, while a nationwide US passport office shutdown has made it impossible for parents who do manage to get into the country to obtain the necessary documentation to take their children home.</p> <p>As a result, babies are being born without their parents present at the birth (immigration authorities will only let parents in once the surrogate has given birth to the child). In at least one case, a mother flew from France to attend the birth of her child, only to be turned back by border control. Some parents aren\u2019t being allowed in the country at all. </p> <p>Surrogates and surrogacy agencies are scrambling to look after babies themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented for a surrogate to be looking after the baby,\u201d says Rich Geisler, a Californian surrogacy lawyer. \u201cWe as an industry really try to avoid that. We want to avoid the possibility of the surrogate bonding with the child.\u201d</p> <p>Martin is adamant that she\u2019ll be able to give Steven back to his parents when the time is right. \u201cIt will be hard to give him back, because I\u2019ll miss him,\u201d Martin says. \u201cBut I know he\u2019s not mine, and that I have to give him up, which is totally OK with me.\u201d She pauses. \u201cBut there\u2019s definitely a bit of attachment there,\u201d Martin says. \u201cI care for him. When you love on a baby, you love on a baby.\u201d</p> <p>To avoid leaving children in the care of their surrogates, with the emotional challenges this can entail, some surrogacy agency workers are taking babies into their own homes. \u201cI never anticipated something of this nature happening,\u201d says Katie Faust, a 26-year-old surrogacy case worker from Tampa Bay. Faust is caring for a three-week-old baby girl, whose name we have withheld at her parents\u2019 request.</p> <p>When it became apparent that her parents, a heterosexual couple living in China, would be unable to collect her, Faust, her husband, and three children flew to California to collect the baby, rented a car, then drove for five days back to Florida. (As the baby doesn\u2019t have a passport, they couldn\u2019t take her on a commercial flight.) \u201cWe\u2019re just kind of planning it as we go along,\u201d says Faust. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out a way to get her reunited with her parents as soon as we can. But I\u2019m OK looking after her, until they get here.\u201d</p> <p>For the parents on the other end of the coronavirus shutdown, there is an excruciating wait to meet their children for the first time. \u201cI feel really sad about almost everything to do with my son\u2019s birth,\u201d says John, a 41-year-old airline worker from Shanghai.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/surrogacy-new-parents-stuck-in-us-amid-covid-19-shutdown\">Surrogacy: new parents stuck in US amid Covid-19 shutdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>John\u2019s baby son with his partner Will, a 39-year-old finance worker, was born on 24 February: they have not been able to enter the US to meet him due to the travel ban. (Both men have requested anonymity, as they are not out to their employers.)</p> <p>When Trump issued an order preventing Chinese nationals from entering the US in January, John wept. \u201cI cried and cried,\u201d he remembers. \u201cIt was really important for me to be there for the birth.\u201d</p> <p>Fortunately, Will\u2019s elderly parents live in Portland, and are caring for the baby. \u201cWe speak to the baby by WeChat almost every day,\u201d says John. \u201cWhen I look at his photos or videos, I feel like my heart is melting.\u201d But Will\u2019s parents are elderly, and he worries what would happen should they, or the baby, fall sick with coronavirus \u2013 the baby is uninsured, as the shutdown means they can\u2019t get the documentation they would need to insure him. John wants more than anything to get into the US and bring his son home. \u201cHere in China, life is returning to normal,\u201d John says. \u201cI think the US government should open the border, so I can get my son. Most people here are healthy and do not have the disease.\u201d</p> <p>In addition to the logistical challenges of arranging care for a child you have never met on the other side of the world, the shutdown means that parents like John and Will are missing out on those precious early months with their children. Martin is sending Steven\u2019s parents pictures and videos, but it\u2019s not the same. \u201cFor Steven\u2019s sake it would be nice for him to bond with his parents instead of with me,\u201d Martin says. \u201cThose first three months of his life are instrumental in the bonding process for the baby.\u201d</p> <p>And even if you can get into the US to collect your child, your problems don\u2019t end there. Surrogacy is an expensive process. Having to wait in the US for the passport office to reopen \u2013 at the moment, it is only issuing documents for life-and-death emergencies, which do not include surrogacy \u2013 all add to the cost. \u201cPeople are running out of funds,\u201d says New Jersey reproductive lawyer Melissa Brisman. \u201cThey\u2019ve already spent so much money on this. They can\u2019t afford another \u00a32,000 a week on a certified nurse to take care of the baby.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c289c0a27644c38a2c7ec31b4524c2595d7bc47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c289c0a27644c38a2c7ec31b4524c2595d7bc47/0_174_1599_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Tcik family with their newborn child.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Tcik family with their newborn child.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Tcik family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I speak to Nir Tcik, he sounds almost frantic. \u201cWe are under huge pressure, because every day our money is getting lower and lower,\u201d he says. Tcik, 47, and his husband Avi, 46, are from Israel, where same-sex surrogacy is illegal. Their daughter Noga was born on 2 April. Since Noga\u2019s birth, the family of four \u2013 the Tciks have a four-year-old son, also born via surrogate \u2013 have been stuck in a New Jersey hotel room, waiting in vain for the authorities to issue her a birth certificate. Even when the birth certificate comes through, they will probably still be stuck, unless the Israeli embassy can make an exception and issue Noga emergency travel documents to fly home, in lieu of a US passport.</p> <p>The Tciks did not budget for nearly two months in the US. They estimate they have spent almost $20,000 in additional costs due to the coronavirus shutdown, on top of the approximately $150,000 cost of the surrogacy. \u201cIf this goes on much longer,\u201d Tcik says, \u201cwe are going to have to borrow money from family and friends.\u201d</p> <p>He is terrified that Noga will fall ill \u2013 as Noga has no official paperwork, she is uninsured. As a result, the Tciks are terrified to take her outside, lest she contracts coronavirus. \u201cWe are stuck in this hotel,\u201d says Tcik. \u201cAll the time, we\u2019re in this hotel room. We don\u2019t feel safe.\u201d</p> <p>The solution, Brisman says, is for the US immigration authorities to allow parents into the US to collect their children, and expedite the process by which they can leave the country. \u201cI would like to see the government allow these people in quickly, and allow them home quickly,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need expedited passports, birth certificates and visas for people whose babies are being born.\u201d</p> <p>The administrative and bureaucratic nightmare in which the Tciks now find themselves means that coronavirus has cast a pall over what should be a joyful experience. \u201cWe thank God that we have a daughter who is healthy, and that the surrogate is also OK,\u201d says Tcik. \u201cThat is the most important thing. But this coronavirus shutdown, and us being stuck here, has ruined everything.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the world\u2019s premier public health agency, was stooped over the White House lectern.

  "<p>On 20 January, KK Shailaja phoned one of her medically trained deputies. She had read online about a dangerous new virus spreading in China. \u201cWill it come to us?\u201d she asked. \u201cDefinitely, Madam,\u201d he replied. And so the health minister of the Indian state of Kerala began her preparations.</p> <p>Four months later, Kerala has reported only 524 cases of Covid-19, four deaths and \u2013 according to Shailaja \u2013 no community transmission. The state has a population of about 35 million and a <a href=\"http://mospi.nic.in/\">GDP per capita of </a><a href=\"http://mospi.nic.in/\">only </a><a href=\"http://mospi.nic.in/\">\u00a32,200</a>.

The names sit oddly with the merry, bespectacled former secondary school science teacher, but they reflect the widespread admiration she has drawn for demonstrating that effective disease containment is possible not only in a democracy, but in a poor one.</p> <p>How has this been achieved? Three days after reading about the new virus in China, and before Kerala had its first case of Covid-19, Shailaja held the first meeting of her rapid response team. The next day, 24 January, the team set up a control room and instructed the medical officers in Kerala\u2019s 14 districts to do the same at their level. By the time the first case arrived, on 27 January, via a plane from Wuhan, the state had already adopted the World Health Organization\u2019s protocol of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/21/kerala-indian-state-flattened-coronavirus-curve\">test, trace, isolate and support</a>.</p> <p>As the passengers filed off the Chinese flight, they had their temperatures checked. Three who were found to be running a fever were isolated in a nearby hospital. The remaining passengers were placed in home quarantine \u2013 sent there with information pamphlets about Covid-19 that had already been printed in the local language, Malayalam. The hospitalised patients tested positive for Covid-19, but the disease had been contained. \u201cThe first part was a victory,\u201d says Shailaja. \u201cBut the virus continued to spread beyond China and soon it was everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>In late February, encountering one of Shailaja\u2019s surveillance teams at the airport, a Malayali family returning from Venice was evasive about its travel history and went home without submitting to the now-standard controls. By the time medical personnel detected a case of Covid-19 and traced it back to them, their contacts were in the hundreds. Contact tracers tracked them all down, with the help of advertisements and social media, and they were placed in quarantine. Six developed Covid-19.</p> <p>Another cluster had been contained, but by now large numbers of overseas workers were heading home to Kerala from infected Gulf states, some of them carrying the virus. On 23 March, all flights into the state\u2019s four international airports were stopped. Two days later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/overcome-by-anxiety-india-in-lockdown-many-can-ill-afford\">India entered a nationwide lockdown</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ea8c04da803bfbd3b862a94e307047c5b011ffa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ea8c04da803bfbd3b862a94e307047c5b011ffa/0_431_6468_3881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kerala quarantine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Indian citizens arriving from the Gulf states are bussed to a quarantine centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arunchandra Bose/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the height of the virus in Kerala, 170,000 people were quarantined and placed under strict surveillance by visiting health workers, with those who lacked an inside bathroom housed in improvised isolation units at the state government\u2019s expense. That number has shrunk to 21,000. \u201cWe have also been accommodating and feeding 150,000 migrant workers from neighbouring states who were trapped here by the lockdown,\u201d she says. \u201cWe fed them properly \u2013 three meals a day for six weeks.\u201d Those workers are now being sent home on charter trains.</p> <p>Shailaja was already a celebrity of sorts in India before Covid-19. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/virus-lesson-mollywood-tackle-coronavirus-200427110703824.html\">a movie called Virus</a> was released, inspired by her handling of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/18/nipah-fearsome-virus-that-caught-the-medical-and-scientific-world-off-guard\">an outbreak of an even </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/18/nipah-fearsome-virus-that-caught-the-medical-and-scientific-world-off-guard\">deadlier viral disease</a>, Nipah, in 2018. (She found the character who played her a little too worried-looking; in reality, <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/express-sunday-eye/extraordinary-measures-kk-shailaja-kerala-nipah-virus-5835834/\">she has said</a>, she couldn\u2019t afford to show fear.) She was praised not only for her proactive response, but also for visiting the village at the centre of the outbreak.</p> <p>The villagers were terrified and ready to flee, because they did not understand how the disease was spreading. \u201cI rushed there with my doctors, we organised a meeting in the panchayat [village council] office and I explained that there was no need to leave, because the virus could only spread through direct contact,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you kept at least a metre from a coughing person, it couldn\u2019t travel. When we explained that, they became calm \u2013 and stayed.\u201d</p> <p>Nipah prepared Shailaja for Covid-19, she says, because it taught her that a highly contagious disease for which there is no treatment or vaccine should be taken seriously. In a way, though, she had been preparing for both outbreaks all her life.</p> <p>The Communist Party of India (Marxist), of which she is a member, has been prominent in Kerala\u2019s governments since 1957, the year after her birth. (It was part of the Communist Party of India until 1964, when it broke away.) Born into a family of activists and freedom fighters \u2013 her grandmother campaigned against untouchability \u2013 she watched the so-called \u201cKerala model\u201d be assembled from the ground up; when we speak, this is what she wants to talk about. </p> <p>The foundations of the model are land reform \u2013 enacted via legislation that capped how much land a family could own and increased land ownership among tenant farmers \u2013 a decentralised public health system and investment in public education. Every village has a primary health centre and there are hospitals at each level of its administration, as well as 10 medical colleges.</p> <p>This is true of other states, too, says MP Cariappa, a public health expert based in Pune, Maharashtra state, but nowhere else are people so invested in their primary health system. Kerala enjoys <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-aging-faster-than-rest-of-india-says-economic-review/story-SEw6hmK8lfTnlTBMmCkZNN.html\">the highest life expectancy</a> and <a href=\"https://thewire.in/health/india-infant-mortality-rate\">the lowest infant mortality</a> of any state in India; it is also <a href=\"https://kerala.gov.in/total-literacy\">the most literate</a> state. \u201cWith widespread access to education, there is a definite understanding of health being important to the wellbeing of people,\u201d says Cariappa.</p> <p>Shailaja says: \u201cI heard about those struggles \u2013 the agricultural movement and the freedom fight \u2013 from my grandma. She was a very good storyteller.\u201d Although emergency measures such as the lockdown are the preserve of the national government, each Indian state sets its own health policy. If the Kerala model had not been in place, she insists, her government\u2019s response to Covid-19 would not have been possible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbb89c19e6f28498b156dd5abecc44830ee725df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbb89c19e6f28498b156dd5abecc44830ee725df/0_256_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"test centre in ErnakulamKerala\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A walk-in test centre in Ernakulam, Kerala.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That said, the state\u2019s primary health centres had started to show signs of age. When Shailaja\u2019s party came to power in 2016, it undertook a modernisation programme. One pre-pandemic innovation was to create clinics and a registry for respiratory disease \u2013 a big problem in India. \u201cThat meant we could spot conversion to Covid-19 and look out for community transmission,\u201d Shailaja says. \u201cIt helped us very much.\u201d</p> <p>When the outbreak started, each district was asked to dedicate two hospitals to Covid-19, while each medical college set aside 500 beds. Separate entrances and exits were designated. Diagnostic tests were in short supply, especially after the disease reached wealthier western countries, so they were reserved for patients with symptoms and their close contacts, as well as for random sampling of asymptomatic people and those in the most exposed groups: health workers, police and volunteers.</p> <p>Shailaja says a test in Kerala produces a result within 48 hours. \u201cIn the Gulf, as in the US and UK \u2013 all technologically fit countries \u2013 they are having to wait seven days,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat is happening there?\u201d She doesn\u2019t want to judge, she says, but she has been mystified by the large death tolls in those countries: \u201cI think testing is very important \u2013 also quarantining and hospital surveillance \u2013 and people in those countries are not getting that.\u201d She knows, because Malayalis living in those countries have phoned her to say so.</p> <p>Places of worship were closed under the rules of lockdown, <a href=\"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/pilgrims-protest-closure-of-bajjreshwari-devi-temple-57282\">resulting in protests in </a><a href=\"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/pilgrims-protest-closure-of-bajjreshwari-devi-temple-57282\">some Indian states</a>, but resistance has been noticeably absent in Kerala \u2013 in part, perhaps, because its chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, consulted with local faith leaders about the closures. Shailaja says Kerala\u2019s high literacy level is another factor: \u201cPeople understand why they must stay at home. You can explain it to them.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/22/snapshots-of-a-world-in-lockdown-the-crisis-has-crossed-a-new-threshold\">Snapshots of a world in lockdown: 'The crisis has crossed a new threshold'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Indian government plans to lift the lockdown on 17 May (the date has been extended twice). After that, she predicts, there will be a huge influx of Malayalis to Kerala from the heavily infected Gulf region. \u201cIt will be a great challenge, but we are preparing for it,\u201d she says. There are plans A, B and C, with plan C \u2013 the worst-case scenario \u2013 involving the requisitioning of hotels, hostels and conference centres to provide 165,000 beds.

She hopes to do the same, eventually, because her ministerial term will finish with the state elections a year from now.

Princess Cruises, part of Carnival Corporation, said support was being offered to staff and the family of the deceased. </p> <p>On the Navigator of the Seas off the coast of Miami, 15 Romanian crew started a hunger strike in protest at not being able to disembark. Royal Caribbean said the strike ended after a charter flight was arranged from Barbados later this month.</p> <p>Many other ships remain marooned around the world. In the Philippines, Manila Bay has more than 20 cruise ships with around 5,300 staff on board waiting for clearance to disembark.</p> <p>In Germany, police in the Germany port of Cuxhaven were called on board the Mein Schiff 3 last week after reports of disturbances. Nearly 3,000 crew members from several ships had been assembled onboard awaiting repatriation to numerous countries, but were told they would have to stay on the ship after nine people tested positive for Covid-19.</p> <p>The deaths and conflicts have prompted renewed warnings about the mental health of crew stuck at sea waiting for permission to return home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48d58f4f610456ffff9ca78be088accdfe5e599a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48d58f4f610456ffff9ca78be088accdfe5e599a/927_286_2641_1584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Satellite image of cruise ships in the Bahamas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Satellite image of cruise ships, mainly from the Celebrity and Royal Caribbean lines, anchored 10 miles west of Coco Bay in the Bahamas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Planet Labs Inc/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cruise lines were managing to repatriate small contingents of crew members to some Caribbean countries by Tuesday, but even those efforts raised consternation in Haiti and Grenada after reports of some crew not being put into the required quarantines, according to reports in the Miami Herald.</p> <p>Cruise companies have blamed strict rules from health authorities for not letting crew disembark. In and around US waters, 100 cruise ships with 70,000 crew are still waiting at sea, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently told the Guardian that some operators have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/01/no-one-comes-the-cruise-ship-crews-cast-adrift-by-coronavirus\">opted to stay at sea</a>, citing concerns about cost and potential legal consequences. </p> <p>Crew members stranded at sea have said the experience has taken its toll on their mental health.</p> <p>Will Lees, a Canadian who was hired to run art shows and gallery sales on the Norwegian Star starting last October, said the waiting and uncertainty have been deeply unsettling. He has not been on land since passengers left the ship on 14 March and has been shuffled between three ships to await repatriation.

Each earphone\u2019s body has an earbud sticking out of one side with a traditional silicone ear tip that twists into your ear canal. The other end has an hook that loops over the back of your ear, holding it in place and neatly guiding the cable backwards rather than in front of your ear like its predecessors.</p> <p>It\u2019s a streamlined and comfortable design that is super secure. You can bend the ear hooks to adjust the fit, and once twisted in place they are not coming off, no matter how hard you shake your head.</p> <p>The cable resting on your neck is better than many I have tested, but like all neckband headphones it drags on clothes and can get caught on things. Within 15 minutes of street running, turning my head to check for cars and people, the cable noticeably dragged on the side of my neck, which may be irritating for anyone running very long distances. At least the cable can\u2019t pull the earbuds out of your ears.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d7eedafcabb4763a0d4e28f1710c66f5680b961\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d7eedafcabb4763a0d4e28f1710c66f5680b961/0_0_5456_3273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"beats powerbeats review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You can hang the earbuds by their cable when not in use.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You can also take the earbuds out and hang them around your neck when not in use.</p> <p>The Powerbeats are fairly light at 26.3g in total and are sweat resistant, so you don\u2019t have to worry about a little rain either.

  "<p>UK austerity, which lasted from 2010 to 2019, was all about bad timing. When coming out of a deep recession the only thing the Treasury should have been thinking about was how to get as complete an economic recovery as possible. Only when the recovery was exhausted, such that inflation and interest rates were rising substantially, was it time to worry about balancing the books.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the Treasury in 2009 had more people in it worrying about the deficit than worrying about the economy. They persuaded the then Labour chancellor, Alistair Darling, to frame his discourse around the recovery and the deficit. The stage was wide open for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/04/george-osborne-eliminating-current-deficit-austerity-terrible-cost-hubris\">George Osborne</a>, helped by the mainstream media, to just focus on the deficit alone. The result was a recovery from recession that should have happened in 2010 being delayed until 2013.</p> <p>Even if we think the supply side is immune from the damage austerity caused, I have estimated that austerity cost the average household about \u00a310,000 in lost resources. It is much more likely that austerity did damage the supply side, and so the cost is both much higher and continues to this day. Surely, just 10 years later, the Treasury couldn\u2019t make the same mistake again?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/13/crisis-winners-losers-2008-broken-economy-covid-19\">As in 2008, this crisis will bring winners and losers. This time, let's get it right | Carys Roberts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f0c7ab6d-33ba-4777-8dd8-0960a78a556a\">Treasury document</a> leaked on Wednesday did contain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/13/treasury-tax-hikes-pay-freezes-covid-19-costs-budget-deficit-spending\">one piece of good news</a>. The chancellor accepts that no attempt should be made to reduce debt to GDP levels after the coronavirus crisis is over. The goal is to stabilise debt to GDP at some new higher level. Those who talk about having to pay for supporting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/uk-economy-could-shrink-by-35-with-2m-job-losses-warns-obr\">the economy</a> during the pandemic are wrong. Government debt to GDP levels can stay high, and if they need to fall that can happen through growth.</p> <p>But that good news may mean nothing if the focus of debate as the pandemic is controlled is about the deficit rather than the recovery. If the Treasury tries to balance the books during the economic recovery, then that fiscal tightening could stop the recovery in its tracks, just as it did in 2010. It will be austerity all over again.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There should be no discussion about the deficit until interest rates and inflation start rising substantially because of excess domestic demand</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We see all the old lines being trotted out in the leaked Treasury document. The need to \u201cenhance credibility and boost investor confidence\u201d, and the possibility of a sovereign debt crisis. These are the same words used to justify 2010 austerity, and they remain as misleading as before. What really matters for credibility and investor confidence is the state of the economy, which in turn depends on the strength of the recovery.</p> <p>There is no chance of a sovereign debt crisis because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/12/treasury-bank-of-england-ways-and-means-facility-debt-mountain\">the Bank of England</a> will buy government debt to prevent it happening. This is because the first sign of a sovereign debt crisis is higher interest rates on government debt, and in a recession higher long-term interest rates dampen the recovery which the Bank is pledged to achieve, so we will see more quantitative easing to keep rates low. In addition, investors know that once the recovery is complete the UK will control the deficit, because we have a good track record of doing so. There is no need to make commitments now.</p> <p>What the Treasury should be talking about is the potential need for some kind of fiscal stimulus if consumers are cautious after the pandemic is over and increase their precautionary saving. What type of stimulus should it be, if demand is weak in sectors involving social consumption but not elsewhere? The 2009 recession clearly showed us that when interest rates hit their lower bound, it is up to fiscal policy to ensure a quick recovery. I fear the Treasury will instead veto any further stimulus on cost grounds.</p> <p>Unfortunately, 2009 also shows us that once the conversation starts being partly about debt and deficits, that becomes all the media talks about. It is true that conditions are not the same as 2009. Boris Johnson is less obsessed with debt than Osborne was, talk of a funding crisis has less resonance than it did after the financial crisis, and we have the experience of 2010 austerity as a warning. But the Treasury and the media have not changed substantially over the last decade.</p> <p>The lessons from what happened 10 years ago are simple and clear. There should be no discussion about the deficit until interest rates and inflation start rising substantially because of excess domestic demand. Only then will we know that the recovery is complete. As we do not know what kind of recovery from the pandemic we will have, talking about what is needed to balance the books is premature because we just do not know how much is required. Indeed such talk may in itself harm the recovery, because people spend less if they think tax rises are coming.</p> <p>Am I overreacting to just one leaked document? If political reports are correct, we have already seen Treasury pressure persuade Johnson to relax lockdown <a href=\"https://mainlymacro.blogspot.com/2020/05/the-government-is-responding-to.html\">before he should</a> have. As premature lockdown just delays the day people feel secure to start spending on social consumption again, Sunday\u2019s announcement reflected short-term penny pinching with a much bigger long-term cost. Which sounds very similar to austerity to me. We must not let this happen again.</p> <p>\u2022 Simon Wren-Lewis is emeritus professor of economics and fellow of Merton College, Oxford</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<h2>Top story: Antibody test gets PHE approval</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray with Thursday\u2019s opening delivery.</p> \n<p>Council social care directors in England warned the government two years ago in a series of detailed reports about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/13/ministers-were-warned-two-years-ago-of-care-homes-exposure-to-pandemics\">care homes\u2019 vulnerability to a pandemic</a>, the Guardian has learned. They said \u201cdemand for PPE could rapidly outstrip supply\u201d and called for improved infection control and a system to enlist volunteers to bolster overstretched services. Boris Johnson has been accused of downplaying the threat to care homes as recently as March. A study from the London School of Economics (LSE) has put the death toll for care home residents in England and Wales at 22,000 or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/coronavirus-real-care-home-death-toll-double-official-figure-study-says\">more than double the official estimate</a>.</p> \n<p>Public Health England has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/public-health-england-approves-roche-test-for-coronavirus-antibodies\">approved an antibody test made by Roche</a> that may now be used to determine how much of the population has been infected by Covid-19. Roche says it is 99.8% specific \u2013 so not confused by antibodies for other coronaviruses \u2013 and 100% sensitive, picking up any antibodies present. Analysers in some hospitals could process 300 tests an hour depending on the set-up, with a positive or negative result determined in 18 minutes, Roche said.</p> \n<p>The FBI and US homeland security have warned of potential hacking by China of organisations researching Covid-19 vaccines, treatments and testing. \u201cChina\u2019s efforts to target these sectors pose a significant threat to our nation\u2019s response to Covid-19,\u201d said the US cybersecurity agency. China has issued one of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/china-hacking-poses-significant-threat-to-us-covid-19-response-says-fbi\">customarily bridling responses</a>. It comes amid heightened tensions between the US and China over the source of the outbreak and whether China adequately alerted the world.</p> \n<p>Doctors in Italy have reported the first clear evidence of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">link between Covid-19 and symptoms of Kawasaki disease</a> in children. Since the pandemic began at least one child in the UK has died while showing Kawasaki-like symptoms. Doctors in Bergamo say cases of Kawasaki-like disease have risen to about 10 a month, compared with one every three months in the past five years. Writing in the Lancet they warn that the \u201cstrong association\u201d between the virus and the condition should be taken into account as governments ease lockdown restrictions. They stress, however, that the disorder seems to affect no more than one in 1,000 children exposed to the virus, with a further fraction of these requiring intensive care.</p> \n<p>The World Health Organization has said coronavirus may never fully go away, instead becoming another \u201cendemic\u201d virus like HIV for humanity to deal with.

Biden has been named among officials who applied to have Flynn \u201cunmasked\u201d \u2013 a routine practice used to identify a person anonymously referred to in an intelligence document. A statement from Biden\u2019s campaign said Trump was trying to divert attention from his poor response to coronavirus: \u201cThese documents simply indicate the breadth and depth of concern across the American government \u2013 including among career officials \u2013 over intelligence reports of Michael Flynn\u2019s attempts to undermine \u2026 national security policy.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>A few people arrived early \u2013 </strong>Modern humans arrived in Europe at least 46,000 years ago and overlapped with Neanderthals potentially for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/11/humans-and-neanderthals-co-existed-in-europe-far-longer-than-thought\">thousands more years than previously thought</a>, archaeologists have said.

  "<h2>Cycling in the Black Mountains</h2> <p>Since the lockdown began almost two months ago, I\u2019ve been off the bike other than for weekly shopping trips and short rides around the block with my young children. As with many cyclists, I turned to an indoor (static) trainer to keep my legs moving. But it\u2019s a poor substitute. Yes, you sit on the saddle, hold the handlebars and turn the pedals, but that\u2019s where the similarity ends. Instead of the lightness of being that comes from riding a bike, you have to endure futile pedalling, profuse sweating and a profound and spirit-sapping boredom. The latest home trainers offer online access and have a display of virtual roads to ride, mountains to climb and other people to race \u2013 but it never compares to the real thing.</p> <p>In Wales, the changes to the lockdown mean I am now allowed out to exercise more than once a day \u2013 and I was desperate to get out for a ride. We\u2019re still required to stay local (unlike in England) but I live on the edge of the Black Mountains and there is plenty of great riding on my doorstep. After weeks on the static trainer, I savoured every sensation of being in motion. I leaned exaggeratedly into my turns and rose out of the saddle on the climbs, rocking the bike back and forth. At the top of each hill I stopped to take in the view, stretching my eyes to the horizon.</p> <p>This year it has felt like the moving tapestry of spring was slipping by unseen. So it was a joy to ride by a wide verge studded with a late-spring tricolour of bluebells, stitchwort and red campion. In the fields, the lambs \u2013 newborn and gangly back in March \u2013 have more than doubled in size. Majestic oak and ash trees, the familiar old friends that I last hailed as bare winter skeletons, are now in full leaf.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d084017d45763e9cbc9d295912cbcf936568b5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d084017d45763e9cbc9d295912cbcf936568b5f/0_389_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Monmouthshire lane with Ysgyryd Fawr (the Big Skirrid) in the background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monmouthshire road with Ysgyryd Fawr (the Big Skirrid) in the background.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Thurston</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No longer an instrument of sweaty, static torment, the bike was, once again, a source of liberation. I didn\u2019t have to push myself mentally like I do on the static trainer. Instead, I let the bike lead me on. As I freewheeled downhill the sensation as the wind cooled my body and ruffled my overgrown lockdown hair was curiously cleansing. In two hours, I rode 25 miles and came home on a mental and physical high \u2013 deep calm and contentment displacing my growing cabin fever.</p> <p>During quarantine bike sales have been booming as people rediscover the pleasure of riding around their neighbourhoods on roads with 1950s levels of traffic. Emerging from lockdown, cities such as Paris and Berlin are installing pop-up bike lanes to give commuters an alternative to crowded public transport. As we rise to the challenge of the coronavirus, cycling can play its part as a cheap, efficient, healthy and pleasurable way to travel. I for one am thrilled to be back on my bike \u2013 and glad to have put the static trainer back under the stairs where it belongs.<br><strong>Jack Thurston , author of</strong><strong> cycling guidebook Lost Lanes North</strong><strong> (<a href=\"http://www.wildthingspublishing.com/product/lost-lanes-north-yorkshire-lake-district-northumberland-pennines/\">Wild Things Publishing</a>, \u00a316.99)</strong></p> <h2>To Langton by Spilsby, a Lincolnshire stroll</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a049e96e791aa0030cf2532c1212beac7e9daa36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a049e96e791aa0030cf2532c1212beac7e9daa36/0_996_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Will Cohu and son on their Langton walk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Cohu and son on their Langton walk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Cohu/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since late March, when this strange world began, any deprivation I\u2019ve had has been in the mind. In Lincolnshire, I have a room with a view, and we have a garden and footpaths to walk. Familiarity has not bred contempt, but a contentment and interest in detail, albeit some of it increasingly odd. Noticing a large population of hedgerow elms is one thing, but my son has been itemising the roadside litter, and we have stared at an epic pothole as if the remains of an ancient temple had risen through the asphalt.</p> <p>We could walk further but consensus cannot hold without solidarity, however ritualistic it may feel to those distant from the awful impact of the virus. Now, the permission of unlimited exercise has come and legitimised a longer excursion. What to do? Learned helplessness has set in. I don\u2019t want to drive to go for a walk \u2013 that seems unfair \u2013 so we take a familiar route in search of views and light: from Raithby, across the Skegness Road, to the hill at Langton by Spilsby and back \u2013 eight or nine miles.</p> <p>It begins with a meandering mile down the Sausthorpe road, over the gentle contours of the land and crossing the choked remains of the River Lymn. Sausthorpe straddles the Skegness road: on one side is a Victorian church with a spire that looks like Thunderbirds was invented by the gothic revival and, on the other, a faux half-timbered village hall. Further on, the road takes doglegs past bosky little woods and coverts and, squeezed by grassy banks, rises into Langton by Spilsby. It is a pool of limpid pastoral, its fields and valleys set with intriguing, snug old farm buildings and spreading oaks, golden with new foliage and flowers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have never seen such a clear horizon here, without the smudge of orange that is the traffic of the east Midlands</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Above the road is the elegant, Georgian <a href=\"http://www.langton-by-spilsby.org.uk/church-of-st-peter-st-paul/\">church of St Peter and St Paul</a>, beloved by John Betjeman (and Simon Jenkins). Not everyone has admired it. In 1825, one John Stephen Langton donated the church six bells and, after his death, the rector observed that he had given \u201ca ring of the sweetest bells in Lincolnshire to one of the ugliest churches in Christendom\u201d. By the village hall is an endearing thatched mud-and-stud circular house, which my son claims as evidence that Smurfs are real, but is, I gather, an example of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottage_orn%C3%A9\">cottage orn\u00e9</a>.</p> <p>There\u2019s a steep quarter-mile walk to the top of Langton\u2019s hill, passing through a tunnel of skinny ash and sycamore, among which lurk slender elms that have suckered from ancient stumps and shine eerily with the samaras, the green communion wafers that house their seeds. Through the private woods to the right is an idyllic dip called Callow Carr, and the top of the hill is marked by a thick-boled beech with a thick trunk on which many lovers \u2013 and a few second world war airmen \u2013 have carved their initials, their names growing bigger, but less distinct with the passing years.</p> <p>Langton\u2019s hill is just 95 metres above sea level but the surprise of its views always delights. A footpath leads onto the escarpment of Northdale Carr, a gentle green cliff dotted with cowslips that faces west across open country towards Lincoln. It is late afternoon when we step out there. The queues of busy white clouds have shuffled off east to the sea, and the light here is dazzling, almost liquefying as the sun begins to descend and the blue turns mauve at its margins. Every blade of grass and fresh leaf below flashes with the light, as if carried away in a flood that is flecked with the spume of mayflower.</p> <p>I have never seen such a clear horizon here, without the smudge of orange that denotes the traffic of the east Midlands. There are no vapour trails, and a strong wind blows from the horizon as if the Atlantic coast were coming to the east coast. I feel dizzy from the light. Is this what it means to feel light-headed? After a hilltop circular route of a couple of miles via farmland and stony track, we are light-hearted also about compromises and contradictions still to be lived through. We have at least seen a real clear horizon, and a way ahead. The view without the room.</p> <p>The day is closing when we walk down through the shadows of Langton by Spilsby, where the blackbirds are scurrying under the hedgerows and the rabbits are making their evening congregation. Near home, I see a barn owl, like a huge white moth, and my son finds a hedgehog \u2013 the first he\u2019s ever seen and the first live one I\u2019ve seen for several years. It is definitely more interesting than the roadside litter.<br><strong>Will Cohu</strong><strong>, author of Nothing But Grass, and The Wolf Pit (<a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/1064048/will-cohu.html\">Penguin</a>)</strong></p> <h2>From a garden marathon to a London commuter run</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"836a29636d2f327e5761b2979f1c4d747159ac42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/836a29636d2f327e5761b2979f1c4d747159ac42/0_0_5646_3764/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oxford Street is deserted during the lockdown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oxford Street is deserted during the lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was counting out the pieces of dried pasta that gave me the first flutters of panic. The total was 1,666 (two bags of penne and about half a bag of fusilli). Each piece represented two lengths of my back garden and by the time I\u2019d jogged each one from a bucket by the backdoor to another by the shed, I\u2019d have clocked up 26.2 miles \u2013 and completed my first (and without doubt last) backyard marathon.<br><br>Using the pieces of pasta to keep track of the interminable lengths may have been my good idea, but the dubious part \u2013 to run so far in such a tiny space \u2013 can be laid firmly at the feet of the organisers of the London Marathon. The event was due to be held on 28 April, and in a bid to raise much-needed funds for the many charities that usually benefit from it, they suggested doing <a href=\"https://www.twopointsixchallenge.co.uk/\">a 2.6 challenge at home instead</a> \u2013 and whatever that may be (climbing stairs, baking cakes, pulling up weeds, anything with a two and six in it), you followed it up with a donation to a favourite charity. Listening to the marathon\u2019s event director, Hugh Brasher, explain it on the radio inspired me and, on a whim, I decided to join in. But rather than 2.6 miles, I\u2019d try and do the full marathon distance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1b29867dcfe31dac3dc60dbabafd09a59a25f6c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b29867dcfe31dac3dc60dbabafd09a59a25f6c8/0_18_518_647/400.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Love runs the marathon in his garden\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Love runs the marathon in his garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Love</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>I started at 10am on the Sunday. My 18-year-old daughter ran the first 2.6 miles with me (she had her own bowl of pasta to work through). We live in a terraced house and the garden is long and thin, but the bit you can actually run on not quite 10 metres long. Partly paved and partly lawn, it\u2019s hardly an ideal running surface. Up and down I went. Every 10 laps I changed direction so I was running clockwise and then anti-clockwise to save my ankles and knees. Usually, when you run a marathon, every pub you pass is blaring out Keep on Running, but here it was Let\u2019s Twist Again \u2013 as I turned and turned and turned again. And all the while the dog snoozed in the sun, acting like a furry roundabout in the middle of the turf.<br>After 5 hours and 23 minutes I staggered to the end, where my wife had strung up a loo-roll finishing tape for me to burst through. The neighbours cheered over the fence and presented me with a coffee-and-walnut cake they\u2019d baked during the hours while I was running. I raised \u00a3800 for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res \u2013 not quite Captain Tom but it\u2019s a start. And we ate the pasta for supper \u2013 each piece marinated by the sweat of my palms!<br><br>Yesterday morning \u2013 as England\u2019s lockdown eased and my own horizon stretched \u2013 I ran in to work. Of course, I\u2019ve been able to jog around my local park, but now I\u2019m able to really stretch my legs. I ran into the centre of London. I jogged down an almost-empty Oxford Street. I crossed Trafalgar Square and saluted Nelson. I ran along the river and headed past St Paul\u2019s. There were still some empty squares and lonely streets. I ran and ran and I didn\u2019t turn round once. The air felt clean. It was glorious. <br><strong>Martin Love, Observer magazine journalist</strong></p>",

They could see a shortfall of up to \u00a33.5bn across the local government social care sector, with 225,000 adult social care places put at risk within this financial year, it says.</p> \n<p>The government announced on Tuesday a further \u00a3600m for social care, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/18/coronavirus-uk-english-councils-welcome-extra-16bn-support\">on top of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/18/coronavirus-uk-english-councils-welcome-extra-16bn-support\">\u00a33.2bn </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/18/coronavirus-uk-english-councils-welcome-extra-16bn-support\">given to councils in the last two months</a>.

Social care is largely funded by councils up and down the country, and makes up a huge proportion of our spending. We have a legal duty to balance budgets, so unless the funding gap is closed then cuts are inevitable.</p> \n<p>\u201cCouncils have been trying to care for more people with less money every year for a decade, but unless the government acts there is only so much councils will be able to do to protect those most in need.\u201d</p> \n<p>The analysis comes as councillors claim they were told to expect to share the financial burden of fighting the virus by Jenrick, who also said local authorities should not \u201clabour under the false impression\u201d that all of their costs will be reimbursed.</p> \n<p>There is also concern that councils have been asked to give estimates to the government on what is needed based on a lockdown period lasting three months only. Labour has said it is obvious that some elements of restriction are due to continue for longer.</p> \n<p>Shadow communities and local government secretary Steve Reed said: \u201cThis government promised to do whatever it takes \u2013 if our loved ones see care taken away in their hour of need it will be devastating and unacceptable. The government should change course now.\u201d<br><br>Councils are suffering revenue losses during the coronavirus pandemic, with closed car parks leading to zero income in April for some local authorities. There has also been a severe reduction in council tax as thousands move onto universal credit. Business rates and rents from commercial properties have also been drastically reduced due to the pandemic.</p> \n<p>A local authority source said budgets set for this year have effectively been \u201cripped up\u201d and they cannot wait for the December local funding settlement to see a cash boost. <br><br>Labour\u2019s analysis shows that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/23/uks-emergency-coronavirus-bill-will-put-vulnerable-at-risk\">if local authorities did not touch their social care budgets, to make cuts</a> they would have to close all libraries, children\u2019s centres, leisure centres, stop all spending on parks, turn off all street lights, carry out no winter gritting, end all planning and building control work.</p> \n<p>Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: \u201cMaking sure council services don\u2019t collapse because of the extra costs caused by the virus and income losses from the lockdown have to be a priority for ministers.\u201d</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \u201cWe\u2019re giving councils an unprecedented package of support, including \u00a33.2bn emergency funding, to tackle the immediate pressures they have told us they\u2019re facing.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is on top of English councils\u2019 core spending power rising by over \u00a32.9bn this financial year and today we announced a further \u00a3600m to help reduce the infection rate in care homes.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government will continue to work closely with councils as the pandemic progresses to develop an ongoing assessment of costs as they support their communities through this national emergency.\u201d</p> \n<p>The department also said councils will be allowed to defer \u00a32.6bn in business rates payments to central government and that they have been paid \u00a3850m in social care grants upfront in April.</p>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Deaths worldwide near 300,000</strong></h2> <p>The number of lives lost worldwide in the coronavirus pandemic is nearing 300,000, according to Johns Hopkins University figures, with 297,197 deaths reported. There are 4,347,015 confirmed infections.The true figure is likely to be significantly higher as a result of underreporting or differing definitions of what constitutes a death from coronavirus.</p> <h2><strong>Moscow ascribes over 60% of coronavirus deaths in April to other causes</strong></h2> <p>The city of Moscow said on Wednesday it had ascribed the deaths of more than 60% of coronavirus patients in April to other causes as it defended what it said was the superior way it counted the number of people killed by the novel virus. At 242,271, Russia has the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world after the United States, but with 2,212 coronavirus deaths, it also has one of the world\u2019s lowest reported mortality rates.</p> <h2><strong>Trump criticises Fauci\u2019s warnings over reopening</strong></h2> <p>US President Donald Trump on Wednesday has criticised a warning given by top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci this week about the dangers of reopening the economy too quickly. \u201cTo me it\u2019s not an acceptable answer especially when it comes to schools,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House, noting he was surprised by the response Fauci gave to lawmakers in testimony to the US Senate on Tuesday.</p> <h2><strong>Italian doctors find link between Covid-19 and inflammatory disorder</strong></h2> <p>Doctors in Italy have reported the first clear evidence of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">link between Covid-19 and a rare but serious inflammatory disorder</a> that has required some children to undergo life-saving treatment in intensive care units. The mysterious condition emerged last month when NHS bosses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/nhs-warns-of-rise-in-children-with-new-illness-that-may-be-linked-to-coronavirus\">issued an alert</a> to doctors after hospitals admitted a number of children with a mix of <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/toxic-shock-syndrome/\">toxic shock</a> and symptoms seen in an inflammatory disorder known as Kawasaki disease.</p> <h2><strong>China begins testing every resident in Wuhan</strong></h2> <p>Chinese authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/10-days-battle-wuhan-covid-19-testing-plan\">have plans to test every resident in Wuhan</a>, after a small outbreak was reported this week. The city in Hubei province, where the virus is believed to have originated with the first recorded cases, had reported few daily cases since early March and none since early April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/now-it-starts-again-new-coronavirus-outbreaks-spark-unease-in-china\">until a cluster of six was confirmed at the weekend</a>. There is serious concern over the outbreak in Wuhan, despite the small size. He Qinghua from the bureau of disease prevention and control, told a press conference disease control was generally stable across the nation, but there were still challenges.</p> <h2><strong>Hong Kong to test hundreds of families</strong></h2> <p>Hong Kong authorities are going to screen hundreds of families, local media is reporting, after its 23-day run of no local infections was broken with the diagnosis of Covid-19 in a 66-year-old woman with no recent travel history, and her five-year-old granddaughter.</p> <h2><strong>Japan is expected to lift the state of emergency for 39 of 47 prefectures</strong></h2> <p>Japan is expected to lift the state of emergency for 39 of its 47 prefectures on Thursday, local media reported. The world\u2019s third-largest economy declared a nationwide state of emergency a month ago, urging citizens to reduce person-to-person contact by 80% in an effort to slow the pace of new infections and ease the strain on medical services.</p> <h2><strong>Japan suicides decline as lockdown causes shift in stress factors</strong></h2> <p>Suicide in Japan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/japan-suicides-fall-sharply-as-covid-19-lockdown-causes-shift-in-stress-factors\">fell by 20% in April compared to 2019, the biggest drop in five years</a>, despite fears of the coronavirus pandemic causing increased stress and many prevention helplines either not operating or being short-staffed. People spending more time at home with their families, fewer people commuting to work and the start of the school year being delayed are seen as factors in the fall.</p> <h2><strong>New Zealand announces NZ$50bn fund</strong></h2> <p>Finance minister Grant Robertson has unveiled an unprecedented NZ$50bn fund to save jobs and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/new-zealand-budget-robertson-lays-out-50bn-plan-to-return-jobs-to-pre-covid-19-levels\">reduce unemployment to pre-coronavirus levels within two years</a>. The huge figure, announced alongside the annual Budget on Thursday, equates to about 17% of the nation\u2019s GDP and 17 times more than what a New Zealand government usually allocates to new spending in its budgets. Underscoring the massive challenges facing the economy as it emerges from lockdown, Robertson said the fund was \u201cthe most significant financial commitment in modern history\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Virus may never be eradicated \u2013 WHO</strong></h2> <p>The coronavirus that causes Covid-19 could become endemic like HIV, the World Health Organization has said, warning against any attempt to predict how long it would keep circulating and calling for a \u201cmassive effort\u201d to counter it. \u201cIt is important to put this on the table: this virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/global-report-who-says-covid-19-may-never-go-and-warns-of-mental-health-crisis\">and this virus may never go away</a>,\u201d said Michael Ryan, the WHO\u2019s emergencies chief.

The paper\u2019s claims did not hold up, it was retracted, and ensuing conflicts between Mikovits and her employer, a private lab, culminated in her arrest in 2012 on charges of being a fugitive from justice, after she allegedly absconded with notebooks and proprietary data. Criminal charges were later dropped, <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/fact-checking-judy-mikovits-controversial-virologist-attacking-anthony-fauci-viral#\">according to reports</a>.</p> <p>Since then she has alleged she has been the victim of widespread corruption in the scientific community, and has presented <a href=\"https://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/08/prweb14577077.htm\">antivaxx-friendly autism conferences</a> with baseless theories about how viruses play a role in causing autism. Many anti-vaxxers believe that vaccines such as the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine causes autism in children, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/04/no-link-between-autism-and-mmr-affirms-major-study\">a claim that has been extensively d</a>ebunked.</p> <p>Now she has a book, Plague of Corruption, outlining these alongside other theories and grievances.</p> <p>Willis, the interviewer, who has described himself on Facebook as a \u201cfather, film-maker, activist\u201d has been an actor and an eclectic film-maker for some years. <br>His work often has a political flavour \u2013 he made videos in support of the Bernie Sanders campaign in 2016 and did the same for Tulsi Gabbard during her presidential campaign (his Facebook wall reveals him to have been a vocal supporter of both politicians).</p> <p>He has also made yoga and meditation videos, and the film nonprofit he founded in 2006 co-produced a <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/311342259\">film</a> on the wellness effects of psychedelic drugs. Willis told the LA Times he made the Plandemic film himself at little cost; researchers have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlKapDC/status/1259263588398698497\">pointed to fundraising</a> by prominent conspiracy theorists aimed at publicising Mikovits\u2019s book.</p> <p>The claims Mikovits made in the interview \u2013 about her own career, the possibility that the virus was engineered by humans, and the proper epidemiological approach to containing it \u2013 were serially debunked, not least in <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/fact-checking-judy-mikovits-controversial-virologist-attacking-anthony-fauci-viral\">Science</a>, which also did a sweeping 2011 <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/333/6050/1694.full.pdf\">postmortem</a> on what led to the publication of her later-retracted 2009 paper.</p> <p>They also played directly into established anti-vaxxer beliefs, which have become integrated into broader, conspiracy-minded, mostly rightwing anti-lockdown narratives.</p> <p>These include the idea that the virus was human-made, possibly in the Wuhan laboratory; that mandatory vaccination is a project by big pharma profiteers that will kill millions; that public health authorities (including Dr Anthony Fauci) are corrupt and not to be trusted.</p> <p>There is no evidence for any of this, as <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/05/08/852451652/seen-plandemic-we-take-a-close-look-at-the-viral-conspiracy-video-s-claims\">many outlets</a> have shown.

We tend to accept anything in documentary format as fact, especially when it looks good,\u201d she added.</p> <p>But also crucial was the large number of Facebook groups, and anti-vaxx and \u201cwellness\u201d influencers who were primed to spread the message. In this respect, Australian anti-vaxxers had a global impact.</p> <p>Gallagher\u2019s research shows that an Australia-led Facebook group, \u201c99% unite Main Group \u2018it\u2019s us or them\u2019\u201d, was one of the central nodes which spread links to the video, and Judy Mikovits\u2019s name, across Facebook.</p> <p>At the time of Gallagher\u2019s analysis, that group had 32,052 members; now that figure has shot up to 43,588.</p> <p>Other groups spreading the video include those devoted to the false idea that aircraft vapour trails are \u201cchemtrails\u201d containing dangerous chemicals; groups in support of conservatives such as Donald Trump or broadcaster Rush Limbaugh, and another group associated with the \u201cQAnon\u201d conspiracy theory.</p> <p>The spread of disinformation during the pandemic has also been aided by charismatic influencers.

He added that while unemployment was forecast to hit 9.8% in the June quarter, his stimulus package could reduce the figure to 4.2% in two years, the same jobless number as in March this year, before the coronavirus lockdown.</p> <p>The $50bn fund includes $13.9bn that has been spent already and $15.9bn of measures announced on Thursday or to be unveiled in coming weeks.</p> <p>Robertson said that this left $20.2bn remaining for future spending \u2013 including on costs incurred by further outbreaks of Covid-19, which he was \u201coptimistic\u201d the country had curbed, he said.</p> <p>Brad Olsen, an economist from Infometrics, praised the fund as \u201cthe most comprehensive investment package New Zealand has ever seen,\u201d saying a massive crisis called for an equally massive stimulus, but was cautious about how swift the country\u2019s recovery would be.</p> <p>\u201cWe remain sceptical about the overly optimistic view from Treasury that the economy can return to normal levels of operation within two years,\u201d Olsen said.</p> <p>In 2019, Robertson made world headlines for his so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/30/new-zealand-wellbeing-budget-jacinda-ardern-unveils-billions-to-care-for-most-vulnerable\">wellbeing budget</a>, which set out a framework to improve the lives of New Zealanders in five main areas, including child welfare, mental health, and a transition to a lower-carbon economy.</p> <p>But while the title \u201cWellbeing Budget 2020\u201d featured on the document\u2019s cover this year, its focus was firmly on Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cWe will be able to provide [an update on wellbeing] when circumstances become more stable, enabling more accurate measurement and analysis,\u201d the document said.</p> <p>The Budget itself did not include cash payments for households or a major social welfare initiative for those already out of work, but Robertson pointed to the government\u2019s NZ$25 benefit increase in late March, as the Covid-19 crisis began to hit New Zealand\u2019s economy, as evidence that the government had already shored up support.</p> <p>A total of 21 people have died from Covid-19 in New Zealand. Ardern has won praise for shutting down the country one month after the first case of the virus arrived and before there were any deaths.</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>In a move virtually unprecedented in professional sports in a year that is absolutely without precedent, the Australian Rugby League Commission have codified major changes to the way the game will be officiated for the remainder of the 2020 season and beyond.</p> <p>The NRL will drop its two-referee system and return to a single referee when the game resumes on 28 May, a change that appears to be part-driven by cost reduction and part-driven by populism. The commission has also approved a rule change that will allow a referee to award a new set of six to an attacking team who have fallen victim to a ruck infringement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/08/the-problem-isnt-nrl-players-risking-the-flu-its-the-confusion-they-cause-about-vaccines\">The problem isn\u2019t NRL players risking the flu, it\u2019s the confusion they cause about vaccines | Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It had been flagged in the media leading up to the announcement, but it is nevertheless a shocking move with the season to resume in two weeks. Project Apollo, charged with facilitating the game\u2019s return, has seemingly taken over the game\u2019s law book and decided to make both a major rule change and a major officiating change midseason. They did so with little consultation.</p> <p>The Professional Rugby League Match Officials association called it \u201cdisrespectful\u201d while they would \u201cnot rule out\u201d the prospect of industrial action. Players have had little say with no representatives on Project Apollo.</p> <p>The ratification of these decisions will have a significant impact on the competition.</p> <p>The move to a single referee in the middle of a campaign brings into question the purity of a competition that already had integrity concerns based around a shortened season and the maintaining of competition points from the first two rounds.</p> <p>A mid-season rule change removing a penalty and replacing it with a six-again scenario \u2013 with little consultation \u2013 crunches any pretence of the season maintaining anything near its integrity.</p> <p>The ARLC seems to be having an each-way bet. They are banking on continuity by ensuring the two pre-break rounds count but have used the suspension of play to fundamentally alter the nature of the game with the changes.</p> <p>The aims are certainly noble, at least at face value. The league is rightly trying to save on costs during a period of significant financial strain and there appears to be a genuine desire to speed up the game and eliminate wrestling in the ruck.</p> <p>But the moves are counter to each other and the rule change simply has not been stress-tested. They should theoretically lead to fewer penalties, but that does not necessarily equate to a greater flow. A single referee is sure to create more messiness in the ruck. It will lead to a greater attempt to not only wrestle but also to play at the ball.</p> <p>The move to a single referee also seems to miss the primary issue many had with the second referee, which was the issue of primacy and standing. When first introduced, both referees were given equal stature. This then moved to a dominant/pocket referee scenario. The pocket official still had a whistle though, and would at times be the dominant referee. </p> <p>The switch to one referee is stunning, but it is the out-of-the-box six again rule that provides the prospect of creating the most drama. It is essentially creating an option between no penalty and a penalty that has not, in any serious manner, been tried since the invention of the differential penalty in the mid-1980s.</p> <p>The NRL is bullish about the positives the rule may bring about, but there seems to have been little thought put into how this rule can and will be manipulated. There is very little disadvantage to giving away an infringement early in a set. Teams coming off their own line would much prefer a penalty than a six-again to clear via a kick for touch. Similarly teams defending their own line clinging to a small lead have little disincentive not to infringe, particularly if early in the tackle count and they have not reached a threshold for repeated infringements. There has been talk of repeated infringements resulting in a sin bin, but it is unclear whether the referee will still be able to award a penalty for a single ruck infringement.</p> <p>These are major changes for the NRL. They have been made for the right reasons but only time will tell if they were the right decisions.</p>",

The pandemic and the ensuing economic downturn was robbing people of their lives and livelihoods around the world.

  "<p>The Nana Otafrija pallbearers might look slick, but they are not afraid to get dirty. Their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvWXwVWJiq4&amp;t=2s\">signature moves</a>, carried out with a coffin in tow, include dropping to all-fours and crawling in unison; or lying on their backs, the coffin balanced on top of them, legs moving in time to the music \u2013 as though they have been crushed by the casket.</p> \n<p>The dancing pallbearers first became famous in 2017 when their so-called \u201ccoffin dance\u201d featured in a BBC documentary. Then, someone added an EDM track and a meme was born: footage of the dancers was spliced with botched feats of strength and other accidents and posted all over the internet.</p> \n<p>Now, the coronavirus pandemic has transformed their performance into a way to warn people of the dangers of ignoring social distancing.</p> \n<p>In India, policemen dressed in uniform<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jay_Apoorva18/status/1255399854936928258?s=20\"> danced along to the track</a> while carrying a (healthy) man on a stretcher.

He came up with the idea of dancing with the coffin because he wanted people to be able to celebrate their dead. He also noticed that people would often grow so upset at their solemn funerals that they would faint or injure themselves. If they could focus on the dancing, he reasoned, they would be less likely to get hurt.</p> \n<p>Once the pandemic is over, Aidoo hopes to teach people around the world to hold uplifting funerals.</p> \n<p>\u201cMost people love the display\u201d, said Aidoo, \u201cbecause they want to be happy.\u201d When people\u2019s parents die, for example, \u201cYou know what your mom and dad did for you,\u201d said Aidoo. \u201cWhy should you cry?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen you know the life that he or she spent before dying, I think it\u2019s a great thing for you to celebrate.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"949f8caad28bb0b0bc0d94aa28cb5b22024a9729\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/949f8caad28bb0b0bc0d94aa28cb5b22024a9729/0_1_757_454/500.jpg\" alt=\"Benjamin Aidoo.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Benjamin Aidoo.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Sullivan/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Things changed for Aidoo\u2019s business when the family of a member of parliament who had died hired Aidoo and his fellow pallbearers \u2013 but insisted they wear all-white, matching outfits.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/the-three-step-plan-to-relax-restrictions-and-reopen-australia-after-coronavirus-crisis\">Scott Morrison has laid out a three-step plan</a> to reopen Australia by July, and the states and territories have quickly followed suit with their own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/11/social-distancing-rules-australia-guidelines-coronavirus-laws-physical-restrictions-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa\">timelines for easing coronavirus restrictions</a>.</p> \n<p>But according to Prof Hassan Vally, an infectious disease epidemiologist at LaTrobe University, lifting restrictions has given some people false hope that this is the beginning of the end of the pandemic, when it is \u201conly the beginning of the end of restrictions \u2026 we still live with coronavirus\u201d.</p> \n<p>So how can we stay safe while exercising our newfound freedoms? Guardian Australia asked several epidemiologists and healthcare professionals to answer some common questions.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/the-three-step-plan-to-relax-restrictions-and-reopen-australia-after-coronavirus-crisis\">The three-step plan for reopening Australia after Covid-19 and what Stage 1, 2 and 3 looks like</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>Should I wear a mask if I go outside? What about when I go grocery shopping or get into a taxi/Uber?</strong></h2> \n<p>The effectiveness of wearing masks in public has been the topic of much debate. <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2020/04/coronavirus-covid-19-information-on-the-use-of-surgical-masks_0.pdf\">Australian government\u2019s advice</a> is that surgical masks are only useful to stop you from spreading coronavirus to another person. In America, where rates of infection are higher, the Centre for Disease Control recommends <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/DIY-cloth-face-covering-instructions.pdf\">wearing cloth face coverings in public settings</a> where social distancing is difficult to slow the spread of Covid-19, as well as to prevent those with the virus who may be asymptomatic from spreading it to others. </p> \n<p>Unless you have been given medical advice suggesting otherwise, don\u2019t bother wearing a mask when going out, according to the University of Newcastle professor of nursing, Brett Mitchell.</p> \n<p>This is because if you haven\u2019t received training on how to correctly use a mask, wearing one could actually increase your risk of catching the virus.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe front of the mask will \u2018catch\u2019 pathogens. Every time you adjust or touch your masks, your hands could become contaminated. Everything you then touch could become contaminated,\u201d Mitchell says.</p> \n<p>You can find the Guardian\u2019s guide to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/what-kind-of-face-mask-will-best-protect-you-against-coronavirus-covid-19\">correctly using and making masks here</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>Should I use gloves?</strong></h2> \n<p>The Australian government recommends regular hand-washing to prevent the spread of Covid-19, but doesn\u2019t suggest people cover their hands by wearing gloves. Mitchell cautions they might give you a false sense of security.</p> \n<p>\u201cGloves are not much different to hands,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cThey can transfer pathogens too and also become contaminated when you touch something.\u201d</p> \n<p>If you do want to want to wear gloves, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/are-you-wearing-gloves-or-a-mask-to-the-shops-you-might-be-doing-it-wrong-137393\">the Conversation has this guide</a> to removing them properly.</p> \n<h2><strong>How do I greet my loved ones? Can I hug them?</strong></h2> \n<p>Vally agrees that \u201cwhile no one is going to be put in jail for hugging someone, the whole reason that these restrictions are being relaxed is on the presumption and the assurance that people are going to be responsible\u201d.</p> \n<p>According to Vally, that means keeping a 1.5-metre distance from people with whom you don\u2019t share a household and making sure you wash your hands a lot.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe trade-off is you get so see people now, but you still have to follow all of these principles,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>That means for now, we will need to embrace alternative ways of greeting each other waving, elbow bumping and \u201cfootshaking\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/waltercotte/status/1234108801810411520\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/iPWbN82jsX\">pic.twitter.com/iPWbN82jsX</a></p>\u2014 Walter Cotte W.

Vally says that \u201cmost people have more room outside and the outside air has better circulation and the virus diffuses a bit more easily in the air if you are outside. So I would say it is probably better.\u201d</p> \n<p>But the most important thing is that we all keep 1.5 metres away from guests, whether we are inside or outside.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/07/scott-morrison-wants-australia-to-get-back-on-the-job-but-what-does-a-covid-safe-workplace-look-like\">Scott Morrison wants Australia to get back on the job. But what does a Covid-safe workplace look like?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>Should I be limiting the total number of family or friends that I am exposing myself to?</strong></h2> \n<p>Yes. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/11/social-distancing-rules-australia-guidelines-coronavirus-laws-physical-restrictions-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa\">Depending where you live</a>, you could soon be allowed to have upwards of five guests over to your house. But Vally says that doesn\u2019t mean you should be having five different people over every night of the week.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe whole reason we are [only allowing a few visitors at a time] is to limit the amount of contact we have with people in case we have the virus and we are spreading it,\u201d Vally says.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are two scenarios: there is one person who invites five different people over each night of the week, meaning there are 35 people they could infect, or there is one person who sees the same five or 10 people in total under the new restrictions. If you show common sense and only catch up with closest friends and family, that is going to be better for everyone.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Do I need to wipe down </strong><strong>outdoor equipment before use? </strong></h2> \n<p>Playgrounds have already started reopening in parts of South Australia. Despite assurances that they will be regularly cleaned, <a href=\"https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/messenger/playgrounds-across-adelaide-start-to-reopen-following-advice-of-sa-health/news-story/9e1074ae5fe580c3eeb35a864c6c6d8d\">one metropolitan council has suggested</a> parents might like to to wipe down any equipment before their child uses it. NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian suggested parents do the same when the state\u2019s playgrounds reopen on 15 May.</p> \n<p>But Vally, whose research includes child health, says this is a situation where the cost could outweigh the risks. Washing public gym or play equipment before using it \u201csounds great in theory but is on the whole impractical,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe most sensible approach is to make sure your children know not to touch their face, and then wash their hands multiple times in between their play sessions and after they have played.\u201d</p> \n<p>The same goes for adults: \u201cJust assume [the gym equipment] could be contaminated. Don\u2019t touch your face and wash your hands regularly,\u201d Vally says.</p> \n<h2><strong>Is it safe to pat other peoples\u2019 dogs? </strong></h2> \n<p>Thankfully, Vally says that patting a dog \u2013 \u201cwhich is a lovely thing to do\u201d \u2013 poses a very low risk of transmission. \u201cI would just encourage people to keep washing their hands. That seems like a reasonable precaution given the chances of a virus sticking to your dog\u2019s fur and then sticking to your hands,\u201d he says.</p> \n<h2><strong>What do I do if there are lots of people in a public place? </strong></h2> \n<p>Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, <a href=\"https://thewest.com.au/news/coronavirus/australias-chief-medical-officer-professor-brendan-murphy-calls-for-shoppers-to-stop-loitering-around-shopping-centres-ng-b881543473z\">has warned Australians against entering crowded shopping centres</a>, in response to the crowds of people not practising social distancing in Perth\u2019s CBD over the Mother\u2019s Day weekend.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you are arriving at a shopping centre and you find a crowd at an escalator not wanting to practise social distancing or crowded together, don\u2019t go in.

But remember that the other person you interact with could be a source, so you are also protecting yourself and others from an infection they may have by keeping distance,\u201d she says.</p> \n<h2><strong>Is it safe to try on clothes at a store? </strong></h2> \n<p>\u201cI believe it\u2019s quite safe,\u201d McLaws says.</p> \n<h2><strong>Should I wash or sanitise my hands every time I go into a store?</strong></h2> \n<p>Yes, according to McLaws.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sign of respect: you are showing the other customers and workers in the shop that you are removing your germs before entering their space,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>You should also try not to touch your face after you have sanitised your hands.</p> \n<h2><strong>Should I avoid taking public transport if I can?</strong></h2> \n<p>Prof Mark Stevenson, an epidemiologist and professor of urban transport and public health at Melbourne University, says we need to acknowledge public transport is a necessary resource for many and encourage its use in the long term to promote environmental sustainability.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut during this pandemic, the public transport system cannot operate as it did before,\u201d Stevenson warns. Gone are the days where we can cram into a stuffed 5pm train carriage.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo I would say, yes, avoid it if you can. But I would also urge employees to think about staggering shift start and end times. And the education department needs to think about starting different schools at different times,\u201d he says.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/28/looks-like-threesomes-are-back-nsws-two-visitor-rule-presents-opportunities-and-conundrums\">'Looks like threesomes are back': NSW's two-visitor rule presents opportunities \u2013 and conundrums</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>If I need to take public transport, how can I stay safe? </strong></h2> \n<p>There is no real difference between sitting and standing in terms of risk of infection. But you can keep safe by waiting for another bus, train or tram if yours looks crowded, and sanitising your hands immediately before getting on and after disembarking, Stevenson says.</p> \n<h2><strong>If the bus driver is using recirculated air-conditioning, should I politely ask them to turn it off?</strong></h2> \n<p>Yes. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/07/scott-morrison-wants-australia-to-get-back-on-the-job-but-what-does-a-covid-safe-workplace-look-like\">Safe Work Australia recommends</a> ride-sharing cars and retail stores avoid using recirculated air-conditioning to avoid regurgitating germs in a small space.</p> \n<p>Stevenson agrees that in some instances, it\u2019s probably a good idea to ask the bus driver to turn the air-conditioning off.</p> \n<h2><strong>Do I still need to press buttons </strong><strong>with my elbow?</strong></h2> \n<p>Yes, use your elbow, wrist or knee, because \u201ctouching buttons with your hands and then touching your face is how you can increase transmission quite quickly, Stevenson says.</p> \n<p>But always make sure you sanitise your hands when you disembark anyway because it\u2019s very hard to navigate public transport without touching something.</p>",

However, it is not yet clear whether they have a lower chance of catching Covid-19. Although fewer children have been picked up in national testing programs, this could be due to fewer being tested. During the early phase of the epidemic in Europe, adult travelers played a dominant role in seeding infections, which also meant, purely for circumstantial reasons, that children would have played a less significant role in spreading infections.</p> \n  <p>Studies on this question give a mixed picture. One analysis, in <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30287-5/fulltext\">the Lancet Infectious Diseases</a>, of households with confirmed Covid-19 in Shenzhen, China, found that children younger than 10 were just as likely as adults to get infected. However, there is other evidence from South Korea, Italy and Iceland suggesting lower infection rates among children. Some of the difference could also be down to differences in social mixing.</p> \n  <p><strong>Why do children react differently to adults?</strong></p> \n  <p>For many infectious diseases, there is a U-shaped risk curve, with the youngest and oldest in society being most vulnerable. Covid-19 does not follow this pattern \u2013 even toddlers and newborn babies typically only experience mild symptoms. One theory is that children\u2019s lungs might contain fewer of the ACE2 receptors that the virus uses to enter cells. To confirm this, researchers would need to study tissue samples from children. Another possibility is that children\u2019s immune systems respond in a more optimal way to the virus \u2013 mounting a strong enough response to get rid of the infection, but without going into overdrive and flooding the body with inflammatory proteins, which are known to sometimes cause problems in adult patients.</p> \n  <p><strong>Are children invisible transmitters?</strong><br></p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-most-infections-spread-by-people-yet-to-show-symptoms-scientists\">Asymptomatic transmission</a> is known to play an important role in the spread of Covid-19 \u2013 studies have shown that in general people appear to be at their most infectious in the day or so before symptoms start. This raises the question of whether children are silent spreaders of the virus. A recent German study, which compared the viral load of nearly 4,000 people aged from one to 100 years old, added weight to this idea. It found that regardless of age, people appeared to shed a similar level of virus, suggesting they could be equally infectious. However, a caveat is that the study did not measure real-life transmission in children. As schools reopen and community transmission is tracked closely in some European countries, a clearer answer on this is likely to emerge in the coming months.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/are-children-less-susceptible-to-coronavirus\">Are children less susceptible to coronavirus?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T22:43:59.956Z\">at 11.43pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebc678c8f080c727453a747\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T21:37:16.561Z\">10.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Per White House press pool reporters, the president also called Dr Anthony Fauci\u2019s message yesterday cautioning against opening schools too soon \u201cunacceptable\u201d. </strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cI was surprised by his answer,\u201d Trump said. \u201cTo me it\u2019s not an acceptable answer especially when it comes to schools.\u201d<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Yamiche/status/1260685470909988864\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Pres Trump: The \"only thing\" that would be acceptable is teachers staying home a bit longer bc the coronavirus \"attacks age.\"<br><br>Dr. Fauci yesterday: \"I think we better be careful if we are not cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects.\"</p>\u2014 Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Yamiche/status/1260685470909988864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 13, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Yesterday, the top public health official contradicted Trump, who urged schools and businesses to reopen and said the White House has set a target of having 100m vaccine doses by the autumn.

Garcia will serve the rest of Hill\u2019s term, which goes until the end of the year, and will have to run again in November. </p> \n  <p>The district in Southern California has flipped between Democrat and Republican over the last few years. The district voted for Republican Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election, but voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. Hill took the seat of a Republican incumbent in the 2018 midterm elections. </p> \n  <p>Whether this special election can be used as a litmus test for the possibilities of what\u2019s to come in November is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/13/what-does-it-signal-battle-house-if-republican-wins-californias-special-election/\">unclear</a> as special elections tend to have lower turnout. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T21:18:49.744Z\">at 10.18pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebc56948f08d99d46a16707\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T20:27:42.105Z\">9.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sam-levine\">Sam Levine</a> reports: </p> \n  <p>Missouri Republicans have approved a new ballot measure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/11/missouri-republicans-gutting-gerrymandering-reform\">seeking to undo</a> significant gerrymandering reform voters overwhelmingly approved just two years ago.<br></p> \n  <p>In 2018, 62% of Missouri voters supported a constitutional amendment to put a non-partisan demographer in charge of drawing the districts for state legislators. The measure also established prioritized criteria for the demographer to follow, making partisan fairness and competitiveness one of the most important ones. The reform would likely weaken Republican control of the state legislature, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/c49a2cf375894f539ca4aad5aafc6a74\">an Associated Press analysis</a> found.</p> \n  <p>The next round of redistricting won\u2019t take place until 2021, and the demographer hasn\u2019t even been chosen yet. But if voters <a href=\"https://www.senate.mo.gov/20info/BTS_Web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=R&amp;BillID=26838179\">approve</a> the new Republican proposal, they would eliminate the position entirely and return redistricting power to committees picked by the state Democratic and Republican parties and the governor. It makes partisan fairness and competitiveness the least important criteria to follow when redistricting, instead prioritizing keeping districts compact and contiguous.</p> \n  <p>The U.S. constitution requires districts to have roughly the same number of people in each district and states have long used the all residents as the basis for drawing districts. But the Republican proposal requires districts to be drawn on the basis of \u201cone person, one vote,\u201d a change many believe would allow districts to be drawn solely on the population eligible to vote.

the New York Times the night before of \u201cneedless suffering and death\u201d to occur if reopening is rushed ie before guidelines on declining cases, lots more testing and hospital capacity, etc, are achieved.</p> \n  <p>But Fauci\u2019s cool testimony drew praise from Republicans.</p> \n  <p>Bright\u2019s testimony tomorrow will be electric, for certain.

This guy, Fauci, may be even more off-base than your average epidemiologist.\u201d </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cde94e03-8944-495c-8a0d-dc41e6593605\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TsRmIhTJ5YM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T18:19:53.738Z\">at 7.19pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebbe9bb8f08d99d46a16143\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T13:20:14.979Z\">2.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>More from the key report on CDC gulf with White House</h2> \n  <p>From the start, CDC staffers working on the guidance were uncomfortable tying it specifically to reopening, and voiced their objections to the White House officials tasked with approving the guidance for release, according to a CDC official granted anonymity because they were not cleared to speak with the press, the AP reports.</p> \n  <p>The CDC\u2019s detailed guidance was eventually shelved by the administration April 30, according to internal government emails and CDC sources who were granted anonymity because they were not cleared to speak to the press.</p> \n  <p>After the AP reported about the burying of the guidance last week, the White House asked the CDC to revive parts of it, which were sent back for approval, according to emails and interviews.</p> \n  <p>On Tuesday, CDC Director Robert Redfield testified before a US Senate committee that the recommendations would be released \u201csoon.\u201d He provided no further details.
