  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Pope begs world leaders to provide coronavirus relief</h2> <p>Pope Francis<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed2b1518f087122eca528f3#block-5ed2b1518f087122eca528f3\">implored world leaders on Saturday</a> to act wisely and generously to provide social and economic relief for the many workers who have lost jobs, and called for the enormous sums of money used to grow and perfect armaments to instead be used to fund research to prevent similar catastrophes in the future.</p> <h2>Top health scientists blame British PM\u2019s chief adviser for losing public trust</h2> <p>Britain\u2019s top public health leaders and scientists have warned the prime minister, Boris Johnson, that trust in the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/30/dominic-cummings-has-broken-covid-19-policy-trust-say-top-scientists\">has been shattered by the Dominic Cummings affair</a> and this now poses real danger to life when lockdown measures are lifted this week. Johnson\u2019s top aide has been embroiled in a scandal after he was seen in Durham, 264 miles from his London home, despite having had coronavirus symptoms.</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/30/tory-poll-lead-collapses-as-voters-say-cummings-should-go\">Opinium poll for the Observer</a>&nbsp;shows 81% of people believe Cummings broke the lockdown rules, and 68%, including 52% of Conservative supporters, think he should resign. The poll also shows the Tories\u2019 lead over Labour has crashed from 26 points at the end of March to just four points now.</p> <h2>Romania\u2019s PM pays fine for breaching own Covid-19 rules</h2> <p>Romania\u2019s prime minister, Ludovic Orban, paid a 3,000 lei fine ($687/\u00a3556) on Saturday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed2ba5a8f087122eca52913#block-5ed2ba5a8f087122eca52913\">for breaking his own coronavirus restrictions</a> by not wearing a face mask and smoking indoors. A picture which went viral on social media shows Orban in his office, sitting around a table with several other cabinet members, smoking a cigarette while none of them wore masks.</p> <h2>Russia to start vaccine trial within two weeks</h2> <p>Russian scientists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed2b7518f08f5e3730118f2#block-5ed2b7518f08f5e3730118f2\">plan to start clinical trials within two weeks</a> on a vaccine to combat coronavirus, the health minister was quoted as saying on Saturday as authorities approved the country\u2019s first anti-Covid-19 drug, Avifavir.</p> <h2>Greece to test arrivals coming from EU\u2019s high-risk airports</h2> <p>Greece <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed2b4e98f08f5e3730118ec#block-5ed2b4e98f08f5e3730118ec\">will conduct coronavirus tests</a> on visitors arriving from airports deemed high-risk by the European Union\u2019s aviation safety agency, EASA, when it opens its airports to tourism traffic on 15 June. EASA regularly updates a list of airports located in affected areas with high risk of coronavirus transmission, which include 13 in the UK, all airports in 22 US states, and those in the Ile de France region surrounding Paris.</p> <h2>Mexican healthcare workers to protest for better protection</h2> <p>Frontline workers in Mexico City\u2019s hospitals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed2d9cf8f084df971c8cc0b#block-5ed2d9cf8f084df971c8cc0b\">are planning a national march</a> on Monday to demand appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Nurses and other health workers account for about a quarter of all of Mexico\u2019s coronavirus infections, government data shows, one of the highest rates in the world.</p> <h2>South Africa\u2019s infection cases top 30,000</h2> <p>The country\u2019s detected coronavirus infections <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed2be3f8f087122eca52924#block-5ed2be3f8f087122eca52924\">now exceed 30,000</a>, the health minister,<strong> </strong>Zweli Mkhize, said on Saturday. South Africa reported 1,727 new cases, taking the cumulative total to 30,967. Its death toll increased by 32 to 643.</p> <h2>Record daily death toll in Pakistan</h2> <p>Pakistan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed290808f08f5e37301180d#block-5ed290808f08f5e37301180d\">has reported 78 coronavirus deaths on Saturday</a>, a single day record since the pandemic arrived in the country in March. The country has recorded 135 deaths in the past two days and over 5,000 new cases, with health experts warning of a steep rise in the number of infections in coming days.</p> <h2>Colombia to lift quarantine in parts of the country</h2> <p>Colombia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed287238f084df971c8caaa#block-5ed287238f084df971c8caaa\">issued new measures</a> to control the spread of coronavirus in three of its most affected cities on Saturday, including the capital, Bogota, as the rest of the country prepares for quarantine rules to start lifting. It has reported more than 26,600 coronavirus cases and 853 deaths.</p> <h2>Death benefit for New York frontline workers announced</h2> <p>The New York state governor, Andrew Cuomo, signed a bill on Saturday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed29a078f084df971c8cb0d#block-5ed29a078f084df971c8cb0d\">will grant death benefits</a> to the families of police officers, public health workers and other frontline workers who have died of the coronavirus. \u201cYou gave your lives for us, we will be there for your families going forward,\u201d Cuomo said as he signed the legislation.</p>",
  "<p>As she looked out of her kitchen window towards a farm in the distance owned by Dominic Cummings\u2019 parents, an elderly woman described her reaction on Friday to the story that had caused shock not just in rural County Durham, but across the whole country.</p> <p>\u201cI have isolated for 10 weeks. I have not seen my children since before Christmas,\u201d said the woman, who asked not to be named. She lives in a pretty village across the valley, with a pond and village green, where life normally passes quietly by with few disturbances.</p> <p>Over the past week, however, the peace has been broken and feelings have run high. \u201cIf there were stocks in the village, Dominic Cummings would be in them,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThere is not one single person around here who is not disgusted. Everyone is furious because we have all played fair. People haven\u2019t been able to go to funerals, they haven\u2019t been able to go to weddings, they haven\u2019t been able to look after people who are dying.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If there were stocks in the village, Cummings would be in them.

I have never come across ill-feeling like this about anything. Everyone feels it is one law for us and one law for them. That is so unfair.\u201d</p> <p>It is now eight days since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/22/dominic-cummings-durham-trip-coronavirus-lockdown\">the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/22/dominic-cummings-durham-trip-coronavirus-lockdown\">Guardian</a></em> and <em>Daily Mirror </em>broke the story of Dominic Cummings\u2019 264-mile journey with his wife and child from London to his parents\u2019 home at the height of the lockdown, and much as Downing Street would love it to, the story is not going away.</p> <p>Last Sunday \u2013 as the controversy began to dominate the news \u2013 the prime minister insisted that his most trusted and powerful adviser had done nothing wrong, either by travelling north or, when he was there, by taking a 60-mile round trip in the family car to Barnard Castle to test his eyesight on his wife\u2019s birthday.</p> <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s defence of Cummings \u2013 when the evidence against him seems so clear to everyone \u2013 has angered and appalled not only the public at large, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/tory-anger-at-dominic-cummings-grows-as-dozens-of-mps-defy-boris-johnson\">also Tory MPs and the Tory press</a> in equal measure.</p> <p>The normally loyal <em>Daily Mail</em> reacted on Monday with an outraged front page headline next to photos of Cummings and Johnson, asking What Planet Are They On?</p> <p>That same afternoon Cummings attempted an explanation in front of the cameras, portraying himself as a normal responsible dad who had left London because he was worried about his son.</p> <p>During an extraordinary appearance in the Downing Street rose garden \u2013 normally reserved for the most important visitors \u2013 the man Johnson dare not sack was, however, completely unrepentant. He would not resign, he said, and had not at any point thought of doing so.</p> <p>In response, MPs of all parties reported that anger from voters had been turned up to boiling point. And more media scorn poured down on the PM and his adviser. Proving that the story had dangerous levels of cut-though, even for a governing party with a large majority, the <em>Daily Star</em> broke its rule of ignoring politics on its front page by printing a cut-out mask of Cummings\u2019 face with the words: Do whatever the hell you want and sod everybody else mask.</p> <p>As the prime minister tries this weekend to get the country to \u201cmove on\u201d from the Cummings row \u2013 and focus on his new track-and-trace plan to defeat coronavirus, while easing the lockdown slowly at the same time \u2013 that <em>Daily Star</em> front page precisely encapsulates his problem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3afb7a6608ac47485c2f342200cb7f6bd6e816d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3afb7a6608ac47485c2f342200cb7f6bd6e816d5/0_15_1604_2003/801.jpg\" alt=\"The Daily Star\u2019s front page on 27 May featuring a Cummings mask.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Daily Star\u2019s front page on 27 May featuring a Cummings mask.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daily Star</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As one despairing Tory MP put it: \u201cWe can say move on and we can say let\u2019s tackle Covid-19 together. But by staking everything on saving Dominic Cummings, we have lost the trust we desperately need to do exactly that. How can we ask people to obey lockdown rules when those at the top are seen to be doing as they want and are not obeying rules? The awful thing is that I think the damage is done.\u201d</p> <p>All last week the inboxes of Tory MPs were full to overflowing with emails from incredulous voters who could see the glaring contradiction in Johnson\u2019s and his government\u2019s position.</p> <p>In the same press conferences, the health Secretary Matt Hancock was earnestly telling people it was their \u201ccivic duty\u201d to self-isolate under the newly launched track-and-trace system if they had been near someone infected with Covid-19, while in the next breath defending Cummings for having done nothing wrong. \u201cIt is a complete disaster. It is not just about rule-breaking, it is the glaring contradictions that make nonsense of messages because Cummings is still in there,\u201d said another senior Tory.</p> <p>More than 100 Conservative members of parliament, afraid that they will never be forgiven by their electorates unless they condemn Cummings publicly, have now chosen to criticise him, risking the prime minister\u2019s wrath.</p> <p>The pressure on the prime minister will only mount further. Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs, has already relayed the extent of anger on the Conservative benches to Downing Street. But this week, the 1922 will meet after MPs return to parliament, and the issue is expected to dominate everything.</p> <p>Some Conservatives are doing their best to cool the controversy. Charles Walker, vice-chair of the 1922 Committee, accepts that many are furious, but says there will be more important issues over which the government will have confront the people in months and years to come. \u201cIf people are very angry at the actions of Dominic Cummings, then that anger is probably only a harbinger of the greater rage to come when the forthcoming recession, or heaven forbid depression, starts to bite,\u201d Walker says. \u201cThen the actions of a worried father will be secondary to the reality of lost businesses, jobs and homes.\u201d</p> <p>Other Conservatives vainly try to claim the fuss is being whipped up by bitter and twisted leftwing and liberal Remainers who want revenge on Cummings for delivering Brexit for Johnson.</p> <p>But saying that it is all politically motivated does not fit with the evidence, and most Tories know that. Our Opinium poll today shows that 81% of all voters think Cummings broke the rules, and that 52% of Tory supporters think he should resign. Almost half of 2019 Tory voters say their respect for the government they voted in has been reduced by the Cummings fiasco.</p> <p>Writing in today\u2019s <em>Observer</em> the Tory hardline Brexiter Peter Bone calls again for Cummings to go and dismisses the idea that it is Remainers stirring trouble. \u201cThe saga is now preventing the government from being able to get their message out clearly,\u201d he writes. \u201cEvery announcement on changes to the lockdown rules, track and trace, and government support, is bogged down with questions about Mr Cummings.\u201d</p> <p>Bone adds: \u201cI believe that Mr Cummings did break the rules. Now, if he had accepted that he had done something wrong, and apologised for it, as a fair-minded person, I would have thought that that would be the end of it. It is the insistence that he did not break the rules and the refusal to apologise that has outraged so many.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday, as Johnson tried desperately to take stories about Dominic Cummings off the front pages and news bulletins, he announced his plans to ease the lockdown by allowing up to six people to meet outside or in each others\u2019 gardens. They could enjoy barbecues together in the hot weather, he said. The announcement surprised many at high levels of government as they had not expected the loosening to be confirmed so soon. Some suspected it had been brought forward to distract from the Cummings row.</p> <p>Now Johnson is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/covid-19-spreading-too-fast-to-lift-uk-lockdown-sage-adviser\">facing new criticism for easing the lockdown too soon</a> and risking a second wave of infections. As The <em>Observer</em> reports today, a group of 27 leading public health experts is warning that his refusal to sack Cummings, and his reliance on systems for track and trace that may not be ready, is a dangerous combination that has seriously undermined trust in government.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This incident will make this challenge even harder for the government to clearly communicate and explain lockdown rules</p> <footer> <cite>Shona Hilton, University of Glasgow</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Other scientists add that the Cummings affair has blown a hole in the government\u2019s messaging. Shona Hilton, professor of public health policy at the University of Glasgow, said: \u201cIn the weeks and months ahead, communicating the easing of lockdown restrictions is going to be a&nbsp;significant&nbsp;challenge requiring public trust in&nbsp;our&nbsp;leaders. This incident will make this challenge even harder for the government to clearly communicate and explain these rules.&nbsp;Politicians should not underestimate this challenge or take public support for granted.\u201d</p> <p>Stephen Griffin, a virologist and associate professor at Leeds University, agreed: \u201cThere has only been a very gradual decline in numbers of new cases of Covid-19 being reported each day. We are still getting them in their thousands and it is going to be very hard to test and trace new cases in those sorts of numbers. The margin for error is going to be very slight. And then Cummings does this. It was shocking. The message that we should just move on is not correct. We need to be led by example and not by allowing exceptions like this.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Tories are falling fast in the polls. Their lead stood at 26 points over Labour at the end of March but is now down to four points. On Friday, a petition calling for Cummings to be sacked had gained over one million signatures. Our poll today shows 68% of people think he should resign and if he doesn\u2019t 66% want Johnson to sack him. On Monday, Johnson said he had made clear his position on his adviser and that it was now up to the public to decide its view. It seems the public has now done so but, as yet, there is no sign the prime minister is listening.</p>",

It is alleged they were locked in a room wearing only nappies.</p> <p>On Friday, the Queensland government announced both cases will now be <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-05-29/willow-dunn-child-family-commission/12300306\">investigated by the state\u2019s Child and Family Commission</a>.</p> <h2>Smith was receiving full-time care</h2> <p>Ann Marie Smith had been receiving full-time care, six hours a day, seven days a week since 2013. She had been supported by the state-based Disability SA until 2018, when the introduction of the NDIS meant she moved to Integrity Care.</p> <p>She had a sole carer, according to police, who has been identified as Hectorville woman Rosa Maione.</p> <p>Smith had lived alone in Kensington Gardens in Adelaide\u2019s eastern suburbs since 2009, when her parents died. It is alleged she may not have left the house in some time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dcf718eb2cd1fb0cd14ac5b0e6bee39e247f1320\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dcf718eb2cd1fb0cd14ac5b0e6bee39e247f1320/0_136_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The house where Adelaide woman Ann Marie Smith was found suffering severe pressure sores\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The house where Adelaide woman Ann Marie Smith was found suffering severe pressure sores.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SA Police</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe outside of the house gives no indication into the horrors that were perhaps occurring within it,\u201d the SA police Detective Superintendent Des Bray said as he launched a public appeal for information earlier this month.</p> <p>The police investigation is expected to be \u201cprotracted and complex\u201d and will rely on medical experts. There would be a \u201csignificant focus\u201d on Smith\u2019s financial affairs.</p> <p>No charges have been laid.</p> <p>An old photo distributed to the media showed Smith healthy and smiling. But Bray said in recent years Smith had been completely unable to bathe or feed herself. She could no longer use a wheelchair.</p> <p>On 5 April Smith\u2019s carer became concerned about her condition, detectives say.</p> <p>Paramedics came to the house, but a day later she died in hospital of profound septic shock and multiple organ failure from severe pressure sores and issues connected with her cerebral palsy. She was also found to be suffering from malnutrition.</p> <p>Shocked by her condition, the doctors who treated Smith contacted the Health and Community Services Complaints Commissioner.</p> <p>Bray alleged Smith had lived in the same woven cane chair in the lounge room for over a year.</p> <p>\u201cThat chair had also become her toilet,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no fridge in the house and investigators were unable to locate any nutritional food in the house.\u201d</p> <p>Asked how it was that police believed Smith had not been found, Bray said: \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a matter of not being found.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day, she has a carer come in. The question for us is how did Ann become so unwell when she has a full-time carer and people \u2026 entrusted with her care.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>At the press conference launching a public call for information, Bray noted the plan Smith was receiving was called a \u201cperson-centered support plan\u201d.</p> <p>He said there would be two concurrent investigations: a coronial probe and a manslaughter investigation conducted by police. They had already seized records from Integrity Care, and interviewed Maoine.</p> <h2>NDIS watchdog accused of inaction</h2> <p>On 17 May, Smith\u2019s carer was sacked by NDIS provider Integrity Care. On Monday, a SA Parliamentary Committee heard neither the carer nor the providers had applied for a disability employee screening until after Smith\u2019s death.</p> <p>Last week, amid growing public anger, the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission, which regulates NDIS providers, announced a $12,600 fine against Integrity Care for failing to report her death within the required 24 hours.</p> <p>In fact, the commission only learned of Smith\u2019s death from the South Australian Health and Community Service Complaints Commissioner two weeks later.</p> <p>Shorten described the penalty as the \u201cequivalent of a speeding fine\u201d while Steele-John said it was less than 5% of the potential penalty available to the commission.</p> <p>\u201cThey can fine somebody $250,000,\u201d Steele-John said. \u201cYet somebody in the commission decided $12,600 was enough. That to me speaks to a cultural problem within the commission.\u201d</p> <p>The commission maintained it was only an initial action. On Wednesday, it went on to announce former federal court judge Alan Robertson SC&nbsp;would investigate the regulation of the provider that was responsible for supporting Smith.</p> <p>It means Robertson will be tasked with investigating the commission, whose role is to keep NDIS providers accountable within a $22bn scheme that covers 360,000 people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/31/ndis-watchdog-is-fielding-nearly-100-allegations-of-abuse-or-neglect-a-week\">NDIS watchdog is fielding nearly 100 allegations of abuse or neglect a week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is now growing frustration with the watchdog, which was widely welcomed when established by the Coalition in 2018.</p> <p>Steele-John said he raised with a \u201cheavy heart\u201d the question of whether the commission was doing its job properly.</p> <p>Guardian Australia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/27/ndis-providers-used-unauthorised-restraints-more-than-65000-times-watchdog-reports\">this week reported that the watchdog</a> had taken action against only 17 individuals and seven providers over an 18-month period in which it received 74,000 incident reports.</p> <p>Shorten also said the commission had questions to answer. \u201cThe paid support worker, they\u2019ll investigate their role, they\u2019ll investigate Integrity Care, but I want to know, what was the NDIA doing just paying out the money and not checking if the person was getting value?</p> <p>\u201cWhat was the watchdog [doing]?

Now that we have done it for three months, we can see that it works.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What\u2019s a city got that I need anymore?</p> <footer> <cite>Rebecca Andrews</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But more people working from home doesn\u2019t necessarily translate as more people leaving cities.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThere are not that many jobs that are true freelance jobs \u2013 your clients are disproportionately in the big cities,\u201d he says.</p> <p>If many offices move to a hybrid mix of working-from-home and in the office, \u201cthe regions that will do well out of this are within striking distance of major cities \u2013 because companies will want a presence in the office some of the time\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cameron Kusher, head of economic research at REA Group \u2013 which includes realestate.com.au \u2013 says that although anecdotally he has heard of people wanting to move to the country, \u201cit\u2019s not showing up much in the data in Victoria and New South Wales\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>Searches for regional properties jumped 11% in Victoria for April compared with March and there was a 16% jump in searches in regional NSW for the corresponding period.&nbsp;But this is down on a year ago, with a 2% fall in Victoria and 1%.</p> <p>Bucking this trend is an overall increase in searches for properties in rural Queensland and Tasmania.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/12/regional-australians-are-just-as-deserving-of-support-as-those-suffering-the-consequences-of-covid-19\">Regional Australians are just as deserving of support as those suffering the consequences of Covid-19 | Pete Mailler</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell but it\u2019s logical that people will start to look for houses in regional areas,\u201d Kusher says. \u201cHowever, most businesses will still want people to come into offices a couple of days a week.\u201d</p> <p>That means that towns up to 90 minutes from the CBD with good connections will be more popular than regions such as Warrnambool in Victoria and Orange in NSW, which are both around three hours from capital cities.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIn Sydney, people will push out to outer areas such as the Blue Mountains and Central Coast. In Victoria, Ballarat, Geelong and Mornington Peninsula could be popular.</p> <p>\u201cPeople from Sydney and Melbourne might also start considering Brisbane and Adelaide because they get on a plane pretty quickly to offices in Melbourne and Sydney.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Rebecca Andrews, 40, of Collingwood, will trial regional living with her boyfriend when overnight stay restrictions lift in Victoria. They have short stays lined up in the Dandenongs, Yarra Valley and Castlemaine \u2013 all places within 90 minutes of the Melbourne CBD. If it works, they\u2019ll move out of the city.&nbsp;</p> <p>Andrews runs a popular events newsletter called The Sprinkler and works as a freelance journalist. She is usually out at several events around Melbourne five or more times a week but the pandemic brought on a major life shift for her. </p> <p>\u201cCovid has definitely influenced my decision to live in the country,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving spent three months in isolation, I\u2019ve been winding down and not feeling the pressure of having to go to social functions and catch up with mates. Since I\u2019ve been at home all the time and slowing down, I\u2019ve found there\u2019s not much need to get energy from huge social things.\u201d</p> <p>Now she wants to spend more time in nature. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference between being in a city park and out in the wilderness. You can\u2019t even compare. What\u2019s a city got that I need anymore? I mean I\u2019m 40, I\u2019m not in my 20s \u2013 and although I\u2019m still an extrovert, I\u2019m getting really nice benefits from iso.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAwFW8chn9T/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

The bright green and red birds breed in summer and spring in south-eastern Tasmania.

It was upgraded to critically endangered in 2016, meaning it faces an extremely high risk of extinction. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to turn it around,\u201d Ingwersen says.</p> <p>The bird was selected by the federal government five years ago for inclusion in a \u201c20 birds by 2020\u201d plan, a strategy that was meant to improve the trajectory of nominated species. But the parrot\u2019s plight has continued to worsen due to an exemption in Australia\u2019s environment laws that makes it legal to log both its breeding habitat in Tasmania and its feeding habitat in NSW.</p> <p>The exemption applies to all areas covered by a regional forestry agreement, a bilateral agreement between states and territories. Forestry operations subject to an agreement do not have to be assessed under federal environment law for their impact on nationally listed threatened species.</p> <p>The consequence has been continued habitat loss, one of the key drivers of extinction.</p> <p>Ingwersen says the recovery team has worked hard across the swift parrot\u2019s range to try to help it survive. It has conducted monitoring to gather data, worked with private landowners on habitat restoration, and invested in research to reduce the impact of sugar gliders, which prey on swift parrots.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an overreach to say a lot of that work is being undermined if we keep taking habitat out of the Tasmanian forests and out of the south coast forests in NSW where they feed,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/29/extinction-is-a-choice-margaret-atwood-on-tasmanias-forests-and-saving-the-swift-parrot\">'Extinction is a choice\u2019: Margaret Atwood on Tasmania's forests and saving the swift parrot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Tasmania, researchers from the Australian National University examined forest loss from logging in important swift parrot breeding areas in the southern forest between 2007 and 2016.

  "<p>We are in a public health crisis unprecedented in living memory. We have written to the prime minister because we are very concerned for the safety and wellbeing of the public. There is ample evidence that effective epidemic control requires the public to trust and respect both the messages and the messengers who are advocating action. This trust has been badly damaged by the actions of Dominic Cummings, including his failure to stand down or resign in the public interest, and Boris Johnson\u2019s subsequent unwillingness to remove him.</p> <p>As lockdown is eased, public trust and high compliance is essential to reduce the risk of a second spike in infections and deaths. It is vital for all people in positions of power to follow the rules with the same discipline as the rest of the population. The public also needs to see that the necessary infrastructure and effective systems are put in place rapidly and effectively.</p> <p>A national track and trace scheme is a major undertaking. This makes it even more crucial that there is complete transparency about likely time scales and the risks associated with the strategy and plan. The public mood is fragile and unlikely to cope with another over-optimistic target-based strategy that goes on to fail. We are also concerned that the needs of people primarily affected by non-Covid-19 diseases are being neglected. For example, since the pandemic hit, there has been a 70% or more reduction in cancer diagnoses and there is an estimated backlog of 100,000 undiagnosed or untreated cancer cases (growing by about 5,000 a week). Similar backlogs are evident in every non-communicable disease. </p> <p>This exceptional situation also requires urgent and detailed planning and investment. We ask that the prime minister better harness the expertise in the NHS, social care, local authorities, academic institutions and the civil service to strengthen the response to Covid-19 and its knock-on effects on other health and care provision.

While the chief scientific officer, Patrick Vallance, said on Thursday that he did \u201cnot want to get involved in politics\u201d, Van-Tam said he was \u201cquite happy\u201d to answer the question.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn my opinion the rules are clear and they have always been clear,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my opinion they are for the benefit of all.

  "<p>Foreigners can sometimes see a country with the greatest clarity. British politicians and journalists, who think themselves sophisticated, watched Dominic Cummings\u2019 press conference in the Downing Street rose garden on Monday \u2013 along with countless citizens outraged by elite double standards. To my knowledge, only one viewer saw the trick Cummings was pulling. It wasn\u2019t an opposition MP or hot-shot reporter but Jens Wiechers, a data protection consultant from Cologne.</p> <p>Wiechers had the wit to do what the Cummingses of this world hate above all else: check. He found that, for all his inflated reputation, Cummings is nothing more than a sneaky little cheat.</p> <p>The context of his charlatanism matters because it connects the Cummings-Johnson administration to the global attempt to delegitimise criticism. A section of the UK right is desperate <a href=\"https://rsf.org/en/news/uk-press-freedom-under-threat-lockdown-government-dismisses-reporting-campaigning-newspapers\">to shift blame</a> for this government\u2019s inability to govern to \u201cthe media\u201d. Online mobs hounded television reporters last week, as government loyalists rallied behind the banner of #scummedia.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Cummings\u2019 evidence that the media were running \u2018false stories\u2019 against him was a false story</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cummings gave them the marching orders. He wanted Tories to believe he was not a hypocrite who broke the lockdown his government instructed others to obey. Rather he was <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/dominic-cummings-statement-speech-transcript-durham-full-text-read-lockdown-a9531856.html\">the victim</a> of \u201cnumerous false stories in the media about my actions and statements regarding Covid\u201d. Journalists, he continued, claimed he had opposed the lockdown and \u201cdid not care\u201d about the mass deaths. Nothing could be further from the truth, the radical disrupter of the stodgy status quo explained. He possessed a prescience that bordered on the magical. He could prove he cared because as long ago as last year he \u201cwrote about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning\u201d.</p> <p>Viewers might have wondered why, if Cummings was warning about coronaviruses in 2019, his government had failed so abjectly to protect the British in 2020. You saw it coming, and still messed up? They might have thought twice before believing the man who gave us the outright falsehood that <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/europe/350-million-week-boris-johnson-statistics-authority-misuse/\">Brexit would deliver \u00a3350m</a> to the NHS in the 2016 referendum campaign.</p> <p>They didn\u2019t doubt him because lies are so common in contemporary politics they blow past us like dust in the wind. No one checked, apart from Wiechers. \u201cIn retrospect, I could pretend I knew not to believe Cummings and Johnson,\u201d he told me from Germany, where he watches British and American public life with a horrified fascination. \u201cBut I began by wondering what he had written on his blog last year.\u201d</p> <p>He found that Cummings had <a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/2019/03/04/the-most-secure-bio-labs-routinely-make-errors-that-could-cause-a-global-pandemic-are-about-to-re-start-experiments-on-pathogens-engineered-to-make-them-mammalian-airborne-transmissible/\">posted on 4 March 2019</a> on the dangers of the Sars coronavirus in a wider piece on pandemics. Or so he wanted us to believe. The post struck Wiechers as a lazy piece of writing filled with extracts from the work of others. The now suspicious Wiechers checked Cummings\u2019 blog on <a href=\"https://archive.org/web/\">the Wayback Machine</a>, a digital library that tracks changes to billions of web pages. It showed Cummings had added the reference to coronaviruses between 9 April and 3 May 2020. Further research showed Cummings\u2019 own site recorded that the post was edited at 8:55pm on 14 April precisely, the day Cummings told the public he had returned from his trip to Durham.</p> <p>The man\u2019s deviousness was breathtaking. His evidence that the media were running \u201cfalse stories\u201d against him was a false story. As striking was his ridiculous vanity: Cummings cared so neurotically about his reputation as a prophet that he forged the record so it appeared that he was warning of the \u201curgent need\u201d to plan for a corona pandemic while the minds of lesser men and women were elsewhere.</p> <p>The vanity is more than striking, it is essential to the right\u2019s attempt to maintain its power. Supporters of strongmen do not want populist leaders who are \u201cjust like us\u201d. They want to believe their heroes are smarter and better. The manufacture of the myth of exceptional talent is as important to the strongman as the ability to turn their voters against journalists, judges and any other independent group that might check them. Liberals should not laugh at Trump\u2019s boast that he is a \u201cvery stable genius\u201d. Trump has persuaded his core supporters to believe that he is a superman, who can master any problem and cut any deal, ever since he first ran for president.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Now more than ever, Johnson wants Conservatives to believe in the illusion of his talent</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Boris Johnson spent years showing off his superficial understanding of the classics by picking up Latin phrases from his well-thumbed dictionary of quotations and dropping them into his articles. A little learning was not a dangerous thing for him but a smart career move. It convinced conservative-inclined voters that Johnson had enjoyed the education of the old imperial ruling class and was not the lightweight he appeared to be. The fact that hardly any educated person studies Latin and Greek today made it easier for Johnson to bluff his way to the top when so few could see the vacuity behind the pose.</p> <p>His administration has presided over thousands of needless deaths. It has never got on top of the virus. A terrible recession is all but upon us, and it\u2019s likely that Tory zealotry will destroy the chance of a decent deal with the European Union that a broken country needs. Now more than ever, Johnson wants Conservatives to believe in the illusion of his talent.</p> <p>Unlike Trump and Johnson, Cummings is not trying to fool the public but fool the fool who employs him \u2013 not the hardest of tasks, I grant you. He sinks to the level of the petty cheat because he must convince Johnson that he is a political mastermind.</p> <p>Don\u2019t be fooled as well. Too many liberals see Cummings as a manipulative demon with supernatural powers, when the most frightening thing about him, and Johnson, is their pathetic inability to control events. They are not evil geniuses but lazy, dogmatic and incompetent men, whose shabbiness is revealed as much by their little deceits as grand blunders.

When did you start working on it?<br></strong>I can tell you exactly. Six years, 11 months and five days ago. The idea came when I went to visit a place called <a href=\"https://www.visitcheshire.com/things-to-do/hack-green-secret-nuclear-bunker-p30131\">Hack Green Secret Nuclear </a><a href=\"https://www.visitcheshire.com/things-to-do/hack-green-secret-nuclear-bunker-p30131\">Bunker</a> with my mum and dad and my wife. It is what was known as a regional seat of government; in the event of a nuclear bomb dropping, the local dignitaries would be rushed to it. It\u2019s now a visitor centre.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s not far from where you grew up, in Cheshire?<br></strong>Yes, just around the corner. And my mum and I had a shared terror of nuclear war. We walked around this place in utter silence. A couple in their early 20s were down there too, though, and they were looking at it all as if it was ancient history. Laughing at some of the exhibits. And I came out and thought I had to write something about that, about how quickly we seem to have forgotten the fear of those cold war years.</p> <p><strong>The book begins at an army installation called Doom Town</strong><strong>. Is that made up?<br></strong>No. I was doing this research and an old Path\u00e9 newsreel popped up on my screen. I was knocked sideways by this report from a bombed-out town where soldiers were learning how they would cope in the aftermath of a nuclear war. There was one particular shot of a man in bandages being fed a cup of tea by another soldier. I looked at these two young men and thought: what would this kind of experience of the end of the world do to you? How would you react? It started from there.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I lost count of, and patience with, the number of novels published in which everyone was extraordinary in some way</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Drum and Carter, the two soldiers, are divided by class, but united by a certain paranoia</strong><strong>; their lives feel out of control in different ways.</strong><strong><br></strong>Yes, I think there was something personal in wanting to find a control of my own. I had become a father when I started the book and that maybe brings a more complicated set of fears. As I write in the book, the first political system we all encounter is the family \u2013 whether it is a benevolent oligarchy or an absolute dictatorship. Fatherhood makes you ask questions of the kind of person you want to be. I was interested in that difference between the upper-middle-class approach of Carter and the more prosaic working-class lifestyle that Drum enjoys.</p> <p><strong>It feels a bit unusual, bizarrely, to read a serious English novel in which the male protagonist is not a publisher or a writer or something. You were conscious of that?<br></strong>Yes. When I was growing up I didn\u2019t see people like myself in any of the fiction I was reading. Even Orwell and Joyce were public school boys. Then the school librarian gave me a copy of <em>Room at the Top</em> by John Braine, and I just hoovered up all those \u201ckitchen sink\u201d novels, <em>The L-Shaped Room</em>, <em>Billy Liar</em>, <em>Saturday Night, Sunday Morning</em>, just because I recognised the pubs and the people.</p> <p><strong>It sometimes seems that fictional voice disappeared along with mass employment in the 1970s</strong><strong>.<br></strong>My first job after university was as a bookseller. I lost count of, and patience with, the number of novels published in which everyone was extraordinary in some way; in Ian McEwan\u2019s books for example. Whereas the American idea \u2013 in Raymond Carver or Jayne Anne Phillips or Toni Morrison \u2013 seemed the opposite. You would have ordinary people placed in an extraordinary situation.</p> <p><strong>Why do you think there was that difference?<br></strong>I don\u2019t know. You think maybe we don\u2019t have the same cultural touchpoints \u2013 the Vietnam war and so on. But write down all the significant events in Britain from, say, 1970 to 1998. The history is teeming with fertile ideas. We have a habit of either looking into the gutter, or at the upper classes. Either <em>Trainspotting</em> or <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/sep/07/fiction.reviews\">Enduring Love</a></em>. I wanted to try to write for people who weren\u2019t being written about.</p> <p><strong>The air of paranoia your characters live with also seems to speak to the current time</strong><strong>.<br></strong>Yes, there was this distant sense in the cold war that everything might fall apart \u2013 and what is your plan B? How do you keep your family safe? For the rich, those questions were always easier: we\u2019ll head to our holiday home. It doesn\u2019t feel a million miles away from what we are going through now. My editor called me up and asked me if I wanted to push the publication of the book back to next year. I said no. People who have read it said they found it curiously calming in some ways. That we get through things.</p> <p><strong>And history mostly happens without us?<br></strong>Yes, there is a great James Salter story about a man having an affair in a hotel room and afterwards they turn on the TV to see that they have just missed man walking on the moon. I have always liked that idea.</p> <p><strong>Which book do you most often return to?<br></strong>I am not a great rereader of books. But one I have gone back to recently is <em>Berg</em>, by Ann Quin.</p> <p><strong>Which books do you have by your bedside?<br></strong>They are on my Kindle. I am reading this brilliant debut novel called <em>Machine</em>, by Susan Steinberg. I have a collection of essays on the go called <em>Deep Sightings and Rescue Missions</em> by Toni Cade Bambara, a contemporary of Toni Morrison who died young. That is wonderful.

Five Sage experts warned that relaxing lockdown restrictions at this time risked a second surge. Their concerns were shared by the mayors of London and Greater Manchester, and by the deputy chief medical officer for England, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, who said: \u201cThis is a very dangerous moment\u201d. He said the R will only stay below 1 if people continue to adhere to physical distancing as the lockdown eases and people play their part to ensure the contact tracing system works well.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK death toll rose by 215 to 38,376.</strong> And in the 24-hour period up to 9am today, another 2,445 positive results were recorded.</li> \n   <li><strong>Competitive sport will be allowed to resume from Monday at the earliest.</strong> The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said the government has published guidance to allow elite sport, including football, horse racing and tennis to resume behind closed doors (only when safe to do so) from Monday at the earliest. He said there will be guidance on how to get athletes back into physically distanced training and then back into close-contact training.</li> \n   <li><strong>People in England will be able to exercise with up to five others from different households from Monday.</strong> With this further relaxation of measures people from different households must remain two metres apart.</li> \n   <li><strong>And Prof Jonathan Van-Tam became the first scientific adviser to break ranks and comment on the Dominic Cummings affair</strong>. Asked if people in power should follow the rules he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> In my opinion the rules are clear and they have always been clear.</p> \n   <p>In my opinion they are for the benefit of all.</p> \n   <p>In my opinion they apply to all.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Make of that what you will.</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from me today from the UK side.

People stumbled away gasping for breath, futilely rubbing their eyes.</p> \n<p>For a few minutes, it looked as if Minnesota\u2019s governor, Tim Walz, had delivered on his pledge to take back control of the streets of Minneapolis. He had said there would be no repeat on Friday of the previous night\u2019s destruction, after thousands of people stormed and burned the third precinct police station at the centre of the outrage over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">the killing of George Floyd</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-us-police\">But then the crowd regrouped</a> and the test of strength began to go its way. The police couldn\u2019t fire teargas fast enough, and retreated block by block. Soon the demonstrators were back in control of the looted police station. It was a symbolic victory that only encouraged them.</p> \n<p>Waltz had threatened to send in the national guard but it was nowhere to be seen and the police suddenly seemed to evaporate.</p> \n<p>By the time the sun went down, the protesters were in control of a two-mile stretch of a busy shopping street, and much of the area around it, in the south of the city. The curfew had collapsed.</p> \n<p>Plunder and arson escalated. So did partying and drag racing after a large crowd helped themselves to the contents of a sprawling liquor store. One group set fire to a Shell petrol station. Businesses were looted wholesale except where the owners were on guard in the mostly Latino neighbourhood.</p> \n<p>By the time the sun rose on Saturday, a visibly furious Walz called a full mobilisation of the national guard for the first time since the second world war. He denounced the destruction as making a mockery of claims the protests were about Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd. It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great city,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Walz said there were \u201celements present\u201d in the rioting of domestic terrorism, ideological extremism and international destabilisation. He denounced \u201canarchists who are burning down damn buildings that were built up by indigenous owners\u201d and said it was overshadowing the death of Floyd.</p> \n<p>But it was also true that large numbers of people on the streets on Friday night were from Minneapolis.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"877b9c6d-7c9c-4a97-827a-1b9af0c16314\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iwPPqDryPO8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The city authorities had hoped the homicide charges against the police officer seen kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes, Derek Chauvin, would go some way to defuse anger on the streets. But there were immediate demands for the arrest of three other officers involved, and questions about why Chauvin was facing only third-degree murder and manslaughter charges when the common view was that he is guilty of a much more serious crime.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-us-police\">Protests flared across the US</a>, from New York to Denver and Los Angeles. Seven people were shot during demonstrations in Louisville, Kentucky.

  "<p>In exhausting and anxious times, a text message last week brought Emma Parker a welcome moment of light relief. \u201cA colleague sent me an ad for the Barnard Castle Eye Test beer, the one that BrewDog has brought out,\u201d says the Durham-based teacher. \u201cI had a bit of a giggle at that, I have to admit. I tried to buy some, but the demand was so great the website kept crashing.\u201d</p> <p>The now infamous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/28/dominic-cummings-potentially-broke-lockdown-rules-say-durham-police\">60-mile round trip</a> by Dominic Cummings to one of the north-east\u2019s best-known tourist spots has entered political folklore. Cummings\u2019 explanation \u2013 that the visit to Barnard Castle, on which he was accompanied by his wife and child, was undertaken to test his eyesight \u2013 has launched countless internet memes. But as Parker, a district organiser for the National Education Union (NEU), points out, the danger is that people may come to see the joke as having been at their expense, drawing their own conclusions. \u201cI have a 14-year-old son who is autistic,\u201d she says. \u201cHis grandparents are a vital part of his life and routines, but he hasn\u2019t seen them for months. It was my son\u2019s birthday last week, and, for the first time in his life, he wasn\u2019t able to spend it with them. He had to accept the rules of lockdown. But what Cummings did undermined the basis of the discipline we need to keep up. You could see it on the beaches round here on bank holiday weekend, after the story came out. A lot more people were just thinking: \u2018We\u2019re going to get on with living.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The fury over the Cummings affair, and its disastrous timing as the country attempts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/groups-up-to-six-people-allowed-meet-england-monday-coronavirus-lockdown-easing\">ease lockdown restrictions</a> without triggering a second Covid wave, prompted three local Conservative MPs to voice their concerns in a joint statement. Richard Holden, MP for North West Durham, Paul Howell, MP for Sedgefield and Dehenna Davison, MP for Bishop Auckland wrote: \u201cLike many of our constituents, we have spent the last few days with a feeling of disappointment, anger and frustration. The last thing we want to see is an enormous collective effort being undermined by the irresponsible actions of individuals.\u201d But the reckless travels of Boris Johnson\u2019s maverick adviser, and the fact that the Durham-born Cummings remains in post, are only the latest, most high-profile, grounds for local concern.</p> <p>The north-east currently has the <a href=\"https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/nhs-test-trace-absolutely-critical-18330238\">highest rate</a> of Covid infection in Britain and the transition to a safe, socially distancing new normal will be complicated, fraught and risky. Last week, as he battled to move on from the Cummings episode, Johnson announced in Thursday\u2019s Downing Street press conference that the government\u2019s five tests for easing lockdown were being met. But it is becoming increasingly clear that, in regions such as the north-east, the government\u2019s authority is not what it was at the beginning of the crisis. In the words of Martin Gannon, the leader of Gateshead\u2019s Labour-run council: \u201cUntil now, in just about every single area, everything that has been co-ordinated by the centre has been a complete and unmitigated disaster.\u201d Somewhat under the radar, a low-key regional rebellion has begun to take place on the basis that London doesn\u2019t always know best. For many in a region that was deindustrialised without a proper plan for its future, that has been true for more than 30 years.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Cut to the bone\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Two weeks ago, Gannon joined the leader of Newcastle city council, Nick Forbes, in rejecting Johnson\u2019s decision <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-52667492\">to drop the government\u2019s \u201cStay at home\u201d slogan</a> in favour of the new \u201cStay alert\u201d formulation. \u201cI listened to the prime minister on that Sunday night and then talked with senior colleagues,\u201d he told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cWe decided that, given the higher R rate in the north-east, the time wasn\u2019t right to move to that message. If we had possessed the same legislative powers as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, then we would have done as they did and stayed with the lockdown as it was.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are disproportionately high levels of deprivation in the north-east, so we have to be ultra-cautious in terms of advice and guidance</p> <footer> <cite>Alice Wiseman, Gateshead director of public health</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>According to Alice Wiseman, Gateshead\u2019s director of public health: \u201cThere are disproportionately high levels of deprivation and poverty here and elsewhere in the north-east. We know that, where that is the case, there will be existing public health problems and we know that the Covid disease targets people with pre-existing conditions. So we have to be ultra-cautious here in terms of advice and guidance.\u201d</p> <p>The willingness to defy government advice in order to, as Gannon puts it, \u201cdo what\u2019s best for Gateshead\u201d, is born of bitter experience. For those on the frontline of local government, particularly in poorer areas, the coronavirus crisis has been a sometimes searing experience that has laid bare the flaws in a dysfunctional relationship with central government. Bluntly, and in common with other local authorities, Gateshead has felt neglected, bypassed and forced to pick up the pieces as things have gone wrong.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cTen years of austerity had already damaged local resilience,\u201d says Gannon. \u201cGateshead has lost 56% of its grant from central government. We\u2019ve made cuts of \u00a3170m. Every part of our budget is cut to the bone now. Over 75% of it goes on care packages. We used to have a big environmental health department. That\u2019s been cut to the bone, too.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>As the epidemic took hold in March, Gannon and his team experienced the consequences of strategic mistakes at a national level. Promises \u2013 particularly in relation to protective equipment \u2013 were not kept. \u201cWe were flagging up the absence of PPE on a daily basis,\u201d says Wiseman. \u201cNo care home in the region had adequate access to the equipment needed to protect their residents. PPE was absolutely critical at that stage and we just didn\u2019t have enough. It\u2019s still a very fragile system now. In the end, we made more plastic masks locally \u2013 working ad hoc, using any 3D printers we could find \u2013 than we got through the national system.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>To the council\u2019s astonishment, a government list of people in Gateshead who would need to be shielded and provided with food contained only 150 names. After consultation with local GPs, the council identified 15,000 locals who would need to be protected; it went deep into debt to get them provisions.</p> <p>There was exasperation when, as belated moves were made in April to boost capacity to test for the virus, Whitehall contracted Deloitte to set up a drive-in test centre in the local Ikea car park. The town\u2019s Queen Elizabeth hospital announced in the same month that it had established one of the biggest testing units in the country, but as the Deloitte centre was flooded with requests, locals reported they had been redirected to Barrow-in-Furness, more than 100 miles away. Swabs from the Ikea centre were sent 240 miles south to Milton Keynes to be analysed; by the time results came back, they were out of date and useless for slowing the spread of infection. \u201cThere just wasn\u2019t a clear, defined purpose behind the testing,\u201d says Wiseman. \u201cIt was just about getting to a high number and wasn\u2019t useful locally. Why not focus resources on the Queen Elizabeth?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f8ef4944ef7b809dc5aa57f342f9527ca16e4c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f8ef4944ef7b809dc5aa57f342f9527ca16e4c6/755_0_4717_2830/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Cummings in London last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Cummings in London last week after answering allegations that he and his family broke lockdown rules.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the most disturbing episodes came as pressure was being exerted on the council and the local foundation trust to discharge untested patients back into the community and into care homes.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cDuring the Easter weekend,\u201d says Gannon, \u201cI was contacted by a member of the council, whose father was in a care home. We had a situation. This was when there was great pressure to vacate beds in NHS hospitals to cope with a coming Covid surge. People were being discharged into care homes without being tested. We were pushed by government to increase the fees to care providers to encourage them to take people. This had led to a stand-off in the car park between the NHS and the home. Some homes were saying, \u2018Yes, we\u2019ll take anyone\u2019; some were saying, \u2018No, we\u2019re not taking anyone, unless they have a certificate that they are Covid-free\u2019. At this particular home, paramedics, family and managers from the home were arguing in the car park about it.\u201d</p> <p>This was happening across the country, Wiseman points out, at a point when \u201chomes were not getting the resources they needed to be able to fully protect residents\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>\u2018We need regional responses\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Scarred by experience, many north-east local authorities will be determinedly going at their own pace this week, as England moves into the next phase of the Covid ordeal. Over the past fortnight, from Hartlepool to Newcastle, the region has become <a href=\"https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/north-east-schools-reopen-when-18278114\">a hub of resistance</a> to the government\u2019s drive to impose a one-size-fits-all approach to reopening primary schools. Parker has organised petitions, held meetings with parents and lobbied her county council, which last week pushed the provisional start date in Durham back <a href=\"https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/durham-county-council-outlines-plan-18317615\">to the middle of next month</a>. In Newcastle and Gateshead, the earliest reopening date will be 8 June. \u201cDifferent parts of the country are at different phases of this epidemic,\u201d says Parker. \u201cThe R rate here seems to be significantly higher and that is weighing on people\u2019s minds a lot. Only 4% of parents we surveyed wanted to send their children back on 1 June.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902gjYFdCYAP6Lb/\" data-alt=\"Map of Covid infections in the north-east\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902gjYFdCYAP6Lb/\">Map of Covid infections in the north-east</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere are just so many unanswered questions: on how test and trace will work, and when it will truly be ready and operational; on what the science is on transmission between and from children; on what teachers or parents with vulnerable people at home are supposed to do.\u201d A blanket approach to coming out of lockdown, she says, will not do. \u201cWe need to develop regional responses to this.

For the past two and a half months, the school has transformed itself into an auxiliary social service, delivering meals and offering advice to pupils\u2019 families. \u201cReopening is the last thing I think about before I go to bed and it\u2019s the first thing I think about when I wake up in the morning,\u201d says Harris. \u201cWe know how tough it is for some families. We know of some kids self-harming and instances of domestic abuse. You\u2019re trying to balance the emotional and educational needs of the children, with any possible risk to the community and the need to protect your staff.

As tax revenues and fees for parking and leisure services have collapsed, expenditure on food distribution, PPE, transport and care needs have soared. A projected \u00a360m debt by the end of the year will eventually have to be addressed. For now though, Gannon is just focused on helping the town survive the worst of the epidemic. \u201cI\u2019ve stopped worrying about the money,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m beyond the point of worry. We\u2019ve got to focus on getting through this next period.\u201d</p> <p>For the unlocking process to be successful, the test and trace system launched by the health minister, Matt Hancock, will have to do its job. The head of the programme, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/dido-harding-super-driven-to-make-track-and-trace-scheme-work\">Dido Harding</a>, has <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-05-28/coronavirus-test-and-trace-scheme-launch-government-covid-19/\">warned </a>that it will not be fully operational until the end of June. For weeks, Gannon and his team have implored central government to make use of the expertise available in local public health networks, rather than rely on Serco-trained call-centre tracers. Finally, it seems, the message might be getting through.</p> <p>\u201cThe tone and approach is changing. We haven\u2019t seen any detail about extra resource but there seems to be a new willingness to work with us. We\u2019ve been asked to draw up a plan to oversee local outbreak control. Twenty-five thousand people sat in call centres isn\u2019t going to work. That needs to be bolted on to existing local capacity. With sexually transmitted diseases and food poisoning, we\u2019ve been doing this kind of thing for years.\u201d</p> <p>Gannon is 62 and has been involved in north-east politics for 35 years. Each week, he and his wife deliver food to his mother-in-law, who lives two miles from the Cummings parental home. \u201cI\u2019ve been around a long time but I\u2019ve never seen anything as extraordinary as last week,\u201d he marvels. \u201cAll the political capital that the prime minister expended to keep him! There was incredulity and fury.\u201d But he hopes and believes people will not follow the former local boy\u2019s bad example: \u201cWe need our government to have authority, legitimacy and respect.\u201d There is a crucial rider, though. \u201cWe also need it to work with us, give us the resources we need and devolve us the power to get things right.

  "<p><strong>The Archers</strong> (BBC Radio 4) | <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000jfzc\">BBC Sounds</a></p> <p>Back in late March, lockdown caught many of us on the hop. The changes to work and life were swift and devastating. Some professions could adapt fairly easily, others couldn\u2019t. Drama is an industry that\u2019s suffered greatly; many great theatres have already had to close down for ever. But audio drama has a few advantages. It\u2019s not TV, it\u2019s not a full theatre production. No need for costumes or cameras, to learn lines or adjust lighting. The audience is still there, stuck at home\u2026</p> <p>Which brings me to <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000jfzc\">The Archers</a></strong>. A well-oiled, beautifully run, wonderfully staffed ship that\u2019s not built for turning, let alone pivoting to WFH, <em>The Archers</em> has found the lockdown difficult. Usually, the writing is done weeks in advance, with the storylines worked out even earlier. Each episode is recorded in the studio as live, the cast acting the whole thing without stopping. Sound effects are played in at the same time, with some added later.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>David seemed as worked up about Ruth's lasagne as he did about not getting on with his son</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Because of these pre-recorded episodes, for a long while after lockdown life in Ambridge continued with no reference to coronavirus at all. Lynda Snell and workman Blake were in hospital, post-hotel explosion, with various family, friends and foes popping in and out at will. Social distancing was most definitely not observed. PPE was never mentioned, nary a hint of a hand-sanitiser shortage. But then, in early May, the pre-records ran out, and for the past three weeks, <em>The Archers</em> has been reduced to replaying old episodes. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000j7b2\">The Flower and Produce Show</a>\u201d was one; \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05410wn\">Floods Hit Ambridge</a>\u201d another. During this time, entire storylines were mothballed (bye bye, Kirsty\u2019s marriage to dodgy Philip), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/19/the-archers-episodes-lockdown-ambridge-radio-4-rural-soap-coronavirus\">12</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/19/the-archers-episodes-lockdown-ambridge-radio-4-rural-soap-coronavirus\"> scripts were binned</a>, and the decision was made for actors to record monologues at home.</p> <p>Though I understand the reasoning, I\u2019m not convinced this was the right decision. The new-style episodes began last week, and they were pretty poor fare. The first, which consisted of David\u2019s moaning about his son Josh, intercut with Josh moaning about David, was a shocker. Beautifully recorded (well done, Tim Bentinck and Angus Imrie), the super-clean voices meant that the added farm atmosphere (David got cows, Josh, geese) sounded ridiculous. Far worse, though, was the spectacularly boring writing. No mention of the frustrations of coronavirus, the alterations to farm work, being cooped up with family, new worries or irritations. Just some waffle about silage and lasagne, with some rousing \u201cwe\u2019ll all get through this together\u201d at the end. (David seemed exactly as worked up about Ruth\u2019s lasagne as he did about not getting on with his son. Maybe it\u2019s an <em>Archers</em> stoicism thing.)</p> <p>The second episode had a couple of nods towards how people actually live, with Tracy making a \u201cvlog\u201d, according to son Brad (who uses that word, in 2020?) about what she thinks the cricket team should be doing during lockdown, and Harrison, policeman and actual cricket captain, responding. Both Harrison and Tracy were heard making phone calls. Unfortunately these were as realistic as a toddler holding up a banana to her ear and saying \u201cHewoh\u201d. When people make phone calls, you can hear the other person on the line! There was nothing in the audio to distinguish between them talking to themselves, talking to a selfie camera, or talking to another person on the phone. No background noise of other people in the house. No one Zooming their family. Everything happening somewhere else.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure the shows will improve as all involved get used to the new way, but these episodes were lame, and revealed the lack of flexibility in how <em>The Archers</em> gets made. No real outdoor atmosphere, no actual phone calls, no moving out of a studio. TV has made a couple of successful forays into drama that acknowledge lockdown\u2019s restrictions and make use of them. Why can\u2019t the actors\u2019 parts be recorded&nbsp;as live, simultaneously (like podcasts have been doing during lockdown), so they interact&nbsp;in real&nbsp;time? The tech is there. These episodes were snoresome and silly. <em>The Archers</em> has made a non-drama out of a crisis.</p> <h2>Three mind-expanding shows&nbsp;</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.talkingpoliticspodcast.com/history-of-ideas\">Talking Politics: The History of Ideas&nbsp;</a><br></strong>A few people have raved to me about this podcast series, which only started on 27 April&nbsp;and has already put out 12 episodes (at the time of writing). In association with the <em>London Review of Books</em>, this set of talks by David Runciman has him exploring the important thinkers behind modern politics, starting with Hobbes and moving through Wollstonecraft, Marx and Engels to Fukuyama and beyond. The shows are interesting but academic: essentially, 45-minute university-style lectures. Runciman is likable and knows his stuff, but if you want bells and whistles, search elsewhere.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e9771bb08af49da45265fc18c09b5884cf2766f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e9771bb08af49da45265fc18c09b5884cf2766f/0_303_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cambridge academic David Runciman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He knows his stuff\u2019: David Runciman, presenter of Talking Politics.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://art19.com/shows/clever-creature\">Clever Creature</a></strong>&nbsp;<br>An experiment from <em><a href=\"https://bigthink.com/podcast/\">Think Again</a></em> producer and host Jason Gots.

(At the start, he explains that he\u2019s trying to kick his procrastination habit.) As you might expect, the results are hit and miss. The songs are better than the short stories, but the stories kick off interesting chats with, in the first episode, Jason\u2019s son Emre about a desert made of ice-cream, and, in the second, novelist Gish Jen.

  "<p>A conversation with a girlfriend when I was in Italy a few weeks ago got me thinking about the latest new norm of the post-coronavirus society: enhanced eye contact. She had told me how, standing in the endless queue for the supermarket, wearing her mask, she had caught the eye of a handsome man in another loop of the queue and found herself engaged in a wordless flirtation carried out just with the eyes from a distance. After this, she had taken to piling on extra eyeliner and mascara.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I am saving in not buying lipstick I am spending on those full-volume mascaras,\u201d she said, laughing.</p> <p>Italians are masters of unabashed eye contact, but I wondered how this would work in London \u2013 my other home \u2013 where we do all we can to avoid gazing at each other. I have spent years passing colleagues along corridors, all of us flashing a smile then hastily looking down lest awkwardness should arise. But if the smile is covered by a mask and cannot be seen, it falls to the eyes to communicate that smile and that will mean \u2013 heavens forfend \u2013 that we will have to look up and meet each others\u2019 eyes. How will we cope?</p> <p>Adults are used to reading faces as a whole and if society is suddenly going to be masked up, then we will have to adapt quickly, making more use of prolonged eye contact. And yet this is not natural behaviour. Most animals look at each other only to signal threat or interest. In humans, social interaction is usually punctuated with very brief periods of mutual eye contact and deviations from this make us uncomfortable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is our new normal. Everyone was wearing a face covering</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A British study found that people look at each other only 30-60% of the time when talking, let alone gazing into each other\u2019s eyes. Surely this will change if we are all wearing masks and there is less on show to offer those all-important non-verbal clues to how we are feeling. After all, 55% of communication is non-verbal, and our facial expressions are a great part of that.</p> <p>I had masks on my mind. Seven weeks into our lockdown in Italy and the province of Tuscany had just made it obligatory for everyone to wear masks and had issued each household with a quota of free ones. They had even made it out to our remote rural home in the foothills of the Apennine mountains: three masks per person. And I was about to wear one for an extended period for the first time, for a trip to Florence thanks to a broken filling.</p> <p>Never has a journey to the dentist been so keenly anticipated. I had not been to the city \u2013 any city \u2013 since 29 February when I had come back home to Italy and self-isolated. As my fortnight of self isolation ended, the whole of Italy was placed in lockdown \u2013 the first European country to take such drastic measures. Any regret I felt for not having visited the hairdresser and the dentist while I could receded in the light of the national tragedy we saw unfolding on our televisions every night. As daily decrees restricted our movements ever more, I became accustomed to not nipping out for a favourite ingredient, to signing off emails with \u201cstay well\u201d, to scraping off the dried soap that clung to my wedding ring. By the time the filling in my tooth fell out, I had not left home for seven weeks.</p> <p>But my tooth qualified as a medical emergency \u2013 one of only three reasons for which we were allowed out. I made the appointment, my dentist sent an email confirming my appointment, and I bundled this paper together with my self-declaration certificate and passport, packing the car with sanitising gel, several pairs of latex gloves and a spare mask.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"910210950f5d9d92675ba010bc32d24ff835c86f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/910210950f5d9d92675ba010bc32d24ff835c86f/0_695_3456_4489/770.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We may find unexpected consequences to all this mask wearing and eye gazing; not only a rash of marriages, but greater empathy and compassion for our fellow humans\u2019: Kamin Mohammadi.\" width=\"770\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We may find unexpected consequences to all this mask wearing and eye gazing; not only a rash of marriages, but greater empathy and compassion for our fellow humans\u2019: Kamin Mohammadi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernardo Conti and Kicca Tommasi/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I donned my mask. We had ordered several from a friend whose factory had switched from stitching clothes for Armani. I had chosen mine in rose pink \u2013 my attempt to make up for the red lipstick it was now pointless to apply. As I got ready, I used much more kohl and mascara on my eyes in compensation \u2013 think Elizabeth Taylor in <em>Cleopatra</em> as inspiration. I picked out earrings that would not get caught in the elastic and a jacket that coordinated with my mask.</p> <p>The journey to Florence was quick and uneventful. There was no traffic and no police checks and I glided to the city through a fairyland of lush countryside shimmering under an extraordinary light made sharper for the lack of pollution.</p> <p>After the dentist, I went to my favourite fruit and veg market, grateful for the mask covering up my anaesthetised mouth. I was buoyed to find parking still a nightmare and, in spite of only half the stalls being there and a mere smattering of people compared to normal, there was still a clamour and chaos that is pure Florentine charm. It was music to my ears.</p> <p>But one thing was very different. Windows were open, but instead of clothes drying on the lines that stretch between them, there were masks flapping in the breeze. Instead of rosaries hanging off the rear-view mirrors of parked cars, there were now masks. This is our new normal. Everyone was wearing a face covering and I soon realised I had to ditch the sunglasses, in spite of the bright sunlight. With only eyes in evidence, it was impossible to communicate a smile with mine covered. The sunglasses migrated to my head, where they kept my wild lockdown locks in check, so that I could use my eyes for the non-verbal communication that we take so much for granted. </p> <p>No wonder then that the Florentines I encountered had a startled look, their eyes raking others\u2019 faces with an intensity that took me back. There was a sort of hunger in those looks: fear jostled with extreme curiosity, as if in the absence of the rest of your face, they wanted to extract every piece of information possible from your eyes.</p> <p>As I threaded my way through the market, catching people\u2019s eyes and holding their gaze, exaggeratedly crinkling my eyes to denote a smile, I felt another wave of familiarity. In Iran we are used to this wordless communication although we don\u2019t cover our faces, just our hair. But, as in much of the Middle East, with female bodies and hair and sometimes faces covered up as a result of the social distancing that the segregation of genders entails, this mode of moving through the world is perfectly usual to us.</p> <p>Science tells us that gazing into another\u2019s eyes and holding that gaze for more than a beat sets off a whole raft of brain processes. We all know that feeling when, in falling into our lover\u2019s eyes, the rest of the world seems to disappear. Romantic as this feels, it is a physiological response: the body produces a chemical called phenylethylamine when you look someone directly in the eyes, helping the brain grapple with the overwhelming awareness that we are looking at another conscious being. That\u2019s why it can make us blush.</p> <p>So powerful is direct eye contact that just one encounter with the <em>Mona Lisa</em>, with her gazing directly at us from across the centuries, makes the painting unforgettable. And who can forget the image of Princess Diana when she scrubbed in to watch an operation at Harefield Hospital in 1996, her face covered by a surgical mask, a wisp of blonde hair escaping from her surgical cap, her kohl-rimmed eyes looking intensely at the photographer \u2013 at us all \u2013 through a crowd of medics? Diana was the arch queen of eye contact, from those first shy gazes cast from under her famous fringe in 1980, to the heavily made-up eyes that were fixed on Martin Bashir as she uttered the immortal line: \u201cThere were three of us in this marriage.\u201d</p> <p>Princess Diana had nothing to learn from our niqab-wearing Saudi sisters \u2013 she was a natural master of the too-long held gaze and one suspects she would have heartily applauded the results of <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167297234003\" title=\"\">the study</a> carried out by psychologist <a href=\"https://news.berkeley.edu/2015/02/12/love-in-the-lab/\" title=\"\">Arthur Aron</a> who made <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/style/modern-love-to-fall-in-love-with-anyone-do-this.html\" title=\"\">two strangers fall in love in his lab by silently holding eye contact for four minutes</a> (they were married six months later). But ordinary Europeans will need time to get used to communicating only through their eyes at a distance.</p> <p>If that happens, we may find unexpected consequences to all this mask wearing and eye gazing; not only a rash of marriages, but greater empathy and compassion for our fellow humans.

  "<p>In addition to washing your hands while singing the first two verses of The Internationale, it might be a good time also to clean out your Twitter feed. According to a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/20/859814085/researchers-nearly-half-of-accounts-tweeting-about-coronavirus-are-likely-bots?t=1590582560153\">recent report</a> of a research study by Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/\">Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems</a>, about 45% of the false narratives about Covid-19 on Twitter are sent by bots.</p> <p>The study examined more than 100 false Covid narratives (including the 5G conspiracy theories) pushed in over 200m tweets since January. If you\u2019re a reader of this newspaper, the likelihood is that you never saw any of these. But that\u2019s because you are \u2013 like me \u2013 cheerfully encased in your own filter bubble. I write with feeling on this matter, because on the morning after the Brexit referendum I went through the list of about 800 people whom I follow on Twitter, and I could not locate a single one who seemed to have been in favour of Brexit in the run-up to the vote. The shock felt by them after the vote was palpable. But it was also a salutary reminder that anyone who uses social media lives in a digital echo chamber.</p> <p>To those who study computational propaganda, the findings will come as no surprise. Philip Howard\u2019s group at the <a href=\"https://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/working-papers/bots-strongerin-and-brexit-computational-propaganda-during-the-uk-eu-referendum/\">Oxford Internet Institute</a> has been doing great work in this field for several years. It would be nice to think that the mainstream media might have learned a thing or two from this work. If it had, it might have learned that just as you cannot believe anything you read in a British tabloid newspaper, you should never regard what\u2019s \u201ctrending\u201d on Twitter as anything other than an artefact of robotic amplification.</p> <p>But bots are not the only problem facing Twitter. An equally difficult challenge is that presented by Donald J Trump, currently the president of the US. Twitter was a medium made for Trump, and he has exploited it masterfully ever since he contemplated running for public office. Although his campaign adroitly exploited targeted advertising on Facebook, Twitter was always how Trump directly communicated with his base. He currently has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump\">80.3 million followers</a> and has tweeted over 52,000 times. And while nobody was surprised that he campaigned using Twitter, nobody in the liberal (or even the conservative) establishment dreamed that, once elected, he would <em>govern</em> by tweet. Which is why the ingenious <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealPressSecBot\">@RealPressSecBot</a> bot that transforms Trump tweets into the proper presidential White House statement format is both such a good joke, and so depressing.</p> <p>The fact that Twitter has allowed Trump to abuse the service by spreading lies, libels, conspiracy theories, nonsense and racist abuse continuously since he was elected has infuriated many people. Anyone else doing that kind of stuff would long ago have been banned from the platform. But to date, the company\u2019s executives have shrunk from doing anything about the tweeter-in-chief. They have two reasons for their forbearance, one good and one bad. The good reason is fear for their lives. There are <a href=\"http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/de/weapons-and-markets/tools/global-firearms-holdings.html\">an estimated 392m </a><a href=\"http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/de/weapons-and-markets/tools/global-firearms-holdings.html\">unregistered firearms</a> in the US, and my hunch is that banning Trump would eventually result in a <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/charlie-hebdo\">Charlie</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/charlie-hebdo\"> Hebdo</a></em>-type attack on the company by alt-right fanatics. The bad reason is that Trump is good for \u201cuser engagement\u201d, which is the holy grail of all social media platforms.</p> <p>This week, though, they took a baby step towards trying to rein him in. After <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265255835124539392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1265255845358645254%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2020%2Fmay%2F26%2Ftrump-twitter-fact-check-warning-label\">he tweeted</a>: \u201cThere is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged &amp; even illegally printed out &amp; fraudulently signed. The Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone.....\u201d a label in blue lettering appeared underneath it urging people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/trump-twitter-fact-check-warning-label\">to \u201cget the facts\u201d</a> about voting by mail. The links led to a CNN story that said Trump\u2019s claims were unsubstantiated and to a list of bullet points that Twitter had compiled rebutting the inaccuracies.</p> <p>In any normally run polity, this would have been an unremarkable step for a platform to take.&nbsp;In the crazily polarised society that the US has become, though, it will be seen by Trump and his fans as an affront to his Supreme Leadership. Not quite on the <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> scale of publishing cartoons of the Prophet, perhaps, but an affront nonetheless.&nbsp;At best, legions of bots will now be enlisted to pump abuse at the Twitter bosses and pump more misinformation about postal voting to ordinary users of the platform.&nbsp;More dangerous \u2013 not only to Twitter but to&nbsp;the business models of&nbsp;all social-media companies \u2013 would be a move by a vengeful Trump to use the nuclear option\u2019 of removing the shelter provided by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230_of_the_Communications_Decency_Act\">Section 230 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act</a> which frees online platforms from legal liability for what users post on their platforms.&nbsp;Ironically, though, if Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/trump-draft-order-could-expose-twitter-and-facebook-to-more-lawsuits\">did deploy that weapon</a>, then the rest of us would be free to sue Twitter for what the president tweets!<br></p> <h2>What I\u2019ve been reading</h2> <p><strong>Bringing it all back home</strong><br>\u201cHow to fix globalisation \u2013 for Detroit, not Davos\u201d is a really <a href=\"https://www.the-american-interest.com/2020/05/22/how-to-fix-globalization-for-detroit-not-davos/\">fascinating interview</a> on the American Interest site with Lawrence Summers, a former US treasury secretary.</p> <p><strong>A time of loss</strong><br>There\u2019s an unexpectedly <a href=\"https://www.profgalloway.com/what-we-leave-behind\">moving post</a>, called \u201cWhat We Leave Behind\u201d, about the Covid-19 fallout by Scott Galloway on his blog.</p> <p><strong>No more robot overlords</strong><br>In a <em>New York Times</em> article, Ben Schneiderman lays out his view that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/technology/ben-shneiderman-automation-humans.html\">we need machines to augment human capabilities</a> rather than replace us.</p>",

That\u2019s what class will buy a black man in America. You don\u2019t get it quite as bad as your lower-income brethren.&nbsp;Jeff Zucker, the CNN president, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/george-floyd-protest-updates-05-28-20/h_4285f79616fbc4a7966ab7239b388bf6\">talked</a> to Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, and the crew was quickly released.&nbsp;With an apology&nbsp;from the governor, not the cops. Cops rarely apologize, especially to black men.</p> <p>But what\u2019s most interesting is what happened to Josh Campbell, a white CNN journalist who was in the same area as Jimenez and not arrested. Campbell <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/george-floyd-protest-updates-05-28-20/h_9023ffd063def0b1af22cb3ecdc72a06\">said</a> his experience was the \u201copposite\u201d of Jimenez\u2019s.&nbsp;The cops asked him \u201cpolitely to move here and there\u201d.&nbsp;\u201cA couple times I\u2019ve moved closer&nbsp;than they would, like,&nbsp;they asked politely to move&nbsp;back.&nbsp;They didn\u2019t pull out the&nbsp;handcuffs.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a cliche that the US has two systems of justice, separate and unequal, but I prefer the word Campbell used.&nbsp;The US has \u201copposite\u201d systems of justice \u2013 one for white people and another for racial minorities, especially African Americans, Latinx and Native American people.&nbsp;</p> <p>White progressives love to focus on class subordination (I see you, Bernie Sanders!) but there is something sticky about race.&nbsp;Jimenez\u2019s professional status and calm demeanor did not stop the police from treating him like a regular black dude \u2013 the subject of their vast authority to detain and humiliate.&nbsp;They didn\u2019t have an actual reason and they didn\u2019t need one.&nbsp;Jimenez\u2019s dark skin was the offense.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is how powerful a drug white privilege is.&nbsp;Here we have the cops policing a rally protesting police brutality against a black man.&nbsp;Even in that context, when the whole world is watching figuratively, and CNN\u2019s audience is watching literally, the cops can\u2019t help themselves.&nbsp;They go all brutal lite.&nbsp;They play \u201cwho\u2019s the man\u201d even when the black man, like Jimenez, goes out of his way to show he already knows who the man is.&nbsp;\u201cYou are, officer, Sir.\u201d&nbsp;What the cops round up are the usual suspects and the usual suspects are always black and brown.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People ask why would the police treat another human being like this, and the answer must be because they can</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The whole world has seen the sordid violent recording where George Floyd narrates, over 10 minutes, his own demise.&nbsp;Actually, there is not 10 minutes of narration because Floyd goes limp and silent after several minutes, but that does not cause former officer Chauvin to remove his knee from Floyd\u2019s neck.&nbsp;The officers had received a radio run to go to a local store, where Floyd had allegedly tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill.&nbsp;Floyd is across the street from the store, chilling in his car with a couple of friends, when the officers approach like they are apprehending violent offenders.&nbsp;They order Floyd and his friends out of the car, put Floyd in handcuffs, order him to lie face down on the ground, and pin him down with their knees and hands.&nbsp;Floyd complains he can\u2019t breathe.&nbsp;A cop responds: \u201cWell, get up and get in the car.\u201d</p> <p>&nbsp;I guess that is what you call police humor.</p> <p>People ask why would the police treat another human being like this, and the answer must be because they can.&nbsp;There are rarely consequences.&nbsp;US police officers kill about 1,000 people a year &nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/m62-huddersfield-us-police-shooting-chicago-uk-charts-compare-difference-killings-officers-a7507051.html\">compared</a> with the UK, where in 10 years, law enforcement took a total of 23 lives) and there are rarely consequences.&nbsp;Since 2005, when roughly 15,000 people have been killed by US law enforcement officers, fewer than 150 have been charged with murder.&nbsp;</p> <p>True,&nbsp;the officers in George Floyd\u2019s case lost their jobs, and now face or will face criminal prosecution.&nbsp;This is only because of the video evidence and the high-profile protests.&nbsp;The reality is that, statistically, even these officers are likely to escape conviction.&nbsp;Of the 150 officers charged with homicide in the line of duty, the majority have been found not guilty or had charges dropped.&nbsp;</p> <p>For the moment, we who believe in justice are supposed to be satisfied that one cop, four days after the fact, has been taken into custody, when there are multiple videos of that officer with his knee on the victim\u2019s back as the man complains he can\u2019t breathe.&nbsp;</p> <p>As a black man, and as a former prosecutor, I had no idea it was so difficult to get arrested.&nbsp;US cops arrest about 12,000,000 people a year, but not usually each other.&nbsp;For the rest of us \u2013 I mean the rest of us black and brown people \u2013 we usually get arrested and charged the same day the cops decide we are guilty.&nbsp;The talk our parents give us about how to act around armed agents of the state is designed not so much to prevent arrests as to preserve life.&nbsp;It worked for Omar Jimenez.&nbsp;</p> <p>But not for George Floyd.&nbsp;On the ground, dying, George Floyd pleads for his life, respectful as a person can be when he is asking for mercy from the people who are literally crushing the life out of him. He says \u201cplease\u201d, \u201cofficer\u201d,&nbsp;and calls out to his dead mother.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the police do not remove their knees and feet and hands from Mr Floyd\u2019s body.&nbsp;They don\u2019t even stop restraining him when his body is limp and silent.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One simple reform would be to not allow the cops to make arrests for any non-violent crime</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What\u2019s to be done?&nbsp;Tinkering with the system makes a difference here and there but it is not enough.&nbsp;If a white woman was thought to have tried to use a fake $20 bill, it\u2019s impossible to imagine the police storming her vehicle, ordering her and her friends out, placing her in handcuffs and ultimately her winding up dead.&nbsp;But as long as cops have that kind of power, people of color will bear the brunt.&nbsp;So one simple reform would be to not allow the cops to make arrests for any non-violent crime. It\u2019s a power they can\u2019t be trusted with, because they will abuse it.</p> <p>In the end, this is not about law enforcement.&nbsp;It\u2019s about enforcing white supremacy.&nbsp;There\u2019s no tinkering with that, what with white supremacy being the foundation on which the country was built.&nbsp;The consistent big question in the quest for racial justice has been how much white supremacy is central to the identity of the US.&nbsp;This is what Barack Obama and Ta-Nehisi Coates argued about.&nbsp;If we had something approaching equal justice, would we still even be the United States?&nbsp;In order to accomplish that we\u2019d have to change the constitution, which authorizes much of the police violence that communities of color complain about, and the politics which exploits white anxiety about black and brown men.&nbsp;</p> <p>What does it mean for people of color to live in a country where, for them to have a fair shot, law and government have to be transformed?&nbsp;It means that we should expect more cases like Omar Jimenez and George Floyd, regardless of whether Trump or Biden wins in November.&nbsp;</p> <p>The real problem, ultimately, is not bad apple cops, even though these four officers are rotten to the core.&nbsp;The real problem is demonstrated in what a bystander <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/akzggb/a-cop-kneeled-on-a-black-mans-neck-until-he-said-he-couldnt-breathe-he-died-at-the-hospital\">told</a> the officers as they restrained him to death.&nbsp;\u201cHe\u2019s human, bro.\u201d&nbsp;But Floyd was not human to these officers.&nbsp;Enforcing the dehumanization&nbsp;of people of color has become, in the United States, what you call police work.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Paul Butler is the Albert Brick professor in law at Georgetown University.

  "<p>When Noopur Raje\u2019s husband fell critically ill with Covid-19 in mid-March, she did not suspect that she too was infected with the virus.</p> <p>Raje, an oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, had been caring for her sick husband for a week before driving him to an emergency centre with a persistently high fever. But after she herself had a diagnostic PCR test \u2013 which looks for traces of the Sars-CoV-2 virus DNA in saliva \u2013 she was astounded to find that the result was positive.</p> <p>\u201cMy husband ended up very sick,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was in intensive care for a day, and in hospital for 10 days. But while I was also infected, I had no symptoms at all. I have no idea why we responded so differently.\u201d</p> <p>It took two months for Raje\u2019s husband to recover. Repeated tests, done every five days, showed that Raje remained infected for the same length of time, all while remaining completely asymptomatic. In some ways it is unsurprising that the virus persisted in her body for so long, given that it appears her body did not even mount a detectable immune response against the infection.</p> <p>When they both took an antibody test earlier this month, Raje\u2019s husband showed a high level of antibodies to the virus, while Raje appeared to have no response at all, something she found hard to comprehend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a44884c483a130d1495e9bbbd11d6fa4e43164c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a44884c483a130d1495e9bbbd11d6fa4e43164c7/0_0_5208_3472/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beachgoers in Brighton last weekend\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beachgoers in Brighton last weekend \u2013 if many of us are carrying the virus, mask-wearing in public may become mandatory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s mind-blowing,\u201d she says. \u201cSome people are able to be colonised with the virus and not be symptomatic, while others end up with pretty severe illness. I think it\u2019s something to do with differences in immune regulation, but we still haven\u2019t figured out exactly how this is happening.\u201d</p> <p>Epidemiological studies are now revealing that the number of individuals who carry and can pass on the infection, yet remain completely asymptomatic, is larger than originally thought. Scientists believe these people have contributed to the spread of the virus in care homes, and they are central in the debate regarding face mask policies, as health officials attempt to avoid new waves of infections while societies reopen.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You don\u2019t need to be coughing to transmit a respiratory infection: talking, singing, even blowing a vuvuzela\u2026</p> <footer> <cite>Rein Houben</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the realisation that asymptomatic people can spread an infection is not completely surprising. For starters, there is the famous early 20th century case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/10/typhoid-mary-super-spreader-history\">\u201cTyphoid Mary\u201d,</a> a cook who infected 53 people in various households in the US with typhoid fever despite displaying no symptoms herself. In fact, all bacterial, viral and parasitic infections \u2013 ranging from malaria to HIV \u2013 have a certain proportion of asymptomatic carriers. Research has even shown that at any one time, all of us are infected <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X16302403#bib1\">with between eight and 12 viruses</a>, without showing any symptoms.</p> <p>From the microbe\u2019s perspective, this makes perfect evolutionary sense. \u201cFor any virus or bacteria, making people infectious but not ill is an excellent way to spread and persist in populations,\u201d says Rein Houben, an infectious diseases researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine.</p> <p>However, when Covid-19 was identified at the start of the year, many public health officials both in the UK and around the world failed to account for the threat posed by asymptomatic transmission. This is largely because they were working on models based on influenza, where some estimates suggest that only 5% of people infected are asymptomatic. As a result, the large scale diagnostic testing regimes required to pick up asymptomatic Covid-19 cases were not in place until too late.</p> <p>\u201cI warned on 24 January to <a href=\"https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-news-reports-that-the-china-coronavirus-may-spread-before-symptoms-show/\">consider asymptomatic cases</a> as a transmission vehicle for Covid-19, but this was ignored at the time,\u201d says Bill Keevil, professor of environmental healthcare at the University of Southampton. \u201cSince then, many countries have reported asymptomatic cases, never showing obvious symptoms, but shedding virus.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Finding the real number of asymptomatic patients</strong></h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762028\">first identified case</a> of asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 occurred in early January, when a traveller from Wuhan passed on the virus to five family members in different parts of the city of Anyang. After testing positive, she then remained asymptomatic for the entire 21-day follow-up period.</p> <p>While scientists still don\u2019t know whether asymptomatic people are as contagious as those who display symptoms, there are still many ways in which they can pass on Covid-19. \u201cWe know that you don\u2019t need to be coughing to transmit a respiratory infection like Sars-CoV-2,\u201d says Houben. \u201cTalking, singing, even <a href=\"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0020086\">blowing instruments like a vuvuzela</a> \u2013 in the past all of those have been shown to transmit respiratory viruses in some way.\u201d</p> <p>Since January, the race has been on to try and identify just how many asymptomatic cases are out there, with <a href=\"https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/translational-institute/about/news/sarc-cov-2-infection/\">varying findings</a>. <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20053157v1\">One study</a> in the Italian town of Vo reported that 43% of the town\u2019s cases of Covid-19 were asymptomatic, while initial reports from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigation into <a href=\"https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/translational-institute/about/news/sarc-cov-2-infection/\">the spread of Covid-19 </a>on the Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier in March, suggest that as many as 58% of cases were asymptomatic. Some 48% of the 1,046 cases of Covid-19 on the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier proved to be asymptomatic while, of the 712 people who tested positive for Covid-19 on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, 46% had no symptoms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45ff4acdd93a9952c70ff07af74cb8b19cdb6fbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45ff4acdd93a9952c70ff07af74cb8b19cdb6fbf/0_94_3887_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"French navy sailors wearing face masks seen through a porthole.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two thirds of the nearly 2,000 sailors on this French aircraft carrier tested positive, but 48% of those were asymptomatic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christophe Simon/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAlmost all evidence seems to point to a proportion of asymptomatic infections of around 40%, with a wide range,\u201d says Houben. \u201cThe proportion is also highly variable with age. Nearly all infected children seem to remain asymptomatic, whereas the reverse seems to hold for the elderly.\u201d</p> <p>Houben points out that, because most asymptomatic people have no idea they are infected, they are unlikely to be self-isolating, and studies have shown this has contributed to the rampant spread of the virus in facilities such as <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/04/14/coronavirus-boston-homeless-testing\">homeless shelters</a> and <a href=\"http://physiciansweekly.com/covid-19-asymptomatic-transmission-fueled-nursing-home-death-toll/\">care homes</a>. He says this means there is a need for regular diagnostic testing of almost all people in such closed environments, including prisons and psychiatric facilities.</p> <p>\u201cWhen it comes to controlling Covid-19, this really shows that we cannot rely on self-isolation of symptomatic cases only,\u201d he says. \u201cGoing forwards we need trace and test approaches to account for individuals who are not reporting any symptoms.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Following Korea\u2019s example</strong></h2> <p>Since February, the country that has arguably had the greatest success in suppressing asymptomatic spread of Covid-19 is South Korea. Armed with a rigorous contact tracing and diagnostic testing regime, which involved dozens of drive-through testing centres across major cities enabling tests to be carried out at a rate of one every 10 minutes, they put specific policies in place to offset the threat of asymptomatic carriers from the moment the virus began to spread out of control in Daegu.</p> <p>\u201cOnce identified, all asymptomatic people are asked to self quarantine in their house until they test negative, with health service officials checking on them twice daily, and monitoring their symptoms,\u201d says Eunha Shim, an epidemiologist at Soongsil University in Seoul.</p> <p>As Korea attempts to prevent a second wave of infections while reopening schools and allowing people to return to offices, preventing asymptomatic spread is one of their main priorities. This is being done by a mass public health campaign advocating the wearing of masks at all times outside the home. In Seoul, it is not possible to access the subway without a mask.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e970424f4acbcbeece7846768dd414c410488578\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e970424f4acbcbeece7846768dd414c410488578/0_47_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People queue at an outdoor clinic testing clinic in Bucheon, South Korea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People queue at an outdoor clinic testing clinic in Bucheon, South Korea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yonhap/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many scientists are increasingly calling for this policy to be officially introduced in the UK, especially as more and more people resume commuting in the coming months. Keevil says: \u201cThere is a strong case to be made for the public wearing appropriate face covers in confined areas such as stations, trains, metro carriages and buses, where it is extremely difficult to maintain the two-metre gap, considered essential to allow respiratory droplets from infected people to fall down before making contact with other people.</p> <p>\u201cThe argument is that face covers may not protect the wearer, but might significantly reduce transmission of virus particles to adjacent people in the closed environment. If there is any benefit to be gained, then everyone should wear a mask, which is why some countries are fining people who do not wear a mask and preventing them travelling.\u201d</p> <p>Some have argued that masks may pose a risk of harm to the wearer because of their potential to become an infectious surface, but Keevil says this can be avoided through proper cleaning.</p> <p>\u201cThere would need to be policies such as, when arriving at work, place the mask immediately in a plastic bag and wash your hands,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then, when returning home, carefully take off the mask and place it immediately in a washing machine for a 60C wash and wash your hands.\u201d</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether the UK government endorses this as an official recommendation, but a <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2020/may/hospitals-are-safer-places-you-might-think-new-covid-19-research-finds\">recent study</a> across Barts NHS Trust hospitals in London has illustrated how regular testing and social distancing combined with use of facial protection \u2013 in this case PPE \u2013 can prevent asymptomatic spread of the virus. Researchers James Moon and Charlotte Manisty said they found that the rate of asymptomatic infection among hospital staff fell from 7% to 1% between the end of March and early May.</p> <p>For Raje, understanding why asymptomatic patients like her respond the way they do to the virus, will have some critical implications for all of us over the coming months, for example in determining whether vaccines turn out to be effective.</p> <p>\u201cThe big question I have after my experience, is whether a vaccine will really work in all people,\u201d she says. \u201cThe vaccination approach is to create an immune response, which then protects you. But if asymptomatic people are not producing a normal antibody response to the virus, what does that mean? Because it\u2019s these people who are the vectors and the carriers of this virus, I think we can\u2019t get away from social distancing until we have some of these answers out there.\u201d</p>",

  "<p><strong>Time is very weird </strong>at the moment. It\u2019s elastic, but in terms of creativity I am always as much about the here and now as about looking at art and things from the past. I love both.</p> <p><strong>As a child in the suburbs,</strong> I tried to avoid anything that was team-related. I had a very brief career, from the age of eight, on a football team, and I tried ice hockey. My father dreamed I might be the first half-Turkish hockey pro. It came to nothing. I spent most of my time drawing and daydreaming.</p> <p><strong>My mum\u2019s family</strong> lived in the Midlands, my dad\u2019s in Eastern Turkey.

Not \u201cthat\u2019s for girls and that\u2019s for boys\u201d. I never equated the feminine as inappropriate, which is so often pinned on kids when they are playing.</p> <p><strong>A whole collection </strong>can come out of someone else\u2019s story.

Whether it\u2019s [Victorian biologist] Marianne North or [Victorian cross-dressers] \u201cFanny\u201d and \u201cStella\u201d, I am always looking for the magic of narrative to propel me forward.</p> <p><strong>My belief in beauty</strong>, the idea that it can transport you, has a tremendous power. My work has always had to do with a love of the feminine and nature.</p> <p><strong>When I first </strong>realised I was gay, as a child, I was so totally closed. If you told me I would be happily married one day I would never have believed it. But that feeling of being closed also allowed my imagination to run.</p> <p><strong>I am absolutely</strong> optimistic that out of the current situation good and positive change will come. This idea that one can jump on and off a plane and not think about it will come into question.</p> <p><strong>When we opened </strong>our Mayfair store 5 years ago, which my husband Philip designed, we created a universe for an imaginary woman.

Even as a child a colour was something I felt. <br><br><strong>Cecil Beaton was constantly</strong> reaching, taking the next step up. He wasn\u2019t born into the role that he played: he created that role. Tina Modotti also took sidesteps. She was a communist agent and a film star \u2013 she became who she wanted to be. The idea of transformation fascinates me.</p> <p><strong>I don\u2019t cry,</strong> or if I do, it is altitude-related: on a plane watching a sad film.

  "<p>No one wants to see their community burn. But the fires burning in Minneapolis, just like the fire burning in the spirits of so many marginalized Americans today, are a natural response to the trauma black communities have experienced, generation after generation.</p> <p>No one wants the fires \u2013&nbsp;even activists on the ground have said this. But they have also shared how their non-violent pleas and protests have gone unnoticed for years as the situation has gotten out of hand. No one knows who and what is behind the violence, but we do know that countless activists, grassroots leaders and preachers were screaming non-violently long before now: \u201cChange, America! Change, Minneapolis!\u201d Rather than listen, many of those in power saw even their non-violent protest as an unwelcome development.</p> <p>This is so often the case because many Americans struggle to imagine that our government\u2019s policies and its long train of abuses demand radical transformation. Too many want to believe racism is merely caused by a few bad actors. We often turn racism into a spectacle, only considering the cruel legacy of racism when an egregious action escalates outrage to this level.&nbsp;</p> <p>Black Americans have rarely been able to sustain such illusions. Deadly racism is always with us, and not only through police brutality. In the midst of the current pandemic we are painfully aware that our families bear a disproportionate burden of Covid-19 deaths. In some cities where racial data is available, we know that black people are six times as likely to die from the virus as their white counterparts.&nbsp;Even before Covid, large numbers of black Americans died because of the racial disparities in healthcare, which are systemic and not unintentional.</p> <p>African Americans are three times more likely to die from particulate air pollution than our fellow Americans. The percentage of black children suffering from asthma is nearly double that of white people, and&nbsp;the death rate is 10 times higher. This is but a reflection of the fissures of inequality that run through every institution in our public life, where the black wealth gap, education gap and healthcare gap have persisted despite the civil rights movement, legal desegregation and symbolic affirmative action. We understand that the same mentality that will accept and defend the violence of armed officers against unarmed black people will also send black, brown and poor people into harm\u2019s way during a pandemic in the name of \u201cliberty\u201d and \u201cthe economy\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>Many have cited Dr King to remind Americans that a riot is the language of the unheard. But I have been reflecting on the eulogy he offered when another man \u2013 a white man who came to Selma, Alabama, to work for voting rights \u2013&nbsp;was brutally murdered by racist violence in 1965. At the funeral for James Reed, Dr King said it is not enough to ask who killed the victim in a case like the murder of George Floyd. Weak and unacceptable charges have been brought against the officer whose knee choked George Floyd, staying on his neck for three minutes after he went unconscious, but no charges have been filed against the other officers who stood by and watched. Even still, dealing with who did the killing is not all that justice demands. Dr King said the question is not only who killed him, but also what killed him?&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Those of us who have faced the lethal force of systemic racism have also learned something else in the American story. We can be wounded healers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The systemic racism that killed George Floyd has taken untold souls from us for over 400 years. And it is killing the very possibility of American democracy today. I join those screaming that this is all screwed up, and it\u2019s been screwed up far too long. But we are not screwed as long we have the consciousness and humanity to know what is right and wrong.</p> <p>Those of us who have faced the lethal force of systemic racism have also learned something else in the American story. We can be wounded healers. We don\u2019t have to be arbitrarily destructive. We can be determined to never accept the destruction of our bodies and dreams by any police, person or policy. We have learned that there is a force more powerful. When hands that once picked cotton have joined together with white hands and Native hands, brown hands and Asian hands, we have been able to fundamentally reconstruct this democracy. Slavery was abolished. Women did gain the right to vote. Labor did win a 40-hour work week and a minimum wage. The civil rights movement in the face of lynching and shooting did expand voting rights to African Americans.&nbsp;</p> <p>If we take time to listen to this nation\u2019s wounds, they tell us where to look for hope. The hope is in the mourning and the screams, which make us want to rush from this place. There is a sense in which right now we must refuse to be comforted too quickly. Only if these screams and tears and protests shake the very conscience of this nation \u2013and until there is real political and judicial repentance \u2013&nbsp;can we hope for a better society on the other side of this.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>William J Barber&nbsp;II&nbsp;is co-chair of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival, which is mobilizing poor people and their allies for a mass assembly and march on Washington in June 2020</p></li> </ul>",

In Minneapolis some of the protests have turned violent: buildings (including a police precinct) have been set on fire and a Target store was looted.

And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice, equality&nbsp;and humanity.\u201d</p> <p>That speech was 53 years ago and America still isn\u2019t listening.&nbsp;The uncomfortable truth is that, sometimes, violence is the only answer left. We like to pretend otherwise, which is why civil rights movements are often conveniently sanitized. The women\u2019s suffrage movement, for example, is often celebrated as \u201cnon-violent\u201d. It wasn\u2019t: if went&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/06/the-role-of-violence-in-winning-votes-for-women-and-men\">through a very militant phase</a>. \u201cIf men use explosives and bombs for their own purpose they call it war,\u201d the British suffragette Christabel Pankhurst&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/votes-for-women/articles/suffragettes-violence-and-militancy\">wrote in 1913</a>, \u201cand the throwing of a bomb that destroys other people is then described as a glorious and heroic deed. Why should a woman not make use of the same weapons as men?\u201d</p> <p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not glorifying violence \u2013 that\u2019s what the president of the United States is doing. And I\u2019m certainly not calling for violence. I\u2019m simply saying we must interrogate what we call \u201cviolence\u201d and what we call \u201cpolicy.\u201d Many of the people yelling \u201cviolence is not the answer\u201d about the riots in Minneapolis are the same people who wholeheartedly support America\u2019s endless wars. Many of the people condemning the looters in Minneapolis are the same people who venerate billionaires.

  "<p>The Westminster village often gets over-excited about news that, frankly, passes the ordinary voter by. What happens there can seem to have little relevance to people\u2019s lives. But, according to <a href=\"https://britainthinks.com/\">BritainThinks</a>\u2019 coronavirus diaries, the Dominic Cummings story unearthed by the <em>Guardian</em>/<em>Mirror</em> investigation is different.</p> <p>Our diarists, 50 people from all walks of life, are keeping <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/26/britains-lockdown-diaries-expose-gulf-in-wellbeing-between-rich-and-poor#maincontent\">weekly accounts</a> of their lives in lockdown. They were clear that this news from Westminster matters. Entries from last weekend were dominated by Cummings, the chief adviser to Boris Johnson, and his trip to Durham.&nbsp;</p> <p>The mood is febrile. We\u2019ve been asking people to sum up their feelings in a word or two. Back at the start, nine weeks ago, the diarists were \u201cworried\u201d. They then grew \u201cbored\u201d and \u201cfrustrated\u201d as lockdown wore on.</p> <p>As the government message, at first so unifying, became bewilderingly unclear, many declared themselves&nbsp;\u201cconfused\u201d.</p> <p>Now they are quite simply angry. This anger has been bubbling under the surface for a while. At a difficult time, many have judged and been judged by neighbours and friends as they have grappled with \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d.</p> <p>Everyone has a tale to tell about someone getting it wrong. It hits home hard because everyone also has a tale to tell of self-sacrifice, of hardship, even heartbreak. It\u2019s an emotional rollercoaster. Many feel their lives are out of control.</p> <p>Cummings and, indirectly, Johnson have become lightning rods for those feelings, fuelling indignation about people who don\u2019t or won\u2019t play by the rules.</p> <p>In polling last week, <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2020/05/26/3fb8f/1\">71% of respondents </a>agreed \u201cthere is one rule for them [the government] and another rule for everyone else\u201d.&nbsp;This fury about being played by an elite when at your most powerless and vulnerable is, ironically, felt most strongly by the very people to whom Cummings\u2019 brilliant \u201ctake back control\u201d Brexit message had appealed most.&nbsp;</p> <p>The implications for the government\u2019s reputation have the potential to be far-reaching. Here\u2019s a flavour of the diaries:</p> <p>\u201cDominic Cummings\u2019 actions make a mockery of all those people, most of them much less privileged than he is, who have suffered during isolation.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cOh, the hypocrisy of politicians. They make the rules, then undermine them and make them useless.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one rule for the nation but Cummings can do what he wants.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI now have no faith in our leaders. They are playing games with politics, playing with us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJoe Public would never get the backing from on high that Dominic Cummings has had. Joe Public would be fined.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt makes me so angry \u2026 surely the government\u2019s top adviser can arrange his own food and childcare in London without travelling from the country\u2019s main virus hotspot to another region.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so upset at Cummings blatantly breaking the lock down rules \u2013 and at the senior Conservatives lining up to defend him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoJo \u2013 what is he doing standing by DC and his Tour of Britain, while the rest of us stayed home?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think at the beginning they seemed quite impressive and I had a lot of faith in them. I thought they were different. But now they\u2019ve made a huge amount of errors.

In 2019, a Facebook spokesperson declined to clarify the company\u2019s policy around violence and hate speech by state actors on the record to the Guardian. The Guardian has contacted Facebook for comment. </p> \n  <p>This is not the first time that Facebook\u2019s exemption of state actors from content rules has been questioned. During the campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya in Myanmar, Facebook banned an insurgent group fighting to defend the Muslim minority while allowing Myanmar\u2019s military, the Tatmadaw, to continue using its platform to spread its propaganda. </p> \n  <p>Facebook subsequently banned a number of ethnic armed organizations in Myanmar, designating the officially recognized groups as the equivalent to terrorist organizations. The move prompted an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/07/facebook-myanmar-genocide-violence-hate-speech\">outcry from human rights experts</a> who said the company\u2019s decision to favor state actors over non-state actors in armed conflict was inconsistent with both international law and human rights. </p> \n  <p>In his lengthy post, Zuckerberg also appeared to suggest that if Facebook had decided Trump\u2019s post was intended to incite violence by civilians, they would have taken it down, writing, \u201cUnlike Twitter, we do not have a policy of putting a warning in front of posts that may incite violence because we believe that if a post incites violence, it should be removed regardless of whether it is newsworthy, even if it comes from a politician.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Zuckerberg also criticized Trump, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling with how to respond to the President\u2019s tweets and posts all day. Personally, I have a visceral negative reaction to this kind of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He added: \u201cI disagree strongly with how the President spoke about this, but I believe people should be able to see this for themselves, because ultimately accountability for those in positions of power can only happen when their speech is scrutinized out in the open.\u201d </p>

reports on the criminal complaint against Derek Chauvin, which provides new details on the killing of George Floyd. </strong></p> \n  <p>Derek Chauvin, the ex-Minneapolis police officer charged today with third-degree murder and manslaughter in connection with the killing of George Floyd, had his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds total, according to the <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/read-the-complaint-charging-derek-chauvin-in-the-death-of-george-floyd/570870791/\">complaint</a>.</p> \n  <p>For two minutes and 53 seconds, Floyd was \u201cnon-responsive\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cPolice are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous,\u201d the complaint states. </p> \n  <p>As captured in the now-viral video, Floyd repeatedly told the officers \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d before pleading with them, saying \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cplease\u201d. One of the officers responded, \u201cYou are talking fine\u201d as he struggled. </p> \n  <p>The other three officers, identified by authorities as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng, were also fired. According to the complaint, Lane had asked, \u201cShould we roll him on his side?\u201d </p> \n  <p>Chauvin responded, \u201cNo, staying put where we got him.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cI am worried about excited delirium or whatever,\u201d Lane said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we have him on his stomach,\u201d Chauvin said. </p> \n  <p>The medical examiner\u2019s autopsy report is still pending, but preliminary findings have determined that a combination of the police hold on Floyd, his underlying health conditions of coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease, as well as \u201cany potential intoxicants\u201d likely contributed to his death. </p> \n  <p>Floyd ended up on the ground after Lane pointed his gun at him and instructed him to step out of a car. Lane and Kueng had been responding to a report that someone had used a counterfeit $20 bill at a nearby store, and the store owner identified the person as sitting in a parked car around the corner. There were three people in the car. </p> \n  <p>The officers had handcuffed Floyd and were walking him to their police cruiser when he \u201cstiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Chauvin and Thoa arrived at about 8:14pm. Within five minutes, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck.</p> \n  <p>At 8:25pm, the video \u201cappears to show Mr Floyd ceasing to breathe or speak\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWant to roll him on his side?\u201d Lane asked. Kueng then checked Floyds wrist for a pulse. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find one.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cNone of the officers moved from their positions,\u201d the complaint states. </p> \n  <p>At 8:27pm, Chauvin removed his knee. <br><br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed192938f087122eca52364\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T23:05:02.715Z\">12.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>While the imagery of fires and broken windows have dominated the news, reporters in the Twin Cities have also been documenting acts of community, solidarity and mutual aid. </strong></p> \n  <p>Chris McGreal is in Minneapolis reporting for the Guardian, where he has spoken with community members volunteering to clean up the neighborhood or keep watch over their neighbors. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisMcGreal/status/1266428976723111938\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ayanle Hashi who spent Thursday night guarding his Minneapolis apartment building as crowds looted shops below and neighbouring stores. \u201cThere are disabled and old people in this building.

  "<p>Donald Trump has gifted a record proportion of ambassadorial posts to political appointees, rewarding wealthy supporters with minimal experience at the expense of career diplomats, according to the latest figures.</p> <p>About <a href=\"http://www.afsa.org/appointments-donald-j-trump\">44% of US ambassadors</a> nominated by Trump have been political appointees, compared with a historical average of about 30%, according to the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA). That percentage is getting higher. Out of the ambassador nominations so far this year, 57% have gone to political appointees.</p> <p>The dramatic increase of top posts being given to wealthy entrepreneurs like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/02/lana-marks-trump-us-ambassador-south-africa\">Lana Marks</a> \u2013 a handbag designer made US ambassador to South Africa last year \u2013 could violate the law, which requires most ambassadorial posts to go to state department diplomats, and for ambassadors to have relevant experience.</p> <p>Brett Bruen, a former US diplomat and former head of global engagement in the White House, said the number of ambassadorial openings for career diplomats was even smaller in the list of job openings being circulated this summer.</p> <p>The Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, covering the Americas, has only one ambassadorship on the list, Nicaragua, open to foreign service officers, Bruen said. Citing state department sources, he said that though there were 20 vacancies in Africa this year, the number of ambassador posts in Europe and Asia open to career diplomats was \u201cdramatically down\u201d.</p> <p>The Foreign Service Act of 1980 requires that most ambassadors should be career foreign service officers, that political appointments should be a rarity, and that all appointees should be fully qualified for their positions.</p> <p>\u201cWe are concerned that the percentage of political appointees is higher than at any time in recent history, and also with the number of nominees who do not appear to be qualified for their positions,\u201d Eric Rubin, the AFSA president, said.</p> <p>He urged the US Senate to scrutinise the qualifications of nominees with the aim of returning to the historic norm of between 25% and 35% of posts being reserved for political appointees.</p> <p>\u201cThe current percentage of about 45% is way above historical norms and has a negative impact on our diplomacy and overseas operations,\u201d Rubin said. The Senate has so far overwhelmingly backed Trump\u2019s ambassadorial nominations.</p> <p>A state department spokesperson said: \u201cThis year, like every year, career employees have a number of posts for which they can indicate interest and compete,\u201d adding the number \u201cvaries from year to year\u201d.</p> <p>The practice of giving top diplomatic posts to rich backers came under particular scrutiny during the impeachment crisis, in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/20/gordon-sondland-trump-impeachment-ukraine-quid-pro-quo\">Gordon Sondland</a>, a hotelier appointed by Trump as ambassador to the European Union, played a central role in establishing a parallel policy towards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> run by Trump and his lawyer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rudygiuliani\">Rudy Giuliani</a>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/28/us-ambassador-appointments-are-destination-tourism-mega-rich/\">Washington Post</a> has described US ambassadorships as \u201cdestination tourism for the mega-rich\u201d. Ryan Scoville, an associate law professor at University of Marquette, published a <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3333988\">study of political appointee ambassadors</a> last year. Comparing the Trump administration with the Ronald Reagan era, Scoville found the new appointees were \u201cinferior in terms of language abilities, prior experience in the receiving state and region, prior experience in foreign policy and prior experience in organizational leadership\u201d.</p> <p>On the other hand, Trump appointees paid 15 times more than their Reagan counterparts in campaign contributions.</p> <p>\u201cThere is an element of being in an election year, when political favours go a long way,\u201d Bruen said.</p> <p>He argued the steady rise in the political appointees getting top jobs \u201cdemonstrates a deep distrust on the seventh floor [the leadership] of the state department and at the White House, of career foreign service officers\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey have been systematically shut out of the policy process, they\u2019ve been sidelined when issues arose and they had concerns, and they have also been forced to bear the brunt of the president\u2019s direct wrath,\u201d Bruen added.</p>",

Since that first show it\u2019s had a few different makeovers, from doing round-tables and covering news stories to speaking with authors and exploring a single scientific topic in depth. It\u2019s even done a (really spectacular) mini-series, exploring the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2019/may/03/oceans-of-noise-episode-one-science-weekly-podcast\">sonic environment of the ocean</a>. Under each new guise, the podcast is always trying to find the best format to share science and engage its listeners. That\u2019s why we changed things up a bit with Covid-19 \u2013 making our episodes shorter and bringing them out more frequently than usual, so we could delve into the rapidly developing pandemic and discuss the science as it was happening.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>How do you decide which topics and experts to include?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nicola </strong>When it comes to the Covid-19 outbreak, it\u2019s about being very specific. The story has different aspects, and is fast moving, so it can be hard for people to find answers to the questions they care about. With the podcast we wanted to zoom in on key issues in a concise way. Our listeners have been a huge help, sending in fantastic questions to steer our coverage. What I particularly like about that is that it means we as a team are delving into the things that really matter to our listeners, whether that\u2019s unpicking if Covid-19 poses a particular risk to pregnant women (happily the answer appears to be no), or delving into our understanding of immunity. We carefully research which scientists are leaders in the field, and can share not just what\u2019s known about Covid-19, but also what remains to be unpicked.</p> <h2><strong>What have been your highlights of the podcasts you\u2019ve produced so far \u2013 especially the ones launched during lockdown?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6e750f5324ce504c0ea3049a7ce908d051779dff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e750f5324ce504c0ea3049a7ce908d051779dff/0_0_3000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Science Weekly has been on air since 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Science Weekly has been on air since 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Egle Kazdailyte</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Nicola</strong><em> </em>I have so many favourite episodes.

When it comes to Covid-19, my favourite episode, as a former chemist, has to be the one about why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2020/apr/01/covid-19-soap-or-hand-sanitiser\">soap and water helps to tackle coronavirus</a>. Hand washing is a simple action, but so effective.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Madeleine </strong>Of the podcasts I\u2019ve produced during lockdown, I particularly enjoyed the episode on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2020/may/12/covid-19-why-are-some-people-losing-their-taste-and-smell\">why people are losing their sense of taste and smell</a>. As soon as anecdotal reports started coming out that coronavirus was causing this, usually very sudden, sensory loss I was hooked. Was it really a symptom? How was the virus affecting people in this way? What were the biological mechanisms behind it? That exemplifies one of the best things about making these podcasts \u2013 following our (and our listeners\u2019) curiosity, and chasing down answers and insights from the experts.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>What have been the most interesting things you\u2019ve learned about Covid-19?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nicola </strong>As with any novel virus, scientists are discovering new things all the time \u2013 every day brings new revelations. A fundamental, and fascinating, discovery was how coronavirus enters human cells. Impressively early on, scientists found that it did this by attaching its surface proteins called \u201cspike proteins\u201d to a receptor called ACE2. Now, vaccines are already in development that hope to introduce these spike proteins to the body and trigger an immune response.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve had hundreds of interesting, surprising, and provocative questions from listeners</p> <footer> <cite>Madeleine Finlay</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I also think reports of people experiencing symptoms of Covid-19 for many weeks or even months are important \u2013 increasingly so as time goes on \u2013 as are the findings that men and BAME communities are at greater risk from the disease. Hopefully researchers will begin to understand these issues more in the coming months, and find ways to tackle them.</p> <h2><strong>What are the biggest challenges of producing the pods now?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p><strong>Madeleine </strong>Initially I thought the biggest challenge might be technological - trying to get everyone online, able to hear each other, and recorded with a reasonable sound quality. I\u2019m sure most of us have suffered the endless back and forth of \u201cHello? Hello? Can you hear me?\u201d on Zoom calls over the past few months. Occasionally getting the tech right is tough, and there have had to be some rather quick workarounds, but thankfully on day one of working from home, Max Sanderson, the head producer, sent the presenters proper microphones and recorders.</p> <p>In fact, for me, what has been really challenging is the speed at which the science is evolving. For a while it felt as if each morning I\u2019d wake up to a new discovery, question, or mystery. Despite it making things more difficult for a producer, it\u2019s a real testament to how hard, and how fast, scientists have been working on understanding Covid-19 over the past few months.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then, of course, there\u2019s trying to make sure our presenters can find time on a busy news day. Their schedules were full even before the pandemic, so the effort they\u2019re putting in now is pretty heroic.&nbsp;</p> <h2>&nbsp;<br><strong>Do you get feedback from listeners? How have people responded?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Madeleine</strong><em><strong> </strong></em>When we first started the podcasts focusing on Covid-19, we put a call out to listeners asking for questions and feedback. I\u2019m not sure how many responses we were expecting, but we were shocked, and thrilled, to see our inboxes fill up every week. We\u2019ve had hundreds of interesting, surprising, and provocative questions that have really got us thinking, and guided which topics we look at each week. From the start there has been one consistent message in the feedback from listeners \u2013 they\u2019re grateful for the information. I think knowledge and understanding make a huge difference when everything is so uncertain and unpredictable. It can make us feel safer, calmer, and a little more in control. Seeing how much our listeners appreciate discovering more about the science of the outbreak never fails to brighten up a day and motivate me onto the next question!<br></p> <h2><strong>How does the pod complement the rest of our science coverage?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nicola </strong>Working on the Science Weekly podcast is one of my favourite aspects of being a science reporter at the Guardian \u2013 it offers a different way of telling a story compared with writing a news article and it allows us to take listeners behind the scenes of how we delve into a story, from the kinds of questions we ask to the importance of challenging the answers we receive. It also allows us to give listeners a feel for how science works, and the people who are doing the science itself.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>To understand how wide Beijing now casts its security net in Hong Kong, consider the case of Martin Lee. Now in his 80s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/i-wont-allow-this-to-be-the-end-of-hong-kong-campaigner-on-his-long-fight-for-democracy\">Lee is a distinguished barrister</a>, a politician and a lifelong defender of civil liberties.&nbsp;He has never committed an act of violence or advocated that others do so.</p> <p>Last month, in an early sign of what was coming, Lee was arrested at his home.&nbsp;Fourteen other prominent Hong Kong citizens were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/police-in-hong-kong-arrest-14-activists-amid-autonomy-warnings\">taken into custody that day</a> and charged with taking part in illegal demonstrations. He has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/21/i-was-arrested-hong-kong-its-part-chinas-larger-plan/\">pointed out</a> that he was already facing 14 similar charges in mainland China, and had the extradition law that triggered last year\u2019s protests in Hong Kong been adopted he could have been sent for trial in China under a system that not even the Chinese Communist party\u2019s (CCP) most generous supporters could describe as adequate. The CCP regards rule of law and separation of powers as threats to its power. Law, for the party, is one instrument among many&nbsp;that can be used to eliminate opponents \u2013 who can be anyone from dissenting public intellectuals to prominent businessmen.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lee was a member of the drafting committee for the Basic Law, Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution and the legal scaffolding of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/29/hong-kong-the-end-of-one-country-two-systems\">one </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/29/hong-kong-the-end-of-one-country-two-systems\">country, </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/29/hong-kong-the-end-of-one-country-two-systems\">two </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/29/hong-kong-the-end-of-one-country-two-systems\">systems</a>\u201d formula promoted by the late paramount leader of China, Deng Xiaoping.&nbsp;Deng saw it as the means by which China could recover sovereignty over the British colony while preserving Hong Kong\u2019s&nbsp;civil liberties, rule of law, a relative lack of corruption and even an accountable government. He understood that these features had made Hong Kong a thriving centre of global finance and it was key to the economic renaissance of China that became his great legacy.&nbsp;</p> <p>Not only has&nbsp;Hong Kong been essential to huge volumes of investment into China, it has also been a place where information and ideas that are stifled on the mainland could flourish, a place where spies from all over the world could learn each other\u2019s secrets, civil society groups could organise and religious practice could thrive. Its media freedoms helped to save the world from the worst effects of the <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/24/asia/china-sars-coronavirus-intl-hnk/index.html\">S</a><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/24/asia/china-sars-coronavirus-intl-hnk/index.html\">ars epidemic in 2003</a>: it was in Hong Kong that the CCP\u2019s months-long silence was broken.&nbsp;Without that, many more people would certainly have died.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hong Kong has also been a safety valve for a Chinese political system that has lurched too often between intense repression and violent convulsion. One reason the people of Hong Kong <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/10/what-are-the-hong-kong-protests-about-explainer\">defend their freedoms so vigorously</a> is that so many of them are there because they, or their parents or grandparents risked their lives to escape from China.&nbsp;They learned the value of Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms from personal experience.</p> <p>Deng, too,&nbsp;had experience of both the oppression and the convulsion and&nbsp;understood the value to China of Hong Kong as a place apart.&nbsp;He sent tanks to crush the students in Tiananmen Square in 1989, but he didn\u2019t prevent the people of Hong Kong gathering, as they have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/04/tiananmen-square-massacre-marked-with-hong-kong-vigil\">every 4 June</a> since,&nbsp;to remember the dead.&nbsp;This is the first year that that gathering is in doubt.&nbsp;</p> <p>Speaking in New York in 2014, Lee pointed out that Deng\u2019s promises to Hong Kong included no interference in its affairs by any mainland institution and the introduction of universal suffrage. Without universal suffrage, Lee warned, Hong Kong people would mistrust their government and the region would not be stable.&nbsp;But Beijing had repeatedly postponed universal suffrage, and in June 2014 China\u2019s state council published a white paper that claimed government in <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/11/world/asia/hong-kong-beijing-two-systems-paper/index.html\">Beijing had comprehensive jurisdiction</a> over Hong Kong and Macau. As Lee predicted, Hong Kong has not been stable, Beijing has steadily lost support, and today a majority of people in the region identify as citizens of Hong Kong, but not of China.&nbsp;</p> <p>Every move to tighten control since 1997 has been met with resistance. Throughout last year\u2019s growing tumult provoked by a proposed extradition law, Carrie Lam, the latest in a line of disastrous chief executives, argued that Hong Kong\u2019s silent majority supported her government. In an exceptionally large turnout, that majority responded by giving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/24/hong-kong-residents-turn-up-for-local-elections-in-record-numbers\">90% support to democratic parties</a> in the local elections in November.&nbsp;Beijing is anxious to avoid another electoral humiliation in the legislative elections later this year.&nbsp;</p> <p>As resistance mounted, Beijing drew the lesson that only further repression would suffice, fatally undermining Deng\u2019s vision of a self-governing and stable Hong Kong. It has&nbsp;now effectively torn up the treaty it signed with Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government and condemned Hong Kong to further unrest and decline.&nbsp;If Beijing\u2019s desired outcome was stability and security, it has disastrously mishandled it. Few doubt that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/china-vote-npc-national-security-laws-hong-kong-us-protest\">Beijing\u2019s security law</a> will criminalise dissent, undermine the rule of law and target prominent activists such as the youth leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/joshua-wong\">Joshua Wong</a>, as well as veterans such as Lee. Further turmoil is inevitable.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/22/china-foisting-anti-sedition-law-hong-kong-freedoms\">China is foisting an anti-sedition law that will change Hong Kong for ever | Ilaria Maria Sala and Louisa Lim</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The UK has been shamefully feeble in defence of Hong Kong, though the recent hardening of attitudes towards China within the Conservative party may produce something more than the usual pro-forma expression of concern.&nbsp;Hong Kong\u2019s best hopes of support, however, lie in Washington. Under the 1992 Hong Kong Policy Act, the territory enjoys special trade status with the US, provided the secretary of state certifies annually to Congress that it retains its autonomous status. When, on Wednesday, Mike Pompeo notified Congress that Hong Kong could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/hong-kong-china-autonomous-us-pompeo-security-law\">no longer be considered autonomous</a>, the question left open is what will the Trump administration, already locked in angry confrontation with China, do about it?</p> <p>The nuclear option of revoking Hong Kong\u2019s US trade privileges would hurt Hong Kong more than China and could provoke direct retaliation on hundreds of US businesses in both regions.&nbsp;Other options, which include targeted sanctions on party officials, asset freezes and visa restrictions, carry similar risks. In other times, the US might have mobilised its allies to support a concerted rebuke in the upcoming G7 meeting and other high-level gatherings. But Trump is noted neither for effective nor skilful alliances, and his administration has been described as having an attitude to China but not a policy. As for the UK, the least it should do is to open its doors to those citizens of Hong Kong who hold British national (overseas) passports, something it should have done in 1997. This week, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, spoke of opening up a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/uk-will-extend-visas-for-300000-hong-kong-residents-says-raab\">pathway to future citizenship</a>\u201d for BN(O)s, if China doesn\u2019t \u201cstep back\u201d from implementing the security bill. But, so far, these are just words.

Major departments in cities including Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Oakland and Los Angeles have adopted more restrictive policies governing the use of force,&nbsp;a step research indicates is effective at reducing police violence, said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samswey/status/1180655701271732224\">Samuel Sinyangwe</a>, a data scientist and activist.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere have been some changes, in particularly the largest cities in America,\u201d Sinyangwe said. \u201cIn the departments that have begun to implement these changes, we\u2019ve seen reductions in police violence. It doesn\u2019t mean that is a magic solution or enough to fix this whole problem, but it is something that can make a difference.\u201d</p> \n<p>There is less evidence to indicate that measures such as implicit bias training or body cameras have correlated with a reduction in police violence, Sinyangwe said, although body cameras seem to have contributed to an increase in accountability for officers involved in incidents of excessive use of force.</p> \n<p>Public awareness of police violence against people of color has grown thanks to the advocacy of high-profile figures such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/27/lebron-james-george-floyd-death-police-colin-kaepernick\">the former football star Colin Kaepernick</a>, who was rejected by the NFL \u2013 and suffered attacks by Donald Trump \u2013 for kneeling during the national anthem.</p> \n<p>The conversation around racial justice has marginally improved in the six years since Ferguson, Packnett Cunningham said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is an improved public conversation and increased action on the part of some white people,\u201d she said. \u201cThe number of people who are taking responsibility for their own actions&nbsp;has yet to reach critical mass by a long shot. But six years ago, we were simply trying to make America aware of what we suffer.</p> \n<p>\u201cSix years later many more people \u2013 not enough, but many more people \u2013 are further along in their awareness, and they\u2019re able to step much more immediately into action.

In my garden, where the fruit sits hidden among all sorts of others, I do very little netting.

  "<p>With thick, fuzzy trunks topped by a headdress of imposing fronds, these giants of the fern family are showstoppers. \u201cWhen you see them, you think, wow,\u201d says designer <a href=\"https://www.tlg-landscape.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Todd Longstaffe-Gowan</a>, who has been using them in his gardens for more than 30 years. But it is their ability to make a statuesque feature in the smallest of spaces that has cemented the tree fern\u2019s recent popularity, he says. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a dark area where little else will grow, few plants perform so well.\u201d</p> <p>Among the tree ferns available in the UK, the most popular is <em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/5794/i-Dicksonia-antarctica-i/Details\" title=\"\">Dicksonia antarctica</a></em>. Its huge trunks, which arrived on our shores in the 1840s and 50s, were transported from their native Australia to be planted in Britain\u2019s grand gardens by well-heeled Victorian gardeners. The plant\u2019s main asset is its hardiness: it can cope with temperatures as cold as -5C, which means it will survive the average British winter with the help of some insulation around the crown. They can grow to 15m (49ft) in their native south-eastern Australia. Others, such as the black tree fern (<em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/22191/i-Cyathea-medullaris-i/Details\" title=\"\">Cyathea medullaris</a></em>), may thrive outside in a sheltered garden in Cornwall or in the heat island of central London, but would struggle elsewhere in the event of a harsh UK winter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6bd30d8ebf72fe9b933c18b440f28f5ea225cff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6bd30d8ebf72fe9b933c18b440f28f5ea225cff/0_0_3510_4090/858.jpg\" alt=\"Dicksonia antarctica.\" width=\"858\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dicksonia antarctica grow to 15 metres in their native south-eastern Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>D. antarctica</em> provided an elegant solution to a problematic space Longstaffe-Gowan designed <a href=\"https://www.tlg-landscape.co.uk/projects/public/royal-college-of-art/\" title=\"\">at the Royal College of Art</a> in London. \u201cWe were confronted with a dark, enclosed courtyard, protected from the wind.

Tree ferns are widely available from specialist suppliers and some garden centres. For instant impact, the usual choice is a specimen 60cm (2ft) tall or more: a <em>D. antarctica</em> costs about \u00a345-\u00a350 per foot of trunk. Combine a tree fern or three with an underplanting of bold-leaved foliage of a different shape, such as grey-blue hostas. To draw the eye away from a bare or wrapped tree fern in winter, choose an evergreen planting partner such as the glossy foliage of the false castor oil plant (<em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/7147/fatsia-japonica/details\" title=\"\">Fatsia japonica</a></em>).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"498d1d9f040f46ac4e164f9750dbfd064ddd7296\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/498d1d9f040f46ac4e164f9750dbfd064ddd7296/0_0_3618_5424/667.jpg\" alt=\"Dicksonia antartica frond.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dicksonia antartica frond.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s vital that you check the provenance of your dicksonia, and buy only from a reputable supplier.

  "<p>A few days before New York locked down and Broadway closed indefinitely, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/rose-byrne\" title=\"\">Rose Byrne</a> was on stage in Brooklyn, doing Medea. It was a sold-out run, co-starring her husband, Bobby Cannavale, in an updated version of the Euripides classic. Already, in that first week of March, people were starting to not show up, and those who did were in an odd mood. \u201cThere was something subdued about the audience,\u201d says Byrne. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s Medea \u2013 and not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/12/tyler-perry-madea-creator-of-a-racial-stereotype-or-the-greatest-indie-film-maker-ever\" title=\"\">Tyler Perry</a>\u2019s version \u2013 so it\u2019s not full of laughs.\u201d Still, she says, \u201cthe last week was strange. You could feel a tension.\u201d The show closed on 8 March, one of the few in the city to finish its run. Four days later, the theatres went dark.</p> <p>Since then, the 40-year-old actor, along with Cannavale and their two kids, both under five, have been in their home in Brooklyn. Byrne peers into the camera from a dimly lit room in her house, hair tied up in a wrap that conceals what she says is the crash in personal grooming. There is, in these times, nothing so endearing to other New Yorkers as the New Yorker of means who, at the first sign of the pandemic, didn\u2019t clear off to their house in the country. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken some weekend trips here and there,\u201d says Byrne, \u201cbut otherwise we\u2019re holding tight and waiting to see\u2026 \u201d She trails off. The inertia of lockdown descends.</p> <p>Luckily, the new TV show Byrne is promoting is an invigorating effort that lifts the spirits even as it depresses. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/15/mrs-america-cate-blanchett-fx-hulu\" title=\"\">Mrs America</a>, in which Byrne plays <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/gloria-steinem\" title=\"\">Gloria Steinem</a>, is an ensemble piece set in 1972, at the height of the women\u2019s movement in the US. For a moment, it looked as if the equal rights amendment or ERA \u2013 a proposed change to the constitution, seeking to guarantee women equal rights across the board \u2013 might be ratified by all 50 states. What followed was one of the epic disappointments in feminist history, a period characterised by infighting within the movement, and betrayal, chiefly by the 1972 Democratic candidate for president, George McGovern. Having given Steinem his assurance he would adopt abortion rights as official policy, he quietly dropped the position and did no such thing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bbea22ef4779bbd215cb1ac18f85df27bdf55a97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbea22ef4779bbd215cb1ac18f85df27bdf55a97/528_368_5042_3025/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rose Byrne with Tracey Ullman in Mrs America.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Tracey Ullman (right) in Mrs America.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a tough role for Byrne in some ways.

But Byrne, as Steinem, has to communicate the soft-spoken power of someone who, as she puts it, \u201cnever raises her voice, or loses her temper. There\u2019s an incredibly serene quality to her. But it has a real power. She\u2019s actually very tough, and has a steeliness underneath.\u201d</p> <p>Steinem\u2019s steeliness was deployed not just in opposition to enemies of the ERA and their Republican backers, but to rivals within the women\u2019s movement \u2013 chiefly, Friedan. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/nora-ephron\" title=\"\">Nora Ephron</a> famously characterised it at the time, Friedan despised the younger Steinem and fumed at how she pulled the spotlight away from her. \u201cIt\u2019s her baby, damn it,\u201d wrote Ephron of Friedan, in Esquire. \u201cHer movement.

Mrs America, created by Dahvi Waller, a graduate of Mad Men and Desperate Housewives, does not, as Byrne says, \u201cshy away from the infighting\u201d, but it does have a pious air that at times buries the drama beneath a lot of strained sloganeering. \u201cThis is our Vietnam,\u201d says Steinem at one point, trying to impress the seriousness of her cause on a male politician. \u201cI didn\u2019t get anywhere in this life waiting on someone\u2019s permission!\u201d says Uzo Aduba as Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman elected to Congress, who stood as a candidate in the 1972 Democratic primaries.</p> <p>Byrne\u2019s performance is good enough to rescue most of her scenes.

Byrne has never met Steinem, who wasn\u2019t involved in the show, and found the experience nerve-racking. \u201cIt\u2019s hard when someone is still so active, and so present \u2013 trying to honour that, and also give a portrait of her.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the best parts of the show \u2013 apart from Blanchett\u2019s campy scenes \u2013 are when it turns its attention to shortcomings within the movement, particularly its racial bias towards white women. It has been rightly pointed out (by critic Doreen St F\u00e9lix in the <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/27/reviving-phyllis-schlafly-in-mrs-america\" title=\"\">New Yorker</a>) that the least well-drawn character is Shirley Chisholm, though Aduba does her best with a lot of empty, dutiful lines. But the show has a few other, more illuminating things to say about race. In one scene, set in an editorial meeting in the offices of Ms magazine, the sole black writer present tentatively brings up doing a piece on the dangers of tokenism, to be met with blank stares all round. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean us?\u201d says one of the white characters, and the woman is forced, weakly, to say no. As Byrne says, \u201cintersectionality wasn\u2019t even a word yet\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you\u2019re all together doing these big scenes \u2013 how fun that is, and such a pleasure. Not every job is like that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The depressing thing about many of the issues raised in the show, from abortion rights to division of labour within the home, is that they are still raging today. A week or so earlier, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/upshot/pandemic-chores-homeschooling-gender.html\" title=\"\">New York Times carried a piece</a> in which a survey revealed that, under lockdown, nearly half of men said they did most of the home schooling, while only 3% of women agreed. At the start of the pandemic, some states in the US moved to limit abortion rights as \u201cnon-essential\u201d treatment. \u201cYou understand why feminists are furious,\u201d says Byrne. \u201cWe\u2019re still talking about this? My God. When you realise, doing it \u2013 we\u2019re sitting around on the set and still talking about the same thing. It was very upsetting at times.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c11d7de5cd80af6ed794804d9e0088b022879fa1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c11d7de5cd80af6ed794804d9e0088b022879fa1/66_626_2817_3519/801.jpg\" alt=\"With husband Bobby Cannavale in Medea, this year.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With husband Bobby Cannavale in Medea, this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: New York Times/Redux/eyevine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Byrne and Cannavale\u2019s children are too young for school; the older one, her four-year-old son Rocco, does a weekly Zoom preschool class that, she says, inevitably descends into chaos.

They are an odd couple in some ways; Cannavale, who most recently starred in Martin Scorsese\u2019s movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/13/the-irishman-review-martin-scorseses-finest-film-for-30-years\" title=\"\">The Irishman</a>, and is a veteran of the TV show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/boardwalk-empire\" title=\"\">Boardwalk Empire</a>, is from Union City, New Jersey, and as a performer is as raucously energetic as Byrne can be watchful. When she was making the cocktail on the Fallon show, Cannavale was filming her on his phone and being driven insane by her precision and delicacy.</p> <p>The time at home, she says, has been a boon to them both. Before now, it has been rare for the couple to be in one city for long, unbroken periods of time. They travel frequently to Australia \u2013 where they are due to perform in a production of Arthur Miller\u2019s A View From The Bridge in Sydney at the end of the year \u2013 while Mrs America filmed in Toronto. It was a fun summer shoot, says Byrne, with a sorority of cast members that held firm after shooting ended. It reminded her of the vibe on Bridesmaids, which was written by and starred mostly women. \u201cIn both cases, there was an anticipation, most days, when you\u2019re all together doing these big scenes \u2013 how fun that is, and such a pleasure.

But it has been unbearable watching Broadway close down. \u201cBobby\u2019s lived here for so many years, and it\u2019s breaking his heart, seeing the theatre and how affected that community has been. Such a huge employer of so many people in New York, and so many of them our friends. He knows many people who\u2019ve been ill \u2013 people who\u2019ve recovered, and haven\u2019t recovered.

At 1pm,\u201d says Byrne, raising a hand absent-mindedly to her head. \u201cI look crazy.\u201d But she is grateful for the time she\u2019s getting to spend with her kids, and for being healthy and at home.

Those lives are disproportionately black folks\u2019 lives.

But since then that narrative has shifted dramatically. Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking black Democratic member of Congress, said Friday that the riots damaged the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar\u2019s chances of being picked as Biden\u2019s running mate due to her record as a prosecutor in the city.</p> \n<p>Clyburn has argued that Biden should pick an African American woman, which would certainly draw a sharp contrast with Trump.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think right now what you\u2019re seeing is black voters get to see how Donald Trump reacts to things like this. It\u2019s a reminder of his history, his history of calling on law enforcement to be more aggressive, to be more brutal in their enforcement of the law,\u201d said the Democratic strategist Brandon Davis. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Davis added: \u201cI think in the next several months this is going to continue to be front and center in the conversation. I think over that time period people are going to see how Joe Biden deals with these issues, how he reacts to these issues, and I think they\u2019ll get to see, again, where Donald Trump is.\u201d</p> \n<p>This is hardly the first time the country has had to grapple with the dynamics around an African American dying at the hands of the police, but Daughtry suggested that this may be its own unique flashpoint.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis feels different,\u201d Daughtry said. \u201cIt could be because the world is smaller and information travels more quickly. But I wonder if it\u2019s not the intersection of a president whose rhetoric and demeanor and actions have unleashed a part of America that\u2019s been hidden, underground and in the closet for decades.\u201d</p>",

About 8.4 million workers have been furloughed, tens of thousands have lost their jobs and many self-employed workers\u2019 incomes have taken a hit.</p> \n<p>Even the lives of those who are still in work may have changed dramatically. Working from home has become the norm for many, and employees at some firms have already been told this will carry on until at least the autumn. Meanwhile, physical distancing measures are likely to remain for many more months and a whole swathe of events, from holidays to festivals to weddings, have been cancelled. And behind all of this is a virus that can be deadly.</p> \n<p>With all of this in mind, it\u2019s possible your financial set-up no longer matches your lifestyle and needs. Guardian Money has put together a guide to getting everything in order as we all adapt to new ways of going about our daily lives.</p> \n<h2><strong>Reducing household costs</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>Wholesale <strong>energy prices</strong> have dropped as a result of factories and businesses being closed and demand for fuel falling across the world. The very cheapest dual gas and electricity tariffs cost \u00a3750 a year for a medium-sized house with average consumption. Households on their supplier\u2019s capped standard tariff will typically save more than \u00a3300 a year by switching. Tonik Energy\u2019s green super power v4 tariff is arguably the pick of the cheapest deals and it\u2019s fixed for a year. Prices have fallen so much that those on fixed deals bought before March should consider moving supplier too and pay any exit fees. Use <a href=\"http://energyhelpline.com/\">Energyhelpline.com</a> to find out what your household can save. </li> \n <li>Housing is likely to be your biggest outlay. If you have a <strong>mortgage</strong> and have taken a three-month payment holiday, you may be aware that on 22 May the government said people can extend this for a further three months (the first ones were due to come to an end in June). Meanwhile, those who are struggling but have not yet taken a mortgage payment holiday will have until 31 October to apply. However, there are also other options available to borrowers, either now or at the end of the holiday. Two of the main ones are temporarily switching to interest-only payments and increasing the length of the mortgage term. Both will reduce your monthly payments but there\u2019s a price to pay. For example, increasing the mortgage term will ultimately mean paying a lot more interest. </li> \n <li>Most local authorities are offering <strong>council tax</strong> payment holidays to those struggling but you have to ask for one, and there is no guarantee the answer will be yes. Those on universal credit or low incomes may be able to get their bill reduced, or in some cases waived. The amount of reduction depends on your circumstances and the council. On top of the discount, in England, you may also get an extra \u00a3150 off your bill, backed by a \u00a3500m Covid-19 hardship fund. </li> \n</ul> \n<h2><strong>Making up for lost income</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>You may be entitled to <strong>benefits</strong> to top up your earnings. Anna Stevenson from the advice charity Turn2Us says it is \u201cvery difficult to talk in specific sums because each household\u2019s claim is different, depending on the rent they pay and a host of other factors, including the number of children etc\u201d. The charity has <a href=\"https://benefits-calculator.turn2us.org.uk/AboutYou\">a benefits calculator</a> on its website, which will help you work out what you can claim.Households who receive working tax credits and whose annual income is expected to be more than \u00a32,500 different to the previous tax year should contact HM Revenue &amp; Customs and declare a change of circumstances, which should bring a change in payments. Stevenson says some people on working tax credits, which are typically no longer available to new claimants, may be better off switching to universal credit but they should use a calculator to check before they make a claim. </li> \n <li>Are you a higher earner with children who has suffered a drop in income due to the pandemic? If your income is set to be less than \u00a360,000, then get your <strong>child benefit</strong> restarted. It\u2019s worth \u00a31,820 a year for a family with two children. Under the high-income child benefit charge (HICBC), if you or your partner earn more than \u00a350,000 a year, the benefit is progressively clawed back through the tax system until it is worth nothing on incomes over \u00a360,000. Thousands of parents who opted out of receiving child benefit, or never started claiming in the first place, because they had to pay the HICBC will be eligible to claim or restart the payments. To restart child benefit, either fill in an online form or call <a href=\"tel:0300%20200%203100\">0300 200 3100</a>. For more information go to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-tax-charge/restart-child-benefit\">gov.uk/child-benefit-tax-charge/restart-child-benefit</a>. </li> \n <li>If your salary has dropped below \u00a350,000 as a result of the crisis, there could be \u00a3250 with your name on it, courtesy of the <strong>marriage allowance</strong>. This tax break lets one partner transfer \u00a31,250 of his or her personal allowance to their other half, thereby reducing that person\u2019s tax by up to \u00a3250 in the current tax year. You can claim it provided all of the following apply: you are married or in a civil partnership; one partner\u2019s income is below \u00a312,500, or nothing; and the other partner\u2019s income is between \u00a312,501 and \u00a350,000, or \u00a343,430 in Scotland. HMRC will typically give the recipient partner their extra allowance either by changing their tax code or via the self-assessment system.

Insurers generally won\u2019t let you pause your car insurance but you can cancel it and take a refund of the remaining months. You can tell the DVLA you are taking the car off the road with a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/make-a-sorn\">statutory off road notification (Sorn)</a> and cancel the policy. Check the savings and fees you will have to pay before you go ahead. You will also save the car tax for any full months it is off the road. But be aware that the vehicle has to be physically off the highway, on a driveway or similar. The big downside, of course, is that it will not be covered if it is stolen. </li> \n <li>Even if you still need a car, you may be using it less than when you bought your policy. Churchill and Direct Line are among the <strong>insurers</strong> offering refunds to drivers who are in this position. You need to get in touch with your new mileage during lockdown and they will give you cash back based on the difference between that number and the figure you declared when you bought the policy. Check if your insurer is doing the same. If it isn\u2019t but your policy is coming to an end, don\u2019t let it renew without adjusting the mileage you are paying for. </li> \n <li>If you no longer need a car you are buying on <strong>finance</strong>, you can hand it back, provided you have paid back at least half the money owed on it. Section 99 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 sets out how you can voluntarily terminate a regulated hire purchase or personal contract purchase (PCP) agreement. With a PCP, the buyer puts down a deposit, makes perhaps three or four years\u2019 monthly payments, and then a final balloon payment at the end of the term if they wish to keep the car. If you have paid half the value of the vehicle, you can ask for a voluntary termination. If you are near 50%, you can opt to pay the difference to get you there. You hand the car back and escape the rest of the payments. Be aware that no refunds are given if you paid more than 50%. Those with HP agreements can hand the car back sooner, typically halfway through the term, as there are no balloon payments. The <a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/cut-your-car-finance-hire-purchase-and-other-finance-costs#when-should-i-end-my-finance-deal-early\">Money Advice Service website</a> has some good advice on the process. A voluntary termination will show up on your credit file but should not negatively affect your <a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-to-improve-your-credit-rating\">credit score</a>, it says.</li> \n <li><strong>Bike</strong> sales have been soaring during the pandemic. You may want to consider buying a bike through your employer\u2019s cycle to work scheme, which will allow you to save 25-39% of the cost. Employees who sign up get a voucher, which they take to their local bike shop and use to buy their chosen equipment, including lights and clothing. The savings come through the fact that you don\u2019t pay income tax or national insurance on the purchase price. In reality, your employer buys a bike for you, and you \u201chire\u201d it back, making monthly payments from your gross (pre-tax) salary, typically over four years. Basic-rate taxpayers save a quarter on the cost of the bike and accessories. Higher-rate taxpayers save about 40%. Technically, the bike belongs to your employer until the end of the four years, at which point there is an ownership fee payable. Buy a decent lock and insurance, as the payments must still be made even if the machine has been stolen. You don\u2019t have to ride the bike to work to use the scheme but most new applicants will be planning to do just that. </li> \n <li><strong>Rail</strong> commuters who expect to carry on working from home can still apply for a rail season ticket refund, backdated up to 56 days. Passengers have to go back to the rail company that sold them it, either in person at the ticket office or online. Be aware that you will not get the cost of the annual ticket divided by 12, with each unused month returned. Refunds are calculated as the difference between the season ticket\u2019s cost, and that of the cheapest way to make the same journeys without it, using monthly, weekly or daily tickets. Use a refund calculator, such as<a href=\"https://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/help-and-contact/get-in-touch/coronavirus-refund-information\"> the one</a> from Southeastern. Some passengers have received in excess of \u00a32,500 back. </li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"522231a534ff172aa32810c8555c92908639f5ef\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/522231a534ff172aa32810c8555c92908639f5ef/0_0_1359_2552/533.png\" alt=\"money\" width=\"533\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">money</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Ryan Gillert</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Change the way you pay</strong><br></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>Millions of older people left trapped in their homes after the coronavirus struck found that without an online <strong>bank account</strong>, day-to-day banking has been near-impossible. Halifax said the numbers of over-65s signing up for online banking has jumped by 63% and their use of contactless has also soared. Santander says the over-55s have flocked online during the pandemic, with numbers up 54%. Signing up for an online bank account is relatively easy. You don\u2019t have to have a smartphone but it helps. If not, use a home computer instead. Either try your existing bank or set up an account with one of the app-based providers such as Monzo, Starling and Revolut. </li> \n <li>The pandemic and physical distancing have already forced many of us to adapt our <strong>payment</strong> habits. If you haven\u2019t already, check out <a href=\"https://paym.co.uk/\">Paym</a>, the free service launched in 2014 that allows you to send or receive money with any UK mobile phone number without sharing your bank details. Industry body Pay.UK says it is safe and efficient, with 15 banks and building societies offering the service, including all the big ones. Watch out for fake messages, which have recently been impersonating Paym and asking customers to follow a link to receive money.</li> \n <li>We are highly likely to see many businesses closing their doors for good because of the coronavirus. From a consumer point of view, remember that paying by <strong>credit card</strong> gives you added legal protection if the company you are buying from goes bust. If you use your credit card to buy something costing more than \u00a3100 and up to \u00a330,000, you are covered by section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. This means the card company has equal responsibility with the seller if the company you bought from fails. If you pay with a debit card, you might be able to make a claim later for a refund under the <a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-youre-protected-when-you-pay-by-card\">chargeback</a> scheme. This is an agreement the likes of Visa and Mastercard have signed up to. The card company will try to claim your money back from the company you have paid by reversing the transaction. Be aware that time limits apply for making a claim.</li> \n <li>Even though the lockdown is easing (with outdoor markets and car showrooms in England reopening from 1 June, and other non-essential retailers from 15 June), going to the <strong>shops</strong> is likely to remain a rigmarole. Physical distancing rules will restrict the number of people who can be in a store at any one time and shoppers will have to contend with closed changing rooms, restrictions on touching merchandise and one-way systems. If there are things you buy every time you go and you can afford to pay slightly more for them, you could consider looking into a subscription from an independent retailer. You can arrange regular deliveries of all kinds of foods, including ground coffee, cheese, bacon and wine. Away from the kitchen, some small book stores are offering to send you a book a month for a year. This is not likely to be a way to save money but will prevent you having to visit a shop and could help save a small business. </li> \n <li>Similarly, a <strong>milkman</strong> can help you cut out trips to the shops. Many deliver non-dairy substitutes as well as the traditional pint. The website <a href=\"https://www.findmeamilkman.net/\">Findmeamilkman.net</a> can help you find one that covers your area but it doesn\u2019t seem to be exhaustive so ask neighbours or use Google. Some of the larger companies such as <a href=\"https://www.milkandmore.co.uk/\">Milk &amp; More</a> carry other products, including bread, vegetables and drinks. </li> \n <li>In terms of <strong>returns and refunds</strong>, retailers have generally updated their policies since the start of the outbreak, allowing customers to return items after physical stores reopen and extending online returns periods. This is typically between one and two months. The consumer group Which? put pressure on laggard retailers, which were not being quite so generous. Your consumer rights are not affected by the disruption to retail caused by the outbreak, although refunds are taking longer to process as stores and their customer services staff buckle under the strain. </li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cc39d63feea95b7a65b3b0e6de10757b8075f1d0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc39d63feea95b7a65b3b0e6de10757b8075f1d0/0_0_1463_1508/970.png\" alt=\"hide\" width=\"970\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">hide</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Ryan Gillert</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Stashing your savings</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>While the coronavirus crisis has been a financial disaster for many people, the bald truth is that many others are feeling better off at the moment because they are spending so little. If that is you, now\u2019s the time to build a <strong>financial safety cushion</strong> with some of the money you have saved as a result of the lockdown. Financial planners typically suggest we need three to six months\u2019 worth of expenses as a <a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/emergency-savings-how-much-is-enough\">rainy day fund</a> but a study in 2018 found 70% of the UK\u2019s workers were \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/25/uk-workers-chronically-broke-study-economic-insecurity\">chronically broke</a>\u201d, with almost no proper savings. If you are lucky enough to have spare cash, channel it towards a savings account. The interest rate may not be great but by separating it from your everyday spending account, you will make it harder to access and force yourself to think twice before using the money. Check out <a href=\"https://moneyfacts.co.uk/savings-accounts/\">Moneyfacts.co.uk for the best rates on different types of accounts</a>. </li> \n <li>Rebuild your <strong>pension</strong> with some of that money you are not spending. According to adviser Kirsty Stone of The Private Office, if you are in your mid-40s and can afford to put an extra \u00a3100 a month into your pension, it could be worth an extra \u00a342,000 in terms of your pension pot by the time you are 65. If you can set aside an additional \u00a3250 a month, it could be worth an extra \u00a3100,000, using standard assumptions. You could also contact your HR department at work and ask them to increase the contributions that are taken from your pay. That way, you will receive either 20% or 40% tax relief, depending on your pay. If you are fortunate, you may find your company offers an additional voluntary contribution (AVC) scheme where it will match or partially match whatever you put in. But remember it\u2019s a pension so you can\u2019t access the money until you are at least 55. </li> \n</ul> \n<h2><strong>Catastrophe planning</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>Make sure you have a <strong>will</strong> and it is up to date. Check in with older relatives too. The majority of Britons haven\u2019t made a will. However, some trade unions offer members free will-writing. So do several charities, including Cancer Research and the British Heart Foundation. These will work if your family setup is quite straightforward. If your financial or family situations are at all complicated, it will be worth paying for legal advice. Use the Law Society website <a href=\"https://solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk/\">solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk</a> to find a local solicitor. </li> \n <li>With foreign holidays and many other trips on hold, those lucky enough to have a garden will be spending a lot of time in it this year so it is not surprising that people are flocking to garden centres to invest in their outdoor space. But if you are splashing out on expensive barbecues, patio furniture and children\u2019s play equipment, dig out your <strong>home insurance</strong> to check you are covered. The average British garden contains \u00a31,457 worth of valuable items, according to MoneySuperMarket. But financial information firm Defaqto says about 10% of home insurance policies did not cover items left in the garden as standard. Of the policies that do offer cover, many have low limits for these items, typically \u00a31,000 or less, as outdoor space cannot be secured in the same way that a home is. Minimise the risk by bringing items inside or storing them in a locked shed or garage, where possible. If you have had to splash out on new technology to teach the kids, make sure your kit is covered by your home insurance policy. Lots of home insurance will cover all but the most expensive equipment as a matter of course but check the small print in case you need to increase your cover. If you are a renter and have never bothered to buy insurance for your belongings before, it may be worth doing so now. The price comparison sites will help you find a policy that suits you. </li> \n <li>The pandemic and its fallout have prompted many people to take another look at how much <strong>life insurance</strong> cover they have, with some companies saying many more younger people are buying it. Straightforward life insurance is still widely available and nearly all policies, even those taken out today, will pay out if the death is due to coronavirus. Note that the price rises steeply as you get older. We obtained a quote from Aviva this week where the cost was \u00a38.42 a month for a 37-year-old seeking a payout of \u00a3100,000 should they die in the next 15 years. But if the person was 57, the premium shot up to \u00a345.22 a month.</li> \n <li>If your concern is about losing your job and not being able to pay the monthly bills, things have become a lot tougher. Many of the big price comparison sites that sell insurance have stopped providing quotes for <strong>unemployment cover</strong>. You can in theory still obtain income protection cover that pays out if you become sick with coronavirus. We got quotes for an office worker aged in his mid- to late 30s, on an income of \u00a340,000 a year, which would pay an income of \u00a31,650 a month for the next 12 months. LV=, Royal London and Legal &amp; General all came back with quotes at about \u00a320-\u00a322 a month. It\u2019s crucial to check what the minimum amount of time is that you would have to be off sick to get a payout. Most policies don\u2019t cover short periods of illness \u2013 the minimum period can be a month, or a lot longer \u2013 so you would probably have to be ill with coronavirus for a very long time to get a payout.</li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a1579f1bf1bca83376d6cf83d335f648f95e3ae\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a1579f1bf1bca83376d6cf83d335f648f95e3ae/0_0_959_2746/349.png\" alt=\"Coron\" width=\"349\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coron</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Ryan Gillert</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Other spending</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>Review <strong>memberships and subscriptions</strong> to check you can still afford to pay them and are getting what you want. Some organisations, such as the Barbican arts complex in London, have already told their members they will be able to extend their membership by the length of the closure for free. Most gyms have frozen memberships while closed, with no fee to pay until the clubs reopen. With some teetering on the edge of bankruptcy and no guarantee there will not be another lockdown later in the year, you may want to opt for monthly payments rather than paying for a year upfront. David Lloyd, which has 100 tennis and racquet clubs in the UK, is gradually reopening but only for outdoor tennis. It has decided to maintain its freeze on membership fees until its clubs are fully open but has not announced what will happen next. The National Trust is a charity and is keen for members to continue to donate to support its work. It says for a limited period only, it is letting members have a 25% discount when they renew their annual membership. </li> \n <li>Parents who use government schemes to get tax breaks on nurseries, childminders and after-school clubs will have been accruing money in their accounts while not being able to use those services. Insurer Royal London estimates \u00a318m could be sitting in tax-free <strong>childcare accounts</strong>. This is money parents can withdraw if they need it. The older childcare vouchers cannot be refunded but if you have this type of account, you can suspend payments while you are not using it. To stay in the scheme, you need to start them again within 52 weeks. </li> \n</ul> \n<h2><strong>The new workplace</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>If you are going to be <strong>working from home</strong> for several more months, as seems to be the case for many of us, it\u2019s vital you have the right equipment, such as a suitable chair and desk, to ensure a healthy and productive work environment. <a href=\"https://www.iwfm.org.uk/resource/iwfm-research-hygiene-concerns-leave-thousands-anxious-about-return-to-the-office.html?parentId=8CBD03AD-C979-4553-AB9AAA1F0AB1081A\">Research</a> from the Institute of Workplace and Facilities Management earlier this month found just under a quarter (24%) of the employees it questioned had a separate home office, with almost two-thirds (64%) resorting to makeshift workstations on dining room tables, sofas and beds. Some employers are going as far as couriering a van full of kit to their home-working staff, while others are doing little or nothing. Royal Bank of Scotland said this month it will distribute additional gear such as office chairs, folding desks and screens to those who need it. Meanwhile, the BBC said staff can apply for an interest-free loan of up to \u00a3250 (with repayments deducted from net salary), which they can use to buy modest equipment to help them work from home more comfortably. Ask your employer what it can do to help you. Which? has <a href=\"https://www.which.co.uk/news/2020/04/coronavirus-9-tips-for-a-healthy-and-effective-lockdown-home-office/\">published a helpful list of tips</a>, which also includes recommendations for home office chairs and desks.</li> \n <li>You may be able to claim <strong>tax relief</strong> for your job expenses now that you are working from home. You can typically only claim for things that are solely related to your work \u2013 for example, business phone calls or the extra cost of gas and electricity for your \u201coffice\u201d area. You can\u2019t claim for things you use for both your work and in a private capacity, such as your broadband. Accountants Blick Rothenberg point out HMRC allows employees who don\u2019t already complete a self-assessment tax return to make claims of up to \u00a32,500 on employment-related expenses incurred in a tax year by using form P87. Check out HMRC\u2019s website for more information. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/tax-relief-for-employees\">gov.uk/tax-relief-for-employees</a> page includes sections on working from home and buying substantial equipment that you have to have to do your work. This page on form P87 may also be useful.</li> \n <li>Is your home <strong>broadband</strong> up to scratch? Don\u2019t put up with a shoddy service. If yours is limping along at the moment, there are things you can do. You may want to ask your existing provider whether it can upgrade you to a faster fibre package without any loss of service or the need for an engineer visit. And there are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/11/boost-broadband-speed-during-lockdown-wifi-internet\">various tips and gadgets</a> that might help. Switching broadband provider is of course an option, and may be the best bet for some. Most people won\u2019t require a home visit from an engineer. Comparethemarket.com recently said there had been considerable demand for faster broadband packages since the lockdown restrictions began.</li> \n <li>In terms of other homeworking costs, try to make use of the <strong>technology</strong> available for business calls and meetings \u2013 Zoom, Skype and so on \u2013 rather than racking up phone costs that, with all the chaos, you may never get around to claiming back.</li> \n <li>Strictly speaking, everyone should probably notify their <strong>buildings and contents insurer(s)</strong> if they are going to be working at home for a while \u2013 particularly if they have bought expensive new gear to help them do their job. Similarly, you are responsible for checking that working from home will not cause any problems with your mortgage or tenancy agreement.</li> \n</ul>",

  "<h2>British Airways: Dear Britain</h2> <p>You have to pity British Airways. The airline has always sold itself to us with a simple deal: we give it money, and it flies us somewhere nice. But now that Covid-19 has robbed us of the latter, BA has been forced to come up with a brand new USP. And what it has landed on is this: British Airways loves you more than the other boys do. No, really. Its Covid ad is formed of an open letter to the country, in which various socially distanced members of staff say how proud they are of us. We\u2019re coping well with lockdown, they say, and they\u2019ll be waiting to take us on holiday again soon.

  "<p>Gun owners are putting their metal where their manhoods are in a bizarre trend that sees men courting danger to prove how well they can manage a gun.</p> <p>Those participating in the meme do so by pointing their gun at their genitals with the safety off, placing their finger over the trigger, and posting a photo of it on social media. And voil\u00e0, just like that \u2013 proof they are <em>very</em> manly.</p> <p>It was first assumed that the gun owners were embracing the risky pose as a way of trolling progressives. The author and storyteller Dylan Park, who originally reposted the images in a viral tweet, summed that theory up as follows: \u201cTo everyone asking why, I\u2019m not 100% sure. But I think the thinking here is \u2018Guns don\u2019t kill people, people with guns kill people so we\u2019re going to point them at our dicks to prove how safe they are\u2019 or something,\u201d he said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dyllyp/status/1264993857613164544\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Now these MAGA dolts are pointing guns at their dicks with the safeties off and their fingers on the trigger to own the libs.

As the Facebook page Gun People Who Hate Gun People <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GPWHGP/posts/3172305442832643\">explained</a>: \u201cIt\u2019s actually to upset people who think trigger discipline is important.\u201d</p> <p>While it\u2019s not unusual to see gun owners commending others for their gun-safety knowledge online \u2013 using the safety catch, not pointing the gun at anything they don\u2019t want to shoot and not putting the finger on the trigger until they want to shoot \u2013 it appears that their vigilance has upset other hobbyists.</p> <p>\u201cThe uninitiated zero in on dumb shit like [safety] because it\u2019s their entire knowledge base. It\u2019s the only thing they understand,\u201d said the moderator of a Facebook group named Shit Gun Normos Say (normo being a word pejoratively applied to people who stick to rules or norms with fervor).</p> <p>\u201cCongratulating people for keeping their finger in the right place is like congratulating somebody for not wrapping their seatbelt around their neck, or for not shitting their pants in public,\u201d the moderator added <strong> </strong>in a confounding explanation that simultaneously manages to make light of practicing safety precautions while joking about how stupid it would be to brag about not wearing a seatbelt.</p> <p>By this logic, those who put themselves in the most dangerous position are the only ones who can <em>really </em>prove how brave they are. Just think about it like cycling through a red traffic light at an intersection with no handlebars, or setting your house on fire just to prove you can get out. It certainly is one way of looking at the world.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 June 2020 because an earlier version misnamed the Facebook page Gun People Who Hate Gun People, as Gun Owners Who Hate Gun Owners.

  "<p>Poggio Mirteto, Cantalupo, Casperia, Vacone, Configni, Stroncone. Hilltop towns in the ancient land of Sabina, calling to each other across parched patchworks of vineyard and cornfield. Woods, orchards, olive groves. You could drive to these places, of course. But my experience is, when you arrive on foot they are different. They are better. And best of all in summer.</p> <p>You\u2019ll need water with you at all times for this adventure. A light backpack with just one change of clothes. Trekking shoes on your feet, poles in your hands, sweat-wicking shirts and shorts and underwear. Plus a broad-brimmed hat, shades and a big tube of sun cream. Then just surrender yourself to the heat and the cicadas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8a38d2298367c6e1bb25edcd3d351df04bbcacba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a38d2298367c6e1bb25edcd3d351df04bbcacba/0_0_1478_1016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Italy travel map\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The start is simple enough. An hour\u2019s rattly train ride north-east beside the Tiber, from Rome\u2019s Tiburtina station to Poggio Mirteto Scalo. Then a four-mile climb, cross-country, to Poggio Mirteto proper. This will get you used to the idea that every place you\u2019re going to arrive at in the coming days is at the top of a long, steep slope. In fact, <em>poggio</em> means little hill. I remember a chalky track between dry thistles so tall their thistledown waved above our heads. You enter the town through a narrow stone arch perched above a sheer drop. Already you can look down and feel satisfied.</p> <p>The key to walking in heat is to start before dawn and ease into it. So check out Poggio the afternoon you arrive, then early to bed and wake at five. Piazza Martiri della Libert\u00e0 is dustily decorous, more an elongated, tree-lined oval than a square. Creamy baroque church at one end and austere brick cathedral at the other. Pretty facades, patches of green. A vigorous yucca tree thrusts out of 15th-century masonry. At the elegant tables of <a href=\"http://www.torrefazionecaffegentili.it/\">Caff\u00e9 Gentili</a> you can practise ordering a first <em>cedrata</em>. Made from Calabrian <em>cedro</em>, a large yellow citrus fruit, and served in a small bottle that you pour yourself on to crackling ice, this drink is sharp, thirst-quenching ecstasy. You\u2019ll be needing it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f31f05b9c99649531205ea5d6a83e6cc933226c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f31f05b9c99649531205ea5d6a83e6cc933226c2/780_209_4477_2688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Poggio Mirteto.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poggio Mirteto.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valerio Mei/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One last requirement. It\u2019s hard to find detailed paper maps in Italy. Nor is the countryside thick with fingerposts pointing the way. If you\u2019re going to avoid the roads, you need a hiking app to find the paths \u2013 they\u2019re easily available. And it\u2019s wise to plan at least the start of each day\u2019s route the night before; then, when you close the door of your B&amp;B at an ungodly hour, you\u2019ll know where you\u2019re going.</p> <p>There\u2019s a special intimacy to slipping out of medieval walls while it\u2019s still night. Thankfully, the day starts downhill. The deep shadows of the trees are furtive and fresh, the grass dewy, air balmy, and all around an atmosphere of quiet vegetable pressure toward the splendour of the rising sun.</p> <p>Which comes all too soon. Towards seven the light is suddenly sharp over a stand of feathery bamboo. It\u2019s warming fast. At a corner, an enormous agave plant waves grey-green tentacles. Sunflowers raise their heads. In the orchards the peaches begin to glow. Then around 8:30, as if a switch were tripped, the cicadas begin. One strikes up in a tree right above, a rasping rhythmic whir, then another and another and another, until a harsh, hypnotic chorus fuses with the now oven-hot air in one vast summery stupefaction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cf5c3dd5d6b99ff7f062984176d925a9eaabbb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cf5c3dd5d6b99ff7f062984176d925a9eaabbb4/53_0_5314_3192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The undulating terrain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The undulating terrain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victor Harris/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We\u2019re walking north here, in a broad, undulating valley, through fields of scorched stubble watched from towers and castles on the hills each side. At the end of the valley is the larger town of Terni, two days away, offering the option of a train back to Rome. But if you have appetite and energy, it\u2019s just another two days north to Todi, taking in the grand Roman ruin of Carsulae and the pretty town of Acquasparta. Then perhaps another two west to Orvieto. Or north to Perugia and the upper Tiber valley. My partner and I did this walk as part of a longer trip, following in the footsteps of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Garibaldi\">Garibaldi</a> when he tried to march an army from Rome to Venice after the collapse of the liberal Roman republic in 1849. This segment seemed the most intensely Italian, and the least known.</p> <p>But this morning\u2019s first goal is Cantalupo. You have to lift your head to see it, a mass of piled muddled stone rising from gnarled trees far above. The slope is scandalously steep. But the pleasure of these days lies in an intensity of contrasts: first the sweat and strain, then the solace each small town affords. The water fountain by the ancient gate. The coolness in dark churches and resiny smells under gnarled pines. Fortunately, it\u2019s rarely more than three hours\u2019 march between one settlement and the next. You\u2019ll be in Cantalupo\u2019s main square in ample time for freshly squeezed orange juice, cappuccino and croissant, under sunshades, surrounded by a blaze of potted oleanders. It would never have felt so good had you arrived by car.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When Garibaldi passed this spring in 1849 it was dry, and his men, mules and horses went crazy with thirst</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We had set our sights on Vacone as a place to stay, taking time out for lunch in Casperia, another climb to another miracle of the middle ages paralysed in the day\u2019s blue dazzle. Then our app let us down: a path petered into nothing. We turned back. It was past evening when we tackled a rutted track that climbs a thousand feet. There\u2019s a stone trough here, set in the cliff beside the path, and the words of an ode that the poet Horace wrote, more than 2,000 years ago, in praise of the water that springs from the rock. \u201cO fountain of Bandusia!\u201d When Garibaldi passed in 1849 the spring was dry and his men, mules and horses went crazy with thirst.</p> <p>Our water was finished too. But we were almost there. The track turns into cobbled alleys, then a broad terrace beneath an ancient clock tower. Vacone. Two women were sitting on the parapet, a vast sunset panorama behind them. Was there anywhere to stay, we asked. No. Was there a cafe? No. Really, no cafe? There was a bar, they said, that opened after dinner, \u201cFor the men to play cards.\u201d And a tiny grocery.</p> <p>I mention this moment to warn you that you should decide before setting out whether you are up for a night in the open. Whether to take a light tent, perhaps. We had one, but Eleonora, my partner, had read that there were wolves in these hills. Of course no one has been killed by a wolf in Italy for more than 200 years. Wild boars and dogs are more likely encounters. But the imagination is a terrible thing. Wry and generous, the two women phoned all their friends and relatives. Did anyone know anyone who had a place to stay? Children ran back and forth. The grocery provided beer and mozzarella. Finally a B&amp;B was found, another 40 minutes\u2019 walking, in the dark.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b81d255182f3bcd7151c3ce61e590ee5d93f3f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b81d255182f3bcd7151c3ce61e590ee5d93f3f1/0_185_5890_3534/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Casperia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Casperia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valerio Mei/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On arrival, every day, you must plunge your walking clothes in the sink and wash them at once. They\u2019ll dry in the night and be ready for the dawn. In bed you feel your body glowing, ripe with summer sun.</p> <p>Some towns offer evening entertainment. Carmina Burana on the steps of a Duomo. A beauty contest under a <em>loggiato</em>. In one village a magician. In another a one-man band. And yes, there are artworks to look at along the way. If you must. A fine San Sebastiano, for example, cheerfully resigned to his arrows above the altar of a tiny church on cobbled streets heading to Configni. But this holiday is not about frescoes and monuments; rather, it\u2019s about the pleasure of eating <em>cappellacci</em> with radicchio and <em>robiola</em> cheese behind bead curtains in Configni\u2019s one osteria. Then the fragrance of lavender and mint as we plunge back down to the valley; the elegance of the bulrushes and the blue of the cornflowers; the distant braying of a donkey.</p> <p>Vacone to Terni via Configni and the magnificent Stroncone is 27 breathtakingly beautiful, backbreakingly arduous kilometres. There\u2019s a stream to ford, with slimy stones under your toes. At burning midday, in a lane sunk between high banks of bush and bramble, near a place called Coppe, you may stumble upon the miracle of a <em>lavatoio</em>, two long stone basins for washing clothes, brimming with dark water. If you find it, take off your socks and shoes, sit on the edge and plunge in your burning feet. A plaque on the wall beside says that <em>per fatale disgrazia</em> \u2013 through fatal misfortune \u2013 Virgilio Giusti died here in 1948, aged 18, in the flower of youth. Italians love these sad memorials, flowers forever refreshed at the point where a foot slipped or lightning struck. There will be a name, a date, a few words. They spin a sticky web of sentiment across the landscape, and remind you, as this whole trip should, how lucky you are to be alive in a world where there is Italy and summer and freedom.</p>",
  "<p>It is November 2019, 10 weeks since 19-year-old Harry Dunn was killed, and his four parents are distraught. Charlotte, Tim, Bruce and Tracey say that some mornings they can barely get out of bed, never mind begin to mourn. \u201cYou wake up and you\u2019re just a complete wreck, and nothing you can do is processed without thinking of Harry,\u201d says his mother, Charlotte Charles.</p> <p>She and Harry\u2019s father, Tim, split up when he was 10 months old; six months later, Tim was with Tracey, and Charlotte was with Bruce. Both couples were parents to Harry and his twin brother Niall, and the families have always been close. \u201cThe last three or four days have been the worst for me,\u201d Tim says. \u201cI\u2019m struggling. Every time I see his face I start crying.\u201d</p> <p>Harry died on 27 August 2019 after being hit by a car driven by Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US government employee; her husband had just started working at an intelligence base in Northampton. The Sacoolas family had moved to the UK only a month earlier, and lived three miles away in a village called Hinton-in-the-Hedges. As Sacoolas pulled out of RAF Croughton, a former British base run by the Americans since 1950, she smashed into Harry\u2019s motorbike. He lived long enough to make a statement to the police that Sacoolas had been driving on the wrong side of the road \u2013 something she has never denied.</p> <p>The family expected Sacoolas to talk to them about what had happened \u2013 however painful it would have been, it would have provided some comfort. They felt for her: two of her three children had been with her in the car when Harry was flung from his motorbike into her windscreen. Perhaps they could even help each other come to terms with the tragedy.</p> <p>But that never happened. In September, Sacoolas returned to the US, claiming diplomatic immunity, and Harry\u2019s family became less forgiving. They wanted her to face the appropriate criminal charge in the UK: causing death by dangerous driving.</p> <p>Two months on, they seem sick and dizzy with all that has happened. In the short time since Harry\u2019s death, they have appeared on TV shows in Britain and the US, calling for Sacoolas to face justice. In October, they were even summoned to the White House to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/19/harry-dunn-parents-trump-white-house-visit-anne-sacoolas\">meet Donald Trump</a>. None of the parents have been able to return to their jobs yet. Tim is a maintenance man at a local school; Bruce is a site foreman; both Charlotte and Tracey are administrators in local GP surgeries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"15f120192d9923e0a0dd0054c0904b60e25c7a4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15f120192d9923e0a0dd0054c0904b60e25c7a4f/0_0_3543_3160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Dunn at his 19th birthday party in 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"892\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Everybody loved him\u2019: Harry Dunn on his 19th birthday last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of the Dunn family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We meet at Tim and Tracey\u2019s house in Banbury, Oxfordshire. All four are warm and welcoming, and it takes a while to sort out who is who. The living room is small, so Tim sits on the stairs. Charlotte, the youngest at 45, does most of the talking. Tracey is the quietest; Tim says she is having a particularly bad day. All four seem to divide life into bad days and very bad days. Above the sofa is a wall filled with black and white family canvases \u2013 grandparents, Tim and Tracey, Tracey\u2019s children and, in the centre, Harry and Niall.</p> <p>The Dunns and Charleses are not really two families, but one big one. They have six children in total: Harry and Niall from Charlotte and Tim\u2019s marriage; two boys from Bruce\u2019s first marriage; a girl and boy from Tracey\u2019s first marriage. From a very young age, Harry and Niall\u2019s time was spent between their two homes. Towards the end of his life, Harry and Niall didn\u2019t simply split the week, they often divided days \u2013 breakfast with one lot, tea with the other. Harry was an outgoing, confident 19-year-old. \u201cEverybody loved him,\u201d Tim says. He learned how to code and built his own PC from scratch at the age of 14. At college, he studied IT and gaming.</p> <p>Tim introduced him to their local football club, Northampton Town, and they were season ticket holders. But most of all Harry loved motorbikes. \u201cHe had his first one when he was seven,\u201d Charlotte says. Bloody hell, whose idea was that? \u201cHis!\u201d Charlotte points to Bruce. Did the others have no say?\u201d All four laugh. \u201cNo, nobody had a say. Harry always made up his own mind,\u201d Tracey says. He saved and saved \u2013 Christmas money, birthday money, pocket money \u2013 until he could afford a junior motorbike. He went on to travel the country, clocking up 50,000 miles in his short life.</p> <p>***</p> <p>It was Tim who first heard Harry had been involved in a crash. \u201cThe local fireman who was at the scene is a friend. I shot straight up there. I had visions of him just being bruised. Even when I saw him with broken bones in the ambulance, it didn\u2019t enter my head that he was going to die.\u201d The accident happened at 8.30pm. Tim was there by 8.50pm. Was Sacoolas there? \u201cI didn\u2019t see her. Maybe she was in a police car.\u201d</p> <p>Harry lived for 90 minutes after he was hit. \u201cAn hour and a half,\u201d Charlotte says quietly. \u201cHe made a statement on the side of the road, with his face down in the ditch, that she was on the wrong side of the road.\u201d</p> <p>Do they think Harry knew he was dying? </p> <p>\u201cI think probably not,\u201d Charlotte says. \u201cHis injuries were horrific. You hope that the shock element may have taken a lot of the pain away. When Tim got there, they were just about to sedate him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey were giving him blood. There were six or seven people working around him on a stretcher,\u201d Tim says, struggling with the memory.</p> <p>\u201cHearing his dad\u2019s voice would have calmed him down a lot,\u201d Charlotte says.</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t really speak back to me. He was struggling with his breathing. I said, \u2018Harry, it\u2019s your dad, I\u2019m here for you, please do what they say.\u2019\u201d Tim was with Harry for 10 or 15 minutes before he was put in the ambulance and taken to the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford. \u201cHe was panicking. I said, \u2018Harry, let them take you, it will make you better.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Was he calm himself? \u201cYes. I had to be for Harry. Everybody was telling me he\u2019d pull through.\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte and Bruce went to pick up Niall; Tim called for Tracey; and the family followed him to the hospital. \u201cWhen you go to A&amp;E and you get shown to the family room and you\u2019re kept away from everybody, you start thinking \u2013 even though you don\u2019t want to believe it,\u201d Tim says. \u201cThen, within 10 minutes of getting there, the doctor came in and told us they couldn\u2019t save him. Godawful\u2026\u201d Tim splutters to a stop.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"587edccdf54c94424fdae6eb3902d91c36a03952\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/587edccdf54c94424fdae6eb3902d91c36a03952/0_34_1000_648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Dunn (left) with his mother and twin brother Niall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry (left) with his mother and twin brother Niall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: family handout/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Charlotte says she made a pledge that night. \u201cI promised Harry we would make sure the driver of that vehicle was brought to justice. We had no idea how hard that would be \u2013 but if you make a promise to your children, you don\u2019t break it.\u201d</p> <p>At that point, she had no reason to suspect this wouldn\u2019t come easily \u2013 or that their son\u2019s death would become an international incident. Their plan was to campaign for better road signage outside the US intelligence base; they hoped Sacoolas might join them. But when she and her family left the country three weeks later, they realised it would be a very different fight.</p> <p>Northamptonshire police told the family that Sacoolas was no longer in the UK on 26 September, 11 days after she had left. According to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-secretary-update-to-parliament-on-harry-dunn-case\">a statement made by foreign secretary Dominic Raab</a> to parliament in October, the US embassy had informed the Foreign Office (FCO) of the accident the day after it happened, asserting Sacoolas\u2019s right to immunity as the wife of an RAF Croughton employee. Raab told MPs that the FCO had asked for this immunity to be waived at the time, and again when the US refused and said Sacoolas would be leaving the country imminently. They were informed that she had left, Raab said, on 16 September.</p> <p>The foreign secretary admitted in parliament that when officials passed on the news to the police investigating Harry\u2019s death, they asked them to delay telling the family \u2013 \u201cso that we could agree the next course of action\u201d. Astonishingly, Raab went on to blame the police, \u201cas the primary point of family liaison\u201d, for the fact that Harry\u2019s parents spent another 11 days in the dark. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Her kids have got to be suffering. Harry made a mess of her windscreen, and one of her children was sitting in the front</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Unsurprisingly, Harry\u2019s parents were furious. There was a meeting of the extended family \u2013 about 35 people \u2013 to discuss a plan of action. They were joined by a retired lawyer, Radd Seiger, who lived locally and whose children had gone to school with Harry and Niall. Bruce\u2019s 31-year-old son Ciar\u00e1n began <a href=\"https://uk.gofundme.com/f/Justice4harry\">a GoFundMe page</a> to pay for a formal campaign. Seiger, a tough, bullet-headed American, offered to be the family adviser and spokesperson. Within days, they were on the front pages of the tabloids, sitting on breakfast TV sofas, meeting Raab and preparing to fly to the US. Before long, everyone in the country knew about the death of Harry Dunn.</p> <p>His parents believe Sacoolas and her family were removed by the US government; it is impossible to know how much say she had in that decision.</p> <p>\u201cThe Americans pulled them out, didn\u2019t they?\u201d Tim says.</p> <p>\u201cShe would have done what she was told to do,\u201d Charlotte says. \u201cBut she\u2019s still a human being, and can stand up and say, \u2018No, I need to do what\u2019s right by my family.\u2019 She\u2019s got children. How is she explaining all this to her kids \u2013 that your mum\u2019s on the run? That\u2019s why we didn\u2019t want her behind bars in the first place.\u201d Anne and Jonathan Sacoolas have three young children, believed to be between the ages of four and 11.</p> <p>\u201cHer kids have got to be suffering,\u201d Charlotte says. \u201cHarry was a big lad. He made a complete and utter mess of her windscreen, and one of her children was sitting in the front. They have got to be extremely traumatised. So how can you, as a mum, just take your kids back to where they come from and not try to explain to them? That\u2019s what we don\u2019t understand as parents.\u201d</p> <p>Tim says he wishes Sacoolas\u2019s children had not been in the car.</p> <p>\u201cI wish they hadn\u2019t as well,\u201d Charlotte says. \u201cWhen we found out she was a mum, we said we would work with the police to try to get her a suspended sentence. That\u2019s the sad thing about it. If she\u2019d stayed here and faced it all, she\u2019d have probably been back in the States anyway.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a3aeaf32bc5c77ac0404f6fdba40645ba2db669\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a3aeaf32bc5c77ac0404f6fdba40645ba2db669/0_392_5906_3545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Dunn's parents, Tim Dunn (on left) and Charlotte Charles, with his stepfather, Bruce Charles (centre), in May 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t believe our darkest hours have come\u2019: Harry\u2019s mother with his father, Tim, and stepfather, Bruce (centre).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Burke/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The family feel betrayed \u2013 by the police for yielding to the FCO, by the FCO for yielding to the US Department of State, and by the Crown Prosecution Service for failing to charge Sacoolas. Her husband has a degree in electrical engineering and they were told he worked at the base as an electrician \u2013 which would make them unlikely candidates for diplomatic immunity.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s never had immunity,\u201d Tim says. \u201cHow can she? Her bloke\u2019s just an electrician at the base. I\u2019m not being funny. He\u2019s not a diplomat, she\u2019s not a diplomat.\u201d The UK government has never commented on the nature of Jonathan Sacoolas\u2019 work, simply reiterating that its hands were tied by an existing agreement between the two countries.</p> <p>Again, Charlotte says, this doesn\u2019t add up. \u201cIf you were covered by diplomatic immunity, why would you leave the country you are protected in?\u201d</p> <p>In early October, they visited Raab, and came away with more questions than answers. They claim that he told them he was still asking the Americans for a waiver when he already knew it was too late.</p> <p>What offended them most was his dismissive manner. \u201cWe went to his private office,\u201d Tim says. \u201cThere were four of his people there. Raab sat right at the end. And it was just an awful meeting. He wasn\u2019t sincere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHis body language was wrong,\u201d Tracey says. \u201cWe sat in a line, and he was sat opposite, and his body was turned to the side, away from us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was very rude,\u201d Charlotte says.</p> <p>Did they tell him that?</p> <p>\u201cYes. I said we were disappointed and felt the government had let us down,\u201d Tim says. \u201cWe all had a lot of tears afterwards.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a4ff20e6d22e3f8299a3c68878557e6410cbc47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a4ff20e6d22e3f8299a3c68878557e6410cbc47/153_143_4524_2714/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left: Bruce and Charlotte Charles (Harry Dunn's mother), their lawyer Radd Seiger and Tim (Harry Dunn's father) and Tracey Dunn after a meeting with Dominic Raab in October last year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Bruce and Charlotte Charles, their lawyer Radd Seiger and Tim and Tracey Dunn after a meeting with Dominic Raab in October last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thomas/i-Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few days after meeting Raab, the four parents travelled to the US. \u201cWe were going to let everyone know that one of their own had killed our boy, then gone home and not faced any consequences,\u201d Bruce says. On their second day, just after appearing on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/14/harry-dunns-parents-say-they-will-only-meet-anne-sacoolas-if-she-returns-to-uk\" title=\"\">Gayle King show on CBS</a>, Seiger received a call from the White House, telling them to get there as soon as possible.</p> <p>You were told, not asked?</p> <p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t given much choice,\u201d Charlotte says.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a case of, \u2018Get your arses down here\u2019,\u201d Tim says.</p> <p>It was a three-hour train journey from New York to Washington DC.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t go to see the president if there\u2019s nothing wrong. If they\u2019ve done everything by the book, they wouldn\u2019t even entertain us, would they?\u201d Tim says.</p> <p>At the time, none of them had a strong opinion about Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re not into politics,\u201d Charlotte says. \u201cHe was very gracious, very welcoming. But it wasn\u2019t long into the conversation that he dropped the bombshell that Anne Sacoolas was in the next room. He obviously wanted that photo opportunity \u2013 to be able to put her and us together, and show the world that he\u2019d smoothed everything over.\u201d</p> <p>Trump had turned the family\u2019s search for justice into something resembling a reality show. The president appeared to believe that the privilege of meeting him would make up for the loss of a beloved son. But the four parents refused to see Sacoolas.</p> <p>What did Trump say? \u201cHe just kept trying. Three times, he tried. I spoke for about five, six minutes, looked into his eyes. I said, \u2018If it was your son, you\u2019d be doing the same. We\u2019ve accepted it was a road traffic collision, she didn\u2019t purposely go out of her way to kill our boy. But the fact is she did, and she\u2019s not in the UK to face justice.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte told Trump that if they were to meet Sacoolas, it would have to be with mediators and therapists present, and that everybody would have to be prepared \u2013 including Sacoolas. \u201cTo be thrown together, how on earth are you meant to deal with that as a human? We don\u2019t know how we would have reacted to seeing the woman who killed our boy.\u201d Her voice rises and her eyes well up. \u201cYou can\u2019t have that just thrown at you.\u201d</p> <p>There were reports that Trump had attempted to pay them off. Was he really ready to get his chequebook out? \u201cWe\u2019re not sure,\u201d Charlotte says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether that was a slip of the tongue. He turned to Robert O\u2019Brien, head of the National Security Agency. He said to O\u2019Brien, \u2018We\u2019ve been speaking to our finance department.\u2019 So, yes, we heard the word finance, but we thought that, because Trump is a bit of a plonker, he meant the Foreign Office. It didn\u2019t register with us at the time that he may have actually meant money.\u201d</p> <p>The family are appalled at the idea that they could be paid off. \u201cIf anyone had any doubts where that was concerned, our ears would have pricked up at that word \u2018finance\u2019, and they would have got rid of us by now. But we\u2019re not there for that.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Diplomatic immunity is not a get-out-of-jail-free card. You don\u2019t get to skip a country when you take somebody\u2019s life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I ask how they are sleeping.</p> <p>Tracey: \u201cNot very well.\u201d</p> <p>Bruce: \u201cIf we get a couple of hours, that\u2019s about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnce a week, you may get a good night because you are so exhausted,\u201d Tim says. \u201cPersonally, Harry\u2019s still the last thing I think about at night, and when I wake up, he\u2019s the first thing. I think it\u2019s going to be for a long, long time.\u201d</p> <p>As I get ready to leave, Charlotte says they know they need professional help. \u201cWe hope that we get the opportunity to start some counselling.\u201d She says she has been surprised by the inner strength they have discovered: \u201cBut I don\u2019t believe our darkest hours have come \u2013 because we haven\u2019t gone there yet.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Six weeks later, on 20 December, Sacoolas is charged by the CPS with causing death by dangerous driving. Her US lawyer immediately issues a statement saying she will not return to the UK voluntarily. \u201cAnne is devastated by this tragic accident and continues to extend her deepest condolences to the family,\u201d the statement says. \u201cAnne would do whatever she could to bring Harry back. She is a mother herself and cannot imagine the pain of the loss of a child. She has cooperated fully with the investigation and accepted responsibility\u2026 This was an accident, and a criminal prosecution with a potential penalty of 14 years\u2019 imprisonment is simply not a proportionate response.\u201d It\u2019s an extraordinary argument: despite accepting responsibility for Harry\u2019s death, she will not return to the country because she believes the jail sentence she could face is disproportionate. But on 10 January, the CPS formally requests her extradition.</p> <p>There have been other developments. It has emerged that Jonathan Sacoolas was an intelligence officer rather than an electrician at RAF Croughton, although the FCO has not confirmed this. In February, the Mail on Sunday reported that Anne Sacoolas, a fluent Russian speaker, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7982191/Fugitive-American-wife-Anne-Sacoolas-wanted-death-Harry-Dunn-CIA-spy.html\" title=\"\">was an intelligence officer</a> herself \u2013 and a much more senior official than her husband. The following day, former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt tells Sky News that Sacoolas\u2019 links to the CIA \u201cmay have a bearing\u201d on the US refusal to extradite her. \u201cIt is totally and utterly unacceptable that she is not facing justice in the UK,\u201d he says. A photograph emerges of Sacoolas filling her car at a petrol station in Virginia. I am due to catch up with the family, but Seiger tells me they are struggling and not up to talking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"377015d3e501803f87d7c53a926dda2fd4134d3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/377015d3e501803f87d7c53a926dda2fd4134d3e/0_36_1935_2327/832.jpg\" alt=\"Anne Sacoolas in Virginia, in February 2020\" width=\"832\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anne Sacoolas in Virginia, US, in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie Wiseman/The Daily Mail</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Britain goes into lockdown, the Harry Dunn story disappears from the front pages. Meanwhile, the family prepare to apply for a judicial review of the decision to let Sacoolas leave the country. They will argue in court that the American did not have diplomatic immunity, and that allowing her to leave without the knowledge of the investigating police force was unlawful.</p> <p>In 1995 and 2001, the US and British governments signed pre-waivers agreeing that if staff with diplomatic immunity at RAF Croughton committed a crime, that immunity would automatically be waived. However, the agreement made no mention of spouses \u2013 which appears to be an oversight. Now both governments are arguing that, under the Vienna convention, the international agreement regulating treaties between states, Sacoolas has full immunity because the waiver neglected to mention spouses.</p> <p>Seiger argues that this is a perverse reading of the convention, even if you accept Sacoolas was a spouse rather than a spy. \u201cHow can dependants have greater immunity than the personnel? And even if you have immunity, Vienna makes it absolutely clear that diplomats should respect the laws of their host country. It is not a get-out-of-jail-free card. In the 21st century, in the United Kingdom, you don\u2019t get to skip a country when you take somebody\u2019s life. But the governments are asking these parents to just walk on by, and say, \u2018Oh well, Harry\u2019s gone, nothing to see here, move on\u2019. I\u2019m sure the Americans want to pay them a lot in compensation. But these parents are not going to be bought off.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>By early May, Harry Dunn is back in the news. Interpol has issued a red notice: a request to law enforcement worldwide to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/11/interpol-red-notice-issued-for-arrest-of-anne-sacoolas\" title=\"\">find and arrest Sacoolas</a>, pending extradition. In other words, she can\u2019t leave the US. The Labour party calls for a parliamentary inquiry; shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy says the family\u2019s campaign has \u201chighlighted a string of unforgivable failings by a government they rightly believed should have been there to support them\u201d. Their local MP, Conservative Andrea Leadsom, writes to Raab suggesting three penalties if the US continues to refuse to extradite Sacoolas: sanctions, expelling diplomats and closing RAF Croughton.</p> <p>When I catch up with Charlotte and Bruce on a WhatsApp video call, it is nine months since Harry died. They are meeting Tim in Seiger\u2019s large garden, where it is easy to adhere to rules on social distancing while having their photographs taken. There is some semblance of normality in their lives: Bruce, Charlotte and Tracey are working part-time (which is why Tracey can\u2019t be here today), and Tim is doing voluntary deliveries while his school is shut.</p> <p>But they look every bit as broken as they did in November. Charlotte says lockdown hasn\u2019t affected them much. \u201cAfter losing Harry, we voluntarily self-isolated. We didn\u2019t want to go anywhere or do anything. We didn\u2019t go to the supermarket, we didn\u2019t go to the pub, we didn\u2019t go out for meals, we didn\u2019t go to friends\u2019 houses. Being at home is our safe place. The only difference is that it gets much more difficult to distract yourself from losing the plot.\u201d</p> <p>The family did start counselling before lockdown, but Charlotte says it may be too early for her. \u201cWe\u2019ve only done one deep trauma session so far, but I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone for three or four days afterwards. You unearth so much you\u2019ve buried.\u201d A couple of months after Harry died, she and Bruce got a couple of dachshunds. \u201cThey\u2019ve helped. I love them to bits. Harry had been pestering us for years to get a dog. When you lose somebody who was your world, you quickly learn not to put things on hold \u2013 that life is too short.\u201d</p> <p>The biggest difference since we last talked, she says, is that the family have become angrier. A week before, Niall had sent an email to Boris Johnson asking him to make a personal intervention, because the family believes Raab \u201chas lost control of this scandal\u201d. He concluded: \u201cI love and miss Harry. I am sick and tired of seeing my mum and dad suffering. It was bad enough losing Harry. But watching them go through this torture is just awful. It\u2019s just cruel.\u201d At the time of going to press, Niall had not received a response from the prime minister. Bruce tells me that his two sons from his first marriage, Michael and Ciar\u00e1n, are struggling and have been signed off work.</p> <p>The family have met Raab four times now. \u201cHe admitted in the last meeting he\u2019d been too guarded in the previous meetings,\u201d Charlotte says. The family hoped this was a sign of progress, but are now convinced that Raab\u2019s energies are focused on encouraging the family to withdraw their legal challenge. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d started building bridges but, in hindsight, they were just trying to soften us,\u201d Charlotte says.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Raab and the FCO insist they are doing their best to have Sacoolas extradited. An FCO spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cWe have deep sympathy for Harry\u2019s family. We have done and will continue to do everything we properly can to ensure that justice is done. As the foreign secretary set out in parliament, Anne Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity while in the country under the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations. We consistently called for Anne Sacoolas\u2019 immunity to be waived before she left the UK<strong>.</strong> Both the prime minister and the foreign secretary have been clear with the US that the refusal to extradite her amounts to a denial of justice, and that she should return to the UK.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ea0d304df04b30ea8dd2af61711420e7925b9e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ea0d304df04b30ea8dd2af61711420e7925b9e1/0_382_5267_3161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Dunn (right) and his twin brother Niall at a family barbecue, aged four.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry (right) and Niall at a family barbecue, aged four.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of the Dunn family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The family believe these are empty words. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the Foreign Office asked for immunity to be waived before she left,\u201d Tim says when I call him. \u201cIf they did, they certainly never showed us any evidence of it.

I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve got the slightest idea of how much extra pain they are putting us through.\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte is convinced a judicial review will find that Sacoolas should not have been allowed to leave the country. Does she think Sacoolas was an intelligence officer at the time of Harry\u2019s death? \u201cProbably. People within Washington have said that she was working for the CIA while she was here. We know she\u2019s been working with the state department for something like 17, 18 years. Trump actually mentioned in one of his speeches that she works for the government.\u201d</p> <p>Footage emerges on ITV News At 10 of Raab meeting US ambassador Woody Johnson at an embassy reception on 12 September, three days before Sacoolas left the country. Sources at the FCO have told ITV that Raab did not know about Harry\u2019s death at this point, which contradicts the foreign secretary\u2019s October statement to parliament. Then, Raab told MPs that \u201cthe US embassy&nbsp;notified us\u201d&nbsp;of the incident on 28 August, and that the FCO had asked the US to waive immunity on 5 September. Last month the family discovered a foreign office briefing note, also seen by the Guardian, copied to Raab\u2019s private secretary and dated three days after Harry\u2019s death, that outlined the accident and expressed concern over the potential for negative headlines.</p> <p>Since we last spoke, the family\u2019s lawyers have uncovered a phone text from&nbsp;senior diplomat Neil Holland, then the FCO\u2019s director of protocol,&nbsp;to his US embassy counterpart, stating: \u201cI think that now the decision has been taken not to waive [immunity], there\u2019s not much mileage in us asking you to keep the family here. It\u2019s obviously not us approving of their departure but I think you should feel able to put them on the next flight out\u2026\u201d The note was dated 14 September, a day before Sacoolas and her family left the UK.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/28/family-of-harry-dunn-to-bring-private-prosecution-against-dominic-raab\">Family of Harry Dunn to bring private prosecution against Dominic Raab</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The family believe they have been misled about who knew what, and when, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/28/family-of-harry-dunn-to-bring-private-prosecution-against-dominic-raab\">and this week decide to launch a private prosecution against the foreign secretary</a>.

In normal times, no one would expect a Conservative government to proactively care about a world that consistently rallies opposition to it, and which \u2013 up late, non-conformist, possibly on drugs \u2013 is the antithesis of middle England. But given live music\u2019s cultural and economic heft (\u00a31.1bn annually), you might imagine that in a national emergency, culture secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/24/the-world-looks-to-british-theatre-so-lets-get-it-back-on-track\">Oliver Dowden</a> would feel grudgingly obliged to support it.</p> <p>Instead, the message is: you\u2019re on your own.

The <a href=\"https://saveourvenues.co.uk/#/\">Music Venues Trust\u2019s Save Our Venues</a> campaign has removed 156 venues from its critical closure list. But 400 remain on it.

To raise money, they are hosting livestreamed gigs and DJ sets, selling merchandise and bar tabs or raffling-off vinyl, artwork and tickets, with some success.</p> <p>However, framing this as a heroic struggle between music fans and The Man feels delusional. Community activism will be necessary to save venues. If you care, have connections or skills, or can donate to help, there will be opportunity over the next year. But as Covid-19\u2019s economic fallout spreads, as furlough ends and unemployment spikes, how many people will be able to defer ticket refunds or buy charity compilations on Bandcamp?

A state of alarm was declared two days later, the country locked down. \u201cI\u2019m a tsunami, taking everything with it, but after a day the tsunami was stopped,\u201d says the 52-year-old, who made his way into management via amateur clubs starting in the mid-90s, having made little impression as a player.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f67c452ab35023ecc4aa4aa2a7582bf85d89ac13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f67c452ab35023ecc4aa4aa2a7582bf85d89ac13/0_74_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Sandoval, in his club mask, watches his Fuenlabrada players go through their paces in training\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Sandoval, in his club mask, watches his Fuenlabrada players go through their paces in training.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CF Fuenlabrada</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fuenlabrada\u2019s players didn\u2019t come back until 11 May, two months on, and even then it was for individual sessions, arriving and leaving in their kits, not allowed to loiter or gather together. La Liga hopes the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n can return on 12 June but full training won\u2019t begin until this coming week. Competition will get under way without Sandoval seeing them play a game. They return in 13th, just four points above the relegation zone (though also just seven off the play-offs). Yet one thing is clear: the enthusiasm.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this has happened to anyone, ever,\u201d he says. \u201cMy first task was to win them over from home, empathise. \u201cI asked for a video of the good moments this season, edited it and put it to music. They went into lockdown having not won in 13 and I didn\u2019t want that lingering. I wanted positivity. We\u2019ve been working towards that idea for nine weeks.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You do a Zoom call and the same guy always connects first. Some exercise with their kids clambering on their backs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe had a programme to maintain strength and avoid injuries and created a daily structure so their biorhythms didn\u2019t change: up at nine, breakfast, connect. They had to send a photo of their scales: by 9.15 every day, I had everyone\u2019s weight. The idea wasn\u2019t to police them, but show we\u2019re with them, they\u2019re not alone. We had group sessions every morning, then the two fitness coaches rang half each in the afternoon, reporting back every night. I called them all individually: long chats, asking how they\u2019re getting on, their families. You don\u2019t have that relationship managers have built with players but you get to know them.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, Sandoval says, he might know them even better than under normal circumstances. \u201cYou\u2019re talking every day, you chat before each session: jokes, what politicians are up to now. Some managers wouldn\u2019t need all that but I\u2019d only just arrived. I watched them work. You see things: how they position the camera, how they interact. You do a Zoom call and the same guy always connects first. Some exercise with their kids clambering on their backs. A cat walks past the camera. Someone\u2019s doing press-ups and the dog licks his face. That tells you about personalities, sensibilities, and gives you ways of reaching them which are helpful.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted them to have a dose of reality too. I asked the doctor, who works in a hospital and is close to them, to connect after being in ICU. Show them there are people on the front line, this isn\u2019t a story. Every day people are dying, as if two or three planes are falling out the sky. That helps motivate them: \u2018We\u2019re stuck at home, sure, but that\u2019s as bad as it\u2019ll be.\u2019 And it works in reverse too: when things improved, I rang the doctor: \u2018Tell them the truth, there\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel. Don\u2019t give up, nearly there. It\u2019s been worth it.\u2019</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and thebiggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks</figcaption> </figure>  <p>&nbsp;\u201cThey returned in good shape, physically and mentally and the last two weeks have been so enriching.\u201d There\u2019s a laugh. \u201cThey\u2019re exactly as I thought.

  "<p>In his 1998 book <em>On Hunting</em>, Roger Scruton defended the unspeakable in pursuit of the uneatable. In his last, now posthumously published book, the philosopher who died in January stands up for the unbearable responsible for the insufferable. The unbearable? The megalomaniac, narcissistic, antisemitic monster Richard Wagner. And the insufferable? The life-hating curse on the senses that was his last opera.</p> <p>So at least argued Nietzsche, who damned Wagner\u2019s <em>Parsifal</em> with the histrionics only a former devotee can muster. \u201cParsifal,\u201d he snarled in the essay \u201cNietzsche Contra Wagner\u201d, \u201cis a work of perfidy, of vindictiveness, of a secret attempt to poison the presuppositions of life \u2013 a <em>bad</em> work.\u201d</p> <p><em>Parsifal</em>, which received its premiere at Bayreuth in 1882, unfolds in an unsavoury twilight milieu of death, curdling blood and toxic sex. The castle of Montsalvat is home to a community of grimly celibate knights who guard the Holy Grail, a chalice holding the blood of Christ collected after the crucifixion, along with the Holy Lance with which he was pierced. Their depressive leader, Amfortas, has an agonising and suppurating thigh wound that won\u2019t heal \u2013 just like Henry VIII\u2019s, if not as smelly. His ailing father Titurel, selfishly, declines to die, but hangs on so he can savour the sight of Christ\u2019s blood that is ritually unveiled before the faithful.</p> <p>Amfortas\u2019s wound was caused when a self-castrated magician called Klingsor seized the Holy Lance and stabbed him with it. Klingsor earlier gelded himself so as not to fall prey to the sexual desire that would distract him from his project of seizing the grail for his drearily power-crazed purposes. He controls a bevy of flower maidens whom he weaponises to lure knights from their vows of chastity. He has also ensnared the opera\u2019s most interesting character, Kundry, a self-loathing seductress with a shameful past (she laughed at Christ\u2019s crucifixion), whom he deploys to destroy his foes with sex.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0eb558648fd4d12ca2ae79c901e4349f856d8a21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0eb558648fd4d12ca2ae79c901e4349f856d8a21/0_155_2507_3132/800.jpg\" alt=\"Amalie Materna as Kundry, Emil Scaria as Gurnemanz, Hermann Winkelmann as Parsifal at the premiere of Parsifal in Bayreuth, 1882.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amalie Materna as Kundry, Emil Scaria as Gurnemanz, Hermann Winkelmann as Parsifal at the premiere of Parsifal in Bayreuth, 1882.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Into this crypto-Christian bedlam, strolls our eponymous hero, a Siegfried-like simpleton, making his entrance slaughtering a swan for kicks. It is this bird-murdering oaf on whose hopes the future of this community of knights depends.</p> <p>And yet from this unpromising cast and dramatic material, Scruton convincingly suggests that <em>Parsifal</em> is not so much an infection corrupting its listeners as an antidote to our ills \u2013 even in the 21st century. He regarded <em>Parsifal</em> as an allegory of the Gospel story of Christ, with the twist that we can redeem ourselves and in so doing, effectively, become mini-Christs.</p> <p>This third and final of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/apr/12/classicalmusicandopera.artsfeatures1\">Scruton\u2019s analyses</a> of Wagner\u2019s operas \u2013 the first two were <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/may/01/highereducation.news\">Death-Devoted Heart</a></em> on <em>Tristan und Isolde,</em> and <em>The Ring of Truth</em>, his superb analysis on the Ring cycle \u2013 shows Scruton\u2019s obsession with a composer whose loathsome views were typified by the fact that he tried to get Hermann Levi, a Jew, to convert to Christianity before conducting <em>Parsifal</em>\u2019s premiere. It took Wagner\u2019s patron \u201cMad\u201d King Ludwig to broker a deal whereby Levi conducted without getting baptised first.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His lifelong obsession with so dubious a character as Wagner may seem symptomatic of Scruton\u2019s own poisonous conservatism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His lifelong obsession with Wagner may well seem symptomatic of Scruton\u2019s own poisonous brand of elegiac conservatism. That said, this short book is a bracing corrective to Nietzsche\u2019s account of the opera. In doing so, Scruton recycles some of his favourite themes, namely the difference between the sacred and the profane, sexual pollution and the redemption desperately needed by our spiritually degenerate society. Scruton writes: \u201cIn our polluted passions, seeking pleasure and excitement rather than respect and love, we scorn the Redeemer\u2019s suffering and surrender to the basest form of control.\u201d</p> <p>But we can revivify the sacred conception of how we ought to live. For Scruton, Wagner \u201crightly insists\u201d that \u201ca person can be godly without the belief in God\u201d. At the heart of Wagner\u2019s opera, this book suggests, is the idea that our real task as humans is to take on the burden of another\u2019s suffering without any expectation of reward. Amfortas, Klingsor, Kundry and the rest are too mired in their own woes and machinations to do so. Parsifal, sibling to the blond beast Siegfried from Wagner\u2019s <em>Ring</em> tetralogy, is what we need, not just to redeem ourselves but to redeem the Redeemer whose self-sacrifice the grail knights have forgotten. He is the \u201cinnocent outsider, perhaps free from specific religious beliefs but with a heart open to the Redeemer\u2019s message\u201d.</p> <p>The most freighted scene comes in the second act, in which Kundry attempts to seduce this innocent outsider. Sex, for Scruton, has long been the fraught nexus of the erotic and the sacred, an existential zone wherein if you\u2019re doing it right you exalt the other, but if wrong, embark on mutually assured pollution. Apart from drawing him into some pretty dismal views on homosexuality, and a reactionary perspective on the sanctity of marriage, this leads Scruton into a worry about how sex is used as power when it should be sacred communion.</p> <p>When Kundry kisses Parsifal in Klingsor\u2019s magic garden, she uses sex both to corrupt him and, paradoxically, to win redemption through wooing a chaste man who will resist her, thus lifting the curse. Of all kisses in the operatic canon, this must be the most semiotically dense, sexually weird, not to mention hopeless.</p> <p>No wonder some critics have seen Kundry as serving not just Klingsor but Wagner\u2019s hidden sexist agenda. The opera\u2019s only substantial female character is<strong> </strong>conceived of as existential succubus, evil magician\u2019s sex missile, and self-divided ruin of a human being.</p> <p>Matters get even stranger in act three in which Parsifal, after years of wandering, returns to Montsalvat on Good Friday, now a fully fledged grail knight. He is the personification of compassionate godliness, to which we should aspire. Kundry washes his feet and he baptises her. Then he turns his attention to Amfortas, whose still terrible pains pique his compassion. He touches the wound with the Holy Lance and, miraculously, it heals. The community is revived and revitalised by this act. The Grail is brought out and opened. The knights kneel down, Kundry dies peacefully. In some productions of the opera, a dove is lowered on a string to hover above Parsifal\u2019s head as the music swells to a conclusion.</p> <p>What are we to make of this? Scruton writes: \u201cThrough compassion the Redeemer made a gift of himself and we, by following that example \u2026 renew the world, which flowers like the meadows on Good Friday.\u201d It\u2019s a plausible interpretation of what Wagner attempted, but not one that would have induced Nietzsche to return to the Wagnerian fold. Disenchanted with Wagner, he fell for Bizet\u2019s <em>Carmen</em> since the Frenchman\u2019s music was everything the German\u2019s was not \u2013 light, loveable, healthy.</p> <p>Yet if you listen to the opera, as I did while writing this review, you can find in it something other than the Christian message Scruton excavates or the life-rejecting toxicity Nietzsche revolted against. Debussy called its music \u201cincomparable and bewildering, splendid and strong\u201d. Not so much a curse on the senses, then, as an enchantment of them.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Wagner\u2019s Parsifal: The Music of Redemption is published by Allen Lane (RRP \u00a320).

He is abusing the past to distort the present, in order to control the future. But the past is not as malleable as Fox News.</p> <p>The symmetries between the past Kushner seeks to exploit and the discreditable present are striking. If there is any resemblance of the Trump mutation of the Republican party to any actual party in the election of 1856 it is not to the Republicans. Nor is it to the Democrats. Rather, it is to the third party in that campaign, the American party, also known as the Know Nothings, who also had a concise platform.&nbsp;</p> <p>The original American party sought to protect the purity of white native-born Protestants from the first great wave of immigration to the United States, which consisted mostly of the Irish and Germans, and to stigmatize a subversive religion.</p> <p>\u201cAmericans must rule America,\u201d its platform proclaimed. Only native-born citizens should be allowed to hold any public office, federal, state or municipal. Catholics, described in the category of those pledging \u201callegiance or obligation of any description to any foreign prince, potentate or power\u201d, were to be proscribed.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Know Nothings emerged from the crack-up of the Whig party over the issue of the extension of slavery in the territories. Most regarded themselves as Old Whigs, \u201cconservatives in principle\u201d in the words of their party platform. Their standard-bearer was Millard Fillmore, the last Whig president, a decorous figurehead. The Democrats nominated James Buchanan, a northern man of southern sympathy, a distinguished former senator from Pennsylvania, the crucial swing state.</p> <p>Abraham Lincoln, a lifelong Whig, forged the Illinois Republican party in 1856 out of a cacophony of contending factions, including radical abolitionists, Whigs, dissident antislavery Democrats and liberal German immigrants. Lincoln despised Know Nothingism.</p> <p>In 1855, he wrote that if the movement ever won power it would rewrite the Declaration of Independence: \u201cWhen the Know-Nothings get control, it will read \u2018all men are created equal, except negroes, and foreigners, and Catholics.\u2019 When it comes to this I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretense of loving liberty \u2013 to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy.\u201d</p> <p>Behind the scenes, Lincoln worked to undermine the Know Nothings, break up their party and bring some of its former Whig adherents to his new cause. In order to hold together their fragile coalition, Lincoln in Illinois and Republicans nationally advanced the singular goal of prohibiting slavery in the territories.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate in 1856, John C Fremont, was a famous western explorer and senator from California. Both the \u201cAmericans\u201d and the Democrats mounted vicious smear campaigns against him: that he was not native-born but of foreign birth, illegitimate and a secret Catholic. \u201cTrial by mud,\u201d his wife Jessie Benton Fremont called it.</p> <p>Two years later, running for the Senate, Lincoln declared that immigrants who believe in the Declaration of Independence\u2019s precept that \u201call men are created equal\u201d are \u201cour equals in all things \u2026 as though they were blood of the blood, and flesh of the flesh of the men who wrote that Declaration, and so they are.

  "<p>I was on the phone to a friend recently, blathering away as usual, when I realised that there was no one on the other end of the line. How long ago had this happened? I checked my phone and discovered, to my horror, that the call had ended almost five minutes ago.</p> <p>In the pub with another friend, not long after this incident, I asked how self-obsessed she thinks I am \u2013 a question only self-obsessed people ask, along with our other hobbies: stalking ourselves on social media and planning our own funerals. Without deliberation, she concluded that I was an 8.5 out of 10. \u201cOK\u2026\u201d I reeled, deeply offended. \u201cBut I ask about you too, right? I am a good friend?\u201d Quickly, the subject was changed.</p> <p>That night, I lay in bed, thinking only of myself, and did an audit of my life. Yes, I recently gave up on therapy because I\u2019m so happy to talk to anyone I know about my feelings that it seemed a waste of money. But I get deeply irritated by those people who sit next to you on a flight and ask where you are going just so that they can give you a monologue about themselves for an hour. How could I talk about myself too much when I find others who do so annoying? I feel certain that, were I forced, I could go at least a week without talking about myself.</p> <p>At 28, I lie squarely within what Time magazine called the <a href=\"https://time.com/247/millennials-the-me-me-me-generation/\" title=\"\">\u201cme me me generation\u201d</a>, after collecting data that showed millennials are more narcissistic, entitled and fame-obsessed than any other cohort of society. I feel this acutely as a writer who is often paid to write about myself for a living. My most successful contemporaries are the millennial female journalists who have, with a bit of clever personal self-branding, modelled themselves into semi-<a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/media/2019/oct/20/caroline-calloway-writers-journalists-social-media-influencers\" title=\"\">influencers</a>: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/15/dolly-alderton-memoir-interview-everything-i-know-about-love\" title=\"\">Dolly Alderton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/11/jia-tolentino-i-like-to-write-about-instincts-that-are-in-some-way-good-and-in-some-way-dangerous-\" title=\"\">Jia Tolentino</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/12/we-so-rarely-hear-from-women-in-the-grip-of-addiction\" title=\"\">Cat Marnell</a>. \u201cI owe a lot of my career to the fact that my temperament, my self, and my life all map well and easily on to the persona-based internet,\u201d Tolentino recently told the Guardian.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just my generation that is more self-obsessed. Using magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, researchers at the Harvard University Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Lab <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-neuroscience-of-everybody-favorite-topic-themselves/\" title=\"\">have found</a> that talking and thinking about ourselves is accompanied by high levels of activity in the areas of our brain associated with motivation and reward.</p> <p>Social media has made us less attuned to what is going on around us, too. The average internet user <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/433871/daily-social-media-usage-worldwide/\" title=\"\">spends</a> two hours 24 minutes on social media daily; and receiving \u201clikes\u201d for content we post about ourselves is associated with increased dopamine, the neurotransmitter that makes us feel good.</p> <p>According to Kate Murphy, who has spoken to hairdressers, CIA agents and priests who take confession for her book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/13/youre-not-listening-kate-murphy-review\" title=\"\">You\u2019re Not Listening: What You\u2019re Missing And Why It Matters</a>, we are not totally to blame: our modern age encourages self-involvement and, particularly, the prioritisation of talking over listening. We\u2019ve all been guilty of waiting for an opening in the conversation just so we can have our turn to speak, but Murphy argues that, recently, things have got out of hand.</p> <p>In schools, debate, rhetoric and presenting are all taught, but not listening. At work, we are told to be leaders or \u201cgirl bosses\u201d, while those who make it in their professions invariably end up giving a Ted Talk. At home, we bark orders at Siri and Alexa, at the same time filtering out different viewpoints on social media, leaving us in an echo chamber.</p> <p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ve noticed the same things you mention about yourself,\u201d Murphy says in a soft Texan accent, when I call to ask why she wrote the book. \u201cWe feel the need to advance our own agenda to sell ourselves, we\u2019re distracted by technology and we\u2019re consumed by what\u2019s going on in our own heads.\u201d</p> <p>Murphy quotes the famous book written in 1936 by Dale Carnegie, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/07/100-best-nonfiction-books-how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people-dale-carnegie-donald-trump\" title=\"\">How To Win Friends And Influence People</a>. \u201cYou can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.\u201d</p> <p>After my friend\u2019s character assassination in the pub, I wondered later that night what I would gain from talking about myself less, and resolved to do the unthinkable: avoid any mention of myself in conversation. (I did this experiment long before social distancing guidelines were in place, although it would have been a lot easier if I\u2019d had the \u201cmute mic\u201d button I have in isolation.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>After two hours, the conversation does eventually turn to me. I am offended that it took so long, but I do not let on</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is a Monday evening and I am at a dinner party, fidgeting in my seat but holding my tongue. I have decided that for my first attempt at not talking about myself, this event will be perfect. I don\u2019t know most of the people here: fewer friends means fewer people likely to notice that I am being unusually generous in the conversation.</p> <p>When I arrive, I pour myself a glass of wine and start throwing questions out into the room. A Greenpeace activist tells me about their planned expedition in the Antarctic. A comedian tells a very entertaining story about a recent gig where she was trapped on a lesbian cruise ship for a week. So far, so normal. Suddenly, an hour has passed and I find that because I am not talking, but listening, I have much more time and headspace to think of funny quips to respond to other people\u2019s anecdotes. I am hilarious. Funnier than the comedian.</p> <p>After two hours, the conversation does eventually turn to me. I am offended that it took so long, but I do not let on. Someone tells me that they read my book <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/queer-intentions-9781509866175.html\" title=\"\">Queer Intentions</a><em>,</em> which is part memoir (quelle surprise!) and part reportage, exploring LGBTQ+ rights across the west. They ask about the research process and I deflect the question by talking about the people in it: \u201cEveryone I interviewed was absolutely incredible. So fascinating, so honest.\u201d But it comes across feigned, like a Miss World acceptance speech.</p> <p>I leave the room before I can be probed further, excusing myself to help the host wash up in the kitchen. Over the pans, he asks me how I\u2019ve been doing. I can\u2019t resist. I explode with my recent gossip like a dam bursting. Out of the floodgates pours an entire monologue about a holiday romance, segueing seamlessly into a rant about searching for a flat. The washing-up is finished long before I am. I couldn\u2019t last one evening. I may have a problem.</p> <p>Seeking answers, I contact <a href=\"http://www.drcraigmalkin.com/blog\" title=\"\">Dr Craig Malkin</a> online. He is a Harvard psychologist who has written two books on narcissism, one of them so popular that it ended up in Oprah\u2019s book club. Narcissism, he tells me, is on a spectrum. Everyone has some narcissistic traits, he says, but a narcissist is someone who lets it govern their personality. When it tips over into a problem, he says, is when you have narcissistic personality disorder (NPD). These people exhibit what Malkin calls the triple E: they are so driven to feel special that they will <em>exploit</em> other people; they are so <em>entitled</em> they think other people should bend to their will; and <em>empathy impairment</em> can make them blind to the feelings of others, usually to the detriment of personal relationships.</p> <p>Being a narcissist is different from being self-obsessed, says Malkin, because you could be self-obsessed for any number of reasons, short- or long-term \u2013 from having obsessive compulsive disorder or anxiety, to being really stressed about preparing for your wedding. Narcissists inherently think they deserve more attention and are always comparing themselves with others. We can spot one, Malkin says, when it feels like \u201cgetting ahead comes over getting along\u201d.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t seem like who I am \u2013 I just really like the sound of my own voice \u2013 and yet I feel a strange pang of sympathy for narcissists. \u201cI have been looking at the reviews of your book and notice that one calls it \u2018terrifying\u2019, and that the Oprah book club review said it would help you to \u2018protect yourself against narcissists\u2019,\u201d I tell Malkin. \u201cDo we think narcissists are getting a bad rap?\u201d Potentially, he says, explaining that we are more prone to NPD if our parents are narcissistic, or if we do not experience loving parenting with set boundaries. Plus, in extroverted NPD \u2013 present in a certain type of more outgoing, disordered narcissist \u2013 men are twice as likely to be diagnosed as women, probably because \u201cwomen are discouraged from, and punished for, being too loud, outgoing or attention-seeking, and men are rewarded for it\u201d.</p> <p>So, narcissism is both innate and conditioned, he says; thus it\u2019s not really your fault if you are one. Besides, \u201cThere are many narcissists whom you can invite into a loving, secure relationship and they have some flexibility, and if you teach people with NPD how to relate to people when they are feeling scared, vulnerable or sad, the narcissism drops.\u201d That is why Malkin is able to help people with NPD: once identified, it is to some extent treatable. Overall, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s not bad to be a narcissist\u2026 not as a value judgment.\u201d</p> <p>By Wednesday, I have become much more focused on my task. I meet a close friend for lunch and, with therapist levels of Zen, I offer him the floor, enjoy my food and listen. Within 20 minutes, he tells me about problems with his partner that have been going on for a year \u2013 something he had never mentioned before, partly, he admits, because he isn\u2019t very good at talking about his feelings, but also because I never gave him the space. After work, I go for a drink-slash-meeting with a colleague \u2013 in which, admittedly, I talk about myself because it\u2019s a meeting about my work \u2013 but I do make an effort to talk about myself <em>less.</em> And so she begins to tell me about her love life. Over the course of two drinks, I feel we progress from colleagues to something closer to real friends. Create more silence, I notice, and people will start to fill it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A lot of the time people are thinking of what witty, wonderful thing to say next.

I wonder whether this counts as bad listening or good listening, rude or engaged.</p> <p>After a while, I start to drift into thinking about a delivery that hasn\u2019t arrived, my next meal, another date I went on with someone else, but catch myself and take note of my poor attention span. My wandering mind leads me to accidentally put my sleeve in my dinner, and I am frustrated that I can\u2019t use a dazzling anecdote to redeem myself.</p> <p>At the end of the date she says, \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve talked this whole time. What about you?\u201d We can talk about me next time, I say, feeling smug and mysterious for maybe the first time ever.</p> <p>I call Murphy and tell her I\u2019ve been struggling to be a present listener. Thankfully, she assuages my guilt. \u201cBecause we\u2019re social animals, we want to be liked,\u201d she says. \u201cSo a lot of the time, people are spinning the wheel, thinking about what witty, wonderful or intellectual thing they want to say next. But, as a result, you miss half of the conversation. It often happens with people who are smarter.\u201d</p> <p>Is that true, I ask, hoping I\u2019m simply too intelligent to be attentive. \u201cIt is. When you have a higher IQ, it makes it harder to listen because your brain can think of more things to think about and you\u2019re more likely to assume that you already know what people are going to say. Plus smarter people tend to be more neurotic and anxious. So things can more easily hijack their attention.\u201d</p> <p>Over the weekend, I grow tired of my new, less self-involved lifestyle. OK, I\u2019ve shut up about myself only half of the time anyway, but when I meet friends at a bar and contribute little to the conversation, I only feel half present. Here\u2019s the thing: talking, but not talking about yourself at all, is both inconvenient and weird; generally, people expect a two-way exchange of personal information. We give over something of ourselves as a courtesy and, in return, others open up to us. It might have endeared my date to me (she texts to tell me she wants to see me again), but if I shared nothing of myself, how do I know she really likes me?</p> <p>Still, I realised that my lack of listening and habit of hitting people with an onslaught of information have a lot to do with the economy of time. For me, socialising often becomes a conveyor belt of cursory \u201ccatch-up\u201d dinners with people you see once every three months, involving a manic exchange of top-line news. What is much more enjoyable, I learn in my meagre six days of relative selflessness, is to give yourself and others more of your time, to lie back and listen.</p> <p>I failed my challenge of not talking about myself for a whole week. But a lot like dry January (which, yes, I also failed), it did curb my bad habits. A week or so on, I am more of what Murphy would call an \u201cactive\u201d listener, so, naturally, I decide to meet up with the friend who rated me 8.5 out of 10 on the self-obsessed scale, in order to try to lower my rating. Without me speaking, the time we spend together feels forced and there are lulls in the conversation. Eventually the friend cracks. \u201cHaven\u2019t you got any good stories?\u201d she asks. Oh, I thought I talked about myself too much, I reply. \u201cOf course you do, but that\u2019s your special quality,\u201d she says. \u201cYou are completely comfortable holding the floor for one hour, but at least it\u2019s entertaining.\u201d</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to have a drinking problem to find dry January difficult. Similarly, I realise, you don\u2019t have to be a raging narcissist to be unable to shut up about yourself. There is nothing wrong with a bit of self-obsession, but now I occasionally pause for breath \u2013 to make sure everyone else has had their conversational turn\u2026 or to check whether the line has gone dead. </p>",
  "<p>On 20 April, Lucy left her house in a small market town in Buckinghamshire and walked through winding country lanes to a quiet field. There, her friend Owen was waiting with a joint already rolled. The weather was balmy; barely a cloud in sight. The pair smoked and caught up on school gossip, before Lucy judged that she should probably head home \u2013 any longer, and her parents might become suspicious.</p> <p>When she got back, she chatted to her family, before heading upstairs to her bedroom, her mother none the wiser. Lucy, who is 17, wasn\u2019t going to let the coronavirus pandemic stop her marking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/20/420-marijuana-hallmark-holiday\" title=\"\">4/20</a>, the international day of cannabis celebration.</p> <p>\u201cI do feel guilty about it,\u201d Lucy tells me, whispering (she does not want her parents to know about her weed-smoking). \u201cI have cut back on it the last week or so.\u201d Because she wanted to observe the lockdown rules? \u201cWell, mostly because the weather hasn\u2019t been great.\u201d</p> <p>When social distancing measures were announced in March, thousands of students had to quickly throw their possessions into suitcases, bid goodbye to university friends, and return to their childhood bedrooms. Teenagers who\u2019d been bracing themselves for the shock of GCSEs and A-levels were told to stand down, their exams cancelled. There will be no tearful goodbyes to friends, no rite-of-passage trips abroad, no festivals, no 18th-birthday parties. Instead, the summer months stretch out into a flat expanse of nothingness. Lucy is one of many young British adults who have been snatching moments of freedom when they can.</p> <p>\u201cSo much of your first year is about going out with your mates,\u201d says Harry Batt, 20, from Fareham, Hampshire. He was in his first year of a biomedical science degree at the University of Birmingham when he had to return home to live with his sister and parents, who are both key workers. \u201cYou have that taste of freedom and then you lose it so abruptly. You feel like you\u2019re kind of existing. My sleeping patterns are pretty rubbish. There\u2019s not a lot to wake up for.\u201d</p> <p>Socrates first complained that children \u201clove chatter in the place of exercise\u201d more than 2,000 years ago, and little has changed since then. The young adult brain is typically more dependent on social interaction than a fully matured adult\u2019s. \u201cThe importance of peers has been a hallmark of adolescence for thousands of years,\u201d says Dr Amy Orben, a research fellow at the University of Cambridge\u2019s cognition and brain sciences unit. \u201cWhat we have seen in studies is that this period involves a strengthening of social ties and a reconfiguration of social networks. Young people are finding their place in a maturing social world.\u201d </p> <p>It is too soon to know what the impact of the lockdown will be on young people, because the coronavirus pandemic is so unprecedented. \u201cIt\u2019s something we will only fully understand in future years, through more detailed study,\u201d Orben says.</p> <p>Batt\u2019s lockdown hasn\u2019t been entirely unsociable; he\u2019s in a tentative new romance with someone who lives locally. They connected on Instagram, and, although they haven\u2019t met yet, they have spent hours on video calls. \u201cThe hours we\u2019ve spent on FaceTime, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Batt jokes. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the equivalent of 10 dates.\u201d Once lockdown is over, they plan to go on their first date. \u201cHe lives near the sea, so we\u2019ll probably go for a walk on the beach and to a McDonald\u2019s drive-through.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve worked really hard to get my grades, and now I\u2019m just going to be given them \u2013 it feels like I don\u2019t deserve it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s not just their social lives that teenagers are missing. Away from the feckless stereotypes of tabloid lore, some conscientious young people crave the satisfaction of passing through examinations into adult life. If exam season is a corset, afterwards there is the sweet release of slouching into a summer free of obligations. Without the build-up to A-levels, 17-year-old Amina, a student from a small town in the north, says she feels aimless.</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a prom or a chance to say goodbye properly to friends or teachers,\u201d she says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do any of the stuff people do when they leave school. That\u2019s the most frustrating part.\u201d She\u2019s also fearful that being part of the \u201cCovid generation\u201d will impair her long-term job prospects. \u201cI\u2019ve been working really hard for the last two years to get my grades, and now I\u2019m just going to be given them \u2013 it feels like I don\u2019t deserve it. Everyone is going to think we just had our grades handed to us on a plate.\u201d</p> <p>British teenagers are among the most tested in the world, and the unhappiest. \u201cWe have been concerned about stress for some time now,\u201d says Natalie Perera of the Education Policy Institute. \u201cOther countries test as frequently as the UK, but what is different about England in particular is that there is greater accountability. These tests come with higher stakes. Your GCSE scores matter, and so do your A-levels.\u201d </p> <p>For diligent students, the sudden cancellation of exams can be disorienting. \u201cThere\u2019s an emotional component,\u201d Perera says. \u201cThey\u2019ve been working for two years to get to this point. In some cases, they may feel deflated: this milestone they\u2019ve been building towards isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d Of course, for others it may be a blessed relief: teenagers are not a homogeneous bloc.</p> <p>Young people who haven\u2019t had exams cancelled are also concerned. Noor Hashmi, 17, from Manchester, takes her A-levels next year. She feels that her cohort has been \u201coverlooked\u201d, because they\u2019re having to teach themselves the syllabus at home, using online learning. \u201cIf I was in college I would be properly absorbing the information,\u201d Hashmi says. \u201cBut there are only so many emails you can send to your teacher without feeling you\u2019re being annoying.\u201d Hashmi\u2019s classes have all moved online, but she worries she\u2019s not understanding the material fully. \u201cI feel the teachers are going through the content too quickly,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful knowing that everything we\u2019ve covered so far won\u2019t be revisited in depth before our exams.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Hashmi\u2019s concerns, some educationists believe coronavirus could accelerate our progression towards more online models of teaching. \u201cThe government will have to give the whole area of education technology much more focus, in case there\u2019s a second wave,\u201d Perera says. As big tech continues to move into the education sector, some Silicon Valley venture capitalists are staking top dollar on bricks-and-mortar universities becoming a thing of the past.</p> <p> </p> <p>Amina, who is estranged from her family, lives alone, in supported accommodation. She is classed as a vulnerable student, so has been able to access the school building during lockdown. \u201cIt\u2019s really eerie, seeing the school so silent,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no one in the halls or the canteen to say hi to.\u201d At home, she passes the time by packing for uni and reading course textbooks, to get ahead. She has an offer to read law at Swansea, a course she opted for after her experience of legally breaking with her family. \u201cI know it\u2019s early to be reading my books,\u201d Amina admits, \u201cbut I can\u2019t wait to get out of here and explore. I\u2019m tired of being inside on my own all the time.\u201d</p> <p>For those who had already made it to university, there is a different set of challenges. Stripped of their social networks and plunged back into a childhood holding pattern, many are struggling. \u201cMy mental health was a lot better at uni,\u201d says Claudia, 20, from Leeds. She is in the second year of a computer science degree but is currently self-isolating with her mother and sister at home. Lately, things have been strained. Having grown used to her freedom at university, Claudia finds it hard being told what to do. \u201cWe\u2019ll be watching TV for a bit and Mum will say, \u2018Right, you need to deep clean the kitchen,\u2019\u201d Claudia says. \u201cYou have to tiptoe round her. I think she\u2019s getting obsessive about cleaning because she\u2019s not sure what else to do. It makes me feel panicky when she gets like this. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s going to be like, day to day.\u201d</p> <p>Claudia is not alone: <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2020/mar/new-study-psychological-and-social-effects-covid-19\" title=\"\">University College London\u2019s ongoing Covid-19 social study</a>, which has been tracking the psychological and social experiences of adults in the UK during the pandemic, indicates that depression and anxiety levels have been higher in young adults than in the general population. In April, 17-year-old Manchester student <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/mourners-teenage-girl-trafford-streets-18069451\" title=\"\">Beth Palmer</a> took her own life after telling her parents that she was struggling to cope with the lockdown restrictions. A month later, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-52655678\" title=\"\">Matthew Mackell</a>, also 17, killed himself in a park in Tunbridge Wells, Kent. Mackell, an academic high achiever, left behind a notebook in which the A-level student expressed his fears that the lockdown might affect his results.</p> <p>As families have been forced to spend more time together, tensions can rise: the victims\u2019 commissioner for England and Wales has warned of a spike in domestic abuse cases, which impact children as well as adults.</p> <p>\u201cPrevious studies have shown that teenagers and young adults are among the most lonely people in the UK, despite being the most digitally connected,\u201d Orben says. \u201cThe removal of contact outside the home during a lockdown can be very destructive.\u201d In addition to her family confrontations, Claudia tells me she misses her boyfriend; she hasn\u2019t seen him for six weeks, which, she says, feels like an eternity. \u201cI\u2019m probably going to be here until September,\u201d she says. </p> <p>When you feel your grasp on adult life slipping, you grab freedom wherever you can. Lucy has kept her violations to a smattering of joints with friends \u2013 although there was that one time where four of them got together in a field and hung out. \u201cIn fairness, that was unplanned,\u201d Lucy says. \u201cIt was spontaneous.\u201d Lucy has confessed to friends that she\u2019s been breaking the rules. \u201cThey said, \u2018At least you\u2019re being honest about it, so we\u2019re not so angry.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Other transgressors have come in for social censure. Someone Lucy knows recently had a birthday party in his parents\u2019 garden. Photos appeared online, and WhatsApp groups turned into choruses of disapproval. \u201cThere was a backlash,\u201d Lucy says. \u201cIt definitely wasn\u2019t OK, but I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s OK for people to bitch about him behind his back.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3278f094636332adc9b95e7530b1a2b89558831\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3278f094636332adc9b95e7530b1a2b89558831/31_0_2854_3567/800.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of a woman balancing on her head, trapped in a jar\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018What might be the long-term consequences of so many months stuck indoors for a young person who already struggles with their mental health?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Mari Fouz/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s assumed that young people are unlikely to be seriously affected by coronavirus and are mostly in isolation to stop transmission to others \u2013 but many are in high-risk groups themselves. \u201cI\u2019m stuck in limbo,\u201d says Adam Preston, a 22-year-old student at the University of Sheffield who is currently back at his family home in Eastbourne, East Sussex. </p> <p>Preston has a rare form of blood cancer, meaning he is at high risk from coronavirus. The government has told him that he has to isolate until 30 June. Before the pandemic hit, Preston had been accepted on to an Erasmus programme in Stockholm. \u201cI worked so hard to get that place to study abroad,\u201d he says, sounding morose. \u201cAnd now, because of my health, it looks extremely unlikely I\u2019m going to be able to do that.\u201d</p> <p>In lieu of a year\u2019s study in Sweden, Preston\u2019s life is now limited to the four walls of his parents\u2019 house, and the occasional walk outside, avoiding human interaction. He was previously on a waiting list for NHS mental health support, but his long-awaited assessment was cancelled due to the pandemic. \u201cI feel like every avenue of progression I\u2019ve been working towards for the last year has been frozen,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Coronavirus is more than an existential fear: it has put the breaks on rebellion, or the generational search for answers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What might be the long-term consequences of so many months stuck indoors for a young person who already struggles with their mental health? \u201cA lot of people are drawing analogies with the Great Depression,\u201d says Dr Cheryl Sisk, professor of neuroscience at Michigan State University. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a big disruption in people\u2019s lives, and I think it\u2019s going to have a major influence on the generation that is currently in adolescence and young adulthood.\u201d</p> <p>Sisk explains that young people feel stress more acutely than adults: tests on lab rats find that adolescent rats struggle to turn off their stress response as quickly as adult rats do. \u201cThe general neural systems that regulate emotion and executive function are still a work in progress,\u201d Sisk says. \u201cThat means that the brain is more susceptible to life disruptions than a fully matured brain. There is evidence from what we know about neural development that this could have a longer-lasting impact on teenagers than adults.\u201d</p> <p>In addition, coronavirus will lead to the economic hangover to end all hangovers. \u201cEvery generation has its own task in its own time,\u201d says the writer Jon Savage, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/teenage-9781845951467.html\" title=\"\">Teenage: The Creation</a> <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/teenage-9781845951467.html\" title=\"\">Of Youth 1875-1945</a>. \u201cWhen I was a teenager in the 1960s, I was terrified I would die in a nuclear war. The thought that I could die at any time changed the way I looked at the world. There are always terrible events that threaten our future, until things change and the next threat comes along.\u201d</p> <p>But coronavirus feels different. For starters, young people can\u2019t pin badges to their chests and go out to protest against the virus. They can\u2019t do anything, really, apart from obey their parents\u2019 house rules \u2013 few have places of their own \u2013 and wait for the world to reopen. Coronavirus is more than just an existential fear: it has also put the brakes on reaction, rebellion, or the generational search for answers. It has forced young adults to return to their families, and accelerated the destruction of existing models of work, in sectors such as high-street retail and manufacturing; this generation of young adults will have to navigate their way through a world that is radically changed.</p> <p>\u201cThis generation are growing up in the death throes of the post-world war two world order,\u201d Savage says. \u201cThey are going to have to work out a new method of organisation that is sustainable and allows for a reasonable life for all.\u201d</p> <p>This social reorganisation is likely to be conducted amid a protracted recession in which young people will suffer disproportionately. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in previous downturns is that the graduate job market has contracted,\u201d Perera says. She anticipates a rising number of young people going into stable professions such as teaching as a stopgap until (if) the economy gets back on track. \u201cWe always need teachers, and it\u2019s a safe profession, although not as well paid as other graduate jobs.\u201d</p> <p>Young people may also look at frontline health workers during the pandemic and consider careers in nursing and medicine; or they could see headlines about PPE shortages and be put off due to safety concerns. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018Coronavirus might change people for the better. We want to do our part and give back\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Coronavirus could even herald the end of teenagers as a social category entirely. \u201cThe word \u2018teenager\u2019 really began as a marketing concept,\u201d Savage explains. \u201cAmerica had won the war and democratic consumerism came to Europe; these were the fresh young people who could be marketed and sold to.\u201d</p> <p>But teenagers aren\u2019t as valuable as they once were to marketers. \u201cOur society has learned to market products that were initially aimed at teenagers to people of all ages,\u201d Savage says. With teenagers likely to suffer the most from an economic downturn, the concept of the teenager as a discrete subgroup of cash-rich consumers, dreamed up in the boardrooms of Mad Men-era advertising agencies, will effectively be over. </p> <p>This may not be an entirely bad thing. Once the dust settles, young people will have to reconsider their futures in a rapidly shifting world. \u201cThings aren\u2019t going to go back to normal,\u201d Savage says. \u201cThe young are going to play an active part in either destroying or creating a new world. That\u2019s kind of extraordinary.\u201d He predicts greater youth-led social activism, particularly around the climate emergency and animal rights.</p> <p>Hashmi tells me she feels tentatively hopeful for the future. \u201cI think coronavirus might change people for the better,\u201d she says. \u201cSome of my friends, who weren\u2019t considering working in hospitals and stuff, now look at clap-for-carers and think, we want to do our part and give back.\u201d She believes coronavirus will create a more compassionate, selfless generation of young people. \u201cI think we\u2019re more aware of others now,\u201d Hashmi goes on. \u201cAt the start of this, I was just thinking about making myself safe. But seeing the death toll increase, I was thinking about everyone else.\u201d Despite the fact that the lockdown restrictions have been eased, with socially distanced meet-ups for one individual from each household now permitted, Hashmi is in no rush to start socialising. \u201cMost of my friends and I think that it would be safer and better to meet when the lockdown is way, way more relaxed and the death toll has decreased,\u201d she says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel safe to go out right now.\u201d</p> <p>Most of the young adults I spoke to accepted the lockdown in a spirit of sacrifice, with equanimity and good grace. Very few had considered breaking the rules. \u201cWe want to stay in,\u201d Batt explains. \u201cWe know it\u2019s for the best.\u201d</p> <p>And when the lockdown is finally over, they will step out into a world that is radically uncertain, full of promise but also doubt. Will the kids be all right? \u201cI\u2019d like to think the kids will always be all right,\u201d Savage concludes. \u201cI have great faith in young people and their ability to see what is wrong with the world and come up with solutions. I am always optimistic.\u201d </p> <p><em>\u2022 Some names have been changed.

Ilhan was upset, partly because the orphans couldn\u2019t come with them, but the rest of her book is the astonishing story of a&nbsp;voyage&nbsp;from Nairobi to New York to Minnesota, then barely 20 years later to Congress.</p> <p>The family\u2019s first stop was Arlington, Virginia, where the combative Ilhan spent most of her time in detention.&nbsp;But then she decided, she writes, \u201cthat my education was the one element of my life I had full control over, and given the long hours of studying in detention\u201d, by the time they moved on to Minnesota she \u201chad become a very good student\u201d.</p> <p>At her new school, \u201cAfricans fought African Americans over who was blacker.&nbsp;Muslim kids and white kids fought over US policy in the Middle East.&nbsp;Latinos against African Americans, Africans against Native Americans.\u201d</p> <p>But Ilhan began to display her talents as a community organizer.&nbsp;She joined a group of students determined to \u201cimprove racial and cultural relations\u201d by founding Unity in Diversity, \u201cessentially a training program around diverse leadership\u201d.</p> <p>Her next stop was North Dakota State University, after a friend told her it was searching for students, offering scholarships and a \u201cvery low cost of living\u201d. Back in Minneapolis after graduation, she immersed herself in the Democratic Farmer-Labor party, first working to defeat ballot initiatives to require photo IDs for voters and to outlaw gay marriage.&nbsp;</p> <p>She figured out a winning narrative: both were threats to freedom and civil liberties, a message that worked with communities of color <em>and</em> white rural Minnesotans.&nbsp;No anti-marriage equality initiative had ever been beaten until then \u2013 the same year Barack Obama was elected president.</p> <p>Omar was elected to the state legislature in 2016, then to the US Congress in 2018, as one of the first two Muslim women in the House.&nbsp;She feared she would be banned from the House floor by an ancient rule barring hats, which would have prevented her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/03/ilhan-omar-hijab-congress-headwear\">wearing her hijab</a>.

Traditional owners the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) peoples don\u2019t yet know the full extent of the damage.</p> <p>The operation had been discussed at meetings with Rio Tinto over a number of years, but Burchell Hayes, one of the directors of the PKKP Aboriginal Corporation, says those meetings often conveyed technical information which PKKP elders found hard to interpret. He says the \u201cblunt details\u201d that would have helped them understand exactly what was being proposed, and when, was lacking.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe sadness and the loss of our country has been very distressing,\u201d Hayes said.</p> <p>Rio Tinto says the \u201cmining activity\u201d conducted this month was \u201cundertaken in accordance with all necessary approvals\u201d, which had been obtained following a decade of \u201cdetailed consultation\u201d with the PKKP.</p> <p>\u201cWe are sorry that the recently expressed concerns of the PKKP did not arise through the engagements that have taken place over many years under the agreement that governs our operations on their country,\u201d a company statement says.</p> <p>The PKKP Aboriginal Corporation rejected that statement on Saturday, saying they had told Rio Tinto of the importance of the site on a number of occasions since 2013, the last as recently as March.</p> <p>Hayes said the mining company did not advise the PKKP of its intention to blast, and they only found out \u201cby default\u201d on 15 May \u201cwhen we sought access to the area for Naidoc Week in July\u201d.</p> <p>On a site visit in October 2019, Hayes said, their cultural and heritage manager, Dr Heather Builth, told a senior manager from the mine that the rock shelters were significant.</p> <p>\u201c[He] advised Dr Builth that there were no plans to extend the mine and Rio Tinto had been monitoring Juukan Gorge for vibration effects of local blasting,\u201d Hayes said.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cAt all times the PKKPAC has been direct and explicit in the archaeological and ethnographic significance of these rock shelters and the importance that they be preserved. For Rio Tinto to suggest otherwise is incorrect.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe Rio Tinto\u2019s outrageous statement is a bid to minimise the adverse public reaction and community outrage about Sunday\u2019s blast at Juukan Gorge; and the distress and upset caused to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama people.\u201d</p> <p>The WA Aboriginal affairs minister, Ben Wyatt, says he is normally \u201ccontacted pretty rapidly by the relevant Aboriginal organisation\u201d when a heritage site is under imminent threat, but was not called in this case.</p> <p>\u201cThe first I heard about this was after the explosion,\u201d Wyatt told reporters in Perth.</p> <p>The federal Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, says he received an 11th hour call from lawyers for the PKKP advising him of the risk and asking for advice, and that he advised them to seek an injunction under federal heritage legislation.</p> <p>He did not take it further or intervene, but said in a statement after the blast that the \u201cdestruction should not have occurred\u201d.</p> <p>Even if Ben Wyatt had known, there are no legal levers under the current legislation that allow for ministerial intervention. Wyatt has promised to reform the laws but consultation on that reform has been slow and was put off again last month due to the coronavirus.</p> <p>It is now highly unlikely the WA government will have those new laws drafted and through parliament before the state election next March.</p> <p>Robin Chapple, a Greens MP who campaigned alongside Wyatt to reform the legislation when Labor was in opposition, says Wyatt has \u201cfound himself to be incredibly compromised\u201d by the conflicting responsibilities of protecting Aboriginal heritage, as Aboriginal affairs minister, and supporting its most significant industry as the state\u2019s treasurer.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot have one person who is pushing the state in the pursuit of mining \u2026 being the same person that has to represent the interests of Aboriginal people to protect the excesses of the mining industry from destroying their sites,\u201d Chapple says.</p> <p>In response, Wyatt says he acts \u201cin the interests of all Western Australians when carrying out my ministerial responsibilities\u201d and that his dual portfolios \u201conly elevates the significance of Aboriginal affairs within this government\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/19/fertiliser-plant-is-not-damaging-burrup-peninsula-rock-art-epa-says\">Fertiliser plant is not damaging Burrup Peninsula rock art, EPA says</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>How did this happen?</h2> <p>Negotiations over the protection of Juukan Gorge began in 2003. In 2005, Hamersley Iron, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto, applied for environmental approval to build a new iron ore mine dubbed Brockman 4.</p> <p>Documents submitted as part of that assessment process said it had found 27 archaeological sites within the project area: mostly rock shelters with some artefact scatters, water sources and scarred trees.</p> <p>It said that identified Aboriginal heritage sites \u201cmay need to be either disturbed or actively managed\u201d for the mine to proceed but that \u201cit is not anticipated that the project will adversely impact on any areas of ethnographic significance\u201d.</p> <p>In 2008, the archaeologist Dr Michael Slack was engaged to conduct a test dig in the large rock shelter known as Juukan two, and concluded it was a \u201cquite significant\u201d site that was about 20,000 years old.</p> <p>In 2013, Rio Tinto applied for and was granted ministerial consent under <a href=\"http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consol_act/aha1972164/s18.html\">section 18 of the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972</a> to destroy Juukan one and two, as part of the expansion of its proposed Brockman 4 mine, which had become operational three years earlier.</p> <p>The minister who provided that consent was Peter Collier, a member of the Barnett Liberal government that was in power at the time. But it\u2019s unlikely he knew the details of what he signed off on, Chapple says.</p> <p>All applications are assessed by the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Committee, which then provides a recommendation with scant detail to the minister.</p> <p>There is no legislated requirement for the ACHC to consult traditional owners. In 2015, the committee was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/apr/02/landmark-wa-judgement-on-aboriginal-sacred-sites-prompts-call-for-review\">chastised by the supreme court for using an invalid definition of sacred sites that explicitly excluded sites that were part of songlines</a>.</p> <p>In 2014, after permission to destroy the site had been granted, a salvage mission dated the Juukan two site at 46,000 years old and of very high archaeological and cultural significance. One year later the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura were granted native title over the area, and a 10,888sq km patch of the Hamersley range.</p> <p>That gave them the right to negotiate over any new developments, and to make financial agreements with mining companies profiting from their land. But it did not confer any legal ability to protect heritage sites, unless negotiated as part of a land use agreement.</p> <p>Those land use agreements are designed to foster closer relationships between industry and Aboriginal peoples, like the relationship that Rio says it has with the PKKP. The relationship is both financial and institutional, and can make it difficult to take a disagreement over a matter like the protection of a heritage site into a public arena.</p> <p>But because of the lack of power granted to traditional owners under the WA Aboriginal Heritage Act, a public fight is the only mechanism left to traditional owners to defend heritage if negotiation fails.</p> <p>Chapple says the financial ties between traditional owner corporations and the mining companies that threaten their heritage are well known, but rarely discussed.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly corrupt, I just think we need to know that there are relationships that can be used to the benefit of the mining companies,\u201d Chapple says. \u201cYou get this in small communities, and Western Australia is a small community.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/apr/02/landmark-wa-judgement-on-aboriginal-sacred-sites-prompts-call-for-review\">Landmark WA judgment on Aboriginal sacred sites prompts call for review</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>An antiquated law</h2> <p>The Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 has been relatively unchanged for almost 50 years and does not give traditional owners any formal right of consultation or appeal.&nbsp;</p> <p>In his second reading speech in April 1972, the then minister for community welfare, Bill Willessee, said the legislation had been drafted because \u201cthe preservation of sites and objects of Aboriginal origin is now recognised throughout Australia as an important aspect of providing Aboriginal citizens with the social environment that they need when they still retain partly or wholly their traditional beliefs\u201d.</p> <p>This speech proved more enlightened than the resulting legislation, says Greg McIntyre SC, a leading expert on Aboriginal heritage cases.</p> <p>He says that had the legislation included a strong emphasis on spiritual value as a basis for heritage protection, he would be \u201creasonably happy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is that the legislation doesn\u2019t even do that,\u201d he says.&nbsp;</p> <p>Under the current legislation, McIntyre says, the only legal option for traditional owners who oppose a decision allowing the destruction of their heritage lies in administrative law, an argument that due process has not been followed. That does not in itself halt a development, but it does cause delays.</p> <p>\u201cAdministrative relief is like guerrilla warfare in that you hope it will slow people down and they will be forced to rethink it, but it doesn\u2019t really get to the key issues of whether it\u2019s affecting Aboriginal heritage or the environment,\u201d McIntyre says.</p> <p>Even if the act is reformed, McIntyre says, the economic importance of the mining industry made it likely that the focus would remain on finding a compromise between heritage and industry.</p> <p>\u201cThe best legislation I think we\u2019re likely to get is legislation that has a heavy emphasis on involving Aboriginal people in the decision making, but with the understanding that ultimately they will be expected at best to go into partnership with those that wish to extract minerals rather than prevent that from happening,\u201d he says.</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 4 June 2020 to correct the date&nbsp;the&nbsp;PKKP Aboriginal Corporation found out about the plan to blast the site, and the date of the site visit in which Rio Tinto was informed of its significance.</p></li> </ul>",

As of Friday evening, the Facebook&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10164767134275725?__xts__[0]=68.ARD2X076najMYm_pwm0iMhcYKoJY3mmAo1ICS2DteP5riQcwIH0PoMdQeuzbRbOlN1ZoSizGRHzhUMU2PDODI6V2fgEkBjWL-KNHj6Lh_qvCrJHP3_0UsoxLA2RIo_aw4Y9RKZHF1Zk3ALeKy-kkwBfF3EtNJUU6mHVGmmDhauCcbr6V6Pblv-faEYSX_3wXECHQlbBWnfPaC0kViMqxV-uOP9BDYJ_96xTuTFC-B9xV8u16M05WYUsnh-iDibxMLFr1nZyKkFz8oOKiTxmD2phkceYwbfMGR2TWOf8_eaqWfUqtV6zTr2hWwENQAFGukoyCVKvOT0lwdn6g&amp;__tn__=-R\">post</a>&nbsp;had been shared more than 65,000 times and received 196,000 likes, 32,000 heart emojis, and 6,600 laughing emojis.</p> <p>The text was also overlaid on a photo of Trump for the president\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAwoli1hbcP/\">Instagram account</a>, where it has received more than 433,000 likes.</p> <p>And while Facebook has made a controversial decision to exempt politicians from its third-party factchecking process, there is no such exception for incitement to violence.</p> <p>On Friday evening, Facebook\u2019s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, defended Facebook\u2019s decision to allow the post by arguing that Facebook has a policy to allow warnings of the use of force by state actors.</p> <p>It was not immediately clear if that policy had ever been articulated by Facebook before. In 2019, a Facebook spokesperson declined to clarify the company\u2019s policy around violence and hate speech by state actors on the record to the Guardian. The Guardian has contacted Facebook for comment.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10111961824369871\">post</a> on his personal Facebook page, Zuckerberg also appeared to suggest that if Facebook had decided Trump\u2019s post was intended to incite violence by civilians, they would have taken it down, writing, \u201cUnlike Twitter, we do not have a policy of putting a warning in front of posts that may incite violence because we believe that if a post incites violence, it should be removed regardless of whether it is newsworthy, even if it comes from a politician.\u201d</p> <p>Zuckerberg also criticized Trump, saying: \u201cPersonally, I have a visceral negative reaction to this kind of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric \u2026 I disagree strongly with how the president spoke about this, but I believe people should be able to see this for themselves, because ultimately accountability for those in positions of power can only happen when their speech is scrutinized out in the open.\u201d</p> <p>Threats of violence by state actors on its platforms have long been a tricky topic for the company. Facebook was used by Buddhist extremists and military officials in Myanmar to incite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/03/revealed-facebook-hate-speech-exploded-in-myanmar-during-rohingya-crisis\">hatred and violence</a> against that country\u2019s Muslim minority, the Rohingya, in 2017 \u2013 a campaign of ethnic cleansing that culminated in the killing of 25,000 Rohingya and the forced displacement of 700,000 more. </p> <p>Facebook&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/06/facebook-admits-it-has-not-done-enough-to-quell-hate-in-myanmar\">admitted to failings</a>&nbsp;in Myanmar in 2018 and eventually banned many of the hate preachers and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/27/facebook-removes-accounts-myanmar-military-un-report-genocide-rohingya\">military leaders</a> who had used the platform to inspire genocide.</p>"
