Other districts across California, including in Santa Cruz and Berkeley, are closing their schools because of coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cClosing schools deeply affects so many of our families who depend on schools to provide a safe place for their children, food, and many other services,\u201d Kyla Johnson-Trammell, the superintendent of Oakland schools, <a href=\"https://www.ousd.org/coronavirus\">said in a statement</a>. \u201cSchool sites have been and will continue to be crafting continuity of education plans, with each school preparing to provide assignments to students.\u201d</p> <p>And across the University of California system, administrators suspended in-person classes, pivoting to remote instruction and canceling campus events. University housing remained open, but on some campuses, students were encouraged to go home.</p> <p>Meanwhile, state public health experts released recommendations Wednesday night calling for large gatherings of 250 people or more to be rescheduled or canceled. They also recommended that venues that do not allow social distancing of 6ft per person to cancel or postpone events, as well as any gathering that brings people together in a single space at one time, be it an auditorium or a conference room.</p> <p>\u201cChanging our actions for a short period of time will save the life of one or more people you know,\u201d Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s governor, <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/11/california-public-health-experts-mass-gatherings-should-be-postponed-or-canceled-statewide-to-slow-the-spread-of-covid-19/\">said in a statement</a>. \u201cThat\u2019s the choice before us.\u201d</p> <p>The recommendation came after San Francisco and Santa Clara county fully banned all gatherings of 1,000 or more. On Friday, London Breed, the San Francisco mayor, went a step further and fully banned all gatherings of 100 or more.</p> <p>San Francisco will also close its public libraries and recreation centers to the public starting Monday, and open emergency childcare and youth centers in the wake of the public school closures.</p> <p>Earlier in the week, the famed music festival Coachella, known for drawing hundreds of thousands to the California desert, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/10/coachella-expected-to-postpone-until-october-over-coronavirus-fears\">was postponed to October</a>. Soon after, Disney <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/mar/12/disneyland-closed-coronavirus\">agreed to close its California parks</a> until the end of March. \u201cDisney made the right call in the interest of public health and agreed to shut down their California parks,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cExpect more announcements like this shortly.\u201d</p> <p>The week began with officials scrambling to figure out what to do with the Grand Princess cruise ship, which had been stuck off the coast of California after 21 on board tested positive for coronavirus. The ship originally destined for San Francisco ended up docked in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/oakland-coronavirus-grand-princess-san-francisco\">larger and more industrial port of Oakland</a>, where it remained Friday after a slow five days of disembarking<strong> </strong>2,450 passengers to quarantine locations elsewhere. According to the cruise line, 14 international passengers were still on the ship, awaiting transportation to their home countries.</p> <p>A<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-us-testing-failures-trump-administration\"> lack of testing capacity</a> has caused an outcry nationwide, and California made strides on that front this week. Experts at the University of California San Diego Health, UC San Francisco Health and UC Los Angeles Health can now offer their own in-house testing for coronavirus, taking place in hospital laboratories for patients who meet clinical recommendations. UC Davis Health and UC Irvine Health will be able to begin in-house testing within the next week or so as well, said the UC Health spokesman Michael Crawford.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Kaiser Permanente rolled out a pilot program for drive-up testing in northern California, allowing for patients who meet criteria for testing and have a doctor\u2019s order and an appointment to get tested with minimal exposure. </p> <p>California had the capacity to conduct 8,227 tests as of Thursday, Newsom <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CAgovernor/status/1238154824819990528\">said in a press conference</a>. But many of the testing kits provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were missing the key components to conducts the analyses.</p> <p>\u201cThe test kits do not include in every case the RNA extraction kits, the reagents, the chemicals, the solutions that are components of the broader tests,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is imperative that the federal government and labs across the United States, not just state of California, get the benefit of all the ingredients, the components of the test. I am surprised this is not more of the national conversation.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Look into your dry pantry. Of all the unadulterated seasoning agents, I\u2019m guessing you may have salt, sugar, pepper, vinegar and soy sauce?</p> <p>You\u2019re probably pretty well covered for all the flavours: salty, sweet, bitter, spicy and sour. And I\u2019m guessing most of you will have two or more ingredients to emphasise saltiness, sweetness and spice in your cooking \u2013 but acidity and bitterness often get a little neglected.</p> <p>Yes, these are more complex flavours and they come with overwhelming choices, so it might seem easier to shy away and stick to one vinegar \u2013 usually distilled, probably boring.</p> <p>I absolutely understand the world of acidity can be daunting. But once you embrace it, it is like stepping into a new dimension from which there is no going back.</p> <p> Sour flavours are often what we yearn for to whet our appetite, especially when we are under the weather. It\u2019s no coincidence that Vitamin C is sour, not sweet.</p> <p>Often it is acidity that is missing from rounding out a dish, even if it isn\u2019t the dominant flavour. Five-spice braises? Nothing without a little black vinegar. A caprese salad is good but with a drizzle of that aged balsamic it is improved a hundred fold \u2013 especially if the tomato is not perfectly ripe.</p> <p>An arsenal of vinegars can make everything from salad dressing(chardonnay, balsamic, apple cider) to mapo tofu (shaoxing and zhenjiang) sing. But they\u2019re not the only way you can add acidity into your food. Various citruses, ferments and cultured dairy all work \u2013 and sometimes leafy herbs.</p> <p> One of the ultimates is tamarind, an uber-useful legume that\u2019s both sour and sweet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4126ba560181143b586cc13d5c776de1e233fadc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4126ba560181143b586cc13d5c776de1e233fadc/0_94_2121_1273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Freshly opened tamarind\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Freshly opened tamarind.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LuVo/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Originally an African native from along the tropics, it has spread prolifically to become a beloved presence in many traditional cuisines and medicines, from Timbuktu to Venezuela and everywhere in between.</p> <p>I\u2019m in Bangkok right now, and amid the Covid-19 overload and the natural environmental stresses, my palate has been leaning sour lately. Fortunately, everywhere I turn, I spot fresh podded tamarind. Even the office workers on their smoko breaks gathered at the base of high rises choose to counter balance their cigarettes and smog inhalation with fresh tamarind pods.</p> <p>They reach into bags, crack open the pods and reveal soft, chewy flesh with a date-like consistency, encasing hard, indigestible black seeds. They make a delicious palate cleanser, even when you haven\u2019t been smoking.</p> <p>If you don\u2019t have access to fresh tamarind, I guarantee that you can find packaged bricks of tamarind pulp in grocery stores. For cooking, the pulp is easily made into a concentrate by mushing the freshly peeled pod with a little bit of water, or any liquid, then extruding the seeds. This can be added to soups, or used in place of anything in need of added acidity. You can also buy jars of tamarind concentrate \u2013 but you\u2019ll have more control over the strength if you make it yourself using packaged pulp.</p> <p>Tamarind is more commonly used than you might think. It\u2019s even in Worcestershire and HP sauces, as well as being one of the main seasonings in pad thai.</p> <p>In Thai and Indian cookery, when the tree isn\u2019t fruiting, the tenderest, feathery, bright green tips of the plant are used instead. Sour soups are a particular flavoursome way of using these sour greens. They pep up a seasoned bone stock, making for a refreshing soup served alongside any meal to get the digestive juices flowing.</p> <p> When you add an acidic element, the timing makes a big difference to the outcome. In fact, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a key skill.</p> <p>If in doubt, always add it at the end of the cooking process, as sour notes change with heat and oxidise quickly. So use your sour touch at the last minute \u2013 right before you eat. Another key thing I\u2019ve been doing is mixing my sour notes in the same dish \u2013 there\u2019s a whole spectrum of sour out there, why restrict yourself?</p> <h2>Pad thai with tofu</h2> <p><strong>2 tbsp healthy fat</strong>,<strong> </strong>choose one that can stand a high smoking point. I like to use macadamia oil or rendered pork fat<strong><br>1 large organic egg</strong>, slightly beaten<strong><br>1 tbsp Bragg</strong><strong> Aminos</strong> or another good-quality light soy sauce<strong><br>1 tbsp tamarind puree<br>2 tbsp coconut nectar or palm sugar<br>1 tbsp dark soy sauce or kecap manis<br>100g soft tofu</strong>, cut into 2cm x 5cm batons<strong><br>100g thin dried rice noodles</strong>, soaked for 10 minutes then drained<strong><br>1 tbsp salt pickled turnips</strong>, chopped roughly<strong><br>2 tbsp roasted peanuts</strong>, crushed<strong><br>7 garlic chive stems</strong>, cut into 7cm pieces<strong><br>\u00bd cup bean sprouts</strong>, washed<strong><br>\u00bd lime or lemon</strong></p> <p>Pour the light soy and dark soy sauces, tamarind puree and palm sugar into bowl and mix until well incorporated, then set the mixture next to the stove.</p> <p>Heat one tablespoon of oil in wok on high heat, until it starts to smoke a little, at which point add the beaten egg, and cooking it for about one minute, stirring occasionally. After it is cooked, remove it from the wok and set aside.</p> <p>Into the same wok, without washing, add one tablespoon of oil and again heat it until slightly smoking, then add tofu \u2013 stir to cook until it\u2019s evenly golden.</p> <p>Add the noodles and seasoning mixture, keeping the wok on high heat.

  "<p>America\u2019s failure to provide quick and easily accessible testing to people suspected to have the coronavirus has been a central thrust of criticism about the US response to the threat from the global pandemic.</p> \n<p>That has left many wondering how the US could have got its coronavirus response so wrong, though it appears that steps are now being taken to try and catch up with the outbreak\u2019s spread.</p> \n<p><strong>The Trump administration is scrambling to provide more testing for Covid-19. What is happening?</strong></p> \n<p>New measures are being introduced that should speed up access to test kits. Roche, the manufacturer of state-of-the-art testing machines that are 10 times faster at getting results than other models, has just been given <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-13/roche-gets-clearance-for-coronavirus-test-that-s-10-times-faster?utm_campaign=news&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;utm_source=applenews\">approval</a> by the US Food and Drug Administration to produce a new coronavirus test which should see 500,000 or so additional kits available from next week. New York state, which is an epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, has also been given permission to run its own testing operation using both public and private laboratories.</p> \n<p>At a White House <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/mar/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-joe-biden-bernie-sanders-live-updates-news\">press conference</a> on Friday, Donald Trump said the federal government was working in partnership with private laboratories such as Quest Diagnostics to sharply increase capacity. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba13ce6a-1fc7-45a1-81b1-3dc9c1afeb5f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mOT8pnLvEOc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>All of this is good news, as it is should bring much more testing capacity on stream.</p> \n<p><strong>So now there will be more testing available the crisis is over, right?</strong></p> \n<p>Wrong.</p> \n<p>The US is woefully behind the curve in tackling the novel coronavirus, especially in terms of testing. It is now thought the disease may have first emerged in China as early as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/first-covid-19-case-happened-in-november-china-government-records-show-report\">November</a> though Chinese authorities only revealed the crisis in January. Even so, Trump was only putting crucial elements of the US testing strategy in place on Friday, almost two months after the scale of the danger was fully known. With a virus that is as contagious and lethal for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/covid-19-what-we-know-and-do-not-know-about-the-coronavirus\">vulnerable populations</a> as Covid-19, that is unthinkably slow.</p> \n<p><strong>What explains this abysmal failure?</strong></p> \n<p>\u201cFailure\u201d is right. That\u2019s precisely the word that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-us-testing-failures-trump-administration\">Dr Anthony Fauci</a>, one of the top US officials dealing with the crisis, used to describe the testing fiasco on Thursday.</p> \n<p>A number of problems contributed to the disaster. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is marshaling federal testing, botched its rollout of test kits in February, sending out faulty materials. A bottleneck then ensued, with states all having to send their samples to the CDC\u2019s headquarters in Atlanta for analysis which slowed results down.</p> \n<p>The federal government was also too controlling of the process, preventing states and private laboratories running their own decentralized efforts. The criteria for testing was set far too tightly. Doctors were initially told they could only test people who had traveled to China or had close contact with infected individuals. Only now can doctors freely offer testing, and even so there are simply not enough kits to go round.</p> \n<p><strong>So how bad is the shortfall?</strong></p> \n<p>Extremely bad. A few statistics put it in perspective. South Korea, which is increasingly being seen as a model of good practice, has been testing up to 15,000 people a day \u2013 and has reached more than 230,000 people.</p> \n<p>In the US, the total number of people who have been tested is still only about 11,000. That\u2019s a per capita rate that is about 130 times lower than in South Korea.</p> \n<p>This matters. South Korea\u2019s blanket testing has helped the country turn the corner of the epidemic. The number of new cases reported in South Korea every day is now falling, suggesting good policy and strong leadership can beat the virus. The US had neither.</p> \n<p><strong>Basic question: why is testing important?</strong></p> \n<p>The even more basic answer is that Covid-19 is invisible and can easily go undetected. It also spreads very quickly, and can be passed along by people who themselves have no symptoms. Trying to combat the disease without testing is like running through a forest blindfolded \u2013 it\u2019s not going to end well.</p> \n<p>The only way to get to grips with the disease, experts say, other than locking down entire cities like China and Italy have done, is mass testing. This allows doctors and government to operate on two levels: they can identify carriers of the virus who can then be quarantined until they are no longer infectious, and they can also carry out random sample testing in communities to spot localized outbreaks that can then be targeted as \u201ccontainment zones\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/nyregion/coronavirus-new-rochelle-containment.html\">New Rochelle</a> outside New York city is an example, where the National Guard was sent this week to deliver food to quarantined families.</p> \n<p><strong>How do the tests work?</strong></p> \n<p>Swabs are taken from the mouth or throat and then sent to laboratories. The aim is to gain a match with Covid-19\u2019s genetic sequence. The new Roche test takes only four hours to get results, but earlier versions can take up to 48 hours which slows things down.</p> \n<p><strong>So who is to blame for the lethally late push for testing?</strong></p> \n<p>With a health crisis of this dimension, the buck stops at the top, and that\u2019s Trump. From the outside, medical experts say, he has taken the wrong approach, thinking of Covid-19 as an outside threat to be dealt with by closing borders rather than an inevitable and already existing fact of life inside the US that must be dealt with through testing and isolation. This week, in his Oval Office address to the nation, Trump called it the \u201cforeign virus\u201d which is a dangerously misleading concept. Remarkably, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1238478167695863817\">continued to talk</a> on Friday about combating coronavirus through \u201ca very strong border policy\u201d, when the disease has almost certainly been prevalent inside the US undetected for weeks.</p> \n<p>The bottom line is that Covid-19 is happening on Trump\u2019s watch. He may find his usual techniques for deflecting criticism \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/12/fact-checking-trumps-address-nation-cornavirus/\">lying</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/trump-coronavirus-threat/607825/\">adopting conspiracy theories</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html\">blaming others</a> \u2013 may not spare him the consequences this time.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Update: A previous version of this story referenced a Google site which Trump announced on Friday would advise individuals on how to gauge their symptoms and, if needed, steer them towards new drive-in testing facilities. Despite Trump\u2019s announcement of such a service, that service does not appear, with a subsequent statement by the Google-adjacent company in question, to be real. The company Verily, which shares a corporate umbrella with Google, released a statement after Trump\u2019s press conference announcing that it was developing a Covid-19 triage test tool, but the tool \u201c</em><em>is in the early stages of development\u201d,</em><em> and the company is \u201cplanning to roll testing out in the Bay Area\u201d,</em><em> not nationally.</em></p></li> \n</ul>",

The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt described the UK as an \u201coutlier\u201d.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, Johnson played down the importance of banning mass gatherings, even suggesting Scotland\u2019s decision to ban events with more than 500 people reflected the lack of resilience of its emergency services.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe scientific advice, as we\u2019ve said over the last couple of weeks, is that banning such events will have little effect on the spread,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, defended the approach on Friday, saying it was aimed at creating a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/herd-immunity-will-the-uks-coronavirus-strategy-work\">herd immunity</a>\u201d against Covid-19. That means allowing 60% of the population to catch the virus, but not so quickly as to overwhelm the NHS.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur aim is to try and reduce the peak, broaden the peak, not suppress it completely. Also, because the vast majority of people get a mild illness, [our aim is] to build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission, [while] at the same time we protect those who are most vulnerable to it. Those are the key things we need to do,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>On Friday, the number of diagnosed cases in the UK rose to 798, though the government believes the true figure to be 5,000 to 10,000, and the first death was confirmed in Scotland.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-crisis-leaders-failing-gordon-brown\">criticised the lack of a coordinated international response</a>, urging global leaders to pledge to do \u201cwhatever it takes,\u201d to tackle the outbreak.</p> \n<p>Writing in the Guardian, he likened the scale of the response necessary to the Manhattan Project, which led to the creation of the nuclear bomb. \u201cIf the Manhattan Project could bring people together in the 1940s to create the most lethal weapon in human history, surely we can come together in the 21st century to save lives and the livelihood of millions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Brown blamed the spread of \u201cpopulist nationalism\u201d, which has been \u201csubdividing our world\u201d, for the inability of governments to deal with the crisis together. He encouraged them to be more open about how they were learning from each other\u2019s experiences.</p> \n<p>His plea came as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, announced that world leaders will hold an emergency G7 video-conference summit on Monday. \u201cWe will coordinate research efforts on a vaccine and treatments, and work on an economic and financial response,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Global stock markets rallied on Friday after their worst day since the 1987 crash, on hopes that economic policymakers might deliver a coordinated response.</p> \n<p>In the UK, ministers have insisted their decision-making is based on scientific advice. One factor influencing their thinking has been the risk of \u201cfatigue\u201d setting in if restrictive measures had to be applied for a prolonged period.</p> \n<p>Labour has been broadly supportive of the government\u2019s approach so far but the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, demanded more information.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re supporting to the move from the contain to delay stage, but the government needs an explain stage,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a duty to voice the concerns that are being raised with us: and the public want to know why the UK appears to be taking an approach which is different to other countries, when other countries themselves are saying their approach is based on their science.\u201d</p> \n<p> A Whitehall source said: \u201cMinisters are working with the chief scientific adviser and chief medical officer on our plan to stop various types of public events, including mass gatherings, beginning next week. We are also talking to businesses and other bodies about the timing of moving towards much more widespread working from home.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are many complex considerations to make all these measures as effective as possible. We will make the right decisions at the right time based on the best scientific evidence.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor example, we are concerned about the burden large events put on public services \u2013 including the health service and the police \u2013 from dealing with coronavirus. Officials are working with industry bodies to identify how to support businesses that will be affected by this decision.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have drafted emergency legislation to give the government the powers it needs to deal with coronavirus, including powers to stop mass gatherings and compensate organisations. We will publish this legislation next week.\u201d</p> \n<p>Parliament announced a clampdown on visitors, and urged MPs not to go on overseas visits.

  "<p>British football is facing a crisis unprecedented in the modern era after the postponement of the league seasons in England and Scotland plunged clubs into a prolonged spell of financial and legal uncertainty.</p> \n<p>The Premier League, EFL and FA, in an abrupt reversal of their previous position, together agreed on Friday morning to suspend all competitive football until 4 April. Later in the day the Scottish and Welsh FAs followed suit, with the Scottish ban extending all the way to grassroots football.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/13/english-football-shutdown-until-april-means-season-may-never-be-completed\">English football's shutdown until April means season may never be completed</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The decision was taken in light of a sudden burst of cases of coronavirus among Premier League players and staff, most notably the Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, and Chelsea forward Callum Hudson-Odoi. On Friday top-flight clubs, including Everton, Watford and West Ham, had been forced to take quarantine measures.</p> \n<p>Arteta is not in a serious condition and issued a statement. \u201cThanks for your words and support,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFeeling better already. We\u2019re all facing a huge &amp; unprecedented challenge. Everyone\u2019s health is all that matters right now. Protect each other by following the guidelines &amp; we\u2019ll come through this together. Well done PL for making the right decisions.\u201d</p> \n<p>While there is relief across the game that football has taken the decision to suspend play there is also genuine concern that the season may never be completed. This would certainly not be the wish of the Premier League and EFL, the former insisting that \u201cdespite the challenges, it is the Premier League\u2019s aim to reschedule the displaced fixtures, when it is safe to do so\u201d.</p> \n<p>However with government advisers believing infections may not come to a peak for another three months, the decision could be taken out of the hands of governing bodies.</p> \n<p>With a three-week period at least before another ball is kicked in anger, other issues are set to come to the fore that could provide clubs with significant challenges. First and foremost will be concerns over revenues and contractual obligations likely to affect clubs up and down the football pyramid. \u201cAt the moment every club will be looking at key contracts with sponsors and advertisers, trying to identify where the risk hotspots are,\u201d said Andrew McGregor, a senior associate at the sports law firm Brabners.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe commercial concerns will be around a reduction in value of contracts, caused by suspension or playing behind closed doors. Take perimeter advertising, which in the Premier League can sell for anything from \u00a330,000 to \u00a360,000 a minute. Partners will have minutes included in their deals with the club; so what happens if there are no fans in the stadium?</p> \n<p>\u201cSome clubs might have a partial rebate in their contracts, others might have \u2018force majeure\u2019 clauses. But often these are almost throwaway, tacked on to the back page of a deal because people don\u2019t anticipate it happening. To have an event of this magnitude and for clubs to then be looking at a clause four or five sentences long, it is going to leave a lot of legal dispute about how to interpret them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Contractual obligations to partners and sponsors are just one part of the picture. Centrally there is the issue of wages, not only for players but support and ground staff. There is also the possibility of legal claims being brought by third party contractors such as caterers or in-house betting providers, if games do not go ahead.</p> \n<p>Another factor that could complicate any hopes of completing the season is the timing of players\u2019 contracts. Commonly contracts run until 30 June, which would mean that, if delayed matches were to be played later than that date, players who had previously been under contract may no longer be and could in fact have agreed deals to sign at new clubs.</p> \n<p>There is a possibility that clubs get caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. \u201cIf you start looking at wholesale cancellation, that\u2019s when it gets really complicated,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cYou might have restriction of trade, anti-competitive complaints, if clubs are denied promotion or relegation.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think a full cancellation or early cancellation would be way down the list of possible actions, just simply because of financial or integrity issues that are unfathomable in terms of what they might look like.\u201d</p> \n<p>For many clubs the three-week pause will provide an opportunity to take stock and work out a strategy, in the hope that the picture has improved by the time another decision is taken. The Premier League, who met by video conference, will meanwhile convene again next week following an extraordinary meeting of the members of Uefa, where it is anticipated the summer\u2019s European Championship will be postponed until 2021.</p> \n<p>On Friday Uefa announced the postponement of the remaining scheduled ties in the Europa League and Champions League, including Manchester City\u2019s home leg against Real Madrid in the round of 16. With this move, and those taken by the home nations, it brings about a complete shutdown of European club football, comparable to that caused by the second world war.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/13/governing-bodies-face-a-fraught-future-as-game-we-love-grinds-to-halt\">Governing bodies face a fraught future as game we love grinds to halt</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Earlier this week Italy announced the suspension of league football after having played matches behind closed doors for some weeks. La Liga in Spain then followed suit. Yesterday the German Bundesliga and French Ligues 1 and 2 also postponed matches until April.</p> \n<p>The German football league (DFL) had been reluctant to disrupt matches, and Bayern Munich had been scheduled to play at Union Berlin behind closed doors until late on Friday afternoon.</p> \n<p>That decision drew public criticism, including from Bayern midfielder Thiago Alcantara who wrote on Twitter: \u201cThis is crazy. Please stop fooling around and land on reality. Let\u2019s be honest, there are much more important priorities than any sport.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bayern\u2019s director Karl Heinz Rumenigge also intervened publicly calling on Munich fans not to travel to the capital. \u201cThese are all contacts that we must prevent so that the virus does not spread quickly\u201d, he said. \u201cPlease do not come to the stadiums \u2013 you are not doing the clubs and the players a favour.\u201d</p> \n<p>By Friday evening the match had been postponed and the DFL had issued the following statement: \u201cThe goal is still to end the season by the summer \u2013 from a sporting point of view, but especially because an early end of the season could have existential consequences for some clubs.\u201d</p>",

The commission said it had already signed off a Danish scheme in less than 24 hours, promising to do the same for other countries.<br><br></li> <li><strong>Releasing \u20ac1bn from the EU budget,</strong> which is expected to cover \u20ac8bn in loan guarantees, with the aim of providing liquidity to 100,000 small and medium-sized companies.<br><br></li> <li><strong>Governments will be able to use flexibilities in the EU stability and growth pact rules that restrict the deficit.</strong> In normal years a state\u2019s deficit cannot exceed 3% of gross domestic product.

  "<p> The only authorised video stream of this week\u2019s federal parliamentary hearings into Australia\u2019s family law system was broadcast on Pauline Hanson\u2019s Facebook page.

On Thursday the head of the Men\u2019s Rights Agency, Sue Price, made claims that there had been an \u201cincreasing number\u201d of false domestic violence allegations made by women.</p> <p>The Greens senator Larissa Waters challenged Price about why she did not believe women\u2019s accounts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/10/malcolm-roberts-criticised-after-claiming-many-domestic-violence-allegations-made-up\">Malcolm Roberts criticised after claiming 'many' domestic violence allegations made up</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen I talk to probably 5,000 men each year for 26 years, I think I get a pretty good handle on who is telling me the truth,\u201d Price said. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t talk to the women, we\u2019re a men\u2019s rights agency. I talk to many, many men who tell me that \u2026 lies have been told.\u201d</p> <p>Waters then brought up the evidence of multiple experts and researchers who had told the inquiry that the existence of a domestic violence order or unproven allegation did not provide any benefit in family court proceedings.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the experts know what they\u2019re talking about on these issues,\u201d Price responded.</p> <h2>Hannah Clarke would have found it \u2018impossible\u2019</h2> <p>Zoe Rathus, an expert on family law and domestic violence at Griffith University, told the inquiry the <a href=\"https://www.ag.gov.au/FamiliesAndMarriage/Families/ChildrenAndFamilyLaw/Pages/default.aspx\">legislated presumption of equal shared parental responsibility</a> had proved \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d and acted to prevent people from airing allegations of domestic violence in the family court.</p> <p>Rathus said that danger was particularly apparent in situations like the one faced by Clarke, where the behaviour of her estranged husband, Rowan Baxter, had been abusive and controlling but not physically violent.</p> <p>\u201cHannah Clarke was allowing Baxter to see the children on a regular basis,\u201d Rathus said. \u201c[The presumption in favour of equal shared parental responsibility] would have been part of all of the information that she will have been given. It would have been almost impossible for her to have resisted doing that.</p> <p>\u201cAnd if she had, it would have been very possible for him to accuse her of being an alienator, particularly as this is not a case that would have been described as aggressive violence. We know that family violence can be most dangerous when it isn\u2019t necessarily aggressive.\u201d</p> <p>Hanson said the murders of Clarke and her children were horrific and \u201cshould never happen. But it\u2019s on both sides.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI read your report and it is all about women,\u201d she told Rathus. \u201cDo you agree that there are men that are aggrieved? That there are men that are victims of domestic violence? That there are men that, you know, are taking their own lives?\u201d</p> <p>Rathus responded: \u201cI would prefer if you didn\u2019t ask me if I admitted things. I\u2019m not really here to admit things, senator. I\u2019m here to present my research. I\u2019ve been working in this area since 1981.</p> <p>\u201cThe statistics are very clear \u2013 that domestic violence is something that is very gendered and that violence in the home happens more often by men towards women.\u201d</p> <h2>Inquiry may encourage \u2018emotive responses from disaffected fathers\u2019</h2> <p>Rathus had expressed concern in her submission that the inquiry\u2019s terms of reference might unfortunately \u201cattract submissions and information from fathers who wish to claim that their former partner lied about violence in the relationship\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough it is true that both men and women do not always tell the truth in family law proceedings, this [inquiry] may encourage individual emotive responses from disaffected fathers which will draw sympathy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is almost certainly easier, and more common, for a perpetrator to dishonestly deny violence than for a \u2018non-victim\u2019 to make it up.\u201d</p> <p>Rathus and others have cited a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16293307\">Canadian study</a> that showed non-custodial parents, usually fathers, most frequently made intentionally false reports.</p> <p>Throughout the first week of hearings, Hanson and others have used mostly anecdotal accounts to support their positions, including <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/false-abuse-claims-are-the-new-court-weapon-retiring-judge-says-20130705-2phao.html\">seven-year-old comments from a retired New South Wales judge</a>.</p> <p>Price, from the Men\u2019s Rights Agency, said the Australian Institute of Criminology \u201cinflated\u201d its figures on parental homicide because it did not distinguish murders committed by stepfathers from biological fathers.</p> <p>Hanson cited government statistics that \u201cone woman a week and one man a month were killed by a current or former partner\u201d from 2012 to 2014.</p> <p>Samantha Jeffries, a criminologist from Griffith University, said those figures did not tell the full story about intimate-partner violence.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that women kill their intimate partners, that\u2019s usually done in retaliation, so it\u2019s usually self-defence because they\u2019ve been victims of domestic violence over a long period of time,\u201d Jeffries said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/oct/03/family-law-inquiry-is-no-sop-to-hanson-its-a-deliberate-move-to-bury-previous-reviews\">Family law inquiry is no sop to Hanson. It's a deliberate move to bury previous reviews | Jess Hill</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMany of the domestic violence death review committees have come to that conclusion, that when women kill their intimate partners it\u2019s usually because they\u2019ve been victims of domestic violence. When men kill their intimate partners it\u2019s because they\u2019ve had a long history of perpetrating domestic violence. There\u2019s a difference. You can throw the stats around, but the background and the reason is very different.\u201d</p> <p>Hanson replied: \u201cWe can all throw stats around to suit our own agenda.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018It\u2019s that urgency that\u2019s driving us\u2019</h2> <p>Last year, the Australian Law Reform Commission finished its own <a href=\"https://www.alrc.gov.au/news/family-law-inquiry-final-report-released/\">detailed inquiry into the family law system</a>. The decision to hold a parliamentary investigation was largely viewed as a concession to Hanson, whose One Nation party holds an influential position on the Senate crossbench.</p> <p>Hanson was made the deputy chair. On Thursday, she introduced herself as the \u201cco-chair\u201d of the inquiry.</p> <p>There is no live video broadcast supplied by the parliament, but the committee has agreed to an unusual filming protocol that allows members, their staff or the media to record. The video feed allows One Nation to give its own social media <strong> </strong>audience a window into the half-empty committee rooms. After the hearing is adjourned, Hanson responds directly to dozens of the comments made during her own live video feed.</p> <p>Larissa Waters, the Greens spokesperson for women, said the decision to hold another inquiry, rather than implement the law reform commission\u2019s recommendations, was \u201ca sop to One Nation\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s become One Nation\u2019s Queensland state election campaign, and women and children are the collateral damage,\u201d Waters said.</p> <p>Witnesses have told Guardian Australia they are concerned at the direction of the inquiry, and in particular that the legitimacy of the parliament has now been loaned to several groups promoting fringe, discredited and dangerous views.</p> <p>Angela Lynch, of the Women\u2019s Legal Service Queensland, said the process was \u201cpotentially dangerous\u201d because it delayed the implementation of needed reforms to prioritise the safety of victims of domestic violence.</p> <p>\u201cFor 25 or 30 years, these groups have consistently been saying the same thing, that women make up allegations of domestic violence, they stop men from seeing children. But they cannot point to any credible research that backs up these claims. It\u2019s the most over-researched, over-inquired area where we\u2019ve had inquiry after inquiry after inquiry. In any credible inquiry nowhere have they ever found evidence that\u2019s the situation.\u201d</p> <p>Lynch said she had concerns about what the parliamentary inquiry would ultimately decide, but that the urgent need for reform meant groups like the women\u2019s legal service were determined to participate.</p> <p>\u201cThe issue is that there\u2019s a level of urgency now. In the light of the Hannah Clarke murder, that really illustrates the danger that children and women are in. It\u2019s not something that can wait. It\u2019s that urgency that\u2019s driving us at the moment.\u201d</p>",

The virus was HIV.</p> <p>At the medical center where Birx worked as a US army physician, healthy young men were dying in droves from an illness no one could name.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re trained in medicine and it\u2019s the 80s and you\u2019ve got all this hi-tech stuff and this ability to diagnose everything,\u201d Birx said in <a href=\"https://www.bushcenter.org/publications/podcasts/channels/strategerist/s2-ep02-amb-birx.html\">a Sep 2019 interview</a> with the George W Bush Presidential Center, \u201cwhen you not only couldn\u2019t make a diagnosis, you didn\u2019t know what the problem was, and you didn\u2019t know how to treat it, it was devastating.\u201d</p> <p>But instead of being cowed, Birx twisted her heartbreak and confusion into research and treatment. In doing so, she embarked on a career dedicated to stopping HIV and Aids.</p> <p>Having gone head-to-head with global health leaders while overseeing a program responsible for saving millions of lives, Birx has become something of a legend in the global health community.</p> <p>Now her task is to stop the spread of Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cWhen it is a matter of making tough decisions, she will do it,\u201d said Dr Carlos del Rio, a professor in the global health department at Emory University who has known Birx for more than 20 years. \u201cAnd that, to me, is what we need right now.\u201d</p> <p>Birx will also need to manage her role in a tumultuous White House, where she has been placed as one of three people leading the US coronavirus response.</p> <p>The vice-president, Mike Pence, is overseeing a taskforce led by the health secretary, Alex Azar, but <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/07/trump-coronavirus-management-style-123465\">has said</a> Birx is his \u201cright arm\u201d.

The doctor ordered a transfusion but Birx had read a report about the mystery disease and the risks of such a process.</p> <p>\u201cDo not let them give me blood,\u201d she screamed, before passing out from pain.</p> <p>Her husband followed her orders, stopping a transfusion the hospital later revealed would have been contaminated with HIV.</p> <p>\u201cIt made her think hard not just about the perils of this new disease, but about her responsibility to fight it,\u201d Kerry said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bushcenter.org/publications/podcasts/channels/strategerist/s2-ep02-amb-birx.html\">In a September 2019</a> interview, Birx explained how the sacrifices of infected soldiers helped define her commitment to fighting the disease.</p> <p>\u201cThey died with such courage and such willingness to try different things, realizing it may not help them, but it would help the person behind them,\u201d she said. \u201cI just never saw that level of altruism, amidst just death and despair, from the patients themselves.\u201d</p> <p>She spent the next two decades helping to lead an influential HIV vaccine trial and providing important contributions to understanding the disease in the military, where she was promoted to colonel. She was lured out of the military after George W Bush started Pepfar in 2003.</p> <p>The program began when drugs to manage HIV/Aids and prevent its transmission were available in the US but not in Africa, where millions were dying. Birx joined two years later, overseeing programs led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p> <p>Her work has taken her around the globe to study and learn and to ensure US money funding such programs is used effectively. Del Rio, who chairs the scientific advisory board for Pepfar, said Birx had confronted global health leaders misusing US funds.</p> <p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t say, \u2018We\u2019ll give you another opportunity,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cShe stands up to a minister of health and says: \u2018I\u2019m sorry but we\u2019re not doing that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>At one point, the World Health Organization called for people to stop using a HIV/Aids medicine. Scientists at Pepfar thought it was the wrong call. Birx listened to them, then ignored the WHO.</p> <p>\u201cAt the end of the day, she was right,\u201d Del Rio said. \u201cThis is the right decision. She listened to the data, she looked at the data and she said, \u2018Let\u2019s proceed.\u2019 She is a bold leader. I have a lot of respect for her.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><strong>04.30:</strong> Alarm goes off and my face scrunches up; is it really that time? I know I\u2019m in for a long, busy day. That\u2019s always a given.

These CSN\u2019s pop up regularly and provide us evidence-based, safety-related information. We must familiarise ourselves with them. Today\u2019s notice is about Covid-19.

Before we even get a whiff of beans, the radio calls us for a job. <em>Car 288, we have a 1C breathing difficulties for you</em>. A priority 1 job means lights and sirens. The notes drop down on our screen, a 93-year-old female can\u2019t breathe. Not much information, we respond briskly.</p> <p><strong>06:08:</strong> We arrive at the nursing home and greet our patient. She is breathing, but with some difficulty. I have a listen to her chest, wheezy. After some oxygen and a nebuliser she has settled but must still come to hospital. \u201cHas she had any overseas travel recently?\u201d I ask a bemused looking nurse. \u201cShe is bed-bound,\u201d the nurse replies. I feel silly asking but we\u2019re expected to.</p> <p><strong>09:30: </strong>We arrive at the hospital. They\u2019re already at capacity, in fact the waiting room is overflowing on to the footpath outside. Our case is considered \u201clow acuity\u201d so we must wait in the corridor with our patient on our stretcher until we\u2019re allocated a hospital bed. I get chatting with the triage nurse. She tells me the latest from what she calls the Covid chronicles, of people coming in, sometimes with no symptoms besides fear. They are already one of Sydney\u2019s busiest hospitals. \u201cIt\u2019s the social media\u2019s fault,\u201d she says. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Covid-19 is a big topic now. We were warned early but none of us expected it to blow up like this</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>09:45:</strong> Coffee in hand and paperwork completed, we\u2019re ready to respond. The next few hours roll by as usual. A 49-year-old male with chest pain, another couple of nursing homes. Al and I talk about the job we\u2019re on our way to, but now the chat isn\u2019t the usual. Covid-19 is a big topic now, we\u2019re all talking about it. We were warned early but none of us expected it to blow up like this. I feel a mild anxiety about it, enough to keep me alert but stopping short of fear. It certainly makes me feel uneasy when words like pandemic are being used. We\u2019re running low on masks, we have protocols but they are vague, none of us know exactly what to do. Misinformation is spreading fear and we\u2019re doing our best to remain focused on our task.</p> <p><strong>15:40:</strong> <em>Car 288, we have a medical transfer for you</em>. The notes drop down. It\u2019s a medical centre: nausea, backpain, sore throat, headache. Not an abnormal job, someone just feels generally unwell. More script appears on the screen: PT works at the airport and has had symptoms for five days, doctor won\u2019t assess patient as querying coronavirus. Frustration sets in. \u201cWhy does the doctor think it\u2019s OK for us to assess the patient if they don\u2019t want to?\u201d Al laments. I agree. Our job isn\u2019t just about turning up and taking someone to hospital, it\u2019s never that simple. We provide pre-hospital treatment, resolve social issues, relationship problems, family disputes. People sometimes call us when they have nowhere else to turn. It\u2019s the part of the job I enjoy the most.</p> <p>But when we feel like we are being made the sacrificial lamb by doctors unwilling to provide frontline services, it grates. Don\u2019t get me wrong, most GPs do a fantastic job keeping people out of the hospital system. But it does happen, and more often now.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/this-is-a-mess-put-on-your-mask-diary-from-the-frontline-of-the-coronavirus-health-crisis\">'This is a mess.

By this time Al and I have donned all our protective wear \u2013 long-sleeved yellow gowns, respiratory masks, gloves and goggles. We now feel a little overdressed for the occasion. After gathering more of the story from the GP, I also suspect it\u2019s mental health-related. But we are required to rule out an organic cause before a mental health assessment is commenced. Al is in agreement with my plan, but he is the only one. Both GP and police don\u2019t seem impressed that I have decided to follow Covid-19 protocol. We receive the same dismissive response at the hospital by triage staff. \u201cShe\u2019s a regular, she can go to the waiting room,\u201d the triage nurse tells me. Deflated, we offload our patient and return to base. Sometimes it feels like you can\u2019t win.</p> <p><strong>19:05:</strong> Back at station finishing our shift an hour late. Not too bad \u2013 it can often be more. While restocking the car, Al and I talk about the day. We both feel frustrated by the lack of cooperation between agencies but hindsight gives us some perspective. Everyone is working for the same outcome, balancing our safety with what\u2019s best for the patient. This is where differences in opinions develop \u2013 all the guidelines in the world can\u2019t account for differing perceptions.</p> <p>This is where my concerns regarding Covid-19 lie. Our healthcare system is world-class, we often forget that. We have so many avenues to access medical assistance, from HealthDirect, which is a 24-hour advice line, to home doctors, GP clinics and, of course, the ambulance service. Call any time day or night and we\u2019ll turn up to your front door. But the system is a complex beast, with multiple agencies and disciplines coexisting, so cooperating and collaborating is a fine balancing act at the best of times.

Some 40% of the fledgling nation\u2019s population (predominantly men aged between 25 and 40 \u2013 a similar demographic to that which contributed most to this commonwealth\u2019s world war one fatality lists) would contract the flu that ultimately killed 13,000 Australians and 50 million people worldwide. And by mid-late 1919 \u2013 by which time the Australian papers were filled with articles about the hundreds of people who were dying weekly \u2013 the federation, still working on the myth that nationhood stemmed from a foreign war, was buckling in the face of contagion.</p> <p>As the historian <a href=\"https://honesthistory.net.au/wp/mcqueen-humphrey-spanish-flu-pandemic-australia-1912-19/\">Humphrey McQueen writes in The Spanish Influenza Epidemic in Australia, 1918-19</a>: \u201cIn 1915 an external menace had driven Australians together; by 1919, an internal danger revealed yet again how easy it was for Australian to stand apart.

The states effectively ceded control of borders and interstate traffic to the commonwealth.</p> <p>The first diagnosed case in New South Wales challenged the integrity of that agreement. He was a returned soldier who had come to Sydney from Melbourne. Victoria, despite medical evidence to the contrary, had not notified the commonwealth of the Spanish flu in its midst. It was only after NSW notified the commonwealth (its headquarters and federal parliament were based at the time in Melbourne) that Victoria itself made the formal notification. NSW, blaming Victoria for the transmission, responded unilaterally, shutting its border with Victoria and walking away from the agreement.</p> <p>Once transmitted to Australia the flu rapidly escaped a quarantine system whose efficacy relied on the honesty of ship medical officers to volunteer past or present cases on board, and the willingness of returned soldiers to self-report and voluntarily isolate themselves rather than seek \u201ccures\u201d.</p> <p>Quackery was rampant. The broader medical fraternity was divided on origins of the flu, methods and bases of diagnosis, and possible treatment.</p> <p>Then \u2013 as now with coronavirus \u2013 \u201cforeigners\u201d, even those who\u2019d been in Australia for generations, were treated with utmost suspicion.</p> <p>Indeed, in Australia and throughout allied Europe and the US, the supposed genesis of the Spanish flu had its foundations firmly in fear and blame of the other, not least the old enemy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/spanish-flu-pandemic-centenary-first-world-war\">Spanish flu: the killer that still stalks us, 100 years on</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis modern plague \u2026 has commonly been called Spanish influenza,\u201d <a href=\"https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/140221010\">the Australasian of 29 March 1919 reported</a>. \u201cYet it did not originate in Spain, nor was it exactly the grippe or influenza of other days. It appears that the Germans, in anticipation that the malady might be justly named German plague \u2026 broadcast a misleading name which they had craftily devised before the infection spread from Germany to other countries.\u201d</p> <p>There was no evidence the pandemic began in Germany. Epidemiologists have since determined it was likely that servicemen from the US \u2013 who entered the war late \u2013 brought a milder flu strain to Europe. It then transmogrified into the Spanish flu (so named because the king of Spain was among the first to die of it).</p> <p>In Australia schools were closed, sporting events \u2013 if they proceeded \u2013 were unattended, and worshippers stayed away from church.

Video conferencing for office meetings or school lessons, logging into networks remotely or using Netflix to cure the boredom all mean the amount of bandwidth the average home needs is going to go up significantly.</p> <p>According to NBN Co, last year the average download a day across Australia was close to 7GB, while on its busiest day (Boxing Day) it was close to 12GB. More people at home will likely push it up somewhere near the latter.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/the-family-lockdown-guide-how-to-emotionally-prepare-for-coronavirus-quarantine\">The family lockdown guide: how to emotionally prepare for coronavirus quarantine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Research by the then-department of communications <a href=\"https://www.communications.gov.au/publications/demand-fixed-line-broadband-australia\">in 2018</a> estimated that by 2026 the maximum that Australian households made up of two adults and two children would need was 49Mbps download speeds in peak use times. That is assuming one of the adults is making a video call, the other is streaming a video and browsing online on their phone and the two children are watching YouTube and gaming online, and a software update is downloading.</p> <p>In theory, this should mean that more than half the population on the NBN should have sufficient speeds. According to NBN Co, as of the middle of last year, 64% of homes and businesses on a fixed-line connection or the fixed wireless 4G service had connections of 50Mbps or over.</p> <p>But whether it achieves that speed will depend on a variety of factors. First, the technology you\u2019re connected to. If you are on fibre-to-the-premises, there should be no immediate issue getting that speed. If you are on fibre-to-the-node or fibre-to-the-kerb, it will largely depend on the quality of the copper line from the node to the home. The poorer the line, the slower the download speed.</p> <p>According to the competition regulator\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/internet-landline-services/broadband-performance-data\">latest report</a>, just 80% of fibre-to-the-node connections could reach their maximum download speed in the busiest hour of the day. The issue has led to Telstra <a href=\"https://www.itnews.com.au/news/telstra-stops-offering-100mbps-services-for-nbn-fttn-b-c-users-538601\">killing off the 100Mbps plans</a> for people connecting to the NBN this way.</p> <p>If you are on cable, which NBN bought off Telstra and still used to deliver Foxtel, you may struggle due to <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/telecommunications/labor-attacks-nbn-s-costly-unnecessary-mistake-20200310-p548ok\">a high number of outages</a> on the service, but the speed ranks similar to fibre-to-the-premises, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.</p> <p>Around a third of people on the fixed wireless 4G connections get only between 3Mbps and 25Mbps on the service during the busy times, according to NBN Co\u2019s latest statistics. In a lockdown period, those busy times would go up, reducing the download speed.</p> <p>Those in regional and remote areas of Australia are going to struggle the most. The satellite services covering about 400,000 homes and now connected to close to 100,000 can order only a maximum of 25Mbps plans. Any uptick in demand is likely to strain this service and make it more difficult to reach even 25Mbps.</p> <p>You may want to review your plan and upgrade to a higher speed tier if you can. The ACCC\u2019s report <a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/internet-landline-services/broadband-performance-data\">also highlights</a> which internet service providers perform better.

  "<p>A decorated police chief convicted of possessing a video of child sexual abuse was found guilty of gross misconduct and sacked despite an extraordinary outpouring of support warning that her dismissal would damage the service\u2019s reputation.</p> <p>Metropolitan police Supt Robyn Williams was convicted last November after her sister sent her the video via WhatsApp, wanting those behind it hunted down and punished. Williams said she never watched the video. She was cleared of a charge of covering up knowledge of the video to protect her sister, who sent it to 16 other people. Only Williams was arrested despite others having it for longer or actually playing the clip.</p> <p>On Friday Williams went before a Met special <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/10/met-officer-in-child-abuse-video-case-faces-fast-track-dismissal\">fast-track disciplinary hearing</a>, which had the power to order her sacking. The hearing, before assistant commissioner Helen Ball, found that the conviction amounted to gross misconduct, enough to see her 36-year policing career end with instant dismissal.</p> <p>Williams showed no reaction as Ball announced she should be dismissed without notice: \u201cIt is entirely unacceptable for police officers responsible for enforcing the law to break it themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Ball rejected claims that Williams had been treated differently because of her race, as claimed by the Metropolitan Black Police Association, and said: \u201cI want to make clear that racial bias has played no part in my decision.\u201d</p> <p>Ball said Williams had been a role model, but the conviction showed fatal flaws in her judgment and truthfulness. Immediately afterwards Williams had to hand in her warrant card as her policing career ended.</p> <p>Before reaching her decision, Ball heard a phalanx of pleas for leniency from police officers and community figures. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, wrote that Williams\u2019s work after the 2017 Grenfell disaster had been invaluable. Despite the criminal conviction, Hewitt wrote: \u201cI believe she still has a contribution to make to policing.\u201d</p> <p>Yvette Williams from Justice for Grenfell, the community group fighting for victims of the fire, wrote: \u201cWherever Robyn Williams goes, confidence in policing increases.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the conviction for possessing the video, junior and senior colleagues wrote that they still trusted Williams and some feared that her sacking would damage the Met\u2019s reputation and already fraught relationship with African-Caribbean communities.</p> <p>The manager of the charity shop where Williams worked for free for 200 hours as part of her sentence revealed that having completed those hours, the officer had continued working at the shop twice a week as a volunteer.</p> <p>Williams\u2019s barrister, Gerard Boyle QC, said: \u201cShe poses no risk to anyone, let alone children or young people. The circumstances of this case are exceptional and unusual.\u201d</p> <p>Williams is appealing against her conviction by majority verdict in November 2019, and the court of appeal is yet to decide whether it will hear her case.</p> <p>Williams, 54, was one of the most senior female African-Caribbean officers in Britain and a founder member of the National Black Police Association, and helped to set up a gay police association.

  "<p>Pressure is growing on care homes to close their doors to all family and friends despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-governments-coronavirus-advice-and-why-it-gave-it\">updated government guidance</a>, after Bupa said on Friday that it was advising against visits except in exceptional circumstances.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Bupa, which runs 125 care homes for 6,500 residents, said: \u201cWe are continuing to keep our residents, relatives and staff safe and well, so are taking additional measures by minimising visits to our care homes.\u201d </p> <p>The move comes as critics including the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt have expressed concern about the government\u2019s decision to delay more drastic measures, suggesting it could lead to more people catching the virus.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s extremely grave,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cWe are in a national emergency \u2026 Many people will be very concerned [by the decision to keep schools open and not cancel large events].</p> <p>\u201cThe other message \u2026 was that if we are to give people the care they need, when the worst hits us we need to \u2018flatten the peak\u2019 and spread the pressure on the NHS \u2026 I\u2019m personally surprised that we\u2019re still allowing external visits to care homes.\u201d</p> <p>But others have condemned the decision by Bupa and other care homes up and down the country as breaching residents\u2019 human rights and putting their mental health at risk.</p> <p>Judy Downey, the chair of the Relatives and Residents Association, said she was very worried by care homes closing their doors to visitors.</p> <p>\u201cWe have tin-pot dictators telling people that they can\u2019t visit their parents and partners based on something they have half-heard,\u201d she said, adding she also knew of a woman who had been told by a nurse that she couldn\u2019t visit her mother, who lives in her own home.</p> <p>\u201cResidents can get very distressed if their relatives stop visiting,\u201d she added. \u201cIf you had the choice, at the end of your life, between not seeing your children or dying more quickly, which would you choose? I\u2019d choose the latter.</p> <p>\u201cJust as importantly: it\u2019s not legal to ban visits from friends and family,\u201d she said. \u201cResidents have a right to family and private life, the right to choose and the right to be visited.\u201d</p> <p>But Nadra Ahmed, chair of the National Care Association, said the measures were only being taken after discussions with residents, staff and families or friends. \u201cProviders are taking these steps to protect the residents and staff. They are taking steps to increase communication options via telephones etc. The advice remains for relatives who do visit to ensure that they are free of the virus and to comply with precautionary processes.</p> <p>\u201cCare providers are working hard to mitigate the risks to the vulnerable people they care for and their workforce, but know that they cannot completely eradicate the risk as there will be circumstances under which families and friends will be enabled to visit,\u201d she added.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-residential-care-supported-living-and-home-care-guidance\">Updated guidance</a> for residential care, supported living and home care providers was issued by the government on Friday. It advised care home providers to review their visiting policy, by asking no one to visit who has suspected Covid-19 or is generally unwell, and by emphasising good hand hygiene for visitors. Contractors on site should be kept to a minimum.</p> <p>But the review said care homes should also consider the wellbeing of residents, and the positive impact of seeing friends and family.</p> <p>One person who works in a care home for the elderly, who did not want to disclose their name, told the Guardian they believed all care homes should close to all visitors. \u201cThe majority of residents are [in their] late 80s to 90s and are frail with underlying health conditions. They would not survive the virus.</p> <p>\u201cIt only takes one unsuspecting person to carry it into the home. We already know that we could have it without knowing. Placing elderly people at risk is a safeguarding issue and the government are responsible for this.\u201d</p> <p>Hazel, whose 97-year-old mother is in a care home with severe dementia, added: \u201cShe\u2019s extremely frail and extremely vulnerable. One coronavirus case could wipe out a dementia home \u2026 as a matter of safety I have stopped visiting the home, even though there\u2019s no restrictions.\u201d</p> <p>But other relatives of care home residents are concerned by the restrictions. John, whose relative has dementia and is in their 90s, said: \u201cThey will be very anxious and will feel abandoned without being able to understand why \u2013 it feels like a bereavement, and I don\u2019t think I will see them again. I\u2019m worried they may be so distressed they just give up.</p> <p>\u201cClosing their doors feels draconian and more in the care home\u2019s interests than the residents\u2019, and not compatible with government advice,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I don\u2019t dare complain because I feel it could rebound on my relative.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Lucy Series, a senior research fellow and lecturer in law at Cardiff University, said: \u201cCare homes do not have legal authority to simply place residents in preventive isolation without some lawful authority, like the Mental Capacity Act 2005 deprivation of liberty safeguards. If they have no clear legal authority, and this is a blanket lock-down, this could potentially amount to an unlawful detention.</p> <p>\u201cRestricting access to visitors is also an interference with fundamental human rights to family life that would normally require some kind of clear policy to implement unless it is a very short-term measure,\u201d added Series, who also holds a Wellcome society and ethics research fellowship.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lawrence-o-gostin/\">Lawrence Gostin</a>, a Fulbright fellow and law professor who specialises in public health law, said that while we must take \u201caggressive measures\u201d to keep nursing home residents safe, \u201cthere is no legal authority and therefore there can and should be no lockdown. It should \u2013 and could \u2013 be accomplished on a voluntary basis.\u201d</p> <p>Other experts questioned whether severe restrictions on visitors would be effective, pointing out that the policy would bring its own risks.</p> <p>Marion Shoard, an activist and author, said:<em> \u201c</em>Barring visitors would leave homes free to operate largely outside the public gaze, increasing the chances of abuse of all kinds.</p> <p>\u201cIn addition, by far the largest number of people entering a home on a daily basis from the outside world are the staff who, by the very nature of their work in helping with personal care, get close up to residents.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 March 2020. An earlier version was wrong to say that Bupa had \u201cannounced\u201d its new visitation policy.</p>",

  "<p>Covid-19 could permanently shift working patterns as companies forced to embrace remote working by the pandemic find that their employees do not want to return to the office once the closures are lifted.</p> <p>The sudden increase in working from home is presenting problems as well as opportunities: on the one hand, startups such as Slack and Zoom and established giants including Google and Microsoft are offering their tools for free, in the hope that people who start using them in a crisis may carry on once normality returns.</p> <p>On the other hand, some systems are already creaking at the edges. Corporate networks, unused to having a majority of their connections coming in over virtual private networks (VPNs), are experiencing unusual quirks, while internet service providers have come under pressure to lift bandwidth caps so that remote workers do not get cut off from their employers halfway through the month.</p> <p>But it looks increasingly as if the situation will not ever go back to how it was: many employees for companies who have sent all staff home are already starting to question why they had to go in to the office in the first place.</p> <p>Large technology firms were some of the first to make the switch to remote working for all their staff, building on pre-existing infrastructure such as office chat groups, remote access to critical tools, and the fact that much knowledge work can be carried out remotely.</p> <p>In Seattle, the hub of many of America\u2019s early Covid-19 cases, companies including Amazon, LinkedIn, Microsoft and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/coronavirus-google-tech-dublin-twitter-work-from-home\">Google advised workers to stop coming in to the office</a> in late February. In early March, Twitter \u201cstrongly advised\u201d all its employees worldwide to do the same, and on Wednesday, made it compulsory.</p> <p>\u201cWe understand this is an unprecedented step, but these are unprecedented times,\u201d Twitter\u2019s head of HR, Jennifer Christie, said in a message to staff. Christie promised to reimburse employees, including hourly workers, for the expenses required to set up home offices, covering the costs of buying things such as computer hardware, desks and ergonomic chairs. \u201cOverall, working from home doesn\u2019t change your day-to-day work, it just means you\u2019ll be doing it from a different environment,\u201d Christie added.</p> <p>Those sorts of investments have prompted many to wonder if companies that embrace remote working in a crisis may find it sticks around as normality returns. It is harder to say no to employee requests for working from home if HR has already bought them a new desk \u2013 and it is easier to view the investment as a sensible one if it pays off for years, rather than months, to come.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not how I envisioned the distributed work revolution taking hold,\u201d <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2020/03/coronavirus-remote-work/\">said </a><a href=\"https://ma.tt/2020/03/coronavirus-remote-work/\">Matt Mullenweg</a>, chief executive of WordPress and Tumblr owner Automattic.

Microsoft has made its cloud \u201cproductivity suite\u201d free to small businesses for the next six months, including its Slack competitor, Teams.

Some have been comparatively minor: Facebook employees found their corporate network was banned from the takeaway service DoorDash for suspicious behaviour, as the company\u2019s entire workforce began placing orders for delivery all over the Bay Area in California while logged in to a VPN connecting from the same IP address.</p> <p>Others have been more serious. An early fear that home broadband networks would collapse under the weight of usage was quelled by UK service providers, whose trade body, ISPA, pointed out that evening peak activity, when the nation sits down to stream Netflix and play online video games, is often 10 times the typical daytime demand.</p> <p>More pressing is the fact that internet usage in general is increasing across the board. Cloudflare, which provides online infrastructure that underpins a huge swathe of the internet, says it has been tracking the increase. <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-during-the-coronavirus-emergency/\">Its chief executive, </a><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-during-the-coronavirus-emergency/\">Matthew Prince</a><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-during-the-coronavirus-emergency/\">, says</a> that \u201cas more people work from home, peak traffic in impacted regions has increased, on average, approximately 10%. In Italy, which has imposed a nationwide quarantine, peak internet traffic is up 30%. Traffic patterns have also shifted so peak traffic is occurring earlier in the day in impacted regions.\u201d</p> <p>The real problems start when schools get suspended.

  "<p>The pilot of the plane carrying the professional footballer Emiliano Sala was not licensed to fly the aircraft that plunged into the sea, killing both of them, an official report has concluded.</p> <p>David Ibbotson had not completed night-flying training or recently practised instrument flying, a vital skill when piloting a plane on a dark night in poor weather, and the aircraft was travelling far faster than it should have been just before the accident.</p> <p>Investigators concluded that Ibbotson was being paid to fly Sala even though under the terms of his private pilot\u2019s licence this was not allowed, and said the regulations under which the light aircraft operated also meant it should have not been flown commercially.</p> <p>The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) concluded that the loss of control that led to the crash was made more likely by the fact that neither the pilot nor the plane had the required licences or permissions for the flight.</p> <p>Investigators found such unlicensed \u201cgrey\u201d flights frequently took place in the world of sport, business and leisure and called for more action to clamp down on them. The Civil Aviation Authority\u2019s (CAA) investigation and enforcement team is continuing to carry out a criminal investigation into the accident.</p> <p>Argentinian striker Sala, 28, was being flown from Nantes in France to his new club Cardiff City when the aircraft plunged into the English Channel on 21 January 2019. His body was recovered from the seabed 68 metres down.</p> <p>In a statement, Sala\u2019s family in Argentina said the report carried a huge amount of important technical detail. But they added: \u201cThe report leaves many questions for the inquest to address. It is crucial that the information held by the police and which went into compiling this report now be made available to the coroner and in turn to the family.</p> <p>\u201cOver a year has passed since Emiliano Sala died. His family remain distraught by their loss but determined to find the full truth of how and why he died, which requires the inquest to be held without delay.\u201d</p> <p>According to the report, Ibbotson, 59, from Lincolnshire, whose body has not been recovered, heard a \u201cbang\u201d or \u201cboom\u201d during the outward flight and \u201csensed\u201d mist in the aircraft \u2013 but may have felt under pressure to make the return flight.</p> <p>The report said: \u201cPayment brings with it some pressures for a flight to be completed so that the fee will be paid and, perhaps, to realise the opportunity to secure work in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Investigators believe Ibbotson was probably suffering from carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning when the accident happened, possibly caused by a fault in the exhaust tailpipe that allowed gas to enter the cabin through the heating system.</p> <p>The AAIB called for it to be made mandatory for planes to carry CO monitors \u2013 which it said cost as little as \u00a315 but could tackle what they described as the \u201csilent killer\u201d.</p> <p>Crispin Orr, chief inspector of the AAIB, said routine maintenance could not eliminate the risk of carbon monoxide leaks completely, but added: \u201cEquipping aircraft with devices that provide warning of the presence of this odourless, colourless and lethal gas, would enable pilots to take potentially lifesaving action.\u201d</p> <p>On the issue of neither pilot nor aircraft having the correct licences, he said: \u201cThe chartering of aircraft that are not licensed for commercial transport \u2013 so called \u2018grey charters\u2019 \u2013 is putting lives at risk.\u201d</p> <p>The report found that Ibbotson was probably manoeuvring to avoid poor weather \u2013 heavy rain showers - just before the plane crashed. It descended rapidly towards the sea and at the last minute, the pilot tried to pull up, suggesting that he was still conscious. This attempted manoeuvre caused such stress that it caused a wing and the tail section to break away.</p> <p>Investigators concluded that the plane was flying at 245 knots at the time of the accident \u2013 far above the 203 knots maximum speed allowed for the aircraft.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/11/no-action-taken-against-yorkshire-man-arrested-emiliano-sala-death\">No action taken against Yorkshire man arrested over Emiliano Sala death</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The report also said the autopilot had been diagnosed as having an intermittent fault.

In such a situation, trust in what the government is saying and doing is essential. Panic-buying is one indicator that their communication is falling short. Another is the mismatch of messages between the chief medical officer and deputy chief medical officer in terms of impact. Saying that the NHS is different from other health systems does not explain why Italy appears to have a higher mortality rate when, according to independent experts, it has one of the best health systems in the world.</p> <p>While the government is saying it will be driven by the science, the evidence behind such decision making has not been made public. UK epidemiologists have an excellent record of estimating the likely spread of diseases, acknowledging the uncertainties and the range of likely outcomes. There will always be a trade off between precautionary protective measures and other impacts.</p> <p>The decisions made as to how to manage those risks are political ones and, whatever the situation, these decisions need to be subject to challenge as to whether they are adequately protecting the public. That cannot take place, and public confidence cannot be assured, without greater transparency.<br><strong>Neil Martinson</strong><br><em>Former director of communications, Food Standards Agency</em></p> <p>\u2022 The government is telling us that its current recommendations on delaying the spread of Covid-19 are based on scientific recommendations.

This astounds me considering that in China, the centre of the infection, confirmed cases peaked well within this timeframe.</p> <p>The efforts of the Chinese government to lock down cities and enforce social distancing have been effective in bringing the outbreak under control there. The rest of the world, including some of our closest neighbours, seems to be taking heed of the Chinese experience, yet we are failing to do so.

  "<p>The startling spread of the coronavirus across the globe is causing understandable alarm. But though it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions about how many deaths may occur, the statistics do point to general trends that can get lost in the drama.</p> \n<p>At present, one thing that does seem clear is that the vast majority of people who get the disease will survive.</p> \n<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated the mortality rate from Covid-19 is about 3.4%. That is higher than seasonal flu and is cause for concern \u2013 but even if it is correct, more than 96% of people who become infected with the coronavirus will recover.</p> \n<p>Any death is, of course, devastating for the families involved. But it is also worth noting the WHO estimate is based on confirmed infections and deaths, meaning it does not take into account mild cases that may not be diagnosed \u2013 cases that would lower the mortality rate.</p> \n<p>Indeed experts say that, in reality, the mortality rate is likely to be nearer to 1% or less. In other words, more than 99% of those who become infected are expected to survive.</p> \n<p>And not everyone will become infected. According to the chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, the worst-case scenario is that about 80% of the UK population becomes infected. But that does not necessarily mean there will be 500,000 deaths \u2013 as would be expected from a 1% mortality rate.</p> \n<p>One reason is because the 80% figure is an estimate. \u201cThat is an entirely speculative number,\u201d Whitty told the press conference, adding that it was not known how many people would ultimately become infected.</p> \n<p>Another factor that will affect the number of deaths, and hence mortality rate, is who gets infected. According to figures from the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, those aged 10-39 have a 0.2% mortality rate, while those in their 60s have a mortality rate of 3.6%. For those aged 80 and older this rises to almost 15%.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/two-zip/giv-3902FgOLd0cMi8q4/\" data-alt=\"china stuudy\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/two-zip/giv-3902FgOLd0cMi8q4/\">china stuudy</a> \n</figure> \n<p>While such figures may seem alarming, particularly for the elderly, it means that if the spread of Covid-19 to the most vulnerable populations can be prevented, or at least limited, there will be far fewer deaths than may otherwise be expected.</p> \n<p>In other words, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-ill-disabled-people\">protecting the vulnerable</a>, including those with underlying health conditions, is crucial.</p> \n<p>Experts currently caution against reading too much into figures from the UK. On Friday morning there were 798 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the UK, and 10 deaths \u2013 although the prime minister, Boris Johnson, has suggested as many as 10,000 people in the UK could be already infected with the virus.</p> \n<p>But simply looking at the current snapshot can be misleading \u2013 because of the time lag between infection, disease and death, those who have already died would have been infected earlier, when the number of cases were lower, while there has also been a rapid uptick in new cases.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is still technically early [in the outbreak]. You are not quite sure if the cases and the deaths are representative of what will pan out in the long term,\u201d said Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health, University of Southampton. \u201cAs we go forward we will basically have better data,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>One thing that is clear is that mortality rates do differ from country to country. At present, Italy has been estimated to have a mortality rate of more than 6%, while in South Korea <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-response-specialre/italy-and-south-korea-virus-outbreaks-reveal-disparity-in-deaths-and-tactics-idUSKBN20Z27P\">the mortality rate</a> has been estimated at below 1%.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-13T16:05:02/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Fatality rate\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-13T16:05:02/embed.html\">Fatality rate</a> \n</figure> \n<p>It is difficult to unpick exactly what is behind such differences. However a number of factors may be at play, including how many people are being tested: aggressive testing may flag up milder cases that would otherwise have been missed, meaning the crude mortality rate is lower.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/13/why-regular-handwashing-can-be-bad-advice-for-patients\">The hellish side of handwashing: how coronavirus is affecting people with OCD</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Indeed it is believed that the coronavirus may have been circulating unnoticed in northern Italy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/from-confidence-to-quarantine-how-coronavirus-swept-italy\">since mid-January</a>, while it took repeated hospital visits before a 38-year-old man with symptoms was diagnosed with Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Other factors include the type of public health measures being employed, and the demographics of the population.

But with the recent coronavirus outbreak, being sick is no longer something people can shrug off given the illness\u2019s ability to spread rapidly and efficiently.</p> <p>The culture around sick leave in the food service industry is that it is nearly nonexistent. The CDC says that 15% of food workers have <a href=\"https://blogs.cdc.gov/yourhealthyourenvironment/2016/12/05/food-workers-working-while-sick/\">paid sick leave</a>. That means a bulk of people in the industry are part of the 32 million American workers who are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/lack-paid-sick-leave-will-leave-millions-us-workers-vulnerable-coronavirus\">without paid sick leave</a>.</p> <p>Poor sick leave policies are an \u201cindustry standard\u201d in food service, particularly fast food, said Judy Conti, government affairs director for the National Employment Law Center. The US does not have a federal sick leave policy, with 12 states and Washington DC having paid sick leave <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/paid-sick-leave.aspx\">laws</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWorkers are getting low wage to begin with, so it\u2019s really disadvantageous for them to take time off from work because they won\u2019t get paid,\u201d Conti said.</p> <p>Maurilia Arellanes, who works at a McDonald\u2019s in San Jose, California, said that she took a day off during the week to recover from the flu last year. When she came back to work, she found that she lost a chunk of the hours she was typically assigned to work.</p> <p>\u201cI went from working 35 hours a week to 27 hours a week. I had spent a month asking and begging my managers to get me back my normal shifts,\u201d Arellanes said. \u201cWorkers like me are paid wages so low that we are dependent on every cent we earn on our shift.\u201d</p> <p>Arellanes is part of the Fight for $15, a workers\u2019 rights <a href=\"https://fightfor15.org/fight-for-15-covid-19-mcdonalds-demands/\">campaign</a> that has called on McDonald\u2019s to give all workers in its corporate and franchise location paid sick leave if an employee or a close family member has tested positive for coronavirus and must be quarantined. They also demand that the company provide paid leave for parents who care for children of closed schools and cover the cost of testing and treatment of the virus.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I called in sick recently, I had to miss a payment on my electric bill and pleaded with the utility company for an extension,\u201d said Fran Marion, a McDonald\u2019s worker in Kansas City, Missouri, also part of Fight for $15. \u201cIf any of us had to be quarantined for two weeks \u2026 the effects would be devastating for our families.\u201d</p> <p>In response to the campaign, McDonald\u2019s made an announcement that they will <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-10/mcdonald-s-to-pay-corporate-workers-for-two-weeks-in-quarantine\">offer up to 14 days</a> of paid sick leave to any employee of corporate-owned restaurants who is quarantined with coronavirus. A vast <a href=\"https://www.qsrmagazine.com/news/mcdonalds-franchisees-share-predictions-2018\">majority</a> of McDonald\u2019s restaurants, above 90%, are not corporate-owned but are owned by franchisees.</p> <p>\u201cAs we proactively monitor the impact of the coronavirus, we are continuously evaluating our policies to provide flexibility and reasonable accommodations,\u201d a McDonald\u2019s spokesperson wrote in statement.</p> <p>Even with paid sick leave, workplace culture in the food service industry encourages ill employees to make their shift rather than having someone rush to find a replacement.</p> <p>Luis Torres, another Chipotle worker in New York City, says that managers at his location will often \u201cguilt\u201d employees into working while sick, saying that they are busy and do not have enough people working. \u201cI\u2019ve kind of normalized it, many people have normalized it,\u201d Torres said.</p> <p>Chipotle as a company offers three days of paid sick leave each year, but employees in New York City associated with the local 32BJ SEIU union, including Hernandez and Torres, <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/chipotle-workers-demand-company-comply-sick-leave-laws-amid-covid-19-outbreak\">went on strike</a> last week in response to what they say is the company not following local sick leave laws.

Employees that are not feeling well are required to stay home and we\u2019ll welcome them back when they are symptom free,\u201d a Chipotle spokesperson wrote in a statement to the Guardian.</p> <p>From a public health perspective, actively encouraging employees to take time off while sick is important for industries such as food service whose work requires employees to come in direct contact with people.</p> <p>But the food industry has been particularly susceptible to high turnover because it typically produces high-pressure and fast-paced environments, putting pressure on managers to have all hands on deck even when employees are ill.</p> <p>\u201cMissing one person out of a system in a restaurant or a food [service] setting is really problematic\u201d for efficiency and quality in a restaurant, said Ben Chapman, a professor and food safety extension specialist at North Carolina State University. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem in public health that we haven\u2019t really gotten our hands around.\u201d</p> <p>Chapman said while coronavirus is not at a stage where people should be avoiding restaurants, \u201cpeople should be wary of being around people who are ill\u201d.</p>",

And the delays in testing sum up why fears are still growing for our safety: despite the brilliance of Britain\u2019s medics, the government still seems behind the coronavirus curve.</p> <p>Of course, the very idea of global collaboration \u2013 and the convening of what would be a \u201cvirtual\u201d G20 \u2013 sits uneasily with the \u201cAmerica first\u201d, \u201cChina first\u201d, \u201cIndia first\u201d and \u201cRussia first\u201d populist nationalism that has been subdividing our world. Since the high point of cooperation in 2009, nationalists have been in the ascendant \u2013 building walls, closing borders, clamping down on immigrants and imposing tariffs. And what was first a protectionist nationalism has morphed into an aggressive us-versus-them unilateralism.</p> <p>Our willingness to cooperate is becoming inversely related to our need to do so, and this insularity means we are fighting today\u2019s pandemic with under-resourced international institutions, not least a WHO to which ever more responsibilities have been added without the financial means to discharge them. In fact, despite a number of laudable post-Ebola initiatives \u2013 including the new vaccine fund (Cepi) \u2013 we are <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2020/02/11/preparing-for-pandemics-such-as-coronavirus-will-we-ever-break-the-vicious-cycle-of-panic-and-neglect/\" title=\"\">$9bn short</a> of the funding needed for medical R&amp;D and contingency planning. Sadly leaders either panic, as now \u2013 or, until disaster hits, follow the course of least resistance: inattention and neglect.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, this us-versus-them nationalism has spawned a blame culture, with under-pressure governments holding everyone but themselves responsible for anything that goes wrong. And yet an ideology of \u201ceveryone for himself\u201d will not work when the health of each of us depends so unavoidably on the health of all of us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11c6da9f886dfe3312dd82c10705acce0ff31c72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11c6da9f886dfe3312dd82c10705acce0ff31c72/0_129_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An elderly man walks down a deserted street in Venice\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018An ideology of \u2018everyone for himself\u2019 will not work when the health of each of us depends so unavoidably on the health of all of us.\u2019 An elderly man walks down a deserted street in Venice</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Silvestri/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the financial crisis, governments did come together \u2013 with globally coordinated interest rate cuts, fiscal stimuli, currency swaps and anti-protectionist deals. A decade on, rising nationalism will likely block central bank cooperation and an early easing of trade restrictions. Today, also, interest rates are currently so low that there is far less scope for monetary activism. The world\u2019s central banks \u2013 for the last 10 years just about the only game in town \u2013 are increasingly exposed as emperors with few clothes.</p> <p>I believe a concerted global, governmental response is still possible. Each country should commit to removing blockages in supply chains; be ready to ease tariffs (and certainly not add to them, as rushing at the Brexit deadline might do); extend credit, as the <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2020/march/boe-measures-to-respond-to-the-economic-shock-from-covid-19\" title=\"\">UK has rightly announced to businesses</a>, including a moratorium on tax payments; and guarantee upfront financial support for workers sent home or on short time.

Now, you become a celebrity without accomplishing anything. It\u2019s completely upside down, but I guess that\u2019s the way it is now.\u201d</p> <p>The exhibit features more than 250 photos, from Brooke Shields in the DJ booth with Calvin Klein, Grace Jones singing at 3am while pointing a gun at the audience, Bianca Jagger seated on a white horse on the dancefloor, Halston kissing Liza Minnelli, Tina Turner laughing with Francesco Scavullo, Diana Ross with a balloon on New Year\u2019s Eve and Truman Capote passed out with a hat over his face.</p> <p>\u201cAny celebrity that came into New York made a stop on The Tonight Show, then made a stop at Studio 54,\u201d says Schrager. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it was.\u201d</p> <p>The photos are not posed portraits; they\u2019re spontaneous moments captured on the dancefloor, in motion, off the cuff moments that capture the energy, style and raucousness of the era.</p> <p>\u201cThere was definitely a \u2018no photo\u2019 policy,\u201d he says. \u201cBut a lot of the photographers were friends.\u201d</p> <p>Studio 54 is remembered as the first non-judgmental, queer-friendly mainstream nightclub, which was not unlike an adult amusement park.

But it wasn\u2019t meant to keep anyone out. In fact, there was no real hierarchy for the clientele at Studio 54, according to Schrager. \u201cWe never believed in having a VIP area because it would take all the great people out of the room, and the other people would be short-changed,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a general rule, we still don\u2019t believe in taking those great people out of the room.\u201d</p> <p>The exhibit features Schrager\u2019s old business cards, telegrams, party invitations and his handwritten day planners, reminding himself to get a liquor license for the club (which he <a href=\"http://movies2.nytimes.com/books/97/04/13/reviews/disco-close.html\">failed to do</a>, and wound up having to close the club for a short period of time).</p> <p>There\u2019s Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s sapphire necklace, which she wore to the club in 1979, paparazzi photos by Ron Galella, Interview magazine covers with Cher, glittery outfits by Yves Saint Laurent and vitrines devoted to architectural drawings.</p> <p>Probably the most famous Studio 54 photo was the shot of Bianca Jagger seated on a horse, but Schrager remembers other moments, as well. \u201cI remember <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2017/11/photos-the-two-margaret-trudeaus\">Margaret Trudeau</a> dancing and making sure the photographer got it, because we knew it would be big press, big media,\u201d he says of the former first lady of Canada.</p> <p>\u201cI remember Andy Warhol walking around with his camera, in a funny kind of way, you might want to say he was the one who invented selfies,\u201d says Schrager. \u201cWhen I see a Studio 54 photo, it\u2019s just like yesterday.

When you have a club, it\u2019s supposed to be cool, subversive to the status quo, a little arrogant, underground, we thought that was a way to present it. It\u2019s a bit subversive and risque, but that\u2019s what a nightclub is about.\u201d</p> <p>His time behind bars and Rubell\u2019s passing are not easy subjects. \u201cI just think the only nightclub people I knew who survived the whole experience were Steve and I,\u201d says Schrager. \u201cWe barely survived because it almost destroyed us.\u201d</p> <p>Was it worth it all? \u201cCertainly,\u201d he says. \u201cWould I do it again? Not if it ended up in the same way.

Nor did it cap the total subsidy.</p> \n<p>Word spread that boilers meant profits, and the more boilers and the more you burned, the richer you became. The result was a scramble to install boilers and run them 24/7.</p> \n<p>The debacle prompted Sinn F\u00e9in to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/26/northern-ireland-power-sharing-talks-break-down\">pull the plug</a> on its power-sharing administration with the DUP, creating a damaging three-year political vacuum that ended in January when political parties agreed to restore the assembly and executive.</p> \n<p>Foster made no immediate response. Speaking before publication, she said the people of Northern Ireland deserved evidence-based answers over what happened.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will all get clarity today and I think that is very good,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>Rosamund Davies, 91, would not be happy if the government banned her family from visiting her at the Birtley House nursing home, set in 48 acres of beautiful Surrey Hills countryside. \u201cI would be very cross if visits from my children were restricted,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I would be furious if I was told I had to stay in my room, self-isolating.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried in the least about this virus. When you get to my age, things have to be a lot worse than this to worry you \u2013 like an earthquake. At my age, the only people whose health I worry about are my children and grandchildren. If I catch this virus and shuffle off this mortal coil, then I\u2019d be perfectly happy.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/care-homes-uk-ban-family-visits-stem-spread-coronavirus\">Care homes ban family visits to stem spread of coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Davies doesn\u2019t need to worry about her social life being curtailed quite yet. Simon Whalley, the chairman of the Birtley House group \u2013 and grandson of the firm\u2019s founder, Dr Lloyd Driver \u2013 is determined to keep the home open to residents\u2019 loved ones for as long as it remains safe to do so.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve restricted all non-essential visits,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to think of our residents\u2019 mental and emotional health; stopping all visits before the government advice has said it\u2019s necessary could have a detrimental effect on their wellbeing.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, the home is ready if the advice changes. \u201cWe are in a very fluid situation and constantly update everyone,\u201d said Whalley. At least three weeks\u2019 worth of dried food has been stockpiled. Medical supplies are ordered a month in advance; local pharmacies have a duty of care to inform the home if it looks like they won\u2019t be able to deliver new supplies on time, so that the local GP can be informed.</p> <p>The home has also introduced its own safety measures. Staff restrict their movements to specific areas of the building. If a staff member contracts the virus, only the part of the home they work in will have to be deep-cleaned.</p> <p>All deliveries are already being left outside the home. An external postbox has been set up so that even letters and cards are only bought into the home by staff.</p> <p>If a resident at the home wants to self-isolate in their room or if they lack the mental capacity and their family ask for it, the home is already well practised in barrier nursing. One resident has already taken this option.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to isolate or barrier-nurse to reduce the risk of spreading infections which can contaminate others, such MRSA, shingles, influenza, norovirus outbreak, as well as the coronavirus,\u201d said Whalley.</p> <p>Staff in these instances wear protective clothing including gloves, apron and mask. Visitors must check before entering the room, and residents in isolation are not allowed to wander around the care home.</p> <p>Reluctant to bring in people from outside if their staff fall ill, the home has been preparing their employees to cover each other\u2019s work where possible: everyone from the nutritionist to the maintenance staff and menu takers are ready to pick up any slack to keep the home running smoothly.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone is very concerned and very keen to do everything they can to help,\u201d said Sylwia Indycka, the home\u2019s registered manager. \u201cWe had a meeting yesterday and at least half of those there were staff who had came in on their day off to attend.\u201d</p> <p>As well as regular meetings between managers and staff, residents and their families are being kept in the loop. \u201cWhat\u2019s vital is that whatever we do is totally transparent,\u201d said Indycka. \u201cWe need our residents to trust us and to stay calm and positive. That\u2019s good for their mental health and their physical resilience.\u201d</p> <p>Helen Hughes, 92, said she felt very reassured by the measures the home had taken. \u201cI\u2019m quite calm,\u201d she said, sitting with her alcohol hand gel on the table next to her and a sheet of paper, in large print, demonstrating precautionary hand washing. \u201cMy daughter and son-in-law were here this morning and they live in London. We\u2019re all very aware of the virus. I know it\u2019s extremely serious, but I\u2019m not worried about it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau tested positive for Covid-19 just over a week after a high-profile event in London where she was filmed hugging the singer Leona Lewis and kissing the former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard.</p> \n<p>The wife of the Canadian prime minister was also photographed at the Wembley Arena We Day event on 4 March alongside the F1 driver Lewis Hamilton and the actor Idris Elba.

  "<p>I made my first home on a train. Underneath a large, empty luggage rack, at six years old. I curled myself away, hung up my coat to cover the space, so no one could see inside but me, and set out my belongings neatly. There was a pile of books \u2013 a library. An orange and some biscuits \u2013 the kitchen. And my backpack, a pillow, and, therefore, a bed. As we rumbled towards London St Pancras, my parents duly started pacing the carriageways to find me and I emerged, sad but sated, ready for the big city.</p> <p>We all know there\u2019s something special about train journeys, and for me, they will always be tied to my youthful imagination of personal time and space. It\u2019s the British in us, but on a seated train, where there\u2019s no expectation to talk to anyone, you can find peace and solitude in the untouchable space of your seat. You can strategise, evilly, and cover your coveted second seat with a bag to luxuriate in double the space. Pretend like you\u2019re on the Hogwarts Express and grab a cheeky rocky road and piping coffee from the trolley lady. But nowadays, as the Nakates, Hirsis and Thunbergs of the world take up the mantle of progress, there\u2019s an added benefit: environmental footprint.</p> <p><em>Tagskyrt</em> is the Swedish word for \u201ctrainbragging\u201d \u2013 the smugness<strong> </strong>you impart when you choose to travel by train rather than the road or the skies. You have good reason to feel that way \u2013 trains can emit <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-49349566\" rel=\"nofollow\">less than half</a> the amount of CO2 into the air than planes or a single person driving in a car, so even on a local level there can be a marked difference between taking a train journey versus gunning down the motorway in your dad\u2019s diesel-guzzling banger.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-magic-of-train-travel/2020/mar/13/its-like-being-held-gently-in-someones-palm-a-love-letter-to-the-countryside-day-trip\">\u2018It\u2019s like being held gently in someone\u2019s palm\u2019: a love letter to the countryside day trip</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When it comes to travel, my eco-consciousness awakening has been a while coming, but was predicated by natural inclinations. I have always struggled with flying \u2013 it doesn\u2019t seem right to be in the actual air in a metal box when gravity exists, and the most I\u2019ve done when it comes to driving is use a provisional to get into club nights. But the thrill of travel is intoxicating, or, at the very least, often necessary for work. Trains give me the best of both worlds and travelling by them is an easy thing to feel good about, and an easy thing to encourage others to do, especially if you live in well-connected areas like the south-east. As I messaged my friend the other day, who was considering taking a domestic flight: \u201cTrains are chill and you gotta think about the environment, pal.\u201d</p> <p>Some of my favourite train journeys are local.

  "<p>My boyfriend has given up smoking. It\u2019s his decision, though I suspect I helped. My favourite tactic was to summon up the image of our future children, their small faces with their large eyes \u2013 green like his, but red from the fumes \u2013 their tiny lips pursed in a cough. Or I\u2019d describe myself: sullen and ashen, older now, but not by much, a solitary tear falling over the man lost to cigarettes. \u201cStop it!\u201d he\u2019d shout, the Sad Violin Music (This Will Make You Cry) YouTube playlist in the background.</p> <p>We joke that he\u2019s given up smoking so we can spend more of our lives together, yet he is so irritable that I\u2019m less keen to.

Where there is life there are options, and more of those are always better.</p> <p>This conclusion is relatively new. It\u2019s not that I believed differently before, but I hadn\u2019t really thought about life or death, fretting more about the present \u2013 specifically whether everyone in it likes me \u2013 or living by my teenage live-fast-die-young sensibility, without any sense of irony that the generation who coined that phrase were now old.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/21/the-best-ideas-do-not-come-at-3am\">The best ideas do not come at 3am | Coco Khan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My mother says my opinion may change again; that while I sit here in good health with youth on my side, I cannot fully comprehend the pain of an ailing body or mind.

It\u2019s an irresistible fantasy.</p> <p>My boyfriend and I worked it out, and though we weren\u2019t born this year, our chances of getting close must be pretty good.

  "<p>Few people would deny that the most successful white wine of the past decade has been New Zealand sauvignon blanc, least of all the Kiwis themselves. The transformation of the Marlborough region in the north of South Island into what is, in effect, a gigantic grape farm has been the wine world\u2019s equivalent of the gold rush. With a reliably sunny climate, prolific yields and a simple vinification process (there\u2019s no expensive oak in most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/feb/26/new-zealand-sauvignon-blanc-wine-fiona-beckett\">savvy blancs</a>), this is probably one of the most profitable wines ever made. Which is, of course, why it accounts for some 86% of the country\u2019s wine exports.</p> <p>But \u2013 and you guessed there would be a but, didn\u2019t you? \u2013 it\u2019s become, dare I say, a tiny bit boring. Many of the country\u2019s top producers have recognised that, too, which is why today\u2019s sauvignons, especially those from the excellent 2019 vintage, are just that bit more restrained, more nuanced, less in-yer-face. They\u2019re even trotting out older vintages \u2013 a development I\u2019m not totally convinced by, but is all about getting the message across that sauvignon can be serious.</p> <p>Still, the Kiwis don\u2019t want to be defined by sauvignon alone, not least in case we all suddenly fall out of love with it, so they\u2019re intent on proving they can turn their hand to other varieties as well. In terms of whites, that means aromatic grapes such as riesling, pinot gris (which is made in the rich, often off-dry Alsace style), gew\u00fcrztraminer and, perhaps surprisingly, Austria\u2019s gr\u00fcner veltliner. But although these play well to the home market, which, from a culinary point of view at least, is far more connected to Asia than to Europe, they\u2019re never going to replace sauvignon blanc in our affections.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/22/20-best-vegan-wines-supermarkets-online\">The 20 best vegan wines</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are two varieties that might, however. One is chardonnay, which is undergoing something of a revival in New Zealand due to the focus of quality production shifting from Hawkes Bay to Central Otago (also home of pinot noir, which I\u2019ll talk about next week) and Marlborough, which must be galling, because they pulled a whole lot of it up not too long ago. Admittedly, it doesn\u2019t come cheap, and not all of it is available here (I\u2019m thinking Gibbston Valley\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gibbstonvalley.com/nz/shop/wines/single-vineyard/2017-china-terrace-95-chardonnay/\" title=\"\">China Terrace 95</a>, in particular), but it is pretty bloody gorgeous.</p> <p>But if I had to put money on what New Zealand\u2019s next rising star will be, it\u2019s albari\u00f1o. True, there\u2019s not a lot of it about (not yet, anyway), but it\u2019s delicious, slightly fruitier than you find in Galicia, though equally as crisp and saline, all of which make it as appealing to the pinot grigio drinker as to the sauvignon blanc one.

  "<p>Boris Johnson is adamant the Brexit transition period will close at the end of December, despite the risk of the Covid-19 crisis disrupting negotiations, his spokesman has said.</p> <p>Face-to-face talks which were to take place in London next week had been called off as a result of the outbreak, with officials exploring possible alternatives, such as video-conferencing.</p> <p>When Johnson\u2019s spokesman was asked whether the status quo transition period might need to be extended as a result, he said simply: \u201cNo\u201d, then added: \u201cIn UK law, a request for an extension is not possible\u201d. </p> <p>When the government passed the EU withdrawal agreement in December, it added a commitment that the transition period would not be lengthened.</p> <p>Pressed on whether that meant the government was prepared to leave without a trade deal if the negotiations were interrupted by virus prevention measures, the spokesman said: \u201cIt will be possible to do the trade talks. Both the UK and the EU are fully aware of the timetable which we\u2019re working towards.\u201d</p> <p>He said both sides had committed to finding alternative ways to continue the negotiations, and were working closely together to achieve this.</p> <p>\u201cThe discussions can take place using an alternative forum, such as video-conferencing,\u201d he said. \u201cVideo-conferencing is something which is used throughout the world, and business.\u201d</p> <p>The government still expected to share a draft agreement with EU negotiators before the next round of talks, he said.</p> <p>The negotiations, led by Johnson\u2019s EU adviser, David Frost, involve more than 100 officials. During the transition period, the UK remains subject to EU rules and institutions, and continues to pay into its budget. This is to be replaced at the end of the year with an agreement on the future relationship, including on trade and security.</p> <p>Despite the prime minister\u2019s warning on Thursday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-moves-to-delay-phase-of-coronavirus-plan\">many more families would lose loved ones to Covid-19</a>, the government has eschewed some of the more draconian measures in place in other countries.</p> <p>Parliament has remained open, and Johnson\u2019s spokesman said local elections in May were also expected to go ahead, despite a request from the Electoral Commission on Thursday for a delay.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/who-we-are-and-what-we-do/our-views-and-research/our-letters/letter-coronavirus-and-its-impact-may-polls\">letter to the government</a>, the commission said holding the elections would put unnecessary pressure on local authorities already having to deal with the public health crisis.</p> <p>\u201cThe risks to delivery that have been identified are such that we cannot be confident that voters will be able to participate in the polls safely and confidently, nor that campaigners and parties will be able to put their case to the electorate,\u201d it said.</p> <p>However, Johnson\u2019s spokesman said that, for the moment, \u201cwe are working to facilitate the local, mayoral and police and crime commissioner elections on 7 May.

My friend Emily snorted at this, I recall, and said surely it would have been the complete opposite; an unleashing of the every-man-for-himself mentality, and all the venal, craven impulses that went with it.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to tell so far which way the present threat is pushing us. In earlier stages of the outbreak, there was a callousness among the healthy towards those at risk, but that seems to be changing as it sinks in how screwed we all are if the hospitals become overwhelmed. </p> <p>I found myself briefly outraged at a friend who wanted to take advantage of the deeply discounted Broadway tickets and see a show, which seemed both bad in its potential impact \u2013 increasing one\u2019s exposure and therefore spread of the disease \u2013 but also for how it looked. No one wants to be the guy unleashing an uncovered cough in the elevator.</p> <p>In other areas, though, I\u2019m a total hypocrite. Some of those whose workplaces have shut feel they can\u2019t, in good conscience, ask their kids\u2019 babysitters to come in, but I\u2019m not one of them. If these are the last days of productivity before school closures, it will take martial law before a lot of people stand down their childcare providers and give up on getting anything done until April.</p> <p>I keep thinking about kindness; the ease with which, in earlier days, the disease was dismissed as a problem mostly affecting far-flung places, that, when it reached home, was no big deal since it killed \u201conly\u201d the elderly. This seems appalling now and not just because of how the disease spreads. To be kind, or to be seen to be kind \u2013 not blaming other parts of the world, as Trump did, or exposing one\u2019s vulnerable neighbours to risk \u2013 is as necessary as washing one\u2019s hands.</p> <p>\u2022 Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>My friend John Liebenberg, who has died aged 61 of complications following surgery, was a photojournalist on the frontline of the fight for Namibian liberation in the 1970s and 80s. He also went into Angola from 1989, documenting its 27-year civil war. </p> <p>John was born in Johannesburg, in South Africa. He and his two sisters were placed in St Mary\u2019s orphanage by his father, after his mother left the family home when he was two. He was eventually fostered by a German couple, Petra and Ernst Kahle, and went to high school in the city. Aged 18, he was conscripted as a soldier and sent to Namibia in 1976. After his national service he settled in the Namibian capital, Windhoek, and earned a living by taking family photographs. </p> <p>As the struggle for Namibian independence grew, John began photographing the soldiers of the apartheid state and protests of the Namibian people. In 1985 he and a group of other journalists, including the editor, Gwen Lister, who were opposed to apartheid repression and injustice, founded the Namibian newspaper.</p> <p>Fearless in his pursuit of photographs, he knew Namibia so well that he was the first stop for visiting foreign journalists. I first met John in 1987, after including him in an anti-war exhibition that I had organised in Johannesburg for the <a href=\"https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/end-conscription-campaign-ecc\" title=\"\">End Conscription Campaign</a>. The show was intended as a challenge to South Africa\u2019s second state of emergency, and many activists were reluctant to attend for fear of being detained, but John flew from Windhoek to see it. </p> <p>In September 1989 the human rights advocate Anton Lubowski was shot dead outside his house in Windhoek. John was the third name on the same hit list. Soon after, someone tried to execute him in his red VW Golf in a drive-by shooting. Years later he still drove the same car, its bullet holes a mark of honour.</p> <p>When Namibia gained independence from South Africa in March 1990, John, who was on first-name terms with the new president, Sam Nujoma, documented the South West African People\u2019s Organisation (Swapo) victory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14eabb8e7f33e00ee0b217a1cafb838aeee5a2d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14eabb8e7f33e00ee0b217a1cafb838aeee5a2d5/0_0_2048_1360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A photogragh taken by John Liebenberg of Namibian Defence Force soldiers photographed in the Eastern Caprivi, Namibia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A photogragh taken by John Liebenberg of Namibian Defence Force soldiers photographed in the Eastern Caprivi, Namibia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Liebenberg/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In November 1994, while in Huambo, Angola, John was in an air crash, in which his hip was broken. The following year he moved back to Johannesburg.</p> <p>As well as working for the Namibian, John freelanced for Reuters and other international agencies and publications, including the Guardian and Der Spiegel, until his death.</p> <p>He <a href=\"https://www.sahistory.org.za/people/john-liebenberg\" title=\"\">exhibited widely</a> at home and abroad. He had a solo show at the Goethe Institute in Nairobi (2008), and his images were included in Rise and Fall of Apartheid (2013-15), which travelled from the International Center of Photography in New York to Munich, Milan and Johannesburg. John\u2019s work was shown in London, at the Contemporary African Art Fair, Somerset House (2014, 2015), by Afronova gallery, and last year at Soas University of London. A book of his photographs, <a href=\"http://www.afronova.com/artists/john-liebenberg/bush-of-ghosts/\" title=\"\">Bush of Ghosts: Life and War in Namibia 1986-90</a>, was published in 2010.</p> <p>John married Ute Siehoff, a violinist, in 1984, and they had three children, Joseph, Max and Jessica. The marriage ended in divorce. He married Inge K\u00fchne in 2005 and they had a son, Emile, but that marriage, too, ended in divorce.</p> <p>He is survived by his children, a grandson, Leo, and a sister, Isabel.</p>",

  "<p>Few of us, I suspect, will forget the strange days of March 2020. There is something in the air, a sense of the slow-motion shutdown of public life in dozens of countries.

  "<p>Every nook and cranny teems with history. The tales of war, adventure, death and crime are myriad but for 30 years the people of Plymouth have only been able to gaze across at Drake\u2019s Island \u2013 but not set foot there.</p> <p>But on Sunday three boatloads of visitors will make the short hop from the Devon city to explore the crumbling fortifications, the bramble-covered barrack buildings and its mysterious tunnels.</p> <p>The island in Plymouth Sound has been off-limits since 1989 \u2013 when an adventure centre on the island closed down \u2013 but is now being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/15/plymouth-francis-drake-island-fortress-sale-hotel\">developed as a luxury holiday resort</a>, and before building work starts, people have been invited to buy tickets \u2013 the proceeds of which are going to a local hospice \u2013 to join exclusive tours.</p> <p>Demand for the 210 tickets for Sunday and a second trip in May was huge. They were snapped up within minutes and <a href=\"https://www.stlukes-hospice.org.uk/discover-the-secrets-of-drakes-island-and-boost-local-hospice-care/\">St Luke\u2019s Hospice Plymouth</a>, which will benefit from the proceeds, reported that its website received almost half a million hits during the sale period, not just from Plymouth people but from fans of history and islands from across the UK.</p> <p>Robert Maltby, the head of communications and marketing at the hospice, said the island was important to the people of Plymouth.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an intriguing place,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a Plymothian it is right there in front of you all the time. It\u2019s a major piece of the city\u2019s history and everyone wonders what it\u2019s like.\u201d</p> <p>The 2.5-hectare (6.5-acre) island has been a place of pilgrimage, a refuge, a fort, prison and \u2013 until the late 1980s \u2013 the site of the Drake\u2019s Island Adventure Centre.</p> <p>Maltby has had a preview of the island, taking a trip there to take photos for the ticket sales. \u201cI was taken aback by how good a condition many of the buildings are still in,\u201d he said. \u201cSome are overgrown with brambles but the brickwork has somehow stayed looking pristine.\u201d</p> <p>His favourite part was the tunnels, which have been used to store ammunition and other goods over the years. \u201cThey were pretty amazing,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The island\u2019s warden, avid historian Bob King, will lead the tour. Over the years his role has included guarding the island and keeping its shoreline clean.</p> <p>But he said: \u201cThe best part of my job is researching the history of the island and sharing it with as many people as possible.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough the fortifications and how they have been used and defended Plymouth over the centuries is fascinating, what brings the history alive are the personal stories of the people on the island.\u201d</p> <p>The island was initially known as St Michael\u2019s \u2013 named after a 12th-century chapel built there. It is only in more recent times that it has been known as Drake\u2019s Island, after the Elizabethan sea captain.</p> <p>In the 16th century, as defending Britain\u2019s shores became more important, the chapel was demolished and artillery towers, musketry walls and barracks were constructed.</p> <p>At one point it served as a prison but as the naval dockyard in Devonport grew, its fortification and armaments were beefed up to protect the fleet.</p> <p>During the second world war it was a minefield control post and if there had been an invasion explosives would have been detonated from the island.</p> <p>It has also been a scene of tragedy. In 1774 a local shipwright and carpenter, John Day, designed a wooden diving chamber and made a bet over how long he could stay submerged. He perished in the adventure.</p> <p>Drake\u2019s Island has been a magnet for all types. Queen Victoria sketched it and in 1957 a bunch of schoolboys \u201cinvaded\u201d it and claimed the island for Plymouth. They were arrested by the guard, given breakfast and then taken back to the city for a double maths lesson.</p> <p>In 2005, anti-nuclear campaigners set up a peace camp and declared the island a nuclear-free state. They followed in the footsteps of brandy smugglers, who used the island as a stopping-off point.</p> <p>The island was bought last year by a local businessman, Morgan Phillips. His hotel plans include a glass elevator that will whizz guests up from the jetty. The governor\u2019s house, barrack block and \u201cablutions building\u201d are to be linked together with a smart extension.</p> <p>Another plan is to open a heritage centre to tell the story of the island and Phillips is working on a scheme with the Plymouth-based Ocean Conservation Trust to open up the island for children to learn both about its history and the seas around it, which are important for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/10/uk-lost-sea-meadows-to-be-resurrected-in-climate-emergency-fight\">seagrass</a>, sea horses and seals.</p> <p>Roger Maslin, chief executive at the Ocean Conservation Trust, said he was delighted at the new possibilities. \u201cIt is an amazing place,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a great opportunity to get them out there in the field and learning with some first-hand experience of the ocean.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Last year we had a call from a concerned but grateful parent. Having previously been sceptical about vaccines, having read one of our <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/search/?q=vaccine#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=vaccines&amp;gsc.sort=\" title=\"\">fact checks</a>, she\u2019d decided to go ahead and have her children vaccinated. It sticks in my mind as an example of the harm that bad information can do \u2013 not just to our democracy, which as fact checkers we\u2019re often asked about \u2013 but to our health.</p> <p>Misleading claims around vaccines have encouraged parents to disregard medical advice and take unnecessary risks with their children\u2019s lives. Since the outbreak of the new coronavirus began, we have been fighting a similar tide of false claims and exaggerations. Much of this has originated and spread on social media. As is common during global news events \u2013 especially health crises \u2013 some have sought to pin the blame on familiar enemies, whether it is <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/online/wuhan-5g-coronavirus/\" title=\"\">5G technology</a>, the <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/online/Rothschild-coronavirus/\" title=\"\">Rothschilds</a> or <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-government-laboratory/\" title=\"\">Chinese lab scientists</a>. Many people have spread conspiracy theories, playing on our fears by suggesting that somehow the institutions that are supposed to protect us somehow had forewarning of \u2013 or even planned \u2013 the global outbreak of this deadly virus.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A Facebook post shared more than 300,000 times made several dangerous claims</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But of particular concern in the short term are those spreading false or misleading health advice. This is often done with the best of intentions: it\u2019s a natural response to a scary situation to pass on advice that you think might help protect your friends and family. But if that information turns out to be inaccurate, you risk doing more harm than good.</p> <p>The misinformation we\u2019ve seen broadly falls into three separate categories. Some, such as the claim that children are immune, begin life with a kernel of truth \u2013 here, that the symptoms in children are generally less severe than they are in older people. But without the proper context and caveats, these morph over time into something more dangerous. Children <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/children-can-get-coronavirus/\" title=\"\">may suffer less from the virus</a>, but they could still pass it on to more vulnerable friends and family.</p> <p>Others revolve around misconceptions of the term \u201ccoronavirus\u201d itself. Without the crucial context that coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that we\u2019ve known about since the 1960s, perfectly normal references to coronaviruses that predate this outbreak can suddenly seem like evidence of a conspiracy. And so we end up with people believing that vaccine trials for previously existing coronaviruses show the outbreak was manufactured, or even that the makers of Dettol somehow knew about the outbreak in advance, because they list <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/online/coronavirus-dettol/\" title=\"\">\u201chuman coronavirus\u201d</a> on their bottles.</p> <p>The third type is bad information masquerading as official health guidelines and advice. This week, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and the NHS both announced measures designed to combat bad information around this coronavirus. DCMS has formed a cross-departmental taskforce to monitor misleading claims, while the NHS has teamed up with tech giants such as Twitter and Facebook to signpost official advice on their platforms. While these announcements are welcome, it is just as important to challenge bad information as it is to direct people to reliable advice.</p> <p>A Facebook post shared more than 300,000 times made several dangerous claims. Chief among them was the \u201cadvice\u201d that a runny nose means you have a common cold \u2013 not Covid-19. This is wrong; this symptom is rarer in Covid-19 sufferers, <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/online/coronavirus-claims-symptoms-viral/\" title=\"\">but it does not rule it out</a>. The post also made the unfounded claim that the virus will die in <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-graphics-unicef/\" title=\"\">temperatures above </a><a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-graphics-unicef/\" title=\"\">27C (80F)</a>. The potential real-world repercussions of such a post (which has now been amended after we approached the author) are plain to see. It\u2019s right that social media platforms have come under scrutiny. But we\u2019ve also seen misleading claims emerge from traditional print and broadcast media.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/trump-coronavirus-ban-travel-backfired\">Trump\u2019s coronavirus ban on travel from the EU is backfiring already | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Telling people that the new coronavirus \u201cdoesn\u2019t infect children\u201d \u2013 as one broadsheet columnist claimed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/allisonpearson/status/1234627349569851393\" title=\"\">on Twitter</a> \u2013 may lead people to make potentially fatal decisions. Journalists have also reported several false claims and conspiracy theories on the new coronavirus. At various times, readers of the Daily Express have been told that an academic paper claimed the virus has been \u201c<a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/new-coronavirus-not-genetically-engineered/\" title=\"\">genetically engineered</a>\u201d to pass between humans more efficiently and that the World Health Organization knew about Covid-19 years before the current outbreak. Both claims are untrue. And multiple newspapers reported a false claim that mass cremations may be secretly taking place in Wuhan, based on \u201csatellite images\u201d that a bit of checking revealed <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/satellites-wuhan-sulphur-dioxide-coronavirus/\" title=\"\">weren\u2019t satellite images at all</a>.</p> <p>As much as we rely on our public institutions and elected politicians, established news outlets are also seen as a dependable source of health information.

With Warner and Finch scoring at will in the early overs, a score north of 300 looked on the cards. But once the first wicket was broken with 124 runs on the board, a rot of sorts set in. Undoubtedly the slowing SCG pitch played its part, but wonderful bowling in the middle from Santner (2-34) and to a lesser degree Boult (0-37) saw the runs evaporate and the wickets tumble. Australia were made to work very hard for their runs - not a single boundary was scored between the 37th and 48th overs - and but for Labuschagne (56 from 52) Australia might have been forced to settle for as score not far north of 200. The par score for a team batting first at the SCG is around 300, so this looks a tad on the thin side, but if runs are as hard to come by this evening New Zealand will have to bat well to win. Of course, all of this is being played out before an empty stadium. Strange, concerning times. That\u2019s all from me.

Today\u2019s clash at the SCG - the first since 2017 when Australia and New Zealand last met in a bilateral series - is one with a difference, however. Any contest, in any format, between these Trans-Tasman foes is invariably played out to a backdrop of raucous cheer, hilarity and usually good-natured ribbing between spectators. Not today. Today, the SCG is closed to patrons as the effects of coronavirus sink their talons into professional sport in Australia. Already the Australian GP has been cancelled by Formula One, Australia\u2019s world champions women\u2019s cricketers won\u2019t be going to South Africa this weekend as planned and, now, the denouement to the endless summer for Australia\u2019s men will be played to TV audiences only. Who knows where it will end. Out on the field, Australia will be looking to sign off in style - and, let\u2019s face it, in one-day cricket they need to - while New Zealand, who\u2019ve been sparingly tried in this format since last year\u2019s amazing World Cup final, will be digging for hen\u2019s teeth: a series win in Australia.

Formal camps, with healthcare and blankets, were the holy grail for Idlib\u2019s newest exiles, but most had reached their capacity when towns and cities were overrun by the war and emptied out in late February, as Russian warplanes pulverised all beneath them and allowed forces fighting for the Syrian president to advance northwards.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make do with what we have in this place,\u201d said another cemetery resident, Ahmad Huesh, 54. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to end up here anyway.\u201d Another man, Mueid Hneish, had just arrived from the town of Ariha, which had been evacuated as regime forces and Shia militias had stormed towards it. That momentum had slowed after an airstrike killed at least 34 Turkish troops on 27 February, and which prompted a withering counter-attack by Ankara \u2013 not on Russian forces who had carried it out, but on Syrian troops and their allies on the ground.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/idlib_12_march/giv-3902MZC7U1UC009T/\" data-alt=\"Idlib map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/idlib_12_march/giv-3902MZC7U1UC009T/\">Idlib map</a> </figure>  <p>In the village of Fuar, 10 miles further into Idlib, a member of the armed opposition against the Syrian leader, Lieutenant Naji Mustafa, said the Turkish offensive had rallied morale among the anti-Assad alliance. \u201cBashar al-Assad was not expecting to face what we had faced for so long,\u201d he said of a three-day Turkish blitz that had killed hundreds of fighters and wiped out much of the Syrian army\u2019s military hardware. \u201cWhen you really look at the Syrian army, they are not on the same level as the Turks, or anyone else.

The slain Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, who was killed by a US drone in Baghdad in January, had spent time in the town organising the recapture of Aleppo in late 2016 and had also overseen its evacuation shortly afterwards. That move had been sabotaged by a suicide bomber who killed close to 160 civilians in April 2017 as they waited to be evacuated. The headquarters of the group blamed for the attack, Jund al-Aqsa, now stands abandoned on a road leading towards Idlib city.</p> <p>\u201cIt was an immoral thing to do, and it was not defensible,\u201d said an opposition member. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been forgiven.\u201d</p> <p>Since then the jihadists, who had established strongholds across Idlib throughout the Syrian war, have been less visible although still a presence.</p> <p>As war rumbled on, the most dominant group \u2013 now known as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) but once wedded to al-Qaida \u2013 had begun to cast itself as protectors of the civilian uprising against Assad, rather than proponents of a global jihad.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d said Lieutenant Naji, when asked about HTS. \u201cFor now we\u2019re getting along with them and things are acceptable.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7d9d4276869232e9d2ea6173c9cb37cdfee7cbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7d9d4276869232e9d2ea6173c9cb37cdfee7cbd/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ibrahim Mezin, a resident of Ariha who came back to the deserted town to check on his house.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ibrahim Mezin, a resident of Ariha who came back to the deserted town to check on his house.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Achilleas Zavallis/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elizabeth Tsurkov, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute who has studied HTS extensively, said the group appeared to have transformed \u2013 long a demand of governments who endorsed the humanitarian demands of the millions trapped in Idlib, but were determined not to deal with jihadists. \u201cThey truly severed ties with al-Qaida,\u201d said Tsurkov. \u201cThe shift is strategic and stems from a realisation that they cannot survive as rulers of Idlib against the regime without foreign protection and backing, in this case, from Turkey.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"1de70415525c353e6d25f13543b485312366eb8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1de70415525c353e6d25f13543b485312366eb8d/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People walking in a market in the centre of Idlib.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People walking in a market in the centre of Idlib.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Achilleas Zavallis/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Who fights the war and whatever might emerge from the ruins long ago ceased to be a concern for Idlib\u2019s desperate residents, many of whom fled from elsewhere in Syria before ending up crammed into its last opposition-held corner. \u201cAnyone who wants to stop Assad and his Shia mercenaries is welcome to,\u201d said \u0130brahim Muezzin, on the outskirts of Ariha, a hillside town that was abandoned last month as regime ground forces approached. \u201cI came back only to see my house,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s gone.

  "<p><sup>\u201c</sup>I would like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never been asked to be a part of, since 2009,\u201d wrote Taylor Swift of her public feud with Kanye West in a now-deleted Instagram post in 2016. Except, 15 minutes into the Swift-approved documentary <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40RsbcFRwNA\" title=\"\">Miss Americana</a>, director Lana Wilson uses it as the film\u2019s inciting incident.</p> <p>Wilson tees up Swift as an entertainer, with footage of her at 13, 16 and 19 showing her easy rapport with her audience; the juxtaposition of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z8gCZ7zpsQ\" title=\"\">West interrupting Swift on stage at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards</a> is like a slap across the face. \u201cFor someone who\u2019s built their whole belief system on getting people to clap for you, the whole crowd booing is a pretty formative experience,\u201d says the present-day Swift\u2019s voiceover. The film pivots on the idea that her people-pleasing was her undoing, and peddles her change in strategy to becoming a no-nonsense, natural-born leader.</p> <p>Twitter and Instagram have empowered stars to share their stories; the feature-length rock doc offers further means of consolidating their own narratives. As well as Swift, the past five years have seen Beyonc\u00e9, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Demi Lovato, MIA and Jonas Brothers participate in and present films about their lives. Amazon and Apple TV+ have ordered original documentaries about Rihanna and Billie Eilish respectively for $25m (\u00a320m) apiece \u2013 a sum comparable with the $60m three-project deal Beyonc\u00e9 reportedly signed with Netflix in 2019. YouTube\u2019s recent 10-part series about Justin Bieber, Seasons, supposedly <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/justin-bieber-seasons-youtube-viewing-record-1203493727/\" title=\"\">cost the company a record $20m</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c4f681577c0c086c5b48bef8a0802609c168469\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c4f681577c0c086c5b48bef8a0802609c168469/32_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gaga: Five Foot Two.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gaga: Five Foot Two.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These deals are mutually beneficial.

Many of the most commercially successful music documentaries of recent years focus on artists who have died: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/09/kurt-cobain-montage-of-heck-review-nirvana-documentary\" title=\"\">Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck</a>; the Oscar-winning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/16/amy-review-asif-kapadias-amy-winehouse-film-is-a-tragic-masterpiece\" title=\"\">Amy</a>; Whitney Houston documentaries from Nick Broomfield and Kevin Macdonald; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/20/mystify-michael-hutchence-documentary-review\" title=\"\">Mystify: Michael Hutchence</a>. But these posthumous texts can veer into hagiographic \u2013 or exploitative \u2013 territory. Perhaps mindful of this, stars are increasingly working with film-makers to shape their stories while they are still alive.</p> <p>These films aim to bolster their stars\u2019 humanity, with many of them following their subjects during a period of crisis. Consider Lady Gaga asking if her face is puffy from crying while in hospital for chronic pain in <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80196586\" title=\"\">Gaga: Five Foot Two</a>, filmed amid the making of flop album Joanne; or Swift admitting in Miss Americana that she had nobody to call after winning album of the year at the Grammys for the second time, filmed after her album Reputation received a muted response. These are stars at moments of transition rather than in their pomp, more character studies than definitive portraits. Caitrin Rogers, who produced Miss Americana as well as the Oscar-winning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/27/20-feet-from-stardom-review\" title=\"\">20 Feet from Stardom</a>, says stars are \u201coften more reflective\u201d in these lulls, and \u201care willing to say more when they\u2019ve had time to sit with something\u201d after their peak success.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c45adf4921d30d913388cbb5ccd140c2b633d609\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c45adf4921d30d913388cbb5ccd140c2b633d609/7_6_1555_2589/601.jpg\" alt=\"In Bed with Madonna.\" width=\"601\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Bed with Madonna.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hogan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some docs are designed to engineer a comeback, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/09/bros-after-the-screaming-stops-review\" title=\"\">Bros: After the Screaming Stops</a>, in which Matt Goss philosophised that \u201cthe letters H-O-M-E are so important, because they personify the word home\u201d. Others are more stage-managed, and therefore less successful. <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1306958/\" title=\"\">Britney: For the Record</a> was filmed one year after Spears\u2019s public breakdown in 2007. \u201cIt\u2019s too in control. There\u2019s no excitement,\u201d she says on the subject of her micromanaged life \u2013 a controlled insight.</p> <p>The first few episodes of Seasons are similarly reticent, but as the series progresses, Bieber is more reflective, confessing that the lack of responsibility, accountability and stability in his upbringing led to the use of \u201clean, pills, molly, shrooms\u201d as \u201can escape\u201d. The presence of Daniel Amen (\u201cJustin\u2019s brain health doctor\u201d) is a reminder, however, that this is ultimately a constrained version of his redemption narrative.</p> <p>These low-ebb documentaries compare unfavourably with ones made during an artist\u2019s imperial period, such as Alek Keshisian\u2019s wildly entertaining <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102370/\" title=\"\">Truth or Dare (</a><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102370/\" title=\"\">AKA In Bed with Madonna)</a>, which captures Madonna during her career-peaking Blonde Ambition world tour; and Jon M Chu\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/filmblog/2011/feb/17/justin-bieber-never-say-never\" title=\"\">Justin Bieber: Never Say Never</a>, which takes place in the bubble of Biebermania. Footage of history unfolding will always have a lightning-in-a-bottle quality. What\u2019s more, freed from the need to re-establish their stars, these films end up revealing more. Though it received the Bieber stamp of approval at the time, Never Say Never is a chilling watch. Its talking heads cycle through an extensive catalogue of people who claim to have made him before we hear from the artist himself.</p> <p>Madonna, meanwhile, is filmed goofing off with her dancers during a game of Truth or Dare. When she performs fellatio on an Evian bottle, it\u2019s spontaneous and still a little shocking. \u201cI don\u2019t know what possessed me at that young age to say to Madonna: if I\u2019m gonna do this, I\u2019m gonna need to have all-access and final cut,\u201d says Keshishian. Back in 1991, he says, \u201ca star had to remain a mystery, and Madonna was going: \u2018Rules are meant to be broken.\u2019 She was revolutionary in creating more fascination [by revealing herself].\u201d</p> <p>Stars now reveal themselves constantly on social media, but as Steve Loveridge, director of <a href=\"https://www.miadocumentary.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Matangi/Maya/MIA</a>, puts it: \u201cAll those Instagram photos of people\u2019s dinners and shoes aren\u2019t going to be a great record of how their lives felt.\u201d Loveridge\u2019s 2018 film collages hours of Maya Arulpragasam\u2019s self-shot archive from over the years with carefully observed footage of his own. She wasn\u2019t allowed in the edit, and he had final cut; the artist\u2019s narcissism, brattishness and self-mythologising are on full display, and endearingly so. \u201cI tried to make the film balanced by moving her regularly between spaces where she was sometimes the underdog, sometimes very privileged, sometimes wise and truthful, sometimes out of her depth, so that the \u2018truth\u2019 is never in one scene in the film,\u201d Loveridge explains. \u201cShe is all of these myriad personas, and working it out for herself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"92a812353d5691d1df5d865a219fcd192e13b875\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92a812353d5691d1df5d865a219fcd192e13b875/0_121_1385_831/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matangi/Maya/ MIA.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matangi/Maya/MIA.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dogwoof</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rogers says the key to this current wave of docs is: \u201cWhat is the story, and what is the story saying about the world we all live in?\u201d Miss Americana\u2019s third act plots the events of Swift\u2019s life into something resembling a political awakening. In one scene, Swift pens a catchy song about sexist double standards called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqAJLh9wuZ0\" title=\"\">The Man</a>; in another, she lambasts Republican senator Marsha Blackburn for conforming to a masculine ideal of power. The contradiction Wilson presents can be read as a subtle critique \u2013 or as an honest look at the process of a young woman learning the parameters of her values. Both Miss Americana and Matangi/Maya/MIA comment on a cultural moment in which female artists are under incredible scrutiny to perform their personal politics, whether equipped to or not.</p> <p>As well as capturing something about our culture, the most attentive documentarians can catch a tender fragment of what looks like truth. Katy Perry, tearfully weathering divorce, plastering on a smile as she ascends to the stage in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2215719/\" title=\"\">Katy Perry: Part of Me</a>. Grainy cameraphone footage of Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z serenading each other with Coldplay\u2019s Yellow in the otherwise opaque <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beyonce-Life-Dream-Beyonc%C3%A9/dp/B00HDZ1L4E\" title=\"\">Life Is But a Dream</a>. The disappointment that flickers across Swift\u2019s face when she is told that Reputation hasn\u2019t been nominated for any Grammys, and the speed with which it switches into practical resolve. But train a camera on anyone and they will likely begin to play a version of themselves \u2013 can these films ever really show the star behind their shine? Artists continue to utilise the documentary form as a shorthand for truth \u2013 but that truth is still another construction.</p>",
  "<p>Ekene Okonkwo studies political science, advocates for gun control and reproductive rights, and is voting in a presidential election for the first time this year. But only if she can vote for Bernie Sanders.</p> \n<p>The 19-year-old, who studies political science and lives in the Bronx, said the Vermont senator is the only candidate she trusts to deal with the issues she cares most about \u2013 on climate change, for instance, she called former vice-president Joe Biden\u2019s plan \u201cunfeasible\u201d. A vote for Biden, who is likely to be the Democratic nominee in November, would only give the party more reason to take her vote for granted, she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we lose to Trump then hopefully within the next four years maybe an AOC or Rashida Tlaib would be able to run,\u201d Okonkwo said, referring to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and another progressive politician who has gained popularity in the last two years. \u201cMaybe there would be a better chance to save the planet.\u201d</p> \n<p>Okonkwo is not alone in her unequivocal and uncompromising support for Sanders. She is part of a loosely connected but vocal group, sometimes uniting under hashtags like #BernieorBust or #NeverBiden who say they will not vote for Biden if he wins the nomination. While it\u2019s nearly impossible to know how large the group is, hundreds of people have shared this sentiment, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anthonyvclark20\">including</a> progressive political candidates.</p> \n<p>It may be impossible to quantify their number, but not their influence. Those Democrats who will not yield to a moderate and vote for Biden if he wins the nomination are the same group who are sometimes blamed for Donald Trump\u2019s victory in 2016 when disappointed Sanders fans sat out the general election.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c92bd2584465722667c6f0071aa9b18002720e0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c92bd2584465722667c6f0071aa9b18002720e0/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders supporters at a campaign rally in Richmond, Virginia, on 27 February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders supporters at a campaign rally in Richmond, Virginia, on 27 February.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zach Gibson/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And the past few weeks have been hard to swallow for Sanders fans. After a strong early showing in Iowa, Nevada and New Hampshire his star faded on Super Tuesday. Supporters were left disappointed again this week when he lost to Biden in Michigan, where he edged out Hillary Clinton in 2016. This poor performance is partly due to an unexpectedly weak youth vote \u2013 despite Sanders\u2019 vaunted ability to mobilise younger Americans.</p> \n<p>As the Sanders campaign reckons with the fallout, and former Democratic candidates <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-builds-moderate-coalition-collecting-endorsements-2020-candidates/story?id=69442331\">rush to endorse Biden</a><strong>,</strong> the #BernieorBust fans are grappling with a repeat of 2016. It\u2019s hard to tell how their decision could affect the election, but in 2016, a similar group of people who boycotted Hillary Clinton on election day contributed to her loss in swing states like Florida, where <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/florida\">more than</a> 200,000 people voted for candidates from outside the two major parties, such as Gary Johnson or Jill Stein.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you distrust something, you are more likely to opt out of it,\u201d said Rashawn Ray, a governance fellow at the Brookings Institution. And Sanders supporters don\u2019t trust the Democratic party. \u201cThey think its political sabotage, and not allowing Bernie to have a fair shot. So what do people do? They opt out.\u201d</p> \n<p>Martha Baez, a 54-year-old who works in finance, is one of those voters. She is registered as an independent and voted for Jill Stein in 2016. \u201cThere was failure in getting me out to the polls with the \u2018lesser of two evils\u2019 theory\u201d, she said of the argument that whatever Clinton\u2019s perceived flaws, she was better than Trump.</p> \n<p>This year, Baez is planning to vote for Sanders in the New York primary, and will not vote for Biden if he is the nominee in November.<strong> </strong>But she said her real issue was not with the specific candidate, but losing trust in the Democratic party. \u201cI don\u2019t think that I should put aside my values and vote out of fear,\u201d she said. \u201cThe DNC needs an overhaul, it lacks values, real leaders that represent the people not its donors.\u201d</p> \n<p>The impact on the supreme court or other policies, she said, was not her responsibility.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhy is that my problem?\u201d she said. \u201cShouldn\u2019t it have been considered before selecting the \u2018chosen one\u2019? Will they try and flip the script and make it my issue or fault?\u201d</p> \n<p>Jessica Wright, an avid Sanders supporter in east Texas, tweeted that she was #BernieorBust after his Super Tuesday defeat in her state. She said she was angry that other Democratic candidates had dropped out just before the big primary day to endorse Joe Biden, and wanted the \u201cso-called Democratic establishment\u201d to know they were letting down people like her.</p> \n<p>Wright, 37, works at a hospital and said she and her husband live paycheck to paycheck. She said Sanders\u2019 policies would be the best for her family, including family members married to immigrants struggling to gain citizenship status in the US. But given that a Trump election could be worse, and herald new conservative court appointees and other harmful policies, she is still considering voting for Biden, or at the very least, voting down ballot in other, non-presidential races on election day.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor me not voting would be to send a message: what you\u2019ve done is not OK,\u201d Wright said. \u201cI wish there was a way to vote for [Biden] and still send that message.\u201d</p> \n<p>Stephen Ansolabehere, a Harvard government professor who studies political campaigns, said there is a similar \u201csour grapes\u201d group during every election, even if it\u2019s not a big enough group to swing the result. But he said what determines whether or not Sanders supporters will show up for Biden depends on how the latter treats them in the coming months.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen you lose [your candidate] it\u2019s like a death in the family,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the bitterness of the emotions. Biden knows that bitterness so he could be empathetic and bring those people back to the fold.\u201d He gave the example of the 1988 Democratic primary, when frontrunner Michael Dukakis <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/26/us/democrats-agree-on-rules-to-select-nominee-in-1992.html\">reached a compromise</a> with his opponent Jesse Jackson by changing party rules to tie the delegate vote more closely to the popular vote, giving Jackson a partial victory.</p> \n<p>Ansolabehere also pointed out that Sanders\u2019 progressive movement relies heavily on young people going to the polls. But even if they are politically engaged, this subset of voters consistently deals with more hurdles to register to vote because of restrictive voting policies around address changes and identification. In New Hampshire, for example, a Republican-backed law <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/05/new-hampshire-2020-election-student-vote\">requires</a> that many young voters have a driver\u2019s license to vote.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to organize a campaign around younger generations,\u201d Ansolabehere said. \u201cYou only have 50% chance of being registered when you\u2019re 18 years old.\u201d And that could have played a role during Super Tuesday, when youth turnout (ages 18 to 29) was only an <a href=\"http://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/super-tuesday-2020\">estimate</a>d 14% in Virginia, and 5% in Tennessee, according to a Tufts University exit poll.</p> \n<p>Ray also said \u201cvoter suppression is alive and well\u201d and probably affected turnout for Sanders. But he said that the group that is more likely to determine the election is the 11% of white voters, mostly suburban and often women, who <a href=\"http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/just-how-many-obama-2012-trump-2016-voters-were-there/\">switched</a> from Barack Obama in 2012 to Trump in the last election.</p> \n<p>For Sanders\u2019 supporters, these obstacles only drive home the frustration around an election system that they say works against their candidate.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a381fa53-24c1-46a8-a648-7710acb74a3a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/K30TgRppDzg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Habiba Choudhary, a Sanders supporter who was canvassing in Michigan, saw the long polling station lines firsthand on Tuesday in Sanders-friendly communities like Dearborn and perceived this as a way to rig the election in favor of Biden. The New York-based 28-year-old, who identifies with the #BernieorBust movement, said the senator\u2019s message resonated with her family<strong>,</strong> Bangladeshi immigrants who share a one-bedroom apartment in Queens.</p> \n<p>Sanders seemed to be the only candidate whose policies could ease the plight of her father, a taxi driver dealing with healthcare issues, and her sister, who is straining to pay back student loans. \u201cEnough is enough \u2013 we tried the neoliberalism and we\u2019re sick and tired of it,\u201d she said. \u201c[Sanders] gave me and other people that voice.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, Choudhary said, she would follow Sanders\u2019 lead when it came to voting in November. In 2016, the senator accepted defeat after the primary, and went on to endorse Hillary Clinton in the presidential election.</p> \n<p>\u201cI know Bernie is super consistent,\u201d she said. \u201cHis supporters are gonna come out for Biden.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 March 2020.

The oil is then piped to the coast and shipped thousands of miles north for refining. Much is sold for export, but some is transported back to Ecuador and driven by road back to petrol stations.</p> <p>From there it is poured into drums and transported in trucks or cars to to be used in canoes that in turn are propelled by two- or four-stroke outboard engines or smaller long-tailed engines known locally as <em>peque-peques</em>.

During the next phase of development, solar recharging stations will be installed along the canoe route. Seven young Achuar people are being trained in using the technology. These are \u201cintercultural training\u201d programmes taught by peers, who are also instructed by indigenous technicians.</p> <p>Concerned about the future of a growing population, the Achuar community is gradually diversifying economically in terms of moving beyond self-sufficiency toward sustainability. There is already an ecotourism project where as many as 24 people can stay in two cabins managed by the community, and a balanced food project that uses a solar power plant. The main and imminent threat, however, is undoubtedly the proximity of the road.</p> <p>Nantu makes a very clear complaint to the authorities in Quito: \u201cI would tell the government not to carry out projects without consulting the indigenous peoples. They should carry out projects in consultation with the people, who are the owners of the territories. They should stop expanding oil frontiers and the arteries that reach the outer corners of the Amazon. It\u2019s becoming very dangerous for us.\u201d</p> <p>Nantu is aware that changes are taking place in the climate and of how global heating affects the territory and the world. \u201cThere is some variation of life here in the jungle. The flowering cycle has changed by one to two months. The rains are too intense, and the sun is too strong.\u201d</p> <p>He has a vision for the future of his five children. He imagines an Amazon capable of being economically self-sufficient, a few community tourism centres managed by indigenous people and solar canoes managed by the Achuar with recharging stations along the river. No roads, no pipelines, no oil.</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was produced with support from the <a href=\"https://pulitzercenter.org/tags/rainforest-journalism-fund-reporting\">Rainforest Journalism Fund</a>, in association with the Pulitzer Center</p></li> </ul>",

Amazon said it would provide its video conferencing tools and other aspects of its cloud computing services to the health service for free.</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s lead adviser Dominic Cummings asked each business to offer what they could towards the effort, before passing the details on to representatives of NHSX \u2013 the health service\u2019s digital transformation arm \u2013 to work out how best to deploy them. Other support came from London artificial intelligence company Faculty, while the likes of Microsoft and Apple were also in attendance.</p> <p>The importance placed on the meeting is a recognition that tech platforms \u2013 often facing a tough time from the government \u2013 can reach the population with accurate information in a way that many traditional media outlets cannot.</p> <p>It is not the first time the government has turned to tech firms for help over the virus, but so far the response has largely focused on asking major social networks to improve the quality of messaging and reducing the level of online disinformation about the illness.</p> <p>The meeting on Wednesday night suggests that some of the offers of assistance were either too ambitious to succeed in immediately delaying the spread of the pandemic, or they required data that is not necessarily available, given the unsatisfactory state of the National Health Service\u2019s computer systems.</p> <p>Other concerns include ensuring appropriate control of sensitive information, and the long-term impact of allowing a large number of private companies to work with the healthcare system\u2019s data. </p>",
  "<p>I hope I\u2019m not giving too much away by saying that episode three of Netflix\u2019s slaphappy romantic reality show Love is Blind opens with a proposal. Contestant Damian Powers is down on one knee, asking his newfound love interest Giannina Gibelli to be his wife.</p> <p>Then, Gibelli flips the script.</p> <p>Instead of a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno,\u201d she clambers on to the ground herself and announces, \u201cOne thing that I don\u2019t believe in is roles or labels \u2026 I see you as an equal, I want to ask you Damien Powers, will you marry me?\u201d</p> <p>Powers weeps with joy, as, one assumes, do the show\u2019s producers (what a twist!).</p> <p>Like double rainbows, double proposals feel unexpected and delightful. And they don\u2019t just happen on TV. Kirsten Palladino, editor of the LGBTQ+ focused Equally Wed magazine, has observed their rising popularity within the queer community over the last seven-odd years. \u201cCouples we\u2019re seeing who are doing mutual proposals really want to be equal partners in every way, and don\u2019t subscribe to heteronormative, socially prescribed gender roles,\u201d says Palladino, who estimates that about a quarter of the couples profiled by her publication both proposed. \u201cIt sets the stage for a relationship whether neither person has the upper hand.\u201d</p> <p>Less has been documented about the popularity of mutual proposals in straight relationships \u2013 but there too, dynamics seem to be shifting. This may be in part due to an increased sense of equality between partners, and the normalization of discussing marriage while still dating (<a href=\"https://www.theknot.com/content/how-much-to-spend-on-engagement-ring\">one 2017 study</a> found only 35% of women are surprised by their partner\u2019s proposal). Today, couples often take the opportunity to talk about tailoring their engagement experience to suit their personalities and values.</p> <p>After four years together, Canadian couple Tom Hill, 33, and Amy Shostak, 35, decided they both wanted to propose when the time was right. \u201cWe liked the idea that you can do things however you want to do them,\u201d says Tom. \u201cEquality has always been a big cornerstone of our relationship, so we were like, \u2018Is there a way we can both propose? What does that look like?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Tom and Amy\u2019s decision involved some logistical strategizing. \u201cOnce we agreed [we were ready to get engaged] we called that \u2018the period\u2019, and once the period started then it was free game for either of us to propose,\u201d explains Tom. \u201cOur proposal was like a safety deposit box where you needed two keys to open the box and if you don\u2019t have both keys you can\u2019t get married,\u201d says Amy.</p> <p>\u201cUltimately the trickiest part of system we developed is: if one person proposes and the other person still has yet to propose, there\u2019s a period where the proposal isn\u2019t complete but one of you has done a big emotional event,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we decided if one of us proposed, we wouldn\u2019t tell anyone else until the second person also proposed, whether that was a day later or six months later.\u201d</p> <p>While Amy admits the first few months of \u201cthe period\u201d were \u201cvery weird\u201d, with both of them slightly on edge every time they went to a restaurant or hiked a mountain, ultimately the couple proposed about six hours apart in November 2018. Tom took Amy on a short road trip to a lakeside resort town outside their city. When they got to their hotel, Amy napped while Tom iced an elaborate cake as part of an inside-joke; she woke up, and he proposed. Later that night, after dinner and dancing, the couple walked to the edge of a pier and Amy decided it was the right time to get down on one knee, too.</p> <p>\u201cHe was shocked, because the time in between was so brief,\u201d says Amy.</p> <p>\u201cI had just been so focused on doing my proposal I was not expecting a response proposal,\u201d says Tom. \u201cThe thing that seemed like it would prevent a surprise provided it. I very much wept and wept.\u201d</p> <p>Adam Fleishman, 36, and Brenna Holler, 34, from San Diego and Vancouver respectively, also both proposed, though somewhat spontaneously.</p> <p>Earlier this year, after about two years of dating, the couple finished walking their dog and was just settling in for a quiet breakfast at home when, explains Brenna. \u201cWe were talking about future plans and Adam got this really silly look on his face and started counting down from three. By the time he got to one and a half I sort of realized what was happening and I, as a competitive person, wanted to propose to him, so when he reached zero we both asked to marry one another.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think we were both thinking it, sitting across the table from each other,\u201d says Adam. \u201cAs cheesy as it sounds, the looks we were shooting each other said it all anyway, so I just started counting down, \u2019cause I knew we would both want to do it at the same time.\u201d</p> <p>Because straight engagements and weddings are rooted in longstanding, heteronormative convention, the option of having both partners propose may not even occur to some couples. Yet as more partners choose to both propose, and share their stories within their social circles, mutual proposals may catch on in a bigger way. In the few weeks since Adam and Brenna announced their engagement, they already have heard from friends who found their story inspiring and proposed in a similar way as a result.</p> <p>What mutual proposals reflect more than anything is the fact that today, there are no right or wrong ways for an engagement to happen \u2013 and by popping the question twice, couples can double their fun. As Tom says: \u201cProposing in itself is very nerve-racking, very exciting, wonderful \u2013 and also being proposed to is a thrill and amazing. Why not do both?\u201d</p>",

What we do know is that wherever possible, food banks will continue to provide the lifeline of emergency food for those in need. Of course, our main priority is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank \u2013 whether it\u2019s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation. We\u2019re working out how we can best support people as the situation develops.</p> <p>But there is a limit to what food banks can do. We face logistical challenges of getting food to the thousands of people who need it most if the country goes into lockdown, as well as concerns around donation levels. All of this comes when food banks are already dealing with a record level of need for emergency food. As charities who respond to local emergencies, it\u2019s not unusual for a food bank to have to adapt quickly \u2013 we saw this in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/16/storm-dennis-prompts-life-threatening-flood-warnings-in-south-wales\" title=\"\">Pontypridd just last month</a>, when the local food bank acted quickly to help local people affected by the flooding. We saw it in London in the summer of 2017, when local food banks worked swiftly to help families facing the terrible consequences of Grenfell. And I know we will see it again in the coming months.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/05/food-bank-britain-trussell-trust-report-election\">The Tories can\u2019t run away from the horrors of Food Bank Britain | Frances Ryan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The resilience of food banks is nothing short of outstanding \u2013 but each food bank in our network is a local charity, run by a community for their local community, and so each will be affected differently. South Liverpool food bank, for instance, already has a partnership with the British Red Cross and has said they have plans to work together to provide emergency provisions as we move through coronavirus. On the other hand, North Liverpool food bank receives a substantial amount of food from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FansSupportingFooddbanks/\" title=\"\">Fans Supporting Foodbanks</a>. If football matches were to be played behind closed doors this could reduce their donations by about 25%.</p> <p>Generally, food banks sometimes run low on certain items, but we have not yet heard that any in our network are currently running out of all food donations. It never ceases to amaze me how generous all our volunteers are with their time \u2013 and how generous the British public is. I have no doubt that will continue to be true. A crisis can often bring out the best in people, and we encourage everyone to carry on donating, and to check with their local food bank which items are most needed.</p> <p>What has also become clearer through this awful and unparalleled situation, however, is the bigger picture. What has been highlighted yet again is just how much we depend on our country\u2019s safety net being there to catch us in times of crisis. The NHS is the focus of much attention as staff work tirelessly round the clock dealing with coronavirus. We\u2019re rightly proud in the UK of the systems we\u2019ve created to protect each other. This week, the chancellor pledged an extra <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51832634\" title=\"\">\u00a3500m hardship fund for local councils </a>in light of coronavirus, which can play a key role in protecting the populace from poverty.</p> <p>The changes to the way people pay back universal credit loans, due to come into force from October 2021, are also welcome. However, many thousands of people have faced significant issues, waiting five weeks for a first payment, with no money for essentials. This wait is far too long. Our benefits system is the life-raft people need now. As the outbreak develops, more people than ever could need this help \u2013 especially those who aren\u2019t eligible for sick pay or have unstable jobs. For many of these people, the five-week wait for a first universal credit payment will cause real hardship, despite measures announced in the budget.</p> <p>As more people look likely to move on to universal credit, the government must ensure people are protected. Universal credit first payments must be made available immediately on a non-repayable basis for anyone needing to claim. The five-week wait for a first payment could be ended by giving people grants, rather than loans that must be repaid. While thousands of our incredible volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask the chancellor to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now.</p> <p>\u2022 Emma Revie is chief executive at the Trussell Trust</p>",
  "<p>When, in 2018, Kate Elizabeth Russell\u2019s agent presented publishers with her first novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/02/are-novelists-obliged-to-tell-the-story-of-their-private-life\" title=\"\">My Dark Vanessa</a></em>, about a sexual relationship between a 15-year-old girl and her English teacher, the #MeToo movement was in full flight. As women across the world were sharing stories and exposing the ways men had used power to abuse and silence them, here was a book, 18 years in the writing, that examined themes of consent, coercion, memory and the nature of victimhood. Initially, Russell was anxious about the timing. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to come across as opportunistic or have it cheapen my work somehow,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut then I realised those worries were about how people might perceive it and not about what my book was. And I really believed that I had written a good book and that I had something meaningful to contribute.\u201d</p> <p>But there were greater anxieties to come. In January this year, the author Wendy Ortiz criticised Russell\u2019s substantial publishing deal and suggested the book\u2019s plot was \u201ceerily similar\u201d to her own 2014 memoir, <em>Excavation</em>, which described how she was groomed by a teacher when she was 13. Ortiz, a Californian of Mexican descent, tweeted about how she had struggled to get published on account of the \u201cdifficult\u201d subject matter. She complained that in \u201can industry that is continually taken to task for being extremely white and making decisions that reflect as much, here is a seven-figure book deal for a fiction book that is being marketed similarly to my book\u201d. Russell emailed Ortiz and offered to send her a copy of <em>My Dark Vanessa </em>(Ortiz admitted she hadn\u2019t read it), but she didn\u2019t get a reply.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I jokingly refer to the early versions as \u2018teacher Twilight\u2019. But as I grew up I feel like the characters grew up too</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Russell had indeed read Ortiz\u2019s memoir while researching her novel, along with 80 or so other titles \u2013 autobiographies, novels, plays and clinical studies of sexual abuse and paedophilia among them. Research was a crucial part of her process, not least because, in the final years of its creation, the book formed her dissertation for a creative writing PhD. Nonetheless, as the furore intensified on social media, Russell decided to take a step back, and deleted her Twitter account. \u201cIt got really intense and really personal very quickly,\u201d Russell tells me afterwards. </p> <p>The row also raised questions about who gets to tell which stories, and whether memoirs are more authentic than novels. Most distressing for Russell, who is 35, were the questions about whether her novel was based on her own experiences of abuse as a teenager \u2013 something that she had long ago resolved not to discuss \u2013 and the implication that she needed to prove her credentials for writing about sexual trauma. \u201cI tried to draw a boundary really early on,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew it was going to be tough. I always anticipated there would be questions, and certain assumptions, but I didn\u2019t foresee this.\u201d It was with some reluctance that Russell put out a short statement on her website confirming that the book had been inspired by various experiences when she was a teenager. \u201cI do not believe we should compel victims to share the details of their personal trauma with the public,\u201d she wrote, noting that \u201copening up further about my past would invite inquiry that could be retraumatising\u201d.</p> <p>When I first meet Russell in November over a cup of tea at her publisher\u2019s office in London, the Ortiz controversy has yet to blow up (Oprah has since dropped <em>My Dark Vanessa</em> from her Book Club). She is shy, softly spoken and a little overwhelmed by the hype around her novel, which has earned plaudits from Gillian Flynn, Stephen King and \u201cCat Person\u201d author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/26/cat-person-author-kristen-roupenian-dating-ego-power-control\" title=\"\">Kristen Roupenian</a>. After years spent studying in near-penury, having money in the bank feels weird, Russell tells me. She had always told her husband, who works in academia: \u201cI\u2019ll move wherever you get a job, just don\u2019t expect me to bring in money.\u201d</p> <p>In the book, Vanessa is an awkward outsider at her new boarding school and is flattered by the attentions of Jacob Strane, a 42-year-old English teacher who lends her books and compliments her attempts at poetry. As they spend evenings in his office and, later, at his home, the relationship becomes physical. The book moves back and forth in time between Vanessa as a schoolgirl, and as a chaotic, self-loathing 32-year-old who works as a hotel receptionist by day, and spends her evenings smoking pot or having sex with men she doesn\u2019t care about. The older Vanessa is still in touch with Strane, who has been accused of sexual abuse by another former student (though #MeToo isn\u2019t directly referenced, Vanessa\u2019s adult narrative plays out against a rising tide of public accusations of sexual harassment and abuse). Strane, who denies the allegations, leans on Vanessa for support. Meanwhile, she pledges to keep quiet about their past relationship, which she still regards as a great love affair rather than statutory rape.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63fcecca47ed0b48ac563e929c75b3c46d09c8a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63fcecca47ed0b48ac563e929c75b3c46d09c8a8/0_40_2556_1533/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nabokov\u2019s Lolita.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain in the 1997 adaptation of Nabokov\u2019s <em>Lolita</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Pathe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Russell has been writing ever since she can remember. She grew up in a small town in Maine on the edge of a lake (a detail echoed in Vanessa\u2019s isolated, lakeside home). Her father worked as a local radio DJ and her mother was in the hotel business. Russell kept a journal throughout her early teens, which would prove invaluable in helping her get to grips with the teenage mindset while she was writing young Vanessa. At 14, she read Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/23/100-best-novels-lolita-vladimir-nabokov-nymphet\" title=\"\">Lolita</a></em> \u2013 it\u2019s the first book that Strane gives to Vanessa \u2013 and was electrified by it. \u201cBut even then, I saw those glimpses of [Lolita\u2019s] sadness and hopelessness. And I saw myself in the book, and it made me aware, very suddenly, of the way this archetype was so embedded in the culture I was living in.\u201d She recalls Britney Spears dressed as a midriff-baring schoolgirl in the video \u201c\u2026 Baby One More Time\u201d, and later being photographed by <em>Rolling Stone</em> in her underwear on pink satin sheets cuddling a Teletubby doll. At the same time, Russell began noticing adult men looking at her and her friends differently. \u201cBecause at that age I still saw myself as a kid, but the world suddenly seemed not to. [It\u2019s] that weird age where you feel like you\u2019re on the cusp of something. You feel powerful and you feel dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>Russell was in her late teens when she dreamed up the central characters of her novel, and they lived in her mind, and in endless drafts, throughout her undergraduate years. Five years later, with a degree and a master\u2019s under her belt, she was still no closer to finishing the book. She would put her characters in different settings and structures; peripheral figures would come and go. As the years went by, Russell became increasingly frustrated with Vanessa and Strane, but never bored.</p> <p>\u201cI think I didn\u2019t fully understand the material that I was trying to work with,\u201d she reflects. \u201c[At first] I definitely saw the relationship between an older man and a younger girl as romantic \u2013 in the same way that <em>Wuthering Heights</em> was romantic, or <em>Jane Eyre</em>. To me, great love stories were also stories that were full of abuses and control. I often jokingly refer to the early versions of my characters as \u2018teacher <em>Twilight</em>\u2019. But as I grew up I feel like the characters grew up too.\u201d In 2013 Russell began her PhD at the University of Kansas. \u201cI decided: \u2018Well, I\u2019m going back to school one more time, and I\u2019m going to give it my best shot and get this written once and for all.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This isn\u2019t just about what happens to a girl at the hands of her teacher, but a much larger systemic enablement of abuse</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her research was wide-ranging \u2013 \u201cI tried to consume and engage with as many different portrayals of abuse as I could. Because I wanted to be sure I got it right.\u201d She found <em>The Kiss </em>by Kathryn Harrison, about a sexual relationship that the author began with her estranged father when she was 20, immensely powerful, though was depressed by its critical reception. \u201c[Harrison] was so insistent on looking at her own complicity in that relationship,\u201d Russell says. \u201cWhen it was published [in 1997], she was just skewered. The headline of one of the reviews I found was: \u2018Do you think she called her dad \u201cDaddy\u201d in bed?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She watched the film <em>Spotlight</em>, about the Boston journalists who uncovered the widespread abuse of children by the city\u2019s Catholic priests, and <em>The Hunting Ground</em>, a documentary on the failure of US colleges to properly investigate cases of sexual assault on campus. A local news story in Maine about a pillar of the community who killed himself after he was investigated for abusing young boys had a big influence on her plot. It turned out that he had been in contact with one of his victims, who was now a grown man, before he died.</p> <p>Russell has long been careful not to portray Strane as a monster: \u201cI had to really dig in and make him complex, and let the reader get glimpses of him letting his guard down a bit and showing that he is aware of what he\u2019s doing, but also what he sees as ethical boundaries.\u201d In one of the book\u2019s more chilling moments, we learn that Strane has had a vasectomy. He tells Vanessa this as he prepares to have sex with her for the first time: \u201cYou won\u2019t get pregnant. Just relax,\u201d he says. The older Vanessa finds his archived medical records, which state \u201cpatient is unmarried but insistent in not wanting children\u201d. Strane knows he can\u2019t be trusted around children, even his own.</p> <p>Vanessa is similarly complex and often infuriating in her reluctance, as an adult, to comprehend what has happened to her. It is a testament to the author\u2019s insight that she refuses to make Vanessa a \u201cgood\u201d victim. While she was workshopping the character, feedback from her supervisors was often less than positive. \u201cThey would say, \u2018Urgh, she\u2019s so unlikable. She\u2019s unrelatable. She doesn\u2019t make sense.\u2019 I had a lot of encouragement to write instead from the teacher\u2019s point of view. I did try it out and I got a lot of praise when I did. I had a professor who told me: \u2018It\u2019s when we see her through his eyes that she really comes alive.\u2019 But that didn\u2019t feel right to me.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/06/anna-wiener-uncanny-valley-silicon-technology-political-surveillance\">'I want this book to be politically useful\u2019: the explosive memoir exposing Silicon Valley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While Russell is understandably reluctant to be drawn on her past relationships, she tells me that Vanessa\u2019s situation is one that many women will be able to relate to. \u201cHer struggles are, in a lot of ways, universal \u2026 I did have experiences when I was a teenager with older men that absolutely informed the book, but those experiences were different. To call the book anything other than fiction would misrepresent it and misrepresent myself.\u201d</p> <p>We talk about the fact that, early on in <em>My Dark Vanessa</em>, the girls at the school are given rape whistles, and realise that we were both given them as teens, too. In the book Vanessa asks, \u201cDo the boys get whistles?\u201d, which makes her classmates roll their eyes in exasperation. \u201cI wanted to put that scene in early to signal that this isn\u2019t just about what happens to a girl at the hands of her teacher, but a much larger systemic enablement of abuse,\u201d says Russell. \u201cIt\u2019s not happening in a vacuum. It\u2019s putting the onus on girls to protect themselves and it\u2019s also admitting defeat. In some ways, it\u2019s the first step in isolating girls from one another. [The message is] it\u2019s dangerous out there and it\u2019s coming for you no matter what. And the only thing that you can do is try to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen to you.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Russell if recent events, from #MeToo to the Harvey Weinstein trial (when we meet, he hasn\u2019t yet been convicted) are cause for optimism. She pauses and lets out a sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t know about optimism but maybe hope,\u201d she replies. \u201cI think progress is incremental. #MeToo has allowed people to realise they are not alone in their experiences, which is important. I think the abuse, and the enablement of abuse, is still there, but the conversation is changing, and there is so much great art coming out of this moment.

Stiff criminal penalties still exist for serious cases.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of rehabilitation and punishment; the criminal justice system is basically a punishment,\u201d said Murie.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/10/man-found-guilty-of-using-phone-while-driving-even-though-device-was-dead\">Man found guilty of using phone while driving even though device was dead</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Manitoba unveiled a similar program in 2018, arguing that the new approach deters one-time offenders from returning to the criminal justice system and is more efficient. Murie said administrative fines are processed within an hour \u2013 rather than the four hours needed for a criminal charge.</p> <p>Since the changes were made in British Columbia nearly a decade ago, alcohol-related deaths in the province have dropped 50%, Murie said.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s an incredible accomplishment that hasn\u2019t been accomplished anywhere else in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have way more people alive today than if BC hadn\u2019t changed their system.\u201d</p> <p>Kyla Lee, a Vancouver-based lawyer specialising in drunk driving cases, disagrees that decriminalisation in British Columbia has brought about such radical change.</p> <p>\u201c[The province\u2019s] rules are having literally no impact on the death rate,\u201d she said, suggesting instead that other factors \u2013 including intense media coverage of the policy, as well as greater public awareness \u2013 played an outsized role in reducing alcohol-related deaths.</p> <p>She said that the administrative tools are financially devastating to lower-income residents who often can\u2019t afford the fines levied against them.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had clients who, as a result of [a roadside stop] committed suicide. I\u2019ve had clients who\u2019ve been hospitalised after suicide attempts. I\u2019ve had people who\u2019ve lost their jobs, lost their homes,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Alberta has not yet announced what changes to the law might look like, other than it is \u201cconsidering all options\u201d.</p> <p>Lee agreed that an approach which forces drivers to address the \u201cunderlying issues\u201d rather than forcing them into the criminal system provides better end results.</p> <p>\u201cIf you can keep a person alive, working and contributing to society and address whatever it is that got them in that position, that\u2019s going to be much better for preventing these types of incidents from happening in the future.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>British motor racing was a different kind of deal in the 1930s \u2013 both more amateur and more aristocratic than it is today, and certainly more dangerous. It tended to involve men who had been to famous public schools, and knew how to handle a shotgun on a Yorkshire moor or a yacht on the Solent.</p> <p>They had names like Cholmondeley and Featherstonhaugh, unless they were Siamese princes (which they sometimes were). They went to Cambridge but didn\u2019t excel, or they crashed out completely, because they were more interested in driving fast cars while thinking about how to acquire even faster ones. At weekends they raced their MGs, Rileys and ERAs \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/jan/17/maserati-250f-perfect-racing-machine\" title=\"\">Maseratis</a> and Bugattis too \u2013 up twisting hill climbs in the Malverns, or round the track at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/nov/03/uk-motorsports-brooklands-driving\" title=\"\">Brooklands</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/may/05/donington-park-british-grand-prix-formula-one\" title=\"\">Donington Park</a>.</p> <p>Abroad as well. Some owned aeroplanes. South Africa? No problem. They shipped the cars in advance, then flew down by biplane, swooping low to admire a herd of elephants or find out where they were. Throw in glamorous women, picnics, gallons of champagne, jazz, skiing, a spot of shark fishing \u2026 you get the picture.

Perhaps not the most colourful of them, but what he lacked in charisma, he made up for with talent. Meticulous, cool with a hint of ruthlessness, he was among the greatest of the era. He would surely have been the Lewis Hamilton of his day had he not been tragically killed in an accident at the Belgian Grand Prix at the age of 26.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0e6acde527afd81a7c72f2274d45e6059cb8178c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e6acde527afd81a7c72f2274d45e6059cb8178c/0_537_3285_4101/801.jpg\" alt=\"Dick Seaman.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dick Seaman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: World History Archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They died in their droves, these men, spinning off the track, into walls and trees, and the crowd, killing them too. Racing went on. It was a lack of health and safety gone mad. Meanwhile, Europe edged closer to a precipice. Germany\u2019s new chancellor, Adolf Hitler, opened the 1933 Berlin motor show with promises of new roads, a people\u2019s car, tax cuts for drivers. And state sponsored motor racing. For the next six years the teams of Auto Union and Mercedes-Benz would dominate international grand prix racing.</p> <p>It was no accident that Seaman ended up behind the wheel of a Mercedes Silver Arrow. The handsome young Englishman\u2019s talent and ambition made him a perfect fit. But as the decade progressed, the political situation made everything awkward. He met Hitler, shook his hand, attended rallies, gave the salute (even if it was a bashful British version of it). He was doing brilliantly, was going places fast; he loved his life and his beautiful young German bride Erica Popp \u2013 how bad could things get? His death, while leading at Spa, on 29 June 1939, came just before war did.</p> <p>This is a tale for the enthusiast, but by no means exclusively. Yes, there are mentions of plugs and pistons, tappets and timing; but there is also a brilliant Italian mechanic named Giulio working away in Seaman\u2019s Knightsbridge garage, adjusting those tappets to get the engine timing (of a French Delage, this was pre Silver Arrow) just right. If you don\u2019t know what a Delage looks like, look it up and picture these beautiful lethal silver machines hurtling around \u2013 and off \u2013 the N\u00fcrburgring.</p> <p>Readers of the Guardian, where Richard Williams was chief sports writer for many years (as well as covering music, film, books and just about everything else) and to which he still contributes, will be familiar with the elegance of his prose and the breadth of his interests and expertise. All are on show here. The story is less of a single-seater joy ride focusing only on the track ahead, but more a leisurely parade lap with Williams at the wheel of something more refined. There\u2019s time to savour the sights, a scene, a time, people. Seaman\u2019s mother Lilian \u2013 who couldn\u2019t accept her son\u2019s German wife and whose social climbing exploits raise an eyebrow is especially splendid.</p> <p>As well as English country houses, German house parties and luxury ocean liners, the tour takes in politics and the fascinating interface between sport and world affairs. Why are there no Italian teams at the French Grand Prix in 1936? Punishment for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1935/oct/03/italy.mainsection\" title=\"\">Mussolini\u2019s invasion of Abyssinia</a>, of course.</p> <p>And the big black cloud looming? Well actually there are two. One is full of the rain that will turn the Spa track into wet death, causing Seaman\u2019s car to spin out of control and strike a tree broadside, before bursting into flames.

In the murky world of Guerrilla \u2013 part war diary, part family memoir \u2013 acquiring an anti-aircraft missile is cause for celebration. \u201cThat thing symbolised a good time for people in the rebellion,\u201d Nazar explains. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have to be so scared of airstrikes because they had an umbrella over them.\u201d</p> <p>The son of a general in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/feb/23/victoriabrittain\" title=\"\">Jonas Savimbi\u2019s Unita rebel group</a>, Nazar was born in Belgium in 1993. He grew up in the relative safety of suburban Brussels \u2013 barring a foiled kidnap attempt on his sister and the spectre of street gangs \u2013 as the Angolan civil war raged. After the nation became independent from Portugal in 1975, it was engulfed in a war between the communist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPLA\" title=\"\">People\u2019s Movement for the Liberation of Angola</a> (MPLA) and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNITA\" title=\"UNITA\">National Union for the Total Independence of Angola</a> (Unita), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/05/angola-brutal-history-mpla-leftwing-discipline-betrayal\" title=\"\">backed by Reagan and the CIA</a>. Nazar\u2019s mother worked two jobs to keep the family in a middle-class neighbourhood. When peace came to Angola in 2002 after nearly three decades of fighting and the loss of an estimated 500,000 lives, the family moved back and Nazar encountered his homeland for the first time.</p> <p>As we sit in the London office of his label <a href=\"https://hyperdub.net/\" title=\"\">Hyperdub</a>, he recalls the overwhelming volume of the journey from the airport to his family home, \u201cradios, taxis and minivans literally shaking, creating mini earthquakes when they passed\u201d. In a country ruptured by civil war and longstanding ethnic tensions, the rhythms of kuduro \u2013 a dense, explosive electronic music that first emerged in 80s Luanda \u2013 is a powerful binding force. He calls it \u201cpart of the DNA of Angolan culture\u201d. But for the young Nazar, kuduro\u2019s jubilant mood jarred with his state of mind. \u201cIn Angola I was faced with another reality. It was much more grim.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R27kjqn0Rg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9R27kjqn0Rg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>An \u201calien with no friends\u201d at school in Luanda \u2013 classmates were mostly children of the victorious MPLA \u2013 he occupied himself making beats on his dad\u2019s laptop. Inspiration came from European music at first: the bombastic electro-house of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKzWLUQizz8\" title=\"\">Justice</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/oct/19/burial-10-of-the-best\" title=\"\">Burial\u2019s sample-heavy rave nostalgia</a>, which got him through a long period of depression. But as he felt more at home in Angola and dug into his family history, he incorporated more African sounds. He calls the result \u201crough kuduro\u201d \u2013 a caustic inversion of Angolan pride that packs the energy of kuduro down like gunpowder before blasting it apart, leaving distorted drums and pockmarks of dirt and noise, gun-cocks as percussion and whirring helicopter blades. As with Burial\u2019s haunted memory scapes, it feels like a psychohistorical investigation, exposing the exhausted psyche underneath kuduro\u2019s bright mask.</p> <p>Guerrilla is populated by many voices: his family; Nazar himself, pitched up to sound feminine; and the Hyperdub DJ <a href=\"https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/shannensp\" title=\"\">Shannen SP</a>, who adds a sullen rap to Bunker, a track about the bloody aftermath of Angola\u2019s 1992 elections. On Diverted, Nazar\u2019s father, Alcides Sakala Sim\u00f5es, reads from his war memoir, describing a tactical decision that could have cost him his life. \u201cHe knew he could die, but he accepted it without hesitation. I thought that was extraordinary,\u201d says his son. In a pointed refusal of Portuguese colonial legacy, he speaks in Umbundu, the language of his people. The oral tradition is fundamental to African history, a process that Nazar is accelerating through music. \u201cIt\u2019s like a bank of information for me \u2013 if I play the album, then I remember,\u201d he says. \u201cThe more I know about my history, the more centred I feel.\u201d</p> <p>An adored but absent figure during Nazar\u2019s childhood, Sim\u00f5es looms large over Guerrilla. His battleworn face appears on the album\u2019s sleeve, captured in a film still from 2002 that was circulated by the MPLA to humiliate Unita\u2019s vanquished leaders. Nazar says he is reclaiming the image \u2013 he has even had it printed on T-shirts. A weird look given the bloody legacy of Savimbi\u2019s army, but a reflection of a filial bond. Sim\u00f5es\u2019s reputation has recovered substantially; he is now an elected politician.</p> <p>\u201cAngolan society was very divided between people that supported the Angolan regime and the rest of us,\u201d Nazar says. \u201cRight after the war, stigmatisation, prejudice was extremely common to people that supported Unita. I\u2019d grow up entering spaces knowing that my political affiliation would be despised. But also, I\u2019d also go to spaces where it was admired \u2013 when I would just hang out with my dad, party events, regions of Angola that were strongholds.</p> <p>\u201cSo in that sense, the \u2018official\u2019 story of the bad guy never got to me,\u201d he continues. \u201cI\u2019ve always regarded my dad as what he is, and not what the rebellion or the party did. Both sides had horrible individuals. Both sides had remarkable people who, regardless of their involvement in the fighting, were doing it for final longstanding peace. My dad is one of them. And both sides recognise that.\u201d</p> <p>Having quit his studies to work on music, Nazar now lives in Manchester. \u201cCulturally, there\u2019s not much space in Angola for very abrasive songs,\u201d he explains, plus the internet was too slow and expensive. Manchester also provided the isolation he needed to complete such a personal record. It has taken him most of a decade to process his family\u2019s history and the war stories he heard on road trips around the country. \u201cThey would talk a lot about the war and they recalled it with a very upbeat approach, a lot of black humour. It comes from this perspective that if you\u2019re alive to recount the story you should be grateful.\u201d</p>",

Reporters were left to stand in muddy fields to wait for ministers to emerge from whichever German <em>schloss</em> their meeting was taking place in.</p> \n<p>Palmer had a ringside seat for all the huge political realignments that followed the end of communism in 1989 and the EU\u2019s expansion eastward.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jan/29/from-entry-to-exit-what-did-eu-membership-mean-for-britain-podcast\">The end of the affair: how Britain walked away from the EU - podcast</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He also chronicled the extraordinary political switch in the Conservative view of Europe \u2013 from enthusiastic backing to open hostility.</p> \n<p>The high watermark of the European project coincided with the tenure of the charismatic Jacques Delors in the 1990s. \u201cDelors came to symbolise the push towards European integration,\u201d says Palmer. \u201cYet it was clear from early on that decisions would have repercussions on national politics. The UK drove hard for the single market. But then it began to assume a dynamic of its own \u2013 you could see it would eventually lead to a single currency.\u201d</p> \n<p>British diplomats also became \u201caghast\u201d, Palmer recalls, to see that Bavarians, Catalans and other autonomous regions had their own \u201cgovernments\u201d represented in the EU\u2019s committee of the regions. \u201cThey began to see where all this might lead,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/this-is-europe-nugget-zip/giv-3902djciTE7YISlG/\" data-alt=\"faf\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/this-is-europe-nugget-zip/giv-3902djciTE7YISlG/\">faf</a> \n</figure> \n<p>By then global media interest had ballooned and the EU could boast a press corps to rival Capitol Hill. \u201cAll three Mexican TV channels had a correspondent accredited,\u201d Palmer remembers.</p> \n<p>Stephen Bates was Brussels correspondent for the Guardian for four years in the 1990s and remembers a panic-inducing bewilderment at the acronyms, arcane structures, committees, the system of <em>porte-paroles </em>[spokespersons], all rooted deep in French administrative culture.</p> \n<p>A former Westminster reporter, Bates grew to love the role because \u201cfor all its faults the EU had a forward looking and expanding view, it was a positive project for Europeans and it was about collaboration\u201d.</p> \n<p>He blames British political journalism for much of the incomprehension. \u201cUK journalism is predicated along Westminster lines: a majority government is in power, and it does things. But the EU works in labyrinthine circles, decision making is slow and often very technical, as well as being essentially about collaboration and compromise.\u201d</p> \n<p>The paradox was that the EU was attacked for ruling people\u2019s lives, when the opposite was true. \u201cIn a way, the problem is that it is so diffuse it\u2019s very difficult to get a decision through,\u201d Bates says. Often it\u2019s a miracle that 27 countries can agree about anything.</p> \n<p>Bates recalls a story about how UK chocolate was going to have to be relabelled \u201cvegelate\u201d, because it contained so little cocoa compared with Belgian or French varieties.</p> \n<p>\u201cI wrote that story at least four times,\u201d says Bates \u201cand it was always illustrated with the same picture of a bar of Dairy Milk. But we never seemed to get it resolved because it kept being referred back.\u201d</p> \n<p>That is a feeling familiar to Rankin. \u201cThe EU often feels like one endless process: meetings that result in decisions to convene a meeting at a higher level. One broadcast colleague complained there were never any pictures in Brussels: just endless shots of middle-aged men shaking hands in rooms.\u201d </p> \n<p>A regular complaint from those hostile to the EU is that it is undemocratic, with decisions cooked up behind closed doors. Palmer blames the democratic deficit on a decision by national governments deliberately to keep the directly elected European parliament weak. But no Brussels correspondent ever complains about a lack of information.</p> \n<p>\u201cFinding out what had been decided was never a problem,\u201d Palmer insists. \u201cWhat was more difficult was to establish what would happen next or what lay behind any decision. What you never did was rely solely on your own government to tell you. You went to talk to the Finns, the Irish, whoever.\u201d</p> \n<p>The skill, adds Rankin, is in knowing what not to bother about. \u201cBrussels has always been abundant in information, the trick is finding the useful nuggets from endless press releases, announcements and invitations.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rankin is on her second spell in Brussels \u2013 and notices a big difference from her first stint in 2006.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn my first stint, the UK was part of the EU machine,\u201d she recalled. \u201cBritish ministers spoke on the record to British and international media after EU councils. </p> \n<p>\u201cBy the time I returned (in 2015) the UK was detached. Barely touched by the eurozone or migration crisis of 2015, the UK also didn\u2019t play such a big role in the EU law-making councils. Those on-the-record ministerial meetings with journalists had disappeared.\u201d<br><br>The expectation is that this detachment will only grow, with less and less about the EU and European affairs in the pages of British newspapers. </p> \n<p><em>Katherine Butler was a Europe correspondent in the 1990s.</em></p>",

  "<p>Populism has arrived, blue in tooth and claw. Rishi Sunak\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/key-points-from-budget-2020-at-a-glance\" title=\"\">budget</a>, clearly dictated from 10 Downing Street, proposes a staggering <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/03/11/budget-news-latest-rishi-sunak-boris-johnson-brexit/\" title=\"\">\u00a3600bn</a> of extra public spending over the current parliament, showing an enthusiasm for public spending not seen seen since postwar reconstruction in the 1950s. Apart from cash set aside for coronavirus, it is going not into people\u2019s pockets but largely into state infrastructure. As it rises, it will carry one signature: Boris Johnson\u2019s.</p> <p>No one can complain that a chancellor should prepare to meet a pandemic trauma. Seeking relief for those unable to work makes sense. So does short-term aid to businesses suffering a collapse in demand. But the deeper interest in any budget lies in what it reveals of a government\u2019s mind. Sunak\u2019s budget had one message: that the British economy is in the ownership of central government, as not seen since denationalisation in the 1980s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/rishi-sunak-budget-fiscal-policy-economy-power\">Rishi Sunak\u2019s budget is proof that big spending is always a political choice | Giles Wilkes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sunak made almost no mention of the private sector, except for short-term fiscal relief. His economy was a public construct of hospitals, schools, colleges, roads, railways, research institutes \u2013 all supplied by the grace of London. I calculated that his speech gave away an extra \u00a31.7m of taxpayers\u2019 money every second: generosity on a Neronian scale. Small wonder Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn was left stumbling over how to object. He should just have smiled and said thank you.</p> <p>Absent from the speech was any idea that the public sector belonged to anyone but Sunak. As for local government, there was to be no let-up in austerity. While \u201cour\u201d NHS is to roll in cash, local government\u2019s share of the welfare state, social care and social services got nothing extra. There was no mention of old people or family support or youth clubs: chief victims of the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-46443700\" title=\"\">30%</a> cut in local council spending since 2010. Downward pressure will continue on libraries, day centres, sports fields, drug rehabilitation and facilities for young people.</p> <p>Central government can borrow and spend at will. Local government is allowed no such liberality for its services. There was no whisper from Sunak of a let-up in rate capping, no new sources of local revenue, no hope of council tax revaluation. If cuts continue, they are not central government\u2019s responsibility. Blame your hapless, wasteful local council.</p> <p>In contrast, Downing Street is splurge central. Anything the NHS asks for, says Sunak, be it \u201cmillions or billions\u201d, it can have. He pledges to pay for 50m more surgery appointments. What other government on Earth would boast such implausible specificity? No such offer is made for local care visits, on which the NHS relies for backup. This is built-in unfairness and inefficiency.</p> <p>At times Sunak sounded as if Johnson wanted to be everyone\u2019s mayor. He wants to run everything. He is to allow a redevelopment at Darlington station, a village bypass in north Wales, hotel bedrooms for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/26/government-pledges-236m-to-tackle-rough-sleeping\" title=\"\">6,000 rough sleepers</a>. He announced \u00a38m for new football fields, grants for new maths teachers and \u00a325,000 for an art teacher in every school. This sounds like window dressing, a sort of blame-shedding for Tory austerity.</p> <p>Sunak\u2019s Father Christmas act continued. There is to be an astronomical billion pounds for tower block cladding. \u201cOver a hundred\u201d road junctions are to be improved. Fifty million potholes have been identified as needing repair. Has Sunak counted them? As a cultural uplift for poor Teessiders, rumour has it that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/23/chancellor-will-send-treasury-staff-to-the-north-of-england\" title=\"\">Sunak is to send</a> 750 of his brightest and best officials to live among them. This is like a Victorian missionary expedition.</p> <p>I cannot imagine any other country, democracy or dictatorship, where the centre would so obsessively micromanage its public sector. Britain is off the graph for centralisation. Its local government now has a mere 1.6% of GDP for its spending, against 6% in Germany, 12% in France and 15% in Sweden. In the eye of Whitehall, anything beyond London is now \u201cregional\u201d, never local.</p> <p>The new elected metro-mayors were carefully assigned \u201cregions\u201d not cities, lest they over-identify and go native. They depend not on accountable local taxes but on Treasury handouts. As Professor Tony Travers of LSE puts it: \u201cDevolution means mayors are allowed an opportunity to talk to the Treasury about how to spend money.\u201d They are Whitehall agents.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/end-austerity-budget-george-osborne-public-spending-cuts-rishi-sunak\">An end to austerity? It\u2019s a nice line \u2013 but one budget can\u2019t undo the damage | Simon Wren-Lewis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Central cash for locally run services \u2013 police, schools, transportation \u2013 increasingly relies on hypothecated hand-outs, on Whitehall decisions as to how they are to be spent. Capping and ring-fencing money for police numbers, or subject teachers or new roads, is not communal choice. It is not what most countries would regard as local democracy. It is subservience to central command and control to a single leader.</p> <p>This is the new egocentric populism. It has virtues. It is non-ideological. Its macroeconomics has Keynesian features, buying new public projects in advance of tough times, albeit at the risk of \u201ccrowding out\u201d the private sector. It is not partisan, witness on Wednesday as former Thatcherite Tories bayed support for a budget they would have damned had it come from a Labour chancellor. A fleeting piquant moment came with a still, small voice speaking up for old Tory caution. It was Theresa May, speaking truth to power.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s populism is extreme. Not even Donald Trump tries to run the US this way. It is government more in the style of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary or Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Turkey, relying on seeking current votes by borrowing from future taxpayers. In doing so, Johnson is suppressing what should be the fountainhead of political freedom: local democracy. Who cares whether or not this is Toryism. It is wrong.</p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>Universities and colleges across the US are halting teaching, moving lessons online, and even asking students to move out of campus accommodation in an attempt to prevent the spread of coronavirus.</p> <p>Dozens of institutions \u2013 including UCLA, NYU, Yale and Princeton \u2013 are cancelling in-person lessons in favour of online teaching.

But for the last two days her in-person lessons have been replaced with Zoom conference calls, recorded lectures and teachers\u2019 transcripts. It has been, she said, a \u201csignificant adjustment\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of interesting because we\u2019re all sort of used to being on campus for most of the day and now we\u2019re all kind of stuck at home which I think is a bit of a difficult thing to get used to.\u201d</p> <p>While she has people to spend time with, she is already missing her former life.</p> <p>\u201cSome students are going home because they don\u2019t have to be here, a lot of students are going back to where they\u2019re from. A lot of us are still here,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cBut when you\u2019re not going to class on the daily basis you\u2019re not seeing people as often as you would, you\u2019re not getting out of the house as often as you would. After a couple of days, that starts to get a little bit difficult, so we\u2019re all trying to figure out how to cope with it and get used to it, because it\u2019s possible we\u2019re going to be dealing with this for a while.\u201d</p> <p>While she agrees with the university\u2019s decision to suspend in-person teaching, she said \u201cnone of us like online learning, to be perfectly honest\u201d.</p> <p>Junior Cabral, 34, a psychology major at Bronx Community College, which is also switching to online teaching, agrees.</p> <p>\u201cFor me it has caused high levels of anxiety because I\u2019m very dynamic, I\u2019m outspoken and I\u2019m one of those people that changes the vibe of a room by stepping into a classroom,\u201d he said.</p> <p>While he understands the decision is in their best interests, he finds online learning challenging. \u201cIt is so hard because I took classes online in the past and I hate the online modules. It feels like you\u2019re talking to a machine, you\u2019re typing, there is no interactions with other people, there is no type of activity going on. It feels empty.\u201d</p> <p>In the final semester of his senior year, he also feels like he\u2019s being robbed of a proper ending.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to graduate. So I have this sour memory of my last day in my last semester, like \u2018Oh wow, my last day in class I didn\u2019t get the chance to say bye to anybody\u2019. I feel like this is it.\u201d</p> <p>But for some people, the virus outbreak has led to more positive outcomes.</p> <p>Just two days into online learning, Logan Miller, 27, a first-year law student at UCLA, has found he prefers it to in-person lessons and is taking the opportunity to go back home to Alaska to do his studies from there.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt gives me more flexibility for when and where I can engage with the material that we\u2019re learning. I actually talked for the first time all semester in one of my classes yesterday. Maybe I just felt more comfortable because I was participating in the class from my apartment \u2026 It\u2019s a less stressful environment because law school first-year classes are notoriously high stress and so to be removed from that environment actually makes it easier for me to concentrate.\u201d</p>",

Like the boy who cried wolf, when in years to come Stormont goes to the treasury with a genuine claim for increased funding \u2013 especially around a health service which in places is collapsing \u2013 its claims will be met with deep scepticism.\u201d</p> <p>Coghlin, a retired court of appeal judge, chaired hearings that lasted over a year, interviewed dozens of witnesses and amassed more than a million documents.</p> <p>The long-awaited report is expected to criticise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/arlene-foster\">Arlene Foster</a>, the first minister and head of the Democratic Unionist party (DUP), because she approved the scheme and ignored warnings about perverse incentives and cost overruns.</p> <p>Foster and other DUP ministers barely read important documents, if at all; civil servants cut corners and ignored signs of problems; unelected special advisers essentially ran Stormont and in some cases helped relatives access \u2013 arguably loot \u2013 public funds.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m accountable but I\u2019m not responsible,\u201d Foster told the inquiry in 2018 when asked about a special adviser\u2019s possible criminal conduct.</p> <p>The scandal\u2019s origins lie in a 2012 decision by Northern Ireland\u2019s Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (since renamed the Department for the Economy), then run by Foster, to make the subsidy more valuable than the cost of wood pellets used to heat boilers. Nor did it cap the total subsidy.</p> <p>Word spread that boilers meant profits, and the more boilers and the more you burned, the richer you became. The result was a scramble to install boilers and run them 24/7. Farmers, went the joke, were using oven gloves to open sheds.</p> <p>A whistleblower reported abuses to Stormont officials in 2013 and 2014, to no avail. The scheme continued and was extended until the belated realisation that the UK treasury would not foot the bill.</p> <p>The debacle prompted Sinn F\u00e9in to pull the plug on its power-sharing administration with the DUP, creating a damaging three-year political vacuum that ended in January when political parties agreed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/13/from-bitter-stalemate-to-smiles-at-stormont-how-the-deal-was-done\">restore the assembly and executive</a>.</p> <p>Drastic revisions to the scheme\u2019s terms have turned an envisaged overspend of hundreds of millions of pounds into an underspend.</p> <p>The pendulum may have swung too far back. Many RHI claimants say they signed up in good faith and borrowed money to install boilers, assuming the scheme was properly managed and would benefit them and the environment, only to find themselves branded unethical and greedy \u2013 and then financially marooned when tariffs were slashed.</p> <p>A farmer in county Down who spoke on condition of anonymity said he borrowed \u00a375,000 on the basis his boiler would generate about \u00a36,500 per year, but that had dwindled to \u00a32,000. \u201cMore than likely we will have to sell some of our other assets to try and pay off that RHI loan,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been scapegoats in all this.\u201d</p> <p>A county Antrim farmer said he was receiving just 10% of the original tariff, a fraction of what farmers in the rest of the UK received, miring him in debt. \u201cI\u2019m stressed financially, emotionally, psychologically.\u201d</p>",

Intuitively, instinctually, it feels like a space where my daughter will flourish. Is it just because of how beautiful it is?

On the wall, in the waiting room, are her degrees, all from fancy places. She is worth the money, is what I\u2019m trying to say. Of all the things in the world for which a person might pay $305 there are few things I was more willing to pay for than this.</p> <p>When I was a private SAT tutor, an hour with me cost more than an hour with this therapist. But the SAT, then, to me, felt like a higher-order concern. Whereas this help for our seven-year-old \u2013 who feels less overwhelmed now by being asked to pay attention in class or to not come into our room at night because her brain was whirring and telling me she was worried that no one understood that she didn\u2019t listen when people told her things \u2013 feels entirely necessary.</p> <p>The friend who recommended this therapist said her family had 70% covered by their insurance through her husband\u2019s job, which I knew was better than ours. Our insurance \u2013 which is through Child Health Plus, a nationwide program controlled by the states that subsidizes healthcare for children who don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid but whose families can\u2019t afford or don\u2019t have access to private insurance \u2013 can pay for care on a sliding scale. It\u2019s great in some ways. It\u2019s great if you don\u2019t leave the state, for instance; elsewhere, almost none of the care you seek is covered. It\u2019s great, it turns out, as long as you don\u2019t seek mental healthcare, which is, according to the website and three different conversations that I had with representatives, not covered at all.</p> <p>This story doesn\u2019t end with total despair and it also doesn\u2019t end in victory. I\u2019m still investigating other insurance options for our children. The therapist has an associate she\u2019s offered to transfer our daughter to who charges less. This is, for now, a story about the way the systems under which we live force us to make choices that might at first feel impossible, about trading and compromising amid what used to feel like necessities.</p> <p>In the meantime, what we\u2019re doing is no longer paying for the private health insurance my husband and I used to be covered by. We were paying $1,430 a month for healthcare \u2013 well over 10% of our combined yearly income \u2013 with a $7,500 deductible. We\u2019ve only used it a handful of times. We\u2019ve often had to cut this cost before. The choice in this way feels almost uncomplicated: our baby\u2019s struggling and we believe this therapist can help her. Whatever happens to my husband and I in the meantime, nothing feels as dire as addressing that.<br></p>",
  "<p>While the known Covid-19 infection rate continued to climb this week in the US, efforts to limit further spread are beginning to affect daily life for many Americans. Dr John Swartzberg, clinical professor emeritus of infectious diseases and vaccinology at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health, praises the steps government and private companies have taken to limit public gatherings. But he cautioned against letting collective concern turn to toxic fear: \u201cThat\u2019s not productive for yourself or for keeping you safe.\u201d</p> <p>The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p> <p><strong>We\u2019re starting to see a real shift in public life across the US, with the cancellation and in some cases government banning of large public <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/12/mls-suspends-season-as-coronavirus-outbreak-hits-us-sporting-calendar\">gatherings</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-concerts-live-nation-wme-music\">events</a>. How effective are those kinds of measures in limiting the spread of infections?</strong></p> <p>I was publicly vocal that sporting events should shut down weeks ago. I thought it was just irresponsible of [the Bay Area sports teams] the San Jose Sharks and the Golden State Warriors to hold public games with fans. So I think all the advice and now dicta to not have these gatherings is a wise thing to do in the face of a pandemic.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s no better way to infect people rapidly than to take human beings and put them in a confined space for a prolonged period</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s no better way to infect more people rapidly than to take human beings and put them in a confined space for a prolonged period of time. And that\u2019s exactly what gatherings do, bringing people from disparate parts of a community together, crowding them together and leaving them there for a prolonged period of time. Think for a moment that you\u2019re the virus instead of a human, and your role in life is to produce more viral particles. It\u2019s ideal from a virus\u2019s perspective in terms of transmission.</p> <p><strong>What are some of the most persistent public misconceptions about </strong><strong>Covid-19</strong><strong>?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve heard some say: look at influenza, that\u2019s already killed between 20 and 30,000 Americans this year, so what\u2019s the big deal about Covid-19? I think that\u2019s a major mis-framing of the situation. There\u2019s no question that influenza is a horrible disease that kills a lot of people every year. On the other hand, we\u2019ve got an infectious agent facing us that we think is around 20 times more contagious than influenza, and carries a mortality rate that is probably 20 to 40 times greater than influenza, and it\u2019s increasing in some parts of the world almost 33% a day over the past two weeks. Where we are now with Covid-19 and where we could be in a few weeks to a few months, we don\u2019t know, but it could be disastrous.</p> <p><strong>Other places experiencing </strong><strong>coronavirus outbreaks have been successful in slowing transmission. What are they doing right that the US isn\u2019t doing?</strong></p> <p>Everybody\u2019s still struggling with knowing what was effective and what was not effective in China. China has not only blunted the curve, but we\u2019re seeing the number of cases declining. I suspect it was related to the draconian measures of not letting people travel outside of that region. They walled off the Hubei province, as many as 56 million people. It\u2019s hard to imagine something like that here in the US, but if things get worse, we might see that. We need to understand what worked and what didn\u2019t work so we can learn from that and apply those things here. But China is a very different society from ours in terms of how it\u2019s governed.</p> <p>We may also be seeing a decline in cases in South Korea. They\u2019ve done an enormous amount of testing, so they know where to apply their public health resources.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/us-cities-wuhan-coronavirus-covid-19\">Will American cities have a Wuhan experience?

We\u2019ve gone from containment to mitigation now, but there may be parts of the country where we should still be putting effort and money into containment.</p> <p>All of these things are knowable, but they\u2019re unknown now because we\u2019ve completely bungled the testing that we should be doing. Just completely. I\u2019m shocked to be saying this.

I come in every day with no makeup, go shopping with no makeup, get on planes with no makeup. I once did ACA with no hair or makeup in Brisbane after wading through flood waters all day in 100% humidity. A Sunday paper gossip columnist devoted her entire column to how poorly groomed I was. My hairdresser has been doing my hair for more than 20 years. She does other people\u2019s hair too. Lucky for all of us because mine needs all the help it can get. I don\u2019t have daily or even monthly wardrobe consultations. Have managed to dress myself since I was about 4yo. And as for seeing myself as some big star? Spare me. The weekly womens mags treat women like morons. Both their readers, and those of us they use to sell copies. They have to make this stuff up, because none of us will actually talk to them any more.

Time has carpeted the pain. Slowly but surely, the shock recedes until all we feel is the echo of the tragedy.

It was a universal and fundamentally human pain. It was the visceral pain of knowing that innocent people had been murdered. It was the outrage at the media outlets that <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/03/zealand-tabloids-condemned-humanising-mosque-attacker-190316081740694.html\">humanised</a> the terrorist by referring to him as an \u201cangelic boy\u201d and an \u201cordinary white man\u201d.</p> <p>At the start of this month, I felt a sense of anxiety. I thought it was just me. In preparing to write this piece, I started reaching out to my Muslim friends to check in with them and ask how they were feeling with the one year anniversary of the tragedy fast approaching. The responses have been similar in many ways \u2013 united by a common thread of sadness, fear, frustration, and a deep sense that pain is still felt.</p> <p>Mohamed Hassan, a poet and journalist from Cairo, Egypt has just launched a new podcast entitled The Guest House which explores the five stages of grief specifically in relation to the events of 15 March 2019. In the fourth episode, Hassan explores the connection between negative media rhetoric about Muslims and Islam, and the corresponding backlash that Muslims experience. Similarly in Australia, a University of Sydney <a href=\"https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2019/04/01/vast-majority-of-nsw-hate-crimes-race-and-religion-related--stud.html\">study</a> found that Muslims were the most common victim religion of hate crimes, followed by Jewish people (73% and 14% respectively). An Asio analytical report prepared after the Christchurch massacre has revealed concerns that far right groups may carry out a terrorist attack in Australia in the next decade, drawing on the Christchurch terrorist attacks as \u201cinspiration\u201d.</p> <p>What has followed is vicarious trauma. What this concept has meant for us, as individual Muslims, and for our Muslim identities after the Christchurch massacre varies from individual to individual. For some Muslims it meant de-veiling. It meant standing with our backs to the wall on the train platform. It meant not setting foot in a mosque. It meant feeling a certain anxiety in public spaces \u2013 and for some it still does. However, it has also presented opportunities for us to lean on our communities for support, to express ourselves through art and poetry and to be unapologetically Muslim.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/new-zealand-gun-reform-stalled-as-christchurch-anniversary-approaches\">New Zealand gun reform stalled as Christchurch anniversary approaches</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We hold the Bankstown Poetry Slam on the last Tuesday of every month. Our event at the end of March 2019 was a space for community healing, support and love. The energy in the room was different. It was nervous, tense and sad. Mohammad Awad held back tears as he performed a poem dedicated to Mucad Ibrahim, the youngest victim of the massacre. \u201cI keep seeing his smile \u2026 his cheeks/will never grow laugh lines.\u201d Ali Al Hajj implored us to understand that \u201chate speech\u201d is not \u201cfree speech\u201d but rather \u201ccomes at the cost of innocence\u201d. Iman Etri asked rhetorically: \u201cDon\u2019t you know? <em>He </em>preyed on them in prayer but we make mosques of everywhere we go.\u201d In many ways, spaces like this provide a platform for us to illuminate our struggles, our fears, our love, and our pain.</p> <p>For many of my Muslim friends, life has not changed. The stereotypes continue to be perpetuated. The fear of being attacked is palpable. The stares linger. In many ways, life has not changed because the world has not changed. However, hope exists. Hope is the opioid of the oppressed. As long as there is hope, the light of a future world that we can dream into existence looms on the horizon.</p> <p>Our Prophet Muhammad\u2019s cousin, Imam Ali (peace be upon them both) is known for two quotes which I try to embody and live by.</p> <p>The first is to \u201cbe like the flower that gives fragrance, even to the hand that crushes it\u201d.</p> <p>The second is that \u201cevery person is either your brother in faith or your equal in humanity\u201d.</p> <p>If we all truly saw each other as equals, we can start to rebuild \u2026 with open mosque doors and open arms. With dignity, and with \u201cnoor\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 Sara Mansour is a lawyer, poet and the co-founder and director of the Bankstown Poetry Slam</p>",
  "<p>In the 22nd Biennale of Sydney, theme is everything. Curated by the Indigenous artist Brook Andrew, the title is Nirin \u2013 a Wiradjuri word meaning \u201cedge\u201d \u2013 with the accompanying public program titled Nirin Wir,<em> </em>or \u201cedge of the sky\u201d.</p> <p>With more than 100 artists and collectives from 36 countries, the coherence of the theme is the key to making sense of the various approaches, attitudes and ideas circulating throughout six venues: Cockatoo Island, the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the National Art School and Artspace in Sydney, and Campbelltown Arts Centre on the south-western edge of the city.</p> <p>But to appreciate the BoS\u2019s current form, it\u2019s important to understand its recent history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cd7a8cc00b586f206e4d37770922d85579053de1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd7a8cc00b586f206e4d37770922d85579053de1/457_0_2380_2381/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brook Andrew, curator of the 2020 Biennale of Sydney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brook Andrew, the curator of the 2020 Biennale of Sydney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Trent Walker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2014, the biennale was rocked by protests from artists over connections <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/dec/18/australian-art-in-2014-the-year-of-protest-politics-and-power-games\">between the organisation and its corporate sponsors</a>.

While the number of venues has remained more or less constant, some aspects of the BoS have either been downplayed or eliminated entirely.</p> <p>There have been fewer big-name international artists, with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/16/sydney-biennale-review-from-ai-weiweis-refugee-journey-to-silent-orchestras\">Chinese superstar artist Ai Wei Wei</a> a conspicuous anomaly among many lesser known artists in 2018.</p> <p> For 2020 the BoS is an even more modest affair. There are no art superstars, few media-friendly eye-catching works, and although a catalogue is promised to appear in time for the opening weekend, there aren\u2019t any conventional wall texts: just an information sheet on an Officeworks clipboard pegged to the wall.</p> <p>You might say this is all irrelevant to the exhibition itself, and in many ways it is. But it\u2019s also intentional. This BoS sets out to give voice to the artists of colour and of First Nations who have been marginalised by a Eurocentric art world obsessed with fame and money. The unnecessary expense of past events has now been replaced with a virtuous negation. And with the first Aboriginal artist/curator in the history of the BoS at its helm, the show has a mission.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9d9c6bc47b3e97ef6b4b8660e94e0c8baf6e05e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d9c6bc47b3e97ef6b4b8660e94e0c8baf6e05e6/0_0_8688_5792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Progress installation view at the Museum of Contemporary Art\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Progress installation view at the Museum of Contemporary Art.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zan Wimberley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Andrew, Nirin proposes that \u201ccreativity is an important means of truth-telling, of directly addressing unresolved anxieties that stalk our times and ourselves. More importantly, it is a place from which to see the world through different eyes, to embrace our many edges and imagine pride in sociologically and harmonious self-defined futures.\u201d</p> <p>So how do these ideas actually play out in the exhibition?</p> <p>At Campbelltown Arts Centre, the uniting logic of the selection is to explore the archive of Indigenous histories, from photojournalism and street posters to various approaches to auto-ethnography.</p> <p>One of the standout works is Barbara McGrady\u2019s Our Ancestors Are Always Watching (2020), a multiscreen video installation of densely collaged photos, music and text.</p> <p>As a Gomeroi <em>yinah</em> (woman), McGrady\u2019s photojournalism has recorded the variety of Aboriginal experience through, as the artist puts it, a \u201cblack lens\u201d. One part of the text in the video states: \u201cWHEN SOME ARTS ELITIST SAYS YOU ARE ONLY A SPORTS PHOTOGRAPHER \u2026 IT\u2019S MORE THAN SPORT.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e99523dfd8ace4f57b4958d82beca289aaa859f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e99523dfd8ace4f57b4958d82beca289aaa859f/0_0_6703_4419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barbara Grady\u2019s Our Ancestors Are Always Watching video at Campbelltown Arts Centre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barbara McGrady\u2019s Our Ancestors Are Always Watching (2020) at Campbelltown Arts Centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zan Wimberley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The declarative tone and didacticism of McGrady\u2019s video is like many other works across Nirin, on the one hand declaring its cultural importance and relevance, while on the other refuting the very world in which the show operates.</p> <p>Artists working in more subtle, metaphoric ways were, for this viewer at least, far more successful.</p> <p>At the National Art School, Mexican artist Teresa Margolles has installed Untitled (2020) which features a blood red curtain creating a long, rectangular room. Inside is a heated metal plate onto which drops of water fall from above. When the droplets hit the surface they evaporate in a puff of steam, but leave a mark.</p> <p>The work is a powerful memorial for Mexico\u2019s murdered women who number in the hundreds every month.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cb694bb36ab98f5b83c8ab82d8f905638e99c6fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb694bb36ab98f5b83c8ab82d8f905638e99c6fa/0_0_8836_5884/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled (2020) by Teresa Margolles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A powerful memorial for Mexico\u2019s murdered women who number in the hundreds every month\u2019: Untitled (2020) by Teresa Margolles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zan Wimberley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A similar approach can be found at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Aziz Hazara\u2019s five-channel video Bow Echo (2019). In it, Hazara, from Kabul, deals with the problem of representation: how does one effectively represent horror, anguish and violence?</p> <p>Hazara applies the question to the wave of suicide bombings that have taken place in Kabul over the last two decades; he presents five small boys atop a high mountain peak, Kabul city laid out behind them. The boys blow toy trumpets, the score of the video pounding out an ominous deep tone.</p> <p>Without knowing the background of the work, the video is undeniably effective; its reference points make it devastating.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7be616619b85043a86cf100bc06e0a4cb259ef78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7be616619b85043a86cf100bc06e0a4cb259ef78/0_0_4916_3069/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aziz Hazara\u2019s Bow Echo (2019)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"624\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aziz Hazara\u2019s Bow Echo (2019): \u2018The video is undeniably effective; its reference points make it devastating.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken Leanfore</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the Art Gallery of NSW, the theme of \u201cedge\u201d places a counter-history of art right in the middle of the European tradition. Curator Brook Andrew has created a version of his own work from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/23/asia-pacific-triennial-8-review-a-colourful-snapshot-of-the-world\">2015 Asia Pacific Triennial</a>. But where in Queensland, Andrew had placed his own large canvases into the gallery\u2019s colonial art collection, here at the AGNSW a variety of work by other artists have been placed among the often-visited collection of colonial pastoral scenes, monumental history pictures of battles and explorers and marble busts of notable grandees.</p> <p>The results are mixed \u2013 some of the dissonance is effective, at other times baffling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38b70f57a080222bab37edfbb8c8b45e1856df2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38b70f57a080222bab37edfbb8c8b45e1856df2e/0_0_8528_5589/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Installation view (2020) photographed in the Grand Courts at the Art Gallery of New South Wales\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There Might Be No Other Place In The World As Good As Where I Am Going to Take You by Jo\u00ebl Andrianomearisoa (2020)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zan Wimberley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Andrew has made another gesture that pretty much claims the entire biennale as a work of his own. Using the pseudonym Powerful Objects, he has placed a variety of archival objects from private and museum collections through all of the venues.</p> <p>In some cases, this elegantly extends the new works into a wider historical perspective, but just as often it\u2019s confusing, clouding the reading of the actual BoS works without any clear definition between who did what, and why.</p> <p>Cockatoo Island has become the BoS\u2019s key venue, its major industrial spaces and decrepit small rooms a challenge to any artist who works there. The Nirin theme there is largely inconsistent and disparate, but at a push one might consider it as the place where the edge ceases to be a metaphor and becomes literal \u2013 can you find all the art without a map?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7197b27756a5aecc3447a15044552f2e04ff5949\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7197b27756a5aecc3447a15044552f2e04ff5949/0_0_8987_5925/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ibrahim Mahama\u2019s No Friend but the Mountains (2012-2020)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ibrahim Mahama\u2019s No Friend but the Mountains (2012-2020).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zan Wimberley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One standout work I did find was Algerian-French artist Mohammed Bourouissa\u2019s Brutal Family Roots (2020), which belies its title and offers the visitor a gorgeous wattle-yellow zone to chill out in, to smell the flowers and listen to lovely ambient music. Creating connections between language, music and cultures, the work operates on the same metaphorical level as Nirin\u2019s best works.</p> <p>Which is not to say some tougher aesthetics don\u2019t go a long way too. Tucked in a corner at Woolloomooloo\u2019s Artspace \u2013 where the theme is collaboration and connection \u2013 is the work of Tennant Creek Brio: a group of Aboriginal men who live in the remote Northern Territory and make anarchic art: paint-covered pokie machines and canvases featuring mysterious, heraldic figures.</p> <p>A video plays on a pokie screen showing the artists working in their studio, driving around at night, and dancing. It looks like a lot of fun, and so is the art.</p>",

  "<p>One of the most popular topics on the Chinese microblog Weibo on Thursday was a one-minute clip of a US congressional hearing this week on how the country was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-outbreak-us-trump-latest\">dealing with the coronavirus</a>.</p> \n<p>In the video posted by the People\u2019s Daily, Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is asked whether there may have been deaths attributed to influenza that could actually have been the result of Covid-19. Redfield responds in the affirmative: \u201cSome cases have been actually diagnosed that way in the United States today.\u201d</p> \n<p>Redfield\u2019s vague answer was enough to add fuel to a conspiracy theory that has been gaining traction over the past two weeks in China \u2013 that the coronavirus did not originate in China but may have come from the US instead.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--showcase\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/01/interactive-coronavirus-tracker\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe US has finally acknowledged that among those who had died of the influenza previously were cases of the coronavirus. The true source of the virus was the US!\u201d one commentator said. \u201cThe US owes the world, especially China, an apology,\u201d another said. \u201cAmerican coronavirus,\u201d one wrote.</p> \n<p>The theory has gained traction over the past few weeks, after a respected epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan, said in a passing remark at a press conference on 27 February that although the virus first appeared in China \u201cit may not have originated in China\u201d.</p> \n<p>Zhong later clarified his statement, saying that the first place where a disease is discovered does not \u201cequate to it being the source\u201d. He told reporters: \u201cBut neither can we conclude that the virus came from abroad. Only through investigation and tracing can we answer that question.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet only Zhong\u2019s first comment has stuck, repeated by Chinese diplomats, state media and officials who have subtly encouraged the idea.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, a foreign ministry spokesman suggested without evidence the US military might have brought the virus to the Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak. Zhao Lijian accused the US of lacking transparency, saying on Twitter: \u201cWhen did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!\u201d</p> \n<p>China\u2019s ambassador to South Africa said last week on Twitter that the virus was not necessarily \u201cmade in China\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AmbLINSongtian/status/1236322524281044993\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Although the epidemic first broke out in China, it did not necessarily mean that the virus is originated from China, let alone \"made in China\". <a href=\"https://t.co/EVXLkQnyfF\">pic.twitter.com/EVXLkQnyfF</a></p>\u2014 Chinese Ambassador to South Africa (@AmbLINSongtian) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmbLINSongtian/status/1236322524281044993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 7, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>An editorial in Xinhua last week also echoed Zhong: \u201cThe epidemic was first reported in China but that does not mean it necessarily originated in China \u2026 The WHO has said many times that Covid-19 is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/who-declares-coronavirus-pandemic\">global phenomenon</a> with its source still undetermined.\u201d</p> \n<p>Officials have framed the campaign as a protest against the \u201cpoliticisation\u201d of the outbreak by countries such as the US, where some officials have continued to use the terms \u201cChinese coronavirus\u201d or \u201cWuhan virus,\u201d despite the World Health Organization\u2019s discouragement. But analysts say China may be looking to deflect blame as the coronavirus spreads around the world.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe might be heading into first global recession caused by Chinese Communist party mismanagement,\u201d wrote Bill Bishop, author of the China newsletter Sinocism. \u201cPrevious manmade disasters in China since 1949 never really spread outside the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s borders in meaningful ways.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThis time looks to be different \u2026 And that is likely one of the reasons the propaganda apparatus and PRC officials are pushing so hard the idea that virus may not have originated in China,\u201d he wrote.</p> \n<p>For weeks, Chinese state media pointed to a seafood market in Wuhan as the likely origin for the virus while researchers said the source had not yet been determined, but few have floated the idea that it came from outside of China. Another respected Chinese researcher, Zhang Wenhong, said in an interview with the China Daily that he did not believe the virus had been imported into China.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf that was the case, we should have seen patients emerging from different regions in the country around the same time rather than their concentration in Wuhan,\u201d he said, in comments that later appeared to have been removed from the interview.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think the consensus is still clearly that the virus did originate in China,\u201d said Jane Duckett, professor at the Scottish Centre for China Research, University of Glasgow, focusing on Chinese policy and health.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis would appear to be a nationalist narrative aimed at countering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/how-did-china-get-grips-with-coronavirus-outbreak\">criticism of the Chinese government for not better managing the outbreak</a> in its early stages,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Shifting the narrative may also be important as China tries to move forward, now that new infections appear to have levelled off. This week, the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/xi-jinping-visits-wuhan-for-first-time-since-coronavirus-outbreak-began\">visited Wuhan for the first time</a> since the outbreak began as state media pronounced \u201cvictory is near\u201d. State media showed elaborate celebrations marking the closure of the last of the temporary hospitals in Wuhan.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a propaganda effort aimed at the domestic audience. Among the Chinese public, there is a general awareness that delays in notifying the public led to many more infections in Wuhan,\u201d said Victor Shih, a politics professor at the University of California, San Diego.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cThis campaign is aimed at distracting the public from the party\u2019s delayed response.\u201d</p>",

What they got was a sense of urgency which we have not heard up until now. In short, the meeting\u2019s participants concluded that Germany is now in crisis mode, with a plan to be unrolled with immediate effect to restructure the country\u2019s hospitals in order to boost the number of intensive care beds (currently there are 28,000 of them, 25,000 of which are equipped with respiratory apparatus). All non-urgent operations are to be postponed. The state will offer financial help to the health insurance companies to ensure this happens, Merkel said. </p> \n  <p>She appealed to Germans to restrict social contact as much as possible. She also advised on the cancellation of all gatherings which are not strictly necessary. She said the next \u201c4, 5 weeks\u201d would be \u201cvery very crucial in determining the question as to what happens next\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Markus S\u00f6der, premier of Bavaria and the leader of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria, admitted that the situation was \u201cfar more dramatic than we had thought even one or two weeks ago\u201d. He said that the government\u2019s quick introduction of so-called \u2018Kurzarbeit\u2019 - or work reduction policies introduced at the height of the banking crisis, which ensure workers receive their wages, and see employers compensated by the state \u201csend an important signal to German businesses\u201d. He coined a phrase used by Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank at the height of the Euro crisis, \u201cwe will do whatever it takes\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Although many Germans had hoped or expected they might do, the leaders did not decide on:</p> \n  <p>- a universal policy on closing schools, kindergartens and universities, although S\u00f6der did announce this evening that Bavaria (which currently has 500 people with coronavirus, and one death) will do so from tomorrow, becoming the first state to do so.</p> \n  <p>- Neither did it decide on the closure of German borders (though it will control them including checking temperatures).</p> \n  <p>- Neither did it decide to stop flights to and from Italy.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6aa40f8f087df56e4c79d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/deniscampbell\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T21:10:08.850Z\">9.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Should schools in Britain shut? Interestingly, although other countries such as Italy and Ireland are doing that, there appears to be no groundswell of medical or scientific opinion in the UK that it should follow suit. </p> \n  <p>There are slightly mixed opinions among experts surveyed by the Science Media Centre (<a href=\"https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/\">https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/</a>), but no one urging immediate closures like those seen elsewhere. </p> \n  <p>\u201cNot closing schools seems understandable to me\u201d, said Dr Jennifer Rohn, a cell biologist at University College London. \u201cChildren will be the least likely to be affected and therefore the least likely to be shedding virus, which is directly proportional to more serious symptoms. In contrast, if you close schools you\u2019re keeping a very large number of parents away from work. As long as it is deemed feasible to keep workplaces open, it\u2019s probably better not to harm the economy further in this way.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, is more sceptical. \u201cI would like to see a bit more about why they\u2019re not closing schools and banning large events. We do know, in general, that school holidays lead to a marked reduction of transmission in infections and at the end of school holidays, infection rates take off. Every mother and father knows that when kids go back to school they\u2019re going to get hammered by colds and flus and sore throats.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He would like to know more about how ministers and government advisers reached their decision. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s based on good quality science. But we don\u2019t know what that science is. The science isn\u2019t being shared with us in a way that makes it easy for us to understand the logical basis for all of this. I would hope that more of the information and science that the government is relying on to make these decisions would be made available so we could interrogate it and see if it\u2019s valid.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Dr Charlotte Jackson, from the UCL Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, points out that school closures have proven effective against outbreaks in the past. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThere are examples from the UK and elsewhere of school closures reducing transmission of influenza. During the 2009 flu pandemic, the UK saw a reduction in cases following the closure of schools for the summer holiday, and an increase when schools reopened in the autumn. There are also studies from various other settings, including France, Hong Kong and Mexico, suggesting reductions in transmission of seasonal or pandemic influenza associated with school closures. Social distancing measures in general did seem to slow down transmission in US cities during the 1918 flu pandemic\u201d, she says. </p> \n  <p>However, that does not mean that they would help delay the spread of the Coronavirus, she adds. \u201cWith the current coronavirus outbreak, countries have generally used lots of control measures at the same time (this also happened during the 1918 flu pandemic) so it\u2019s difficult to separate any effects of school closures from other interventions. I wouldn\u2019t like to comment definitively on whether closures would be effective for this particular virus.\u201d </p> \n  <p>What about Boris Johnson\u2019s new policy of advising schools against overseas trips? Deenan Pillay, professor of virology at UCL, says: \u201cBanning overseas school trips is a difficult one, but remember that any trips involve groups of people going to airports, going on boats and coaches and living together, and since this virus is ubiquitous now, anything like that is likely to increase acquisition of the virus. We know that children are less likely to get severe disease from coronavirus, but they nevertheless are likely, if they do get infection, to spread to others. It\u2019s a sensible measure before closing the schools\u201d. <br></p> \n  <p>(With thanks to the Science Media Centre). <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6aa0868f08c2df6d27896b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T20:59:37.721Z\">8.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A further update from Spain: The government has announced that another member of the cabinet has tested positive for coronavirus.

Rita and I are down here in Australia. We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the Coronavirus, and were found to be positive. Well, now. What to do next? The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks\u2019 will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no? We\u2019ll keep the world posted and updated. Take care of yourselves!
