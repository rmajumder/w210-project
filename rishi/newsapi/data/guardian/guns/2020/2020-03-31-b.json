These travellers are being quarantined in hotels and motels, though there have been some reports of those quarantined being allowed out to buy their own groceries -- which is not allowed.</li> \n   <li>Far more testing. Skegg said loosening of rules around testing -- which no longer require patients to have traveled overseas or have come into contact with a confirmed case -- haven\u2019t got through to doctors in the field. </li> \n   <li>The capacity for rapid case contract tracing must be greatly expanded as a matter of urgency, Skegg said.</li> \n  </ol> \n  <p>The epidemic committee was held by video call, with a live stream broadcast publicly and available to watch on social media and many news outlets. As with any group of people holding a Zoom meeting, there was the occasional person speaking with bizarre echoing feedback, although only one lawmaker asking a question had to be reminded to un-mute his microphone.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e82a8d58f0866297e9f3f3e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/mario-koran\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T02:21:08.774Z\">3.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Anger as Las Vegas turns parking lot into sleeping area for homeless</h2> \n  <p>Images of homeless people sleeping in a converted parking lot in Las Vegas have sparked criticism, even as the city officials describe an \u201cemergency situation\u201d and say the solution was the best option after another shelter was forced to close amid the coronavirus crisis. <br><br>Over the weekend, authorities in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/las-vegas\">Las Vegas</a> needed to find additional sleeping space for the city\u2019s sizable homeless population when a 500-bed overnight shelter closed after a client tested positive for the new coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>Officials turned a parking lot into a makeshift shelter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClarkCountyNV/status/1244029870461472768\">saying</a> spaces for sleeping were drawn 6ft apart in observance of federal social distancing guidelines.</p> \n  <p>Many white boxes were covered up with blue mats that could be more easily cleaned.

He got between Pessotto and Zidane, who ended up his backside, and flashed it past Peruzzi. There\u2019s no celebration from Keane: he points to Beckham, acknowledging the quality of the corner, and runs straight back to the halfway line to get on with business. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e90072d35d4b573d1493bda3b8e2b588f1cf900f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e90072d35d4b573d1493bda3b8e2b588f1cf900f/0_198_3072_1842/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester United captain Roy Keane gets infront of Juventus keeper Angelo Peruzzi to head home.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester United captain Roy Keane gets infront of Juventus keeper Angelo Peruzzi to head home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ross Kinnaird/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee89d2f108320fbd7a9fd51fc4b2c5c2ced5141f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee89d2f108320fbd7a9fd51fc4b2c5c2ced5141f/0_190_3072_1842/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester United captain Roy Keane wheels away after scoring.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keane wheels away after scoring.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T19:26:12.509Z\">at 8.26pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e8395168f08532a0e665824\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T19:08:56.980Z\">8.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>24 min </strong>United move the ball smoothly from right to left, where Cole wins a corner.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e83950a8f08532a0e665822\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T19:08:00.406Z\">8.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>23 min </strong>\u201cI\u2019m watching this in The Dickens Inn in Philadelphia, Rob, and the mood is glum right now,\u201d says Justin Kavanagh. \u201cAlthough Andy from Norn Iron is wearing his \u201clucky jumper\u201d (a red and black hoop Denis the Menace affair), it certainly isn\u2019t working for United tonight.

The first goal may have been avoidable, but this was desperately unfortunate. Di Livio and Davids combined to find Pessotto, who eased a pass into Inzaghi on the left edge of the area. He waited until he felt Stam behind him, then shifted the ball down the line and hit a speculative cross-shot that took a wicked deflection off Stam and spun over the head of Peter Schmeichel. The bounce was a freak of physics. I don\u2019t think it was on target before it hit Stam, but Inzaghi will claim it. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f5c43421e8aeeae66c1d4d276e5dfac5e12997b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f5c43421e8aeeae66c1d4d276e5dfac5e12997b/0_0_3072_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Filippo Inzaghi of Juventus (right) shoots past Manchester United defender Jaap Stam to score.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Filippo Inzaghi gets his, and Juventus\u2019s second goal of the night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T18:57:37.688Z\">at 7.57pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e8391d78f0866297e9f4876\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T18:55:09.176Z\">7.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>10 min </strong>I suppose Manchester United had to score anyway.

Ciro Ferrara replaces Paolo Montero, who is only on the bench. That must be because of injury. The suspended right-back Zoran Mirkovic is replaced by Alessandro Birindelli at right-back. </p> <p>The young French winger Thierry Henry, who scored twice at Lazio on Saturday, is cup tied.

But check it out\u2019</strong></h2> <p>On more than one occasion in recent weeks, Trump has questioned states\u2019 sudden surge in demand for equipment such as masks and ventilators \u2013 essential tools in doctors\u2019 battle against coronavirus.</p> <p>During his daily White House briefing, the president has said states are \u201cstocked up\u201d with medical equipment, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s a question as to hoarding of ventilators, some hospitals and independent hospitals and some hospital chains, as we call them \u2013 they are holding ventilators, they don\u2019t want to let \u2019em up.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also questioned why hospitals in New York City suddenly needed 300,000 masks when they previously needed 10,000 masks. \u201cSo I think people should check that, because there\u2019s something going on, whether \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hoarding, I think it\u2019s maybe worse than hoarding. But check it out.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s re-election campaign has since claimed the president was merely echoing Andrew Cuomo, New York\u2019s governor, who has said that he has asked the state police to investigate the theft of masks. But no evidence has been forthcoming on Trump\u2019s seemingly baseless assertion of \u201choarding\u201d or \u201cworse than hoarding\u201d by hospitals.</p> <p>Governors from several states have said they have received just a small fraction of the medical equipment they need to deal with the pandemic. New York, for example, has said it needs tens of thousands of ventilators but has only received a few thousand. The reason for the sudden surge in demand for these items is obvious \u2013 there is a pandemic of a new virus that is putting a huge and sudden strain on healthcare systems.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018You can call it a germ, you can call it a flu, you can call it a virus, you know you can call it many different names. I\u2019m not sure anybody even knows what it is\u2019</strong></h2> <p>On 27 March, Trump made the above claim despite warnings from public health experts that coronavirus should not be conflated with seasonal flu. Fauci, for example, has said that Covid-19 is transferred between people far more easily than the flu and has a mortality rate around 10 times higher.</p> <p>While there was initial confusion over coronavirus when Chinese authorities described it as an unusual form of pneumonia, the world has been well aware of the dimensions of the virus since January, when China acknowledged the severity of the condition and released the genetic information of Covid-19.</p>",

  "<p>Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto is accused of being responsible for \u201cmultiple human rights violations\u201d after its Panguna mine on the island of Bougainville left people with a dangerous legacy of poisoned water, polluted fields and a ruined river valley, according to a damning <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2020/03/29/HRL012_HRLC_Panguna_mine_report_FA.pdf\">report from the Human Rights Law Centre</a>.</p> <p>The HRLC says the mining company has an obligation to return to the island, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/11/bougainville-referendum-region-votes-overwhelmingly-for-independence-from-papua-new-guinea\">which has just voted in favour of independence from Papua New Guinea</a>, for reparations and reconciliation.</p> <p>For 17 years until 1989, the Panguna mine was one of the world\u2019s largest and richest copper and gold mines, run by Rio Tinto subsidiary Bougainville Copper Limited. Mining ended at Panguna 31 years ago, after disputes over the mine\u2019s profits and its environmental damage led to a decade-long civil war in Bougainville that killed up to 20,000 people. But the mine pit remains a huge scar in the landscape in the centre of Bougainville island and has left a deadly legacy for residents.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/11/bougainville-referendum-region-votes-overwhelmingly-for-independence-from-papua-new-guinea\">Bougainville referendum: region votes overwhelmingly for independence from Papua New Guinea</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The HRLC report says: \u201cPolluted water from the mine pit flows unabated into local rivers, turning the riverbed and surrounding rocks an unnatural blue. The Jaba-Kawerong river valley downstream of the mine resembles a moonscape, with vast mounds of grey tailings waste and rock stretching almost 40km downstream to the coast.\u201d</p> <p> The report was compiled through interviews with 60 locals in the areas downstream from Panguna and also draws on more than 300 interviews conducted under a research project run by the Catholic Diocese of Bougainville.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/11/archive-zip/giv-3902SJA4RbZ9uAni/\" data-alt=\"Map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/11/archive-zip/giv-3902SJA4RbZ9uAni/\">Map</a> </figure>  <p>The report alleges that many villages have been left without clean drinking water, which must be piped long distances or rely on rainwater tanks that frequently run dry. Many families have no option but to continue to use the polluted rivers for bathing and washing. </p> <p>Those who live in the river valleys have reported serious, long-running health impacts, including sores and skin lesions, diarrhoea, respiratory problems and pregnancy complications.</p> <p> The hasty closure of the mine, and the lack of remediation since, means monsoonal rains push massive volumes of polluted tailings sand into the rivers, destroying forests and agricultural land. River crossings also become dangerous, with shifting sand channels and areas of quicksand. Locals reported children drowning or sustaining serious injuries trying to cross rivers.</p> <p>\u201cThe Panguna mine devastated our communities physically and culturally and we are still living with the consequences,\u201d said Theonila Roka Matbob, a teacher and traditional landowner from Makosi village, downstream from Panguna. \u201cOur land is destroyed and our rivers are poisoned.

In December 2019 the province\u2019s people voted overwhelmingly for independence, with 98% in favour. There is renewed interest in reopening Panguna and establishing new mines in the region. <br></p>",

Optimism that the Covid-19 crisis will soon be over could be badly misplaced.</strong></p> <p>So writes my colleague Nils Pratley tonight:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The rapid bounce-back theory rests on the idea that lockdowns will last only two or three months, at most, with no need to reimpose them.</p> <p>Perhaps that will be accurate but, remember, the investment consensus eight weeks ago was that Covid-19 was mainly a China-only affair and would be over quickly. Projections have been made to look very silly very quickly in this crisis. It is why little should be read into Tuesday\u2019s better-than-expected survey of business confidence in China: one unreliable piece of data does not imply a lasting rebound.</p> <p>Nor do we know if governments\u2019 support packages, though they seemed enormous on announcement, will be sufficient. Look at the calls for extra help already piling up at the UK Treasury\u2019s door: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/12/intu-warns-it-could-go-bust-after-reporting-2bn-loss\">even commercial landlords</a>, who should be well placed to take some strain, are begging the state to cover shortfalls in their rental income.</p> <p>What we know now is that there will be a big bill at the end. The UK Debt Management Office on Tuesday said it would raise \u00a345bn just in April via sales of government debt, a stunning sum that compares with \u00a39.5bn in the same month last year. In the coming financial year, the UK\u2019s budget deficit could treble to \u00a3200bn, or 10% of GDP, the Institute of Fiscal Studies estimated last week. Meanwhile, companies, many of which were carrying too much debt in the first place, will be carrying even heavier levels.

Chinese companies have reported a pick-up in economic activity this month, as they start to recover from the Covid-19 shutdown.</p> <p>The latest survey of China\u2019s purchasing managers suggests that some green shoots are peaking out, as companies return to work.</p> <p>The Chinese composite PMI, which tracks activity across service sector firms and factories, surged back to <strong>53 </strong>from a record low of <strong>28.9 </strong>in February. That\u2019s stronger than economists expected.</p> <p>Crucially, that lifts the PMI above the 50-point mark that separates monthly growth from contraction. </p> <p>Both key sectors of the economy reported a pickup:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Manufacturing PMI</strong>: Up to 52 in March, from 35.7 in February. </li> <li><strong>Services PMI:</strong> Up to 52.3, from 29.6 in February</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s early days, of course. The rebound may be partly due to the shocking slump in February. And the PMIs are \u2018soft data\u2019, relying on managers reporting on their own conditions.<br></p> <p>China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics was somewhat cautious about the PMIs, saying the figures:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>....reflects that more than half of the surveyed enterprises have resumed work and resumed production, better than last month, but it does not mean that China\u2019s economic operation has returned to normal\u201d. </p> </blockquote> <p>But the survey does suggest China\u2019s economy is recovering as it starts to relax some of its coronavirus restrictions -- just as many other economies, large and small, head into a deep slump.</p> <p>As Reuters points out:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The survey\u2019s sub-index of [China\u2019s] manufacturing production picked up to 54.1 in March from February\u2019s 27.8, while a reading of new orders rose to 52 from 29.3 a month earlier.</p> <p>New export orders received by Chinese manufacturers ticked up to 46.4 from 28.7 in February, but were still mired in contraction.</p> </blockquote> <p>This could reassure markets, and perhaps calm some of the recent volatility that has sent asset prices swinging. But, with infections still rising sharply in Europe and America, the pandemic is still threatening to cause a very steep downturn.</p> <p><em>I\u2019ll pull together some reaction now....</em></p> <p>Economic data due later today is likely to show that Germany\u2019s unemployment total has risen this month, while US consumer confidence has probably taken a big hit too.</p> <h2>The agenda</h2> <ul> <li>8.55am BST: German unemployment figures for March: Jobless total expected to rise by 25,000</li> <li>10am BST: Eurozone inflation figures for March: CPI expected to fall to 0.8% from 1.2%</li> <li>3pm BST: US consumer confidence index for March: expected to slump to 112.0 from 130.7 </li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T06:49:30.789Z\">at 7.49am BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>The arms race between human immunity and viral pathogens is constant. The contest had been hidden from the public until swine flu, the first global influenza pandemic for more than 40 years, hit the UK in 2009. This <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/15/last-pandemic-england-12401281/\" title=\"\">outbreak</a> was contained with fewer than 500 deaths. Britain was lulled into a false sense of security that its infection control measures would be enough to contain a new infectious disease.</p> <p>Governments pursued a course of <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/213717/dh_131040.pdf\" title=\"\">mitigation</a>, where it is accepted a deadly disease will spread but the losses are bearable. This was true of Labour and Conservative governments. Alan Johnson, health secretary in Gordon Brown\u2019s administration, admitted to a <a href=\"https://www.jesip.org.uk/uploads/media/incident_reports_and_inquiries/Influenza%20Pandemic.pdf\" title=\"\">peers\u2019 inquiry</a> in 2009 that at the \u201cpeak of a \u2018reasonable worst-care scenario\u2019 pandemic, intensive care capacity may well be inadequate\u201d. That this calculation had not changed since is the reason for the extreme lockdown we are enduring.</p> <p>What has altered is the nature of the threat. Covid-19 is 50 times more deadly than swine flu. It is far more easily <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/coronavirus-vs-sars-mers-flu-how-deaths-compare-covid-19/\" title=\"\">transmitted</a>. The world is more globalised, heightening the risk of rapid spread of the virus, especially one that travels with close contact. These were all quantifiable risks. It is disastrous that such a virus has been left to spread untracked around the country. This would have tested any health system, let alone one running close to full capacity and groaning under a winter flu season.</p> <p>Our shortcomings are now being painfully exposed. The global demand for the ventilators that help severely ill coronavirus patients to breathe looks almost certain to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f2845b3-a1ed-44cb-90af-e04d8d712403\" title=\"\">outstrip supply</a>. Plans for homemade machines are being drawn up on the fly. Frontline medics complain they are putting their lives at risk because of a lack of protective equipment. The failure to act fast enough lies behind the testing fiasco. Testing is central to reducing the fatality rate, because it leads to early detection. It allows transmission to be curbed and for resources to be pointed rapidly to the infected.</p> <p>But to test requires staff, equipment and chemicals. The worry is that the NHS does not have enough trained workers to operate the tests. Then there are concerns over supply. Lombardy in Italy, one of hardest-hit places in Europe, is home to one of the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/18/817801222/testing-swabs-run-in-short-supply-as-makers-try-to-speed-up-production\" title=\"\">largest makers</a> of testing swabs. There is a worldwide race to secure the chemical reagents required for the kits. Michael Gove <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/31/uk-coronavirus-live-ons-death-toll-covid-19-latest?CMP=share_btn_tw&amp;page=with:block-5e836b9d8f0866297e9f4694#block-5e836b9d8f0866297e9f4694\" title=\"\">acknowledged</a> on Tuesday evening that Britain has much ground to make up in order to copy South Korea\u2019s successful rollback strategy.</p> <p>Yet Seoul\u2019s achievement was founded on mass-sourcing reagents in January when they were plentiful. Now it\u2019s much tougher, as Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Delfraissy, the immunologist who heads France\u2019s Covid-19 response, <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2020/03/20/jean-francois-delfraissy-nous-avons-une-vision-a-quatre-semaines_6033854_3244.html\" title=\"\">warned</a> this month. He said France had \u201ca huge problem with the reagents used in the tests. These basic reagents are from China and the United States. The production of machines stopped in China and the US keeps the [reagents] for itself.\u201d</p> <p>What is required is more international cooperation to prevent these rivalries from causing avoidable deaths. China has a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/lockdown-china-coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">crucial role</a> to play, having experienced five <a href=\"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2016/5717108/tab1/\" title=\"\">respiratory virus epidemics</a> in 20 years. The success of Germany\u2019s well-resourced public health system in handling the outbreak ought to be a model to emulate. David Alexander, professor of risk at University College London, told the <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/03/why-weren-t-we-ready\" title=\"\">New Statesman</a> that pandemic preparation involves \u201ctelling governments what they don\u2019t want to know, to spend money they don\u2019t have, on something they don\u2019t think will happen\u201d.</p> <p>Every year, <a href=\"https://medium.com/wintoncentre/how-much-normal-risk-does-covid-represent-4539118e1196\" title=\"\">600,000 people die in the UK</a>. If unchallenged, Covid-19 threatens to almost double that and overwhelm the NHS. In the face of uncertainty, it\u2019s appropriate for government to be resilient to extreme events. The science may not be black and white, and no one can possess perfect actuarial clarity. But this crisis has shown us how we can \u2013 and must \u2013 insure against the uncertainty.</p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson\u2019s revamped communications strategy to combat coronavirus will be run like a \u201cpolitical campaign\u201d after he drafted in a new team of advisers spearheaded by his Australian former elections chief, senior sources have said.</p> <p>Following criticism over mixed messages and selective briefings in recent weeks, the prime minister and his key adviser Dominic Cummings recruited Isaac Levido, 36, who ran the Tory general election campaign in December.</p> <p>Having already a \u201cgrid\u201d of communications centred on the daily press conference, the government is now looking to bring in more experienced campaigners to sharpen the message \u2013 with the aim of boosting both public health and the prime minister\u2019s standing.</p> <p>Downing Street is pushing the simple three-part message of \u201cStay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives\u201d to the fore, in the same way that \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d worked during the election and \u201cTake Back Control\u201d worked for Vote Leave.</p> <p>Until recently the government\u2019s communications strategy had faced criticism from senior Conservatives for giving selective briefings after an unnamed government source briefed ITN\u2019s political editor, Robert Peston, about plans to quarantine the over-70s before they were announced.</p> <p>Johnson has been criticised for making statements on camera that contradicted scientific advice. The prime minister claimed he would continue to shake hands with people he met, said the UK could send coronavirus \u201cpacking in 12 weeks\u201d and proclaimed that he would see his mother on Mothering Sunday despite social distancing rules.</p> <p>Problems with the strategy were addressed on Thursday by Cummings and his director of communications, Lee Cain. They held a virtual meeting with Levido at No 10 at which they invited him to take a major role in the government\u2019s strategy.</p> <p>There have already been some cosmetic changes. On Monday Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, unveiled new bright yellow branding on the Downing Street podium, which drew comparisons with the arresting colour scheme used by NCP car parks and the posters for Reading and Leeds music festivals.</p> <p>At the same time, there has been a willingness to slap down ministers who step away from the agreed line, much as in a general election campaign. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, was contradicted by Downing Street on Monday after he advised people to shop <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/no-10-slaps-down-shapps-over-shop-once-a-week-comment-coronavirus\">for food only once a week</a>.</p> <p>A raft of former advisers have been brought back to Whitehall to track public opinion and gauge whether the government\u2019s key messages on handwashing and self-isolation are getting through, including Gabriel Milland, a former head of news at the Department for Education under Michael Gove who is known for his experience running focus groups to refine messaging.</p> <p>Ben Guerin, a 25-year-old online campaigner from New Zealand, is also expected to reprise his role as a strategist from December\u2019s successful election.</p> <p>A source said Levido was part of an effort to move the operation into a \u201ccampaigning mode\u201d, starting from last week, after a recognition that communication had not always been effective.</p> <p>A Whitehall insider said that Johnson and Cummings, both of whom are self-isolating with coronavirus symptoms, have sought recruits who proved to be reliable operators in their victories at the general election and 2016 EU referendum.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a campaign to win over the public to the government\u2019s message. They have a proven track record,\u201d the source said.</p> <p>Cummings\u2019 recent absence from Downing Street has cleared the way for the continued rise of Levido \u2013 a protege of Sir Lynton Crosby, and described by one friend as \u201cthe new Lynton\u201d. A long-time campaign obsessive, Levido now finds himself at the heart of the British government, shaping how Johnson\u2019s handling of the crisis is perceived by the public.</p> <p>Described as an intense, obsessive individual who is loyal to his team, he is known for pulling all-nighters and pushing rigid message discipline. He says he remains in close contact with Crosby, 63, according to individuals who worked on the Conservative election campaign. When the scale of the Tory victory at the election was revealed, others in the office began singing \u201cOh Isaac Levido\u201d to the tune of The White Stripes\u2019 Seven Nation Army in recognition of his role.</p> <p>Hailing from the New South Wales town of Port Macquarie, he previously worked on the 2015 and 2017 general election campaign, plus Zac Goldsmith\u2019s 2016 bid to be mayor of London. He has also done messaging for the likes of mining giant Glencore, according to sources, plus political campaigns from the Caribbean to Asia.</p> <p>\u201cHe hates the fiscal spending craziness,\u201d said one individual who knows Levido. \u201cHe\u2019s a proper conservative like Lynton.\u201d</p> <p>Guerin is one half of the Auckland-based social media campaigns business Topham Guerin, which has previously been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/23/tories-hire-facebook-propaganda-pair-to-run-online-election-campaign\">exposed by the Guardian for its role helping to run Facebook astroturfing campaigns on behalf of major polluters</a>. The pair are also former colleagues of Crosby and worked closely with Levido to re-elect Scott Morrison in Australia\u2019s general election.</p> <p>During the British general election campaign, Topham Guerin were in charge when the Conservatives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/19/tories-tweet-anti-labour-posts-under-factcheckuk-brand\">deceptively rebranded their official press office account as FactCheck UK</a> \u2013 while also taking particular delight in winding up those who reported on their online adverts creating \u201cboomer memes\u201d by issuing knowingly terrible parodies of their own work through official Conservative accounts.

Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use.

In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.

That meant a mentally-ill patient could end up in a care home without their or their guardian\u2019s consent, to free up hospital beds for other patients.</p> \n  <p>In a policy memorandum published alongside the bill, the Scottish government said it was justified because elderly patients were the most vulnerable to the coronavirus, while the crisis meant extra beds were desperately needed.</p> \n  <p>The government said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Hospitals are looking to increase dramatically the number of beds available to deal with the expected large influx of patients affected by coronavirus and requiring hospital treatment. Adults lacking capacity are often elderly patients with dementia who are at high risk from coronavirus and it is a high priority to move them to somewhere safer and more suitable for their care and treatment.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Dr Arun Chopra, the commission\u2019s medical director, said it was very concerned about the rights of those patients. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We understand the need for this emergency legislation to become available during these exceptional times, but we would want to see the reduction in safeguards to only be used if absolutely necessary, and for as short a time as is possible.</p> \n   <p>We believe it is vital that effective mechanisms are in place to scrutinise how and when these powers are used.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The commission said it would adapt its monitoring systems to cope with the emergency powers published in the new coronavirus (Scotland) bill, and the impact the pandemic had on services. But it said ministers needed to amend the bill to require councils to notify a statutory body every time these orders were used.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8379668f087564da1e33b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rebeccasmithers\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T17:10:57.507Z\">6.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Swedish furniture giant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ikea\">Ikea </a>has today reopened the doors of its <strong>Croydon</strong> store \u2013 but only for vulnerable customers and key workers who can shop for essentials at its Swedish food market.</p> \n  <p>The rest of the store will remain closed but the Swedish food market is opening to key workers at different times, including NHS workers and police, the elderly, most vulnerable and their carers and Ikea co-workers.</p> \n  <p>Its normal range has been bolstered with staple items including bread, milk, butter and canned tomatoes.

The government has organised for some deliveries to be made direct to those who have been told to self-isolate, leaving the division of responsibilities confused, local authorities say. </p> \n  <p>The food supplied to Rochdale for households was mostly made up of empty calories and included a giant bottle of sweetened fruit squash, a bag of sugar, teabags, confectionery, small individually wrapped gingerbread biscuits, egg noodles, hard-to-split catering size packs of Angel Delight dessert mix, and just one apple per person. </p> \n  <p>Inventories seen by the Guardian of what was delivered to some other councils over the last few days list similar items of very low nutritional value, including tins of creamed rice, long-life sweetened custard, and, as in Rochdale, giant bottles of fruit squash. Some have also received a small number of longlife \u201cone meal\u201d portions of ready meals such as sausages and mash. </p> \n  <p>One council told us that the only fresh fruit or vegetables on its list of what would be supplied were a limited number of apples, but these did not in fact get delivered. </p> \n  <p>The government promised the packages would contain essential food and household items for those with underlying health problems who need to self-isolate at home for 12 weeks and have no family or friends to help them. The communities secretary, <strong>Robert Jenrick</strong>, appeared on television news over the weekend helping deliver food boxes to houses with vulnerable people. </p> \n  <p>Rochdale council\u2019s Labour leader, Allen Brett, called on the government yesterday to improve the quality of its parcels: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Everyone appreciates that this is an unprecedented situation but the parcels that have been provided were not of the quality we were expecting. Thankfully our council officers are able to source food locally and add them to the packs to ensure that those receiving them have a better choice of items.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He told the Guardian that after he went public with his concerns he received a call late last night from the secretary of state\u2019s office accusing him of putting out false information. </p> \n  <p>A council spokesman said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We do not recognise the secretary of state\u2019s description of these packages being additional supplies to kick-start wider efforts as they were linked directly to our shielded residents. While we are pleased to hear reports that packages sent directly to homes were of a higher standard, we also note that other councils have expressed concerns about the quality of the initial packages they received from government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Referring food items sent out in Rochdale, a government spokesperson said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This picture is misleading, it is not one of the food boxes we are delivering directly to the homes of extremely medically vulnerable people.</p> \n   <p>Our food boxes are of a standard that is consistent and include cereal, fruit and vegetables and pasta.

We have been highlighted because of the slightly unusual use of drones.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut there are some forces who have implemented more draconian measures. Some have implemented roadblocks. We are not doing that and we do not intend to do that.\u201d</p> \n<p>By Monday, the Lancashire force had issued 123 fines under the emergency powers, which came in last Thursday and outlawed non-essential shops staying open, two or more people gathering and tried to get people to stay in their homes with limited exceptions.</p> \n<p>Forces such as Bedfordshire, Durham, Hampshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Suffolk, West Midlands, Wiltshire as well as Derbyshire are yet to use the enforcement powers.</p> \n<p>Derbyshire\u2019s police and crime commissioner, Hardyal Dhindsa, told the Guardian he defended the force\u2019s actions to bolster physical distancing. \u201cDerbyshire police have been applauded and the majority of the public have been very cooperative, understanding and supportive,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Some other forces are using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2017/feb/22/nudge-theory-the-psychology-and-ethics-of-persuasion-science-weekly-podcast\">nudge theory</a> to encourage people to comply, pointing out how many already are rather than highlighting problems.</p> \n<p>In a video message, teh Greater Manchester police chief constable, Ian Hopkins, thanked the public for a \u201chuge\u201d drop in numbers on the streets.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He also accepted mistakes had been made implementing the radical and sweeping emergency laws: \u201cOur policy is engage, encourage, explain and lastly enforcement.

There has also been a counter-productive lack of clarity in government statements on these rules.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere have been amazing community responses to this pandemic, and people have shown they are willing to change the way they live \u2013 but that goodwill, and the broader aim of protecting public health, will be undermined by harsh and heavy handed policing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Adam Wagner, a human rights barrister at Doughty Street Chambers in London and a visiting law professor at Goldsmiths University, tweeted: \u201cMy sense is that there is major confusion over the difference between the government guidance and the law set out in the Coronavirus Regulations 2020. Police can advise the public but must make clear (and be clear themselves) what they have power to enforce.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There seems to be an attitude, not just among the police but also among the public, that because these are tough times, we should all pay some sort of penance (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/30/uk-police-guidelines-coronavirus-lockdown-enforcement-powers-following-criticism-lord-sumption\" title=\"\">UK police warned against \u2018overreach\u2019 in use of virus lockdown powers</a>, 30 March). I\u2019ve even heard of police shouting \u201cThis is not a holiday\u201d to people. Well excuse me for not wanting to self-flagellate! Even if this was in response to people grouping together, such a comment is appalling, as it implies that the police are simply opposed to people enjoying themselves, when they should just be professionally upholding the laws limiting viral spread. Frankly, we don\u2019t need attitude from the police when times are already tough.</p> <p>If people are not social distancing or if they are otherwise doing something that might increase viral spread (based on formal scientific advice, not just a police officer\u2019s personal opinion) then, yes, enforce the law and fine or use force where necessary. I have encountered such behaviour when walking near my flat on Plymouth Hoe and I find it every bit as abhorrent and as selfish as everyone else does. Otherwise, people should be allowed to go about their lives. We are not under house arrest, this is a free country, and everyone should only be concerned with observing or enforcing well-defined, science-based legal measures that will limit viral spread.</p> <p>If the police lose public respect (and they are currently going about it the right away), we\u2019re really stuffed.<br><strong>John Turner</strong><br><em>Plymouth</em></p> <p>\u2022 Lord Sumption is absolutely correct to criticise Derbyshire police for apparently believing that they had to enforce government guidance, as opposed to the law. The job of the police, as ever, is to apply the law and not government opinion or diktats. The reason is simple: the view of any government may change from day to day and from minister to minister, whereas the law is fixed unless and until changed. I fear that a heavy-handed and totally unwarranted approach by the police may be the thin end of the wedge. We live in difficult times, but that is no reason for us to be careless or carefree about preserving our hard-won democratic and civil liberties, whatever the police may think.<br><strong>Dr Stephen Pacey</strong><br><em>(Retired judge), North Muskham, Nottinghamshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Lord Sumption\u2019s familiarity with history is, alas, far inferior to his knowledge of law (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/covid-19-ex-supreme-court-judge-lambasts-disgraceful-policing\" title=\"\">Covid-19: ex-supreme court judge lambasts \u2018disgraceful\u2019 policing</a>, 30 March). Contrary to his claims, totalitarian regimes \u2013 whether Nazi or communist \u2013 did not arise because citizens voluntarily surrendered their liberty in exchange for state protection, as any understanding of the revolutions of 1917 or 1933 will demonstrate, but because of the treacherous power grabs of the would-be dictators and their cronies. There is simply no analogy between the actions of our police and the Gestapo or the NKVD. It is not the government that is being hysterical, it is Lord Sumption. <br><strong>Jeremy Adler</strong><br><em>King\u2019s College London</em></p> <p>\u2022 There has been the most lively criticism of the dyeing of the Buxton \u201cblue lagoon\u201d. This pool has been described by Lord Sumption as a \u201cbeauty spot\u201d. I can only think he has never been there. And he shouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>I live over the hill from Buxton. I can tell you categorically that this evil pool is not a beauty spot. It is a body of water with a pH similar to ammonia or bleach. It is the result of limestone quarrying. The startlingly blue water is speciously attractive. It is a desolate place, difficult to reach, and there are notices everywhere warning you not to enter the water. Rubbish litters the area \u2013 anything less like a beauty spot is hard to imagine. It has been dyed black before to deter visitors tempted to take a dip in its poisonous waters.</p> <p>Those who like to condemn this action, which was solely to protect the idle public who go up there out of sight to gather in groups, may be heartened to know that such is the powerful chemical composition of this pool and its surroundings that soon it will regain its alluring but malevolent Bahama blue colour. We can only repress nature so much before it resumes its status quo.<br><strong>Susan</strong> <strong>Whitham</strong><br><em>Macclesfield</em></p>",

I found myself doing the same things I\u2019d been doing as a kid \u2013 looking at boots in magazines, checking out balls like the old Adidas Questras and the Mitre Cosmics. All these old sensations were coming back and I thought: \u2018You know what, why am I so worried about investing my feelings in this?\u2019 For years I\u2019d been nervous. I hadn\u2019t wanted to get hurt again because I had a lot of problems. But I thought: \u2018I\u2019m going to go for it again.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bc38d3f708d8d0ba52bfe5dc5bd524ee9361eb0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc38d3f708d8d0ba52bfe5dc5bd524ee9361eb0b/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sonny Pike demonstrates his skills at Wembley before the 1996 League Cup final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sonny Pike demonstrates his skills at Wembley before the 1996 League Cup final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pike formed a clear idea of what he could offer. For one thing, he had trodden a path he would not wish on anyone and there was no shortage of advice he could impart. He visited a number of clubs and gave talks at universities and other institutions, expanding on the problems that sent his life off course. There were offers to perform ball-juggling tricks for TV adverts but that did not feel right and was, given all that had passed, a little close to the bone. Two decades after being the next big thing, there was a better way to channel his gift.</p> <p>\u201cPlaying football, that was my forte: the skills, the touch,\u201d he says. \u201cI started watching videos on YouTube of coaches doing certain things, took some badges and other qualifications, and just started doing sessions in my local park via word of mouth or people I knew from before. I said to Rosie: \u2018This is a good idea, I feel it suits me and I\u2019m naturally gravitating towards it.\u2019 And then we came up with this idea.\u201d</p> <p>His one-on-one academy classes are aimed largely, but not exclusively, at youngsters who aspire towards a professional career. Some of his students are training with top-flight or Football League clubs but have enlisted Pike to fine-tune some of the technical movements \u2013 quick feet, tight spaces, close control \u2013 that made him such an enthralling prospect. Exercises from the time he spent, famously, as a trialist at Ajax go down well and when we meet he has been perfecting what he calls the \u201cAjax handclap\u201d \u2013 dribbling in and out of cones while clapping above your head \u2013 with Finley, a 14-year-old on trial at Southampton.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbee4e934ece2f06e32530559465ad74f69f3218\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbee4e934ece2f06e32530559465ad74f69f3218/0_166_5303_3183/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sonny Pike works with 14-year-old Finley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sonny Pike works with 14-year-old Finley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Others might be lacking confidence in different areas. Pike wants to develop an operation that helps create footballers but assists them in developing the resilience to survive all eventualities. \u201cAway from the pitch, that\u2019s where I find I can really help,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve had kids here who stop midway through a session and explain they\u2019ve been scared to make a tackle, or something\u2019s happened at school. We\u2019ll have a conversation and it means the world to me when I get a message later saying \u2018thanks\u2019 or \u2018you\u2019ve brought him right out of himself\u2019. It\u2019s as if I\u2019m coming back to do the things I needed done for me 20 years ago, trying to be the person I wish I\u2019d had by my side when I was 14.\u201d</p> <p>Pike is gentle, softly spoken, easy company. It is not difficult to see how he can be that mentor figure, although he thinks young players today have more sophisticated support networks than were available to him. \u201cMy story was very much a one-off, I think. At that time, I was the only person to live that; no one had gone as far as I did with all the big companies and all that attention. That\u2019s got a lot to do with what went on.</p> <p>\u201cGenerally I think the academies are much better than they used to be; many of the ones I\u2019ve visited have impressed me. But there still needs to be more. I think there should be a mandatory standard for in terms of aftercare and the mental health side.\u201d</p> <p>Most of the attention, when Pike underwent his catharsis in 2016, was on the devastation wreaked by those grasping for spoils before his playing prospects unravelled. His father, Mickey, came into particular focus and there has been no reconciliation. \u201cNo ill feeling or anything, it was 20 years ago and loads has happened, but we haven\u2019t met or spoken,\u201d he says. Some of the revelations back then were shocking; his autobiography is due in September and he thinks the traumas it will lay bare are greater.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afd3bfbec0f77a708b23440dd61b8e15b45a9540\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afd3bfbec0f77a708b23440dd61b8e15b45a9540/0_54_1428_856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sonny Pike with Arsenal\u2019s Lee Dixon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sonny Pike with Arsenal\u2019s Lee Dixon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen I stopped playing football, some of the mistakes I made and things I did were just ridiculous. There were positions I found myself in during my early 20s that I shouldn\u2019t have ever been in. Loads of problems; I struggled for a while with everything. It was just through anger at not being a footballer, things not going your way, and it gets you acting in a way you really shouldn\u2019t at all.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of lessons from those times I\u2019d like to convey to the kids here just so that, whether they become a footballer or not, they can hit the ground running in life and live normally.\u201d</p> <p>Life is treating him well on all fronts, at long last. Family time with Rosie, Freya and five-year-old Beau is the priority but he takes visible delight in being in love with football again and there are big hopes for his coaching school. Pike remembers studying The Knowledge in \u201ca tiny little shed\u201d but hopes that, one day, he may be able to leave the cab and concentrate on the new development.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a heartwarming story: a happy ending in one sense; a vivid new beginning in another.

All over the country there are people setting things up to coach kids and help them back into football and I\u2019m now one of them.

  "<p>Anger is growing in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a> that while the government is preparing to grant amnesties to up to one third of the country\u2019s prison population in order to combat the coronavirus pandemic, jailed human rights activists, journalists and opposition politicians will not be among those considered for early release.</p> <p>The Turkish parliament <a href=\"https://www.haberturk.com/son-dakika-haberi-infaz-duzenlemesinin-ayrintilari-belli-oldu-90-bin-kisi-cezaevinden-cikacak-2630520\">discussed a legal amendment</a> on Tuesday which should make 90,000 of the country\u2019s approximately 300,000 prisoners eligible for either house arrest or parole by halving sentences for offences including non pre-mediatated murder and organised crime. Early drafts of the bill, which would also have covered sex offenders and those convicted of gender-based violence, were dropped after being met with outrage from women\u2019s rights groups.</p> <p>Of perhaps the greatest concern is not who the new law lets out of prison, but who it keeps in.

Ankara\u2019s public prosecutor accused Gergerlio\u011flu of \u201cprovoking anxiety, fear, and panic among the public\u201d and said an investigation had been launched.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been campaigning to improve the standards in prisons for a long time,\u201d Gergerlio\u011flu told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cThere are already many violations in terms of healthcare access, staffing levels, contagious disease, people dying from lack of treatment for their illnesses.

Many languish in lengthy pre-trial detention. There are so many prisoners, in fact, that in order to take pressure off a system already at 121% capacity, Ankara is planning to build 100 new prisons.</p> <p>Idris Say\u0131lgan, a Kurdish journalist, was convicted on terrorism charges after a trial in which the only evidence presented against him were his articles. He spent more than three years in jail before being released in November last year.</p> <p>The overcrowded cells and filthy conditions he experienced in first Mus and then Trabzon prison could lead to coronavirus killing many in the Turkish system, the 29-year-old said.</p> <p>\u201cAt Mus prison I shared a cell seven steps long with 14 other people. Some cells had even more people than that. There was only one bathroom for all of us,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In Trabzon, cells were still overcrowded: Say\u0131lgan\u2019s cell was only meant for four people but housed eight, so two people had to sleep on the floor. Low quality food and unsanitary conditions led him to develop gum disease. Prisoners had to buy their own cleaning products.</p> <p>\u201cWe had to pay for everything ourselves: toilet paper, soap, shampoo, bleach for cleaning. We only got two showers a week,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is impossible to do social distancing or practise good hygiene in such conditions. If coronavirus spreads in prisons, it will be a massacre.\u201d</p> <p>Conditions may be about to get worse: recent news articles suggested that prisoners in Turkey are now having to pay 17 lira (\u00a32.09) for their own face masks, and advocacy group Jurists for Freedom said in a report that inmates have complained that not all prison staff are wearing protective masks and gloves. As part of social distancing measures visits from family members have been stopped and lawyers are now only allowed to visit clients with a prosecutor\u2019s permission.</p> <p>Coronavirus also appears to be exacerbating the Turkish freedom of speech crisis which led to so many getting locked up in the first place. Reporters without Borders said that seven journalists have been arrested for their reporting on the pandemic and charged with \u201cspreading panic\u201d, and 385 people are being investigated for critical social media posts.</p> <p>During the crisis, the government has also found time to<a href=\"https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/turkey/240320201\"> arrest another five HDP mayors</a> in Turkey\u2019s southeast, who are likely to be replaced with unelected pro-government trustees.</p> <p>\u201cThis attitude explicitly displays the government\u2019s intentions: common criminals will be released but the political prisoners will remain behind bars,\u201d said Veysel Ok, co-director of the Media and Law Studies Association, a non-profit legal defence organisation.</p> <p>\u201cThis [decision not to free political prisoners] at this time, in a way, is equivalent to a verdict of death penalty.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The NHS is in talks to roll out a smartphone app that instantly traces close contacts of people carrying the coronavirus and advises them to self-isolate.</p> <p>The app, developed by <a href=\"https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/\">NHSX</a> \u2013 the health service\u2019s digital transformation arm \u2013 with academic and industry partners is in advanced stages of evaluation and is weeks away from being ready to be deployed, the Guardian understands.</p> <p>Around 60% of the adult population would need to sign up and engage with the app by registering their symptoms or positive test results for it to be effective. Their proximity to other users would be logged, and they would follow advice given in alerts to self-isolate \u2013 even in cases where they were not aware of having been in contact with someone infected.</p> <p>The prospect of an app that would give the government access to health and location data has already triggered privacy concerns and would herald an unprecedented level of surveillance.</p> <p>However, digital contact tracing has been a central part of the containment strategy in China and, according to a new analysis by scientists at the University of Oxford, \u201cdigital herd protection\u201d is likely to be crucial in order to lift current restrictions without seeing a huge resurgence of infections.</p> <p>\u201cWe see it as the only alternative to \u2026 applying isolation to the whole population,\u201d said Prof David Bonsall, senior researcher at Oxford University\u2019s Nuffield Department of Medicine and a clinician, who co-led the project. \u201cWe think it\u2019s going to be a very important part of that strategy.\u201d The Oxford team developed an algorithm for the app.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s where this concept of herd protection came from,\u201d said Bonsall. \u201cYou can protect the vulnerable people in society who may not have smartphones, and protect children. If enough adults across the population engage with the system and trust the system telling them they should isolate, you\u2019re protecting all those individuals who don\u2019t have a device.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike with some previous pandemics, including Sars and flu, a high proportion of transmission of Covid-19 occurs before a person is showing symptoms. So isolating people once they become ill and tracing contacts manually has limited effectiveness because the spread of the virus will be one step ahead, according to the team\u2019s analysis in the journal <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/30/science.abb6936\">Science</a>.</p> <p>\u201cTraditional contact tracing is too slow for this virus and it won\u2019t work,\u201d said Bonsall. \u201cBy the time you\u2019ve identified the contact, they\u2019ve already transmitted. It doesn\u2019t scale either.\u201d</p> <p>The team has been working on the algorithm since mid-January and has studied the Chinese app that gives people a red or green code determining whether they need to self-isolate.</p> <p>The app would not need to access location data, but could log users\u2019 proximity to each other through Bluetooth. Once a user reports symptoms or a positive test result, the app would trace back through close contacts over the past seven days and alert those calculated to be at risk. Once deployed, developers would use data on who is actually infected to optimise the app\u2019s performance and gain further insights into how transmission occurs.</p> <p>It is expected that the final phase of evaluation, which will include getting sign-off from ethics committees and also ironing out any technical glitches, will be completed within weeks. However, it is possible the app would be rolled out later in the year before current restrictions are lifted.</p> <p>In China, authorities have reportedly used mass surveillance of smartphone data to classify people\u2019s health status according to a traffic light system and restrict movements accordingly. The system is being used to control who is allowed to return to work and other activities as the city of Wuhan began to relax its lockdown in the past week.</p> <p>It is understood that the NHS app would be an opt-in system and that it would not be required to access NHS testing services, or to get permission to return to work, for instance. Instead, people would be encouraged to sign up as part of a collective effort to bring the pandemic under control.</p> <p>Prof Michael Parker, director of the Wellcome Centre for Ethics and Humanities at the University of Oxford and co-author of the paper, said that it ought to be possible to roll out the contact-tracing app without breaching data protection laws. \u201cIn emergency situations, there are all sorts of things that are allowable that wouldn\u2019t be otherwise and that seems appropriate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most important thing is there\u2019s public trust and confidence and clarity of what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-fears-rediscover-utopian-hopes-connected-world\">Amid our fear, we\u2019re rediscovering utopian hopes of a connected world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There would need to be oversight of the app\u2019s deployment, clear \u201cstop rules\u201d about what happens to data after the pandemic is brought under control and careful attention paid to ensure those without smartphones would not be disadvantaged.</p> <p>David Leslie, an ethicist at the Alan Turing Institute who studies the governance of data-driven technologies, said that public trust in data collection, sharing and use have been eroded by the monetisation of personal data by big tech companies and the intrusive use of data by some governments. Despite this, the circumstances of the pandemic could allow people to set aside these reservations.</p> <p>\u201cI believe that if we put the proper protocols of responsible innovation in place \u2013 protocols which ensure that these technologies are democratically governed, based on individual and community consent, proportional, and constrained with sunset provisions \u2013 a higher level of intrusiveness would be more widely acceptable,\u201d he said.</p> <p>An NHSX spokesperson said: \u201cNHSX is looking at whether app-based solutions might be helpful in tracking and managing coronavirus, and we have assembled expertise from inside and outside the organisation to do this as rapidly as possible.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>A UK start-up company is preparing to launch a free app that will help people observe physical distancing more effectively by informing them when locations are busy.

The app uses GPS satellite data and data available from Google and crowdsourced information to help people decide whether or not it is a good time to visit.

  "<p>The coronavirus has already overwhelmed medical services, grounded flights and halted economic growth, but one of its most enduring effects could be to usher in a political age in which soft authoritarians have turned harder, and the surveillance state becomes a way of life even in some democracies.</p> <p>In Hungary, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">a set of measures introduced on Monday</a>, it is now a criminal offence to spread misinformation about coronavirus, and the prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, can rule by decree for an indefinite period. In neighbouring Serbia, soldiers patrol the streets as part of the coronavirus response plan. In Moscow, authorities are reportedly mulling measures that would require everyone who wants to go outside to submit the reasons online, and then be tracked via their smartphones.</p> <p>By now, most countries across the world have introduced some form of extraordinary measures to battle coronavirus, and even many democratic governments have faced little dissent over changes that in normal times would have been met with months or years of furious parliamentary debate. But what happens when the pandemic is over?</p> <p>\u201cExtraordinary legal situations are very easy to introduce, but it is much harder to return to business as usual afterwards,\u201d said the Budapest-based thinktank Political Capital in response to the Hungarian measures.

None was forthcoming.</p> <p>Ivan Krastev, a Bulgarian political scientist who has written extensively on European political shifts, referred to the Hungarian law as \u201ca kind of authoritarian entrepreneurship\u201d, comparing it to people selling masks and other equipment at inflated prices. Orb\u00e1n, he said, is experimenting with what might be possible in this sudden new reality. \u201cHe\u2019s trying and testing, to see what the market will take.\u201d</p> <p>While Orb\u00e1n is a leader flying high who has sought to push the boundaries even further, in Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu has looked to use the situation to ease himself out of a sticky spot. Despite having failed three times to form a government in the past year, he is now in talks with his rival, Benny Gantz, to agree on a deal for him to remain prime minister for at least the next two years. Additionally, Netanyahu\u2019s trial on charges of bribery and fraud has also been delayed for two months because of the state of emergency.</p> <p>At a time when even stepping outside could be dangerous, mass protests against government moves are a non-starter, and international criticism is not likely to be robust given other leaders are occupied with combating the crises in their own countries.</p> <p>Additionally, citizens may feel more willing to give governments the benefit of the doubt in the current circumstances, preferring an entrenching of the status quo to weak or divided government.</p> <p>Krastev compared the current crisis to the financial crisis of 2008 and the migration crisis of 2015, and said that while then the responses in Europe were driven by anxiety, this time the dominant emotion is fear, which is much more direct. \u201cThis makes people ready to tolerate everything, because when the danger is everywhere, you believe only the government can help you,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The terrifying situation in which anyone, anywhere, can be a potential threat is a perfect mobilising force for authoritarians, and many have explicitly compared the current situation to a state of war, applying military terminology to civilian life, and implying that the kind of restrictions applicable in wartime, when questioning the government could be seen as unpatriotic or even traitorous, should now apply.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/08/hungary-now-for-the-new-right-what-venezuela-once-was-for-the-left\">For the new right, Hungary is now what Venezuela once was for the left | Nick Cohen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cJust as in wartime, a state of emergency could extend until the end of hostilities.

He said the new law only covers those who intentionally spread fake information that hampers the government response to coronavirus. How those judgments are made is a big question; however, given that Kov\u00e1cs and others in the government regularly accuse journalists reporting critically on the government of deliberately spreading lies.</p> <p>Measures reportedly being mulled in Moscow would bring Russia a step closer to the Chinese model of surveillance, but it is not just Vladimir Putin who may soon be keeping a closer eye on his citizens. Throughout Europe, policymakers are wondering how best to monitor the population, especially if in the not-too-distant future lockdowns can be carefully eased. Once surveillance measures are brought in for the coronavirus, it may be hard to argue against keeping them in place for hypothetical future threats.</p> <p>Just how many of the \u201cextraordinary\u201d measures introduced now will stick around to shape our world over the next years and decades will partly depend on how severe and how long-lasting the medical situation turns out to be, and how various governments\u2019 responses to the pandemic look in retrospect.</p> <p>\u201cIf in the end, people have the feeling they were manipulated then maybe we will see resistance to all these measures. But at this stage I see much more acceptance than resistance,\u201d said Krastev.</p>",

I don\u2019t go to church much any more but some habitual part of me had wanted familiarity, and it was Ash Wednesday, so I went along and got the cross swiped on my forehead by a priest with a friendly flat gardener\u2019s thumb. A lot of other worshippers were as out of practice as I was, judging by how much we all bungled the sit-stand-up-down choreography of Catholic mass. Messing up over and over again we started catching each other\u2019s eyes and laughing; we nodded when we passed an hour later on the footpath. It wasn\u2019t just that we\u2019d all gone to mass, it was that we\u2019d all gone to mass together. Seeing each other and being seen was so much a part of what we were there to do.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s the same for so many of the rituals we\u2019re suspending. The point isn\u2019t that we want each other around for our rituals, it\u2019s that the ritual <em>is</em> having each other around. We don\u2019t enact these symbolic performances just for their own sake, we do them because when they\u2019re done in front of groups they take meaning from our togetherness.</p> \n<p>The mother who labours over a mouse-shaped cake from the Women\u2019s Weekly so her five-year-old can huff and puff the candles out; the 20-year-olds who squeeze themselves into ill-fitting suits and heels for each other\u2019s 21sts, the bridesmaids obligingly wear their matching aubergine or sienna \u2013 all are playing their part in familiar performances that rely on an audience.

Part of the joy of these things is surrendering our thinking individual selves; part of what we surrender to is each other. We risk losing that by being apart.</p> \n<p>Which is why I\u2019m really hoping we get wise to this and come up with rituals that make sense inside social isolation. We should work out our own playbooks, inside our own families or close groups of friends, so that we\u2019re not entirely without these performances. We should find symbols that can be the digital, socially distanced equivalents of blowing out the candles; things that will become habits and patterns and comforting repetition to let us salvage some moments of social alchemy.</p> \n<p>These new digital Netflix-watching parties and first dates over FaceTime are sweet ways of connecting but for now they\u2019re all novel; they don\u2019t have the well-worn familiarity that would mean they can really replace the rituals we\u2019re losing. Time will help. Anything becomes a ritual if you do it long enough. But we should know that we aren\u2019t just on the hunt for ways of connecting; we\u2019re on the hunt for ways of connecting that can become habits, that will wear a groove into our brain in the same way that singing carols did, or raising a glass at a wedding.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/29/the-best-chat-apps-for-your-coronavirus-quarantine-ranked\">The best chat apps for your coronavirus quarantine \u2013 ranked!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Just this morning a fleet of cars drove past my apartment building hanging streamers and party hats out the window, beeping and honking and playing mariachi tunes.

  "<p>Surely the best witnesses to the fact that the key to awe and wonder is feeling small are astronauts. Like Captain Jim Lovell, who, when on board the Apollo 8 on Christmas Eve 1968, raised his hand against the window and watched the entire planet disappear. \u201cI realised how insignificant we all are if everything I\u2019d ever known is behind my thumb,\u201d he said. The first person to ever step on to the moon, Neil Armstrong, did exactly the same thing. He recalled later: \u201cIt suddenly struck me that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn\u2019t feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.\u201d</p> <p>We have shot hundreds of human beings into space over the past few decades, most with a background in engineering, science, medicine or the military, and almost all of them seem to return with permanently widened eyes. Former soldiers suddenly speak of elation, mathematicians of bliss, biologists of transcendence. The term for the psychological impact of flying into space and viewing the Earth as a simple dot is called the \u201cOverview Effect\u201d, and it was coined by author Frank White in his book of the same name in 1987. White defined it as \u201ca profound reaction to viewing the Earth from outside its atmosphere\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/26/they-told-me-i-had-18-months-to-live-nothing-was-more-important-than-finishing-my-book\">They told me I had 18 months to live. Nothing was more important than finishing my book | Andrew Darby</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Overview Effect turns astronauts into \u201cevangelists, preaching the gospel of orbit\u201d as they return from space with a renewed faith or on a quest for wisdom. For some it\u2019s a kind of lingering euphoria that results in a permanent change of perspective. The first human to reach outer space, the Russian cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin, who circled the Earth for 108 minutes in 1961, came back with a clarion call: \u201cOrbiting Earth in the spaceship, I saw how beautiful our planet is. People, let us preserve and increase this beauty, not destroy it.\u201d</p> <p>In recent years, scientists have been trying to measure and understand the Overview Effect, even sending people into virtual space, where they view galaxies through portals, and then grilling them about their responses, but the accounts of astronauts provide the best insights. The words they use are saturated with awe, an understanding of how fragile the Earth is, with its paper-thin atmosphere, and how much needs to be done to protect it and its inhabitants.</p> <p>As Syrian astronaut Muhammad Ahmad Faris said, when you look at Earth from space, the \u201cscars of national boundaries\u201d disappear. American Sam Durrance said he became emotional after having hurtled past the stratosphere into black space because \u201cyou\u2019re removed from the Earth but at the same time you feel this incredible connection to the Earth like nothing I\u2019d ever felt before\u201d. Mae Jemison, the first black woman to travel in space, who orbited the Earth 127 times in 1992 on board the space shuttle Endeavour, also says she felt \u201cvery connected with the rest of the universe\u201d. (She later told students: \u201cLife is best when you live deeply and look up.\u201d)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0e1c6ec01989996cec7c116d13e1eda3461e5b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0e1c6ec01989996cec7c116d13e1eda3461e5b2/0_1000_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Planet Earth from space.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Planet Earth from space.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Japanese term <em>yugen</em>, which derives from the study of aesthetics, is sometimes used to describe space-gazing. It is said to mean \u201ca profound, mysterious sense of the beauty of the universe \u2026 and the sad beauty of human suffering\u201d, though the meaning and translation depend on the context. Japanese actor and aesthetician Zeami Motokiyo described some of the ways to access yugen:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>To watch the sun sink behind a flower-clad hill.</em></p> <p><em>To wander on in a huge forest without thought of return. To stand upon the shore and gaze after a boat that disappears behind distant islands. To contemplate the flight of wild geese seen and lost among the clouds.</em></p> <p><em>And subtle shadows of bamboo on bamboo.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Or to stare at the heavens from Earth, or Earth from the heavens.</p> <p>Yugen is also defined as \u201can awareness of the universe that triggers emotional responses too big and powerful for words\u201d. It\u2019s striking how, repeatedly, people who venture into space speak of the inadequacy of words. Former Nasa astronaut Kathryn D Sullivan, who in 1984 became the first woman to ever walk in space (and in 2013 was nominated by president Obama to be under secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere), was also gobsmacked.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain how amazing and magical this experience is,\u201d she says. \u201cFirst of all, there\u2019s the astounding beauty and diversity of the planet itself, scrolling across your view at what appears to be a smooth, stately pace \u2026 I\u2019m happy to report that no amount of prior study or training can fully prepare anybody for the awe and wonder this inspires.\u201d</p> <p>American engineer and astronaut Nicole Stott reported that she was \u201cstunned in a way that was completely unexpected\u201d. She described it to her seven-year-old son this way: \u201cJust take a lightbulb \u2013 the brightest lightbulb that you could ever possibly imagine \u2013 and paint it all the colours that you know Earth to be, and turn it on, and be blinded by it.\u201d</p> <p>When you shrink, your ability to see somehow sharpens. When you see the beauty, vastness and fragility of nature, you want to preserve it. You see what we share, and how we connect. You understand being small. Astronaut Boris Volynov said that after seeing Earth from black space \u201cyou become more full of life, softer. You begin to look at all living things with greater trepidation and you begin to be more kind and patient with the people around you.\u201d</p> <p>Scott Kelly, who spent a full year on the International Space Station from 2015 to 2016, delighting Earth-dwellers with his tweets and superb photographs, told Business Insider that the experience of space makes people more empathetic, \u201cmore in touch with humanity and who we are, and what we should do to not only take care of the planet but also to solve our common problems, which clearly are many\u201d. Kelly\u2019s insights echo those of many others: the splendour and vulnerability of the Earth, the connectedness of people, and the need to work in concert, across nations. He said:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>\u201cThe planet is incredibly beautiful, breathtakingly beautiful. Having said that, parts of it are polluted, like with constant levels of pollution in certain parts of Asia. You see how fragile the atmosphere looks. It\u2019s very thin. It\u2019s almost like a thin contact lens over somebody\u2019s eye, and you realise all the pollutants we put into the atmosphere are contained in that very thin film over the surface. It\u2019s a little bit scary actually to look at it.</em></p> <p><em>And then you realise looking at the Earth, that despite its beauty and its tranquility, there\u2019s a lot of hardship and conflict that goes on. You look at the planet without borders, especially during the day. At night you can see countries with lights, but during the daytime it looks like we are all part of one spaceship, Spaceship Earth.</em></p> <p><em>And we\u2019re all flying through space together, as a team, and it gives you this perspective \u2013 people have described it as this \u2018orbital perspective\u2019 \u2013 on humanity, and you get this feeling that we just need to work better \u2013 much, much better \u2013 to solve our common problems.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The first Canadian to walk in space, Chris Hadfield, says whizzing across continents and seeing a sunrise or sunset every 45 minutes creates \u201ca feeling of privilege and sort of a reverence, an awe that is pervasive. And that sense of wonder and privilege and clarity of the world slowly shifts your view.\u201d He believes the Overview Effect is not limited to spaceflight but is more about \u201cwhen you sense that there is something so much bigger than you, so much more deep than you are, ancient, [that] has sort of a natural importance that dwarfs your own.\u201d This understanding, Hadfield suggests, can lead people to make smarter global decisions, and less \u201cjealous, local, narrow\u201d ones.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Astrid, 28, healthcare assistant</strong></p> \n<p>We have the most patient contact out of any healthcare workers.

If someone is in hospital with Covid-19 and their oxygen levels continue to deteriorate, they will often be transferred to intensive care as they might need a ventilator.</p> \n<p>If that happens, a team of three or four of us will drift them off to sleep and put a breathing tube through their mouth into the airway. In some cases, we also turn them on to their front, for about 16-18 hours a day, because some Covid-19 studies suggest this can help with oxygenation. That takes at least five people.</p> \n<p>We wear full PPE to go in and see patients, meaning a mask and either a visor and goggles or a full respirator helmet, as well as a gown, apron and three pairs of gloves. But we try to spend as little time in with them as possible to minimise our exposure.</p> \n<p>I lead the ward rounds, and manage the whole patient - not just the lungs and the right amount of oxygen, but also the heart, the kidneys, and all the other organ systems. Covid-19 can affect the whole body, and many organs may need supporting.</p> \n<p>We\u2019re seeing many patients stay on a ventilator for about seven to 10 days. After that, the hope is the oxygen levels have returned close enough to normal that patients can breath sufficiently on their own.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s quite an invasive process coming to intensive care. You have quite a lot done to you. But that\u2019s because you need it.</p> \n<p><strong>Carol*, 57, critical care nurse</strong></p> \n<p>In critical care there\u2019s a nurse by the bedside 24/7 - although obviously not the same nurse or we would burn out pretty fast. Other medical staff, like the consultants, physiotherapists and nutritionists, tend to go from patient to patient, so they rely an awful lot on the bedside nurses\u2019 insight.</p> \n<p>If someone is having breathing difficulties, we can reposition them, administer medicines, use oxygen masks, or maintain their ventilator. With breathing, you need to be pretty damn quick at reacting. If five or 10 minutes go by, bad stuff can happen.</p> \n<p>We also do the things for the patients that they cannot do themselves. So we\u2019ll wipe their eyes, lubricate them, make sure their eyelids are shut, we\u2019ll brush their teeth, suction out any buildup of saliva and apply lip balm. We\u2019ll use bedpans, we\u2019ll put in catheters and monitor those, we\u2019ll wash the patients, change their bedding and we\u2019ll regularly reposition them. We\u2019ll also talk to them because we\u2019re never quite sure what level of consciousness they have.</p> \n<p>When the bedside nurse is in full protective equipment, they can\u2019t just nip away to pick up the medicine or a new set of linen. So you have someone who stays in the amber zone away from the patients, who can fetch stuff.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Another big part of my job is supporting family and friends, giving them updates and providing emotional support.

We are the people who are actually asking Covid patients to cough.</p> \n<p>As they\u2019re breathing out on the ventilator, we give their chest a really good shake with our hands. It just helps to clear the phlegm, because they can\u2019t cough as they\u2019re paralysed and sedated. We do the cough for them, using our hands on their chest and tummy. It\u2019s a lot of very hands on treatment. We\u2019re then working with the nurses and medics to ultimately wean them off the ventilator.</p> \n<p>We also do physical rehabilitation.

Everton have three first-team players who are not receiving the hands-on treatment they would expect during rehabilitation from long-term injuries \u2013 Schneiderlin, Cenk Tosun and Jean-Philippe Gbamin. But, thanks to video communication services such as Skype and Zoom, the club have been able to manage their recoveries and, in Schneiderlin\u2019s case, arrange a check-up with the specialist who operated on his torn meniscus last month.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/31/daniel-levy-premier-league-managers-and-players-pay-cuts-tottenham-chairman-coronavirus\">Daniel Levy calls on Premier League managers and players to take pay cuts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Everton\u2019s director of medical services, Danny Donachie, said: \u201cThe two most challenging situations are with Morgan and Cenk. They are not able to do any weight-bearing exercise. Most of what we\u2019d have done with them would be hands-on, and that\u2019s not possible. We are doing regular Skype sessions with them but what we can do practically is very limited. Morgan is due to see the surgeon on Monday next week and we will do that via Zoom. From then he can probably do more exercise, so I will be doing one-to-one videos with him every day.\u201d</p> <p>Tosun underwent surgery this month after damaging an anterior cruciate ligament during his loan spell with Crystal Palace, while Gbamin had an operation in February on the quadriceps injury that has ruined the midfielder\u2019s debut season with Everton.</p> <p>Donachie said: \u201cJP is easier to treat. Adam [Newall, a physiotherapist] sets him a weekly programme and checks in with him on video most days. We are checking in with Morgan and Cenk every day. Because they can\u2019t do a lot, the disappointment about not gaining is not that large, they wouldn\u2019t be seeing much improvement at this stage anyway.

They appreciate what is going on and, because of that, you appreciate the smaller things don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>Despite uncertainty over when or if the Premier League season will resume, Everton have divided their squad into training groups in a bid to maintain physical and mental health as well as inject competition.</p> <p>\u201cWe are hoping to generate competition by doing some sessions together in our training groups,\u201d said Donachie. \u201cIt isn\u2019t always possible because of logistics. I have a group of four, for example, and two of them don\u2019t have bike, so we can\u2019t do the bike session together. But we have a weekly log of their sessions and that has introduced an element of competition because some of them want to do more sessions than anyone else \u2013 and see that recorded.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Horror movies don\u2019t come much gorier, funnier or more outre than <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/re-animator-1985\" title=\"\">Re-Animator</a> (1985), the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/hp-lovecraft\" title=\"\">HP Lovecraft</a> adaptation that brought acclaim and infamy to Stuart Gordon, who has died aged 72 from multiple organ failure. The film, which marked his cinematic debut after many years at the forefront of experimental, cutting-edge theatre, concerned the medical student Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs), who concocts a DayGlo serum to reanimate dead tissue, only for the revived corpses to wreak havoc.</p> <p>The acting was commendably straight-faced with hints of camp, the violence graphic, gooey and over-the-top: \u201cThe main thing I remember about shooting Re-Animator is that my shoes stuck to the floor the whole time,\u201d Gordon recalled. In an unequivocal rave review for the New Yorker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/sep/05/guardianobituaries.arts1\" title=\"\">Pauline Kael</a> said: \u201cYou laugh out loud, and as the ghoulish jokes escalate you feel revivified \u2013light-headed and happy \u2026 the bloodier it gets, the funnier it is.\u201d</p> <p>Not everyone agreed. Re-Animator led Gordon into the first of several contretemps with the censors. The picture was released in the US without a rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA); Gordon realised that \u201cif we cut it to their standards the movie would be about 15 minutes long\u201d. In the UK, a measure of the picture\u2019s gruesomeness can be found in the various snips, almost two minutes\u2019 worth in total, which were insisted on by the British Board of Film Classification before it would grant the 18 certificate necessary for public exhibition: the board instructed Gordon to \u201creduce sight of blood flowing down naked body as boy drives surgical saw into man\u2019s neck\u201d, \u201creduce sight of bloody head being squeezed and blood gushing from it\u201d and \u201cremove sight \u2026 of doctor\u2019s severed head attempting oral sex\u201d.</p> <p>Gordon argued that there was serious intent behind the shock value of the latter spectacle. \u201cIt had occurred to me while watching horror films that there would always be that scene where the monster would drag the woman off with him and then the camera would cut, and you\u2019re left there wondering, \u2018Well, what\u2019s he going to do with her?\u2019 \u2026 These re-animated people would have their libidos fully unleashed, and that\u2019s part of the \u2018problem\u2019, that they\u2019re not being held back by social constructs and values.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c67c2a98a11c37a68a621def1a33eaf2cdbb66af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c67c2a98a11c37a68a621def1a33eaf2cdbb66af/424_727_5658_3396/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West in Stuart Gordon\u2019s horror comedy Re-Animator, 1986, based on a short story by HP Lovecraft.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West in Stuart Gordon\u2019s horror comedy Re-Animator, 1986, based on a short story by HP Lovecraft.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TCD/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The censors sharpened their scissors once again for Gordon\u2019s second Lovecraft adaptation, <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/from-beyond-1986\" title=\"\">From Beyond</a> (1986), on which the special effects team reportedly got through 160 gallons of gunk. \u201cWe thought we were so clever because instead of using blood we just had a lot of slime and goo, but the MPAA said that was even more disgusting!\u201d In this instance, he was contractually obliged in the US to secure an R rating (allowing viewers under 17 to be admitted with an adult), which resulted in some delicate behind-the-scenes conversations. \u201cWhat on earth were you thinking of when you zoomed in on his mouth as he was sucking out her eye?\u201d asked an MPAA representative. \u201cI didn\u2019t even tell her that the woman on screen was my wife and that it wasn\u2019t very pleasant for her either,\u201d Gordon <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/stuart-gordons-shock-treatment-102545/\" title=\"\">later confessed</a>. \u201cBut if your wife won\u2019t put up with it, who will?\u201d</p> <p>His propensity for horror and outrage made it all the more unexpected when he co-created the hit Disney comedy Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989), though he did not consider the project a radical departure. \u201cReally, it\u2019s no different than Re-Animator,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about a mad scientist and an experiment that goes wrong, and so forth.\u201d The picture was a response to his children\u2019s complaints that they weren\u2019t allowed to see any of his work.

He was educated at Lane technical high school before attending the University of Wisconsin. It was there in 1968 that he formed the Screw Theatre, which mounted several controversial productions. The most harrowing was The Game Show, intended as an attack on complacency, during which the auditorium doors were locked and members of the audience (who were, in fact, plants) humiliated and brutalised. After a version of Peter Pan incorporating nudity, anti-war sentiments and psychedelic overtones, he and his future wife, Carolyn Purdy (later Purdy-Gordon), were arrested on charges of obscenity.</p> <p>The following year they co-founded the influential Organic Theatre Company, where Gordon directed new plays including the world premiere in 1974 of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/29/the-seven-rages-of-david-mamet-genius-or-symbol-of-toxic-masculinity\" title=\"\">David Mamet</a>\u2019s savage dating comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/may/15/theatre.artsfeatures3\" title=\"\">Sexual Perversity in Chicago</a>, and Bleacher Bums, a comedy drama about baseball fans written in 1977 by Organic regulars including Gordon, Purdy-Gordon and the actors Joe Mantegna and Dennis Franz, and described by the Chicago Tribune as \u201cBeckettian\u201d.</p> <p>There was already a cinematic quality to Gordon\u2019s theatre work. \u201cStuart\u2019s notion was that anything which could be done on film could be done on the stage,\u201d said Mamet, \u201cso he created, play-by-play, a stagecraft of effect: blood, gore, nudity, music, sound, and so on. It thrilled us all, production by production. We who saw the shows remember them still.\u201d</p> <p>But when he moved into directing films, he retained elements of the theatrical process, often drawing on a small repertory company of actors (including Combs, who described him as \u201cthe Ozzy Osbourne of directors\u201d) and ring-fencing the sort of generous rehearsal period uncommon in filmmaking. Among his other movies were two further Lovecraft adaptations, Castle Freak (1995) and Dagon (2001), as well as the boisterous, irreverent adventure Space Truckers (1996), starring Stephen Dorff and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/29/dennis-hopper-obituary\" title=\"\">Dennis Hopper</a>.

  "<h2><strong>THE MORE THINGS CHANGE \u2026</strong></h2> <p>When all this is over, we will have learned to practise kindness and become more generous towards our fellow man. The flatmate you\u2019ve spent the last 12 weeks in isolation with who leaves the oven on overnight and never flushes? He\u2019s only doing his best. The neighbours who\u2019ve turned every evening of the last three months into some 90s nu-metal lockdown party? They just like what they like.

With press officers and Mr 15%s now merely voices on the end of a Zoom call, off come the shackles \u2013 like Karim Benzema, who\u2019s decided the time is right to appraise the skills of Olivier Giroud, a man who, one might assume, is taking his old place in <em>Les Bleus</em>\u2019 lineup. \u201cYou can\u2019t confuse an F1 car with a go-kart and I\u2019m being kind,\u201d he tooted in a live Instachat video with some YouTuber or whatever. \u201cHe has his career, he does what he wants and scores the goals he wants to score.

That\u2019s what I think, that\u2019s the truth, and that\u2019s how it is. Because, if you ask me with R9 [Ronaldo]: R9 is F1, and I am karting. That\u2019s the way it is.

Or watch one of those interviews where F1 drivers take time out from going round in circles in the most intricately-computed machines and admit that they\u2019d give anything for just one more day back in the old wagon they careered around in as kids, where it all began. Just like the selfish louts next door, we\u2019re all into whatever we\u2019re into.

Play all remaining fixtures on the same day. Each is a five-a-side game of five minutes each way. The matches can be played on an artificial surface, say at The Pitts in Ancoats. Clubs can send a squad of seven, one of whom is the captain/coach. Goalies must stay inside their area, etc. Drinks in the bar afterwards. I\u2019ve not done the maths but I reckon it should be doable in a day and save a lot of messing about\u201d \u2013 Ed Bailey.</p> <p>\u201cGiven that the accepted safe distance is two metres, why can\u2019t this season be determined by completing fixtures as penalty shootouts? Make it best-of-20, every outfield player takes a shot, with discrepancies in the final scores going towards goal difference. After each kick, the ball is changed a la Major League Baseball, and a Disinfectant Task Force is dispatched to fumigate the spot/posts/crossbar as appropriate.

These rules stipulate that we must have a reasonable excuse to leave our homes and that with a few exceptions, gatherings of more than two people in a public place are forbidden. The punishment for breaking the rules is either a fixed penalty notice or potentially a criminal conviction, with the police empowered to make us go home and if necessary, use force to do so. The current situation is being further complicated by discrepancies between government guidance and the letter of the law.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/30/uk-police-guidelines-coronavirus-lockdown-enforcement-powers-following-criticism-lord-sumption\">UK police warned against \u2018overreach\u2019 in use of virus lockdown powers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What is clear is this: we are now all presumed absconders until we demonstrate otherwise. Yet, as with every universal restriction on liberty, the effects of this new state of emergency will not be felt evenly. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, yesterday <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/coronavirus-overzealous-police-council-officers-easter-eggs-row-steven-kinnock-2523263\">urged police</a> to \u201cuse their discretion\u201d in enforcing the new rules. Even on a purely liberal analysis, that is not how the law works. Police have a clear set of rules that they can enforce, and enforcement beyond those rules is outside the scope of their powers and unlawful.</p> <p>As the police monitoring group <a href=\"https://twitter.com/netpol/status/1244624516065767433?s=20\">Netpol remarked</a> yesterday, arbitrary policing wasn\u2019t suddenly invented last week. While some white people may be surprised by the inconsistent way in which the new powers are being enforced, communities of colour already know that police discretion is a gift not bestowed equally.</p> <p>There is a long history of police power being deployed as a disciplinary tool against communities of colour, from the<a href=\"http://www.irr.org.uk/news/fighting-sus-then-and-now/\"> sus laws of the 1970s</a> (the stop and search laws) to the more recent response to serious youth violence, which included calls for <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/police-to-start-armed-patrols-in-londons-gang-crime-hotspots-a3134201.html\">armed police patrols</a> on inner city estates, and even <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/knife-crime-uk-stabbings-gavin-williamson-military-police-cressida-dick-a8809581.html\">deployment of the </a><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/knife-crime-uk-stabbings-gavin-williamson-military-police-cressida-dick-a8809581.html\">army</a>. The recent reports of coronavirus policing brought to mind a 2018 <a href=\"http://www.stop-watch.org/uploads/documents/Being_Matrixed.pdf\">report</a> by StopWatch, which explores the experiences of young people of colour arbitrarily included on the Metropolitan police\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/15/met-removes-hundreds-from-gangs-matrix-after-breaking-data-laws\">gangs list</a>, for whom being stopped and searched is as normal as \u201cputting your clothes on\u201d. For some young people of colour, then, daily life was already locked down well before coronavirus arrived.</p> <p>Far from being the solution, police discretion is actually part of the problem. For black people in England and Wales, police discretion looks like us being subject to <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/853204/police-use-of-force-apr2018-mar2019-hosb3319.pdf\">16% of police uses of force</a> \u2013 and 20% of electro-shock weapon usage \u2013 despite being <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/uk-population-by-ethnicity/national-and-regional-populations/population-of-england-and-wales/latest\">just over 3%</a> of the population. Police discretion is us being <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/crime/stop-and-search-england-and-wales/\">nearly 10 times</a> more likely than a white person to be stopped and searched, despite being no more likely than people of other ethnicities to be found with prohibited items. It is the Met\u2019s gangs database being comprised of <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.uk/files/reports/Trapped%20in%20the%20Matrix%20Amnesty%20report.pdf\">78% black people</a>, despite only 27% of people responsible for serious youth violence in the capital being black. It\u2019s therefore not unreasonable to worry that people of colour who are actually obeying the new rules may nevertheless find themselves targeted by the police for perceived infractions.</p> <p>Physical distancing is clearly vitally necessary in protecting the many people in our communities for whom this virus would prove fatal. But we should not fall into the trap of thinking that<strong> </strong>policing alone can achieve the enormous social change that is needed to see us through this public health crisis \u2013 especially if headlines about bans on seasonal confectionery continue. Any attempt at prioritising<strong> </strong>coercive power over a public health response won\u2019t just undermine the immediate aim of suppressing Covid-19. If communities of colour are left to bear the brunt of arbitrary policing, the damage done will last even when this crisis is over.</p> <p>\u2022 Gracie Mae Bradley is policy and campaigns manager for Liberty</p>",
  "<p>The \u201cman with questionable fashion sense inflicts abuse on cats\u201d category of true-crime TV has a new monarch: the Tiger King himself, Joe Exotic. This seven-part true-crime doc is a smash hit for Netflix, and that\u2019s no surprise \u2013 it\u2019s arresting, gripping, horrifying and jaw-dropping in equal measure. To parrot Mrs Merton: oh Netflix, what drew you to the story of the polyamorous, power-ballad singing, gun-toting, murderous tiger-collector Joe Exotic?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-series\">Murder, madness and tigers: behind the year's wildest Netflix series</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet, many fans of big cat conservation had hoped that Tiger King might have been something else. All the talk was that this would do for the US\u2019s captive tigers what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/20/killer-whales-not-suitable-captivity-seaworld\">Blackfish</a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/20/killer-whales-not-suitable-captivity-seaworld\"> </a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/20/killer-whales-not-suitable-captivity-seaworld\">did for captive marine mammals</a>. Finally, an expos\u00e9 on those that keep tigers and other big cats as pets; those that breed said cats for profit; those that keep big cats in totally ill-suited environments. Appetites were whetted. So, were our expectations met?</p> <p>The good news is that, in its early stages, the show did plenty right, exploring the swap-meets and the \u201ccollector-mania\u201d that many in this industry seem to possess. And it didn\u2019t hold back in exposing the suffering of these poor animals. Many of Joe Exotic\u2019s 200 or more tigers are shown pacing their cells. They pant. They stare idly. Incredibly, it seems they occasionally live off handouts from a local Walmart. This was heartbreaking to see.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acTdxsoa428\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/acTdxsoa428?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>But there were problems with the show, too. There was a distinct lack of independent commentators on the tigers and why Exotic\u2019s behaviour was, to say the least, reprehensible. The show lacked someone to explain that \u201cgood\u201d zoos have standards for housing captive tigers (here are the <a href=\"https://assets.speakcdn.com/assets/2332/tiger_care_manual_2016.pdf\">Association of Zoos and Aquarium\u2019s guidelines</a>, for instance); nobody to explain why tigers being forced to give birth to cubs in tiger mills (sometimes producing litters three times a year) to provide for the public\u2019s appetite for tiger cubs is deeply unnatural, disturbing and unethical. At one point, Tim Stark, the owner of a roadside zoo, Wildlife in Need, argues that breeding captive tigers in the US is just what we need to do to get them off the endangered list. This point, though grossly misleading, goes largely unchallenged.</p> <p>The truth is that not a single one of these captive tigers would be suitable for release back into the wild. Their genetic history is now marked by enforced inbreeding over many generations. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_tiger#Defects\">white tigers</a> (featured throughout all seven episodes) are a case-in-point: this genetic strain is prone to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_tiger#Defects\">strabismus</a>, a condition that causes tigers to cross their eyes when stressed. White tigers are also more prone to club foot, kidney problems or a twisted neck. It would be catastrophic were they ever to breed with wild tigers.</p> <p>In the early stages, the show does lean on one expert for these sorts of scientific insights. That expert is Joe Exotic\u2019s adversary Carole Baskin, owner of Big Cat Rescue. The trouble with Carole is that, by episode three, she is well and truly thrown under the bus for the sake of story, with the introduction of the controversy over her missing millionaire husband.</p> <p>And the show, rather conveniently, gives a free pass to the source of this vile industry\u2019s funds: the people that are happy to pay $10 to have their photo taken with tiger cubs or who visit Joe Exotic\u2019s park and roadside zoos like it. These punters (some of whom no doubt are Netflix subscribers) generate enormous revenue for these enterprises, <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/11/tigers-in-the-united-states-outnumber-those-in-the-wild-feature/\">sometimes more than </a><a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/11/tigers-in-the-united-states-outnumber-those-in-the-wild-feature/\">$1m each year</a>. Educate them, one could argue, and you cut off an entire income stream for Joe Exotic and people like him. Yet there they are, in the background of many shots throughout Tiger King, grinning for their tiger cub photo shoots or pootling around gift shops, inadvertently (and one hopes, unknowingly) funding the continued abuse of tigers at the hands of Joe Exotic and his cronies.</p> <p>If you were hoping for Blackfish, you will be sorely disappointed. Instead, this an entirely different \u2013 perhaps more watchable \u2013 beast. Netflix\u2019s most masterful trick is that, with this show, it has packaged up an important animal welfare issue into a true-crime maelstrom, machine-tooled to keep us coming back for the next episode. For this reason alone, millions upon millions of people around the world are waking up to this abuse of big cats in a way that a serious, more thorough documentary simply wouldn\u2019t have been able to achieve.</p> <p>Anyone interested in how to engage the masses in the ethical treatment of animals should watch and learn. This is conservation messaging, by stealth. Sneaking up from the long grass. Watching and waiting to deliver its blows at just the right time. Like the tigers then, just wild and free. I can only applaud from my living room, and implore you to tell as many people as you can to watch.</p>",
  "<p>Lawyers have attacked plans to suspend jury trials for up to 18 months in Scotland to cope with the coronavirus crisis as a \u201cknee-jerk reaction instigated by panic\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Scottish government is pushing through a swathe of emergency powers to help the criminal justice system and public adapt to the pandemic in a bill expected to be approved by Holyrood on Wednesday in a single day.</p> \n<p>The bill would prevent landlords from evicting tenants for non-payment of rent; empower Holyrood to allow the release of prison inmates nearing the end of their sentences, and allow children with mental illnesses to be detained for up to four days without a sheriff\u2019s approval, instead of three days at present.</p> \n<p>The Scottish Criminal Bar Association, which represents courtroom lawyers, said it was furious that ministers wanted to temporarily suspend jury trials and to dilute rules on evidence and witness statements, to ensure cases could go ahead.</p> \n<p>Judges will be allowed to take pre-recorded witness statements which cannot be challenged under cross-examination, and time limits requiring cases to come to court within 140 or 110 days would be waived.</p> \n<p>Unlike with so-called Diplock courts in Northern Ireland, where a single judge sits without a jury in terror trials, there is no automatic right of appeal allowed under the new bill.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"65a9450f-4bec-4555-bdb0-c829a2782b42\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What do the restrictions involve?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible</li>\n     <li>One form of exercise a day \u2013 for example a run, walk, or cycle \u2013 alone or with members of your household</li>\n     <li>Any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person</li>\n     <li>Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.

They are at best a kneejerk reaction to an as yet unquantified problem instigated by panic, and at worst something far more sinister.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, said the jury trial measures were necessary to ensure that serious criminal trials did not halt entirely, with significant disruption and uncertainty for the accused and victims.</p> \n<p>The government said the European convention on human rights obliges states to maintain an effective justice system, and it believed the proposals were lawful and justified. Social distancing regulations meant it was impossible for juries, which are 15-strong in Scotland, to sit together, while illnesses and self-isolation would impact on witness availability and safety.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are not deaf or blind to the concerns around these powers,\u201d Sturgeon said. \u201cWe would never have wanted to be in a position to pass legislation like this. We wouldn\u2019t be doing it unless we thought it was necessary for the protection of the population.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mike Russell, the Scottish constitutional affairs minister, said the powers had been sought by the head of the Scottish judiciary, Lord Carloway, and the head of the prosecution system, the lord advocate, James Wolffe QC.</p> \n<p>Russell said the powers would be strictly time-limited, and could only last for a maximum of 18 months with Holyrood\u2019s approval, and were also subject to two monthly reports to the Scottish parliament. \u201cWe want to keep people safe,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.scotland-judiciary.org.uk/25/2366/LJG-response-to-Coronavirus-Bill\">In a lengthy statement</a>, Carloway, the lord justice general, said courts faced a \u201cmonumental\u201d backlog in cases, so the powers to try cases without juries and with looser rules on witnesses were necessary. Otherwise, more than 1,000 trials could be delayed.</p> \n<p>\u201cUnless action is taken to mitigate the impact of this, there will be substantial delays in bringing accused persons to trial. These are likely to stretch into years rather than months,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis will have many adverse impacts, including uncertainty for the accused, complainers and witnesses. Such delays will have a highly disruptive effect on their lives, and potentially on the wider system.\u201d</p>",

Eliot L Engel, the chairman of the US House of Representatives\u2019 foreign affairs committee, said Orb\u00e1n was making \u201ca blatant power grab in the face of the worst global health crisis in recent history.

It\u2019s not a matter of whether I trust Orb\u00e1n. It\u2019s really about our basic perception of democracy \u2026 There should always be checks and balances. Such a law is against my perception of parliamentary democracy.\u201d</p> <p>Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, the head of the German Bundestag\u2019s foreign affairs committee and a candidate in the race to succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor, also condemned the law, writing on Twitter that it \u201ceffectively eliminates opposition\u201d and was a breach of basic principles the EU \u201ccannot accept\u201d.</p> <p>Others accused EU authorities and member states in the EU council of ministers of failing to speak out, following Hungary\u2019s sharp decline in democratic freedoms over the last 10 years, as measured by international organisations, such as Freedom House and article 19. \u201cThe silence from the president of the commission and the council is deafening,\u201d in\u2019t Veld said.</p> <p>Responding to Von der Leyen\u2019s statement, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s spokesman Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs said the Hungarian state of emergency and extraordinary measures were \u201ccongruent with the treaties and the Hungarian constitution and targeted exclusively at fighting the coronavirus\u201d.</p> <p>He said the law upheld EU values, rule of law, press freedom, while accusing critics of being misinformed.</p>",

The commons are neither capitalist nor communist, market nor state. They are an insurgency of social power, in which we come together as equals to confront our shared predicaments.</p> \n<p>A thousand books and films and business fables assure us that the fairytale ending to which we should all aspire is to become a millionaire. Then we can isolate ourselves from society in a mansion with high walls, with private healthcare, private education and a private jet. The commons envisages the opposite outcome: finding meaning, purpose and satisfaction by working together to enhance the lives of all. In times of crisis, we rediscover our social nature.</p> \n<p>You can tell a lot about a society from its quirks of language. We repeatedly misuse the word \u201csocial\u201d. We talk about social distancing when we mean physical distancing. We talk about social security and the social safety net when we mean economic security and the economic safety net. While economic security comes (or should come) from government, social security arises from community. One of the extraordinary features of the response to Covid-19 is that, during this self-isolation, some people \u2013 especially elderly people \u2013 feel less isolated than they have done for years, as their neighbours ensure they are not alone.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-and-volunteering-how-can-i-help-in-the-uk\">Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>We still need the state: to provide healthcare, education and an economic safety net, to distribute wealth between communities, to prevent any private interest from becoming too powerful, and to defend us from threats. It currently performs these functions poorly, by design. But if we rely on the state alone, we find ourselves sorted into silos of provisioning and highly vulnerable to cuts. Rich social lives are replaced with cold, transactional relations. Community, then, is not a substitute for the state, but an essential complement.</p> \n<p>There is no guarantee that this resurgence of collective action will survive the pandemic. We could revert to the isolation and passivity that both capitalism and statism have encouraged. But I don\u2019t think we will.

  "<p>As the US continues its scrambling response to the coronavirus outbreak, it has closed borders, quarantined some neighborhoods, and shut down businesses in a number of the most populous states.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, federal and state governments have also been pushing for a series of draconian measures to respond to the virus, which would disproportionately affect asylum seekers, people embroiled in the justice system and even those seeking an abortion.</p> <p>The efforts have already had a striking impact on civil liberties, and bear hints of a 2020 version of the US government response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/september11\">9/11 attacks</a> in 2001, which ultimately led to the Patriot Act, a sweeping piece of legislation that allowed, among other things, the government to collect citizens\u2019 phone data, in an unprecedented encroachment on personal rights.</p> <p>Amid the indisputable need to contain the coronavirus outbreak, many of the measures have civil rights advocates concerned.

The department is also seeking to deport undocumented immigrants who are confirmed to have the virus. The department\u2019s proposal would send those immigrants back to their home countries, regardless of whether they are unsafe.</p> <p>While those rules depend on congressional support, other measures are already being enacted which impede individual rights.</p> <p>Dozens of courts across the US have already been closed due to the coronavirus, and the inherent difficulty of selecting a jury at a time when many Americans are being told to social-distance means further delays are inevitable.</p> <p>Elsewhere, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/ohio-texas-abortion-us-coronavirus-outbreak\">Texas and Ohio have banned almost all abortions</a> in response to the coronavirus, a move it claimed followed federal guidance, but one which fits neatly with their previous efforts to restrict access to abortion.

I now live a stone\u2019s throw away, and was married in the same building in which my birth was registered. When I moved back to London, in 2006, I fell for the city hook, line and sinker, and was under the assumption that it would always be that way.

I find myself envying their close-knit communities, which have rallied in mutual support. Meanwhile, I have only just met my next-door neighbour, who moved in six years ago. What am I doing here, so far from nature and from family? What was so important?</p> \n<p>I know the answer to this, of course: my work, my sense of identity, my friends, culture. I felt that the culture London had to offer was unparalleled. But when you close the galleries and the gig venues, what is left? I simply trudge through the same old backstreets on my daily walk; even my local green space, Hampstead Heath, has little new to offer. It has led me to conclude that the city is great because of its people, the people who have made its food and its art; its architecture, too, though much of that now lies empty. As for the geography, I can take it or leave it.</p> \n<p>I wonder if, after this is all over, our cities will see a mass exodus. Crises, such as this pandemic, always lead to a reassessment; in this case of what constitutes privilege, that much-overused term. Aside from wealth, I used to think privilege meant access to culture, which we rightly value as important. Yet many of us have forgotten to value the natural landscape and what it has to offer us. Privilege, as I see it now, in the midst of this emergency, is the ability to roam in the open countryside. I\u2019d lost touch with that, over the years, despite my childhood climbing trees, hiking up the sides of mountains, and swimming in the pools above waterfalls.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"656c1437-656f-47b7-846e-9585f2c91f09\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z5EpwAUwLkk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Of course, it could just be that I am of that age now.

It\u2019s not until I am standing in the spaced checkout queue that a glance to double-check the list on my phone reveals my battery is on 14%. This might not seem critical, but I have noticed of later that my phone has a tendency to run down from 10% to zero in as many seconds. My basket is full of frozen goods: ice-cream, frozen peas and fish. I am a fool. A green recruit. I jog/walk all the way to Essex Road, sprint for the door (there are several flats), text Hazel, and my phone goes dead.

  "<p>Would you spare a thought for all the poor, suffering celebrities out there? While this is a difficult time for everyone, it has been particularly tough on the famous. They have been upstaged by a virus. No one cares what they are wearing or who they are snogging any more; the world\u2019s attention has been diverted by a headline-hogging pandemic. It seems as if some celebrities are starting to grapple with the realisation that they are not quite as important or beloved as they thought they were. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2020/mar/19/gal-gadot-celeb-friends-singing-self-isolation-jared-leto\">Gal Gadot</a> was the first victim of the great celebrity backlash of 2020. \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together,\u201d the Wonder Woman star assured us in a video on Instagram a couple of weeks ago, before launching into a star-studded rendition of John Lennon\u2019s Imagine. Can you imagine how little self-awareness you must have to enlist a bunch of multimillionaires to sing about a world with \u201cno possessions\u201d while huge numbers of people are losing their jobs? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/20/comedians-gal-gadot-imagine-video-joe-lycett\">The </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/20/comedians-gal-gadot-imagine-video-joe-lycett\">tone-deaf performance was swiftly savaged</a>.</p> <p>One would have thought the glitterati might have learned from the scathing reaction to Gadot\u2019s singalong. But no, the vapid messages of hope from celebs keep coming \u2013 as do the disgusted responses from the public. Madonna, for reasons only she knows, decided to preach to us from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/23/madonna-bathtub-coronavirus-crisis-pop-superstar\">a bathtub full of rose petals</a>. Covid-19 \u201cdoesn\u2019t care about how rich you are\u201d she informed us. \u201cIt\u2019s the great equaliser.\u201d It certainly brought people together in disdain for her out-of-touch antics.</p> <p>Then there is the billionaire David Geffen, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/david-geffen-deletes-instagram-after-self-isolating-yacht-post-2020-3\">who deleted Instagram</a> after the incensed reaction to him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/mar/30/self-isolate-giant-yacht-david-geffen-social-media\">posting pictures of his $590m (\u00a3480m)</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/mar/30/self-isolate-giant-yacht-david-geffen-social-media\"> superyacht</a>, on which he is self-isolating, with the caption \u201chope everyone is staying safe\u201d. Faring slightly better on the social media front is Ivanka Trump, who has not yet sequestered herself on a superyacht. Instead she is selflessly educating the great unwashed by posting a video of <a href=\"https://hollywoodlife.com/2020/03/26/ivanka-trump-kids-wash-hands-expensive-soap-backlash-video/\">her kids </a><a href=\"https://hollywoodlife.com/2020/03/26/ivanka-trump-kids-wash-hands-expensive-soap-backlash-video/\">cleaning their hands</a> with $39 Aesop soap. A real woman of the people.</p> <p>Now it seems that Pharrell Williams has become the latest celebrity who is stuck inside but can\u2019t read the room. Last week, the musician called on his Twitter followers to donate to hospitals. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gymleaderanya/status/1242572528951783424?s=20\">A representative reply</a>: \u201cYou\u2019re worth over $150 million, donate your own money.\u201d Williams later clarified that he had already donated; nevertheless, it feels as if an awful lot of celebrities are more keen on soliciting money from us plebs than reaching into their own purses. The chef and TV star Bobby Flay, for example, who is said to be worth about $30 million, <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/irl/bobby-flay-gofundme/\">set up a GoFundMe campaign</a> to help him pay his restaurant employees. That is capitalism for you: eventually you have to rely on <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/other-peoples-money/\">other people\u2019s money</a>.</p> <p>Celebrities being clueless is nothing new, but it feels as if there has never been such anger levelled at the jet set. Far from being a \u201cgreat equaliser\u201d, coronavirus has made inequality impossible to ignore. That is not just wealth inequality, but inequality of access to healthcare. A new famous person seems to test positive for coronavirus every day while exhibiting mild symptoms at best. Meanwhile, our friends and family can be coughing up their lungs and still not get access to a test or a hospital bed.</p> <p>Celebrity culture and capitalism are inextricably entwined. Both elevate the individual over the collective good. They rely on the lie of \u201cmeritocracy\u201d: work hard and you can achieve whatever you want. But it has become uncomfortably clear how little we value our hardest workers \u2013 the healthcare professionals, supermarket staff, bus drivers and delivery drivers who are keeping the world running while the rich run to their second homes. And it has never been so clear how little the people who earn the most contribute to society. \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together,\u201d the rich and famous keep telling us. Sorry, but it is obvious that we are not.</p> <ul> <li><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Who says everything in the film business has ground to a halt? Some directors are finding ways of keeping the cameras rolling. Timur Bekmambetov, best known outside Russia for making the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/jun/25/film.actionandadventure\">Angelina Jolie thriller Wanted</a>, was midway through filming his second world war fighter-ace film V2: Escape from Hell when the coronavirus pandemic broke. So the Kazakh-Russian sanitised his shooting schedule and, last week, pulled off what he believes was a cinematic first: a feature-film scene shot entirely inside a live video game.</p> <p>Bekmambetov had originally intended to shoot his dogfight the Howard Hughes way: real sky, real planes. But to minimise social mixing, he instead put his lead actor, Pavel Priluchny, in a plane cockpit on a St Petersburg soundstage with a skeletal crew \u2013 <a href=\"https://vk.com/video-111572021_456239286\">while he directed the scene remotely</a>, from 1,200km away in Kazan, Tatarstan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"69f07a5e87f3e05c6e61ccca20828db6491b3768\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69f07a5e87f3e05c6e61ccca20828db6491b3768/0_0_580_900/322.jpg\" alt=\"The first vertical film \u2026 a poster for V2: Escape from Hell\" width=\"322\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The first vertical film \u2026 a poster for V2: Escape from Hell</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Priluchny\u2019s cockpit was surrounded by four LED screens displaying the action as he played real gamers at online aerial shoot \u2019em-ups. Unlike with a green screen, he was reacting to \u201creal\u201d events around him. There was a script of sorts \u2013 the mission was the downing of a German bomber \u2013 and everyone was responding to Bekmambetov\u2019s cues. \u201cOne of the problems was the gamers were too good,\u201d he says, wheezing with laughter on a Skype link from Kazan. \u201cThey killed Pavel too quickly.\u201d</p> <p>V2: Escape from Hell was already innovative. The $10m action film focuses on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Devyatayev\">Soviet war hero and concentration camp escapee Mikhail Devyatayev</a>. But Bekmambetov chose to film in a vertical format tailored for the smartphone market. It will also have a shorter runtime and a more fragmented narrative than the version made for Imax. He says going upright is not solely a commercial ploy: \u201cI\u2019m making a movie about a character who never gave up \u2013 he was 65lb when he escaped from the camp. It\u2019s a movie about the vertical, about a man who never fell.\u201d</p> <p>This could be seen as an extension of the technological setup he developed for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/20/profile-review-skyping-with-isis-thriller-dials-up-the-suspense\">Profile</a>, his last film: a drama about a British journalist investigating Isis recruitment, which took place entirely inside text browsers and Skype video windows. Bekmambetov\u2019s company, Bazelevs, developed <a href=\"https://screenlifer.com/en/about/\">Screenlife</a>, an application that \u2013 through the likes of Skype, FaceTime and chat \u2013 enables film-makers to direct their actors wherever they are in the world as, in character, they use their computers or mobiles to call each other, stalk people on Facebook and juggle chat threads.

Of course it would be a pleasure to sit with you in the same room, but more and more we accept this reality.\u201d</p> <p>Not all of the director\u2019s envelope-pushing has been successful: wild but top-heavy SFX sequences collapsed the weak conceptual scaffolding of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/21/abraham-lincoln-vampire-hunter-review\">Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter</a>.

Thankfully @abbifletcher was there to document it \ud83e\udd74 I\u2019m always looking for ways to reduce my waste and make use of fabric scraps from the studio. So inspired by my @nextinfashion denim challenge I created this arctic landscape throw. You can use anything for this, old clothes, tea towels, your own waste from sewing projects, basically this should be about using up what you have not buying new. You\u2019ll need a base, this could be an old bed sheet, curtains, an existing blanket that needs updating; any size will do but mine was 140cm x 140cm made from some damaged denim from the studio. Cut it into a square then start laying out your scraps to create your landscape scene. Start from the back and work your way to the bottom of the square. Cut the scraps into rough points, there are no real rules to this, it can be as neat or as messy as you like. Pin everything down then start to sew. Don\u2019t worry about it being too neat here either, just sew along the edge of each piece until they are all attached. You can also do a few extra stitch lines so they look like mountain trails and to make sure all the fabric is secure.  To finish it off I added a bias binding around the edge but you could also fold it over twice and stitch down if you don\u2019t have any binding. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve missed some things out but let me know your question in the comments and I\u2019ll try and answer as many as I can! Can\u2019t wait to see all of your creations! Stay safe and stay home xx</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/danielwfletcher/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> DANIEL w.

At Liam Hodges, we&#39;ve been learning to crochet sporadically over the last months, making it up as we go and along and watching youtube tutorials for some help when needed. This week at home, Liam designed an \u2018ISOL8\u2019 rug for everyone staying in. The rug can be made from old clothes / fabric that you would throw away, or normal yarn.  Materials used: A mixture of old t-shirts (4 beige / green and 2 tie dye) along with @woolandthegang\u2019s jersey be good black yarn made from industrial waste from the manufacturing of garments.  Send us or tag us in your attempts or anything else you\u2019ve been learning and making during this time at home. #STAYATHOME</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/liam__hodges/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> LIAM HODGES</a> (@liam__hodges) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-03-27T11:56:54+00:00\">Mar 27, 2020 at 4:56am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <h2>Sew a shark mascot with designer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jan/05/christopher-raeburn-sustainable-design-london-fashion-week-mens\">Christopher Raeburn</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bbcf4f6c6e2ca02f998a81612d118cdcdf46c79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bbcf4f6c6e2ca02f998a81612d118cdcdf46c79/0_0_2250_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Christopher Raeburn shark mascot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Christopher Raeburn shark mascot</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Broomfield/benbroomfield.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Designer Christopher Raeburn\u2019s team are adapting to the current situation by releasing weekly creative tasks via their <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Raeburn_Design\">#RaeburnAtHome</a> initiative.</p> <p>\u201cThis project is to make one of our shark mascots. We have always featured animals in our collections, initially as a way to highlight and support endangered species through our WWF UK partner. The Shark is one of our most popular animals; we keep it in our collections each season, but it always evolves.</p> <p>\u201cYou need no more than one square metre of fabric \u2013 even less if you are conscious of pattern placement for waste reduction. Using a variety of smaller cuts of fabric is encouraged though as this adds pops of colour and texture to the final shark.</p> <p>\u201cNot only is reusing and repurposing old fabric a more interesting way of working, but extending the lifetime of garments is instrumental in reducing planetary impact. When people are spending more time at home than ever before, now is the chance to pull out those bits that we no longer use and give them new life.</p> <p>\u201cUnless you are an absolute master, it should keep you busy for about 10 hours. We only recommend a sewing machine for ease and speed \u2013 top marks for effort go to anyone tackles it by hand.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> advanced<br><strong>Equipment needed:</strong> a sewing machine, fabric, scissors, thread and paper.</p> <p><strong>How to:</strong></p> <p>For the <a href=\"https://www.raeburndesign.co.uk/explore/journal/post/id/diy-shark-mascot-raeburn-at-home\">full instructions click here</a>; you can <a href=\"https://www.raeburndesign.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Raeburn-Shark-Mascot-A4-Print.pdf\">download the shark pattern here</a>.

His first was to cut a pattern for and sew a one-piece kimono-inspired garment. Next up is making miniature sculptures of the kings and queens of England using modelling clay.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Make-Your-Own-Japanese-Clothes/dp/1568364938\">How to make Japanese clothes</a> by John Marshall is a book I have on my shelf that I thought it would be great to lose myself in during isolation.</p> <p>\u201cI love traditional Japanese clothing and now is the perfect time to study. What I love about kimonos is that they are traditionally dictated by the fabric \u2013 they are the width they are because that is how wide the looms could weave. For a fabric geek like me, that\u2019s a dream.</p> <p>\u201cA traditional kimono pattern looks like some different-length rectangles put together, but nothing is ever that simple and it takes a lot of skill to construct a traditional kimono properly. The one I made is much, much easier.</p> <p>\u201cI used three metres of fabric left over from the last collection, but you could make it with two metres if it\u2019s 150cm wide, or you can easily add seams to the patterns or patchwork fabrics together. Repurposing old curtains or a bed sheet would be perfect.</p> <p>\u201cIt took me around four hours to complete \u2013 there are only three seams and three hems. I tried to make it as simple as possible.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> advanced<br><strong>Equipment needed:</strong> a sewing machine, two to three metres of fabric, thread, scissors, paper and dressmaking pins.</p> <p><strong>How to:</strong></p> <p>\u201cThe pattern I made is available to <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/u477xf47t0mj0im/AAAZK_dmuqJij-P-Aw93H3I5a/ONE%20PIECE%20ROBE?dl=0&amp;subfolder_nav_tracking=1\">download for free here</a>.

This so-called shrinky necklace is something we did as kids. We first made one as Tatty Devine in 2001. It was very early days, when we made jewellery from whatever we could get our hands on. We enjoyed <em>having</em> to eat crisps.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> beginner<br><strong>Equipment needed:</strong> old crisp packets (not foiled or metallic, such as Chipsticks or many supermarket own brands); a chain necklace (whether new or something you already own); greaseproof paper, a baking tray, a damp tea towel (for safety reasons), an old tea towel, a hole punch, a regular <a href=\"https://www.the-beadshop.co.uk/beads-and-beading-supplies-c491/jewellery-findings-c7/jump-rings-c12/silver-plated-jump-rings-c14\">jump ring</a> and two pairs of flat-nose pliers.</p> <p><strong>How to:</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Set your grill to medium.</p></li> <li><p>While the grill is warming, fold the greaseproof paper to make it into rough envelope shapes and pop your empty food packets inside \u2013 one wrapper per envelope.</p></li> <li><p>Put the envelopes on a baking tray under the grill. The packet will start to shrink and curl up. You don\u2019t want them to burn or blister so watch closely.</p></li> <li><p>As soon as they are shrunken enough, remove the baking tray, quickly place a folded tea towel on top of the envelope and slam your hand down to flatten your \u201cshrinky\u201d.</p></li> <li><p>Use a hole punch to make a hole somewhere on the packet.</p></li> <li><p>Open a <a href=\"https://beadclublounge.com/what-are-jump-rings/\">regular jump ring</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOkBbCx7MP4\">with the pliers</a> and thread the packet on to the jump ring, then put the jump ring on to the necklace and close it.</p></li> </ul> <p>You can stop with one pendant or layer up for a charm effect.</p> <h2>Knit a scarf with dancer Meshach Henry</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5f646d1bea95fa174c71e2d72eb22a4c6ae90ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5f646d1bea95fa174c71e2d72eb22a4c6ae90ed/0_0_828_1327/624.jpg\" alt=\"Novice knitter Meshach Henry\" width=\"624\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Novice knitter Meshach Henry</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Grimshaw/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite having no previous knitting experience, dancer Meshach Henry has made three scarves in as many days, documented on Instagram by his partner, the Radio 1 DJ Nick Grimshaw.</p> <p>\u201cI always said I would learn a new skill like plumbing or plastering if I ever had a lot of time on my hands. But they aren\u2019t ideal skills to practice in this current situation. So, having seen knitting supplies in a craftshop window recently, I thought, \u2018Here\u2019s my new hobby.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI <a href=\"ttps://www.theknittingnetwork.co.uk/hayfield-bonus-super-chunky-berry-652?gclid=CjwKCAjwvOHzBRBoEiwA48i6Agw3S5RtfL5d5H6CnxtG3WWSPo5wA7_GTJeV9sZt29WqomOAWQAimBoCQwcQAvD_BwE\">purchased a thick wool</a> because it looked easier to use and less fiddly. I bought 10mm knitting needles, which I thought were an average size but later found out are strangely big \u2013 but I\u2019m really happy with the chunky effect they produce.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I like about knitting is that you can see your physical product. As a dancer, I rarely get to see my own work, so to be able to see and hold this tangible thing is a whole new world for me.</p> <p>\u201cMy intention is to move on to knitting jumpers.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/costa-rica\">Costa Rica</a>\u2019s president has pledged to protect the rights of indigenous defenders following a spate of violence against native communities in his country.</p> <p>Last month, an activist, Yehry Rivera, from the Br\u00f6r\u00e1n indigenous community in T\u00e9rraba, Puntarenas province, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/25/costa-rican-indigenous-land-activist-killed-by-armed-mob\">was shot and killed</a> after he was attacked by an armed mob while trying to reclaim ancestral land. The murder happened just two weeks after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/17/costa-rica-indigenous-leader-shot-land-rights\">an indigenous leader of the Bribri indigenous</a> people in nearby Salitre was shot in a surge of unpunished violence against native communities in Costa Rica.</p> <p>Conflicts over land rights in Central America have driven a wave of violence and murders against indigenous activists in the region. In Costa Rica, activists have warned that state inaction over the violence is a question of political will.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d25b0baa0d20a193c007666ba9b494b0f2d0f51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d25b0baa0d20a193c007666ba9b494b0f2d0f51/0_41_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Costa Rica\u2019s President Carlos Alvarado\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Costa Rica\u2019s president, Carlos Alvarado, has set up a fund to compensate people who have lost their land.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juan Carlos Ulate/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In an interview with the Guardian, the Costa Rican president, Carlos Alvarado, said he was committed to protecting indigenous land rights while making sure non-indigenous people living in protected areas were compensated.</p> <p>\u201cI believe one of the problems has to do a lot with the enforcement of those rights. In 1978, many lands were declared indigenous territories. But from that time until today, the state of Costa Rica has not had the capacity \u2013 mainly economic \u2013 to protect the land rights of the people,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere were people that were there before that declaration that have rights also. But after 1978, many people had entered the lands and, in some cases, bought that land without it being possible. Today, the situation we need to fix is that we need to preserve the rights we\u2019ve already recognised and at the same time provide solutions for many of the people that for many years have lived in the lands.\u201d</p> <p>Under the 1977 Indigenous Act in Costa Rica, 24 territories are protected for people with historical ties to the area. Despite legal recognition, these land rights have never been formally implemented, causing the Br\u00f6r\u00e1n and Bribri people to retake possession of their ancestral land.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights expressed its concern about the situation in the Buenos Aires area of Puntarenas province, the centre of the violence, a year to the day after <a href=\"https://www.forestpeoples.org/en/law-policy/press-release/2019/press-release-indigenous-human-right-leader-costa-rica-assassinated\">the murder of </a><a href=\"https://www.forestpeoples.org/en/law-policy/press-release/2019/press-release-indigenous-human-right-leader-costa-rica-assassinated\">Sergio Rojas</a>, a Bribri land and human rights defender.</p> <p>\u201cWe recently started the first fund for buying land and for compensation,\u201d Alvarado said. \u201cWe are going to be presenting a bill in the national assembly as well to provide a solution both to recover the lands of the indigenous but, at the same time, have an integral solutions for the people that are Costa Ricans that need a livelihood solution. These are quite complex solutions but we are addressing it and we are following all the rights, not only on the rights of Costa Rica and international conventions, but also the commission on human rights in the region.\u201d</p> <p>But Vanessa Jim\u00e9nez, a lawyer for <a href=\"https://www.forestpeoples.org/en\">Forest Peoples Programme</a> who works with indigenous defenders in Costa Rica, questioned the president\u2019s framing of the situation.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an issue of political will, not economics. In Salitre alone [where Rojas was murdered last year], eight eviction orders have been active now for between five and seven years, but the government has delayed executing them \u2013 even before the recipients decided to involve the courts with appeals,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd once the evictions are appealed, the executive washes their hands of responsibility, leaving the indigenous peoples at the mercy of hostile illegal occupants and numerous, prolonged judicial cases. The state is wholly responsible for what they call a conflict between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples.\u201d</p>",

This is especially so given the misinformation and fake news permeating the narrative surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic.\u2019</p> \n   <p>The archives continues to fulfil this role despite closing its public spaces across the country, and cancelling all events and programs until further notice. </p> \n   <p>\u2018Our vast online catalogue, RecordSearch, contains millions of pages of digitised content from the national archival collection \u2013 this is available free of charge to all. Members of the public can request analogue records be digitised and added to RecordSearch.</p> \n   <p>\u2018We are also available online to support the public with their research queries. Crucially the national archives is ready to help any Australian who needs certified copies of documents from the collection related to them, to support a claim for government payments or other assistance.\u2019</p> \n   <p>To keep Australians remaining at home connected to each other, and to their documentary heritage, the archives has developed the #ArchivesAtHome Toolkit. This online toolkit comprises collection highlights shared daily on its social media channels, virtual exhibitions, kids\u2019 activities, tips for amateur genealogists and information on how to safely preserve precious family documents, photos and videos.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T03:52:15.526Z\">at 4.52am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e82b9538f08af215f6fe8e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T03:31:34.536Z\">4.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A navy hospital ship with 1,000 beds has reached New York, which is struggling under the weight of critical Covid-19 cases.</p> \n  <p><strong>Hugh Jackman </strong>was among those waving it in.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/oyecomovapart2/status/1244643914423943168\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/USComfort?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#USComfort</a> \ud83d\udea2 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hospital?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Hospital</a> with 1000K beds arrive to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NewYork?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NewYork</a> \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/science?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#science</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/supplies?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#supplies</a> \ud83d\ude37\ud83d\ude37 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ventilators?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ventilators</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/3Dprinters?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#3Dprinters</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/technology?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#technology</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/USA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#USA</a> \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coronavirus</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pandemia?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Pandemia</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BreakingNews?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BreakingNews</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID2019?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID2019</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirusupdate?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coronavirusupdate</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/worldnews?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#worldnews</a><br> \ud83d\udcfd : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealHughJackman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RealHughJackman</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/2TAmcFNofV\">pic.twitter.com/2TAmcFNofV</a></p>\u2014 oyecomovapart2 (@oyecomovapart2) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oyecomovapart2/status/1244643914423943168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 30, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T03:33:54.880Z\">at 4.33am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e82b8738f08af215f6fe8df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T03:28:12.907Z\">4.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-the-national-cabinet-and-is-it-democratic-135036\">The Conversation has published a piece on the national cabinet</a> (which is just the council of Australian governments with a fancy war-timey name) by Griffith University\u2019s <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/jennifer-menzies-8509\">Jennifer Menzies</a>.</p> \n  <p>It appears to have been written for <strong>Naomi Wolf</strong>, but you may find some answers in there too. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T03:28:52.369Z\">at 4.28am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e82b7f48f0866297e9f3f92\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/calla-wahlquist\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T03:24:54.134Z\">4.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Victoria adds 96 cases, bringing total to 917</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Victoria has recorded <strong>another 96 cases of Covid-19, bringing the total to 917.</strong></p> \n  <p>The new cases include four children under five, bringing the number of pre-school-aged children to have tested positive in Victoria to five. </p> \n  <p>Nationally 14 children under five have tested positive to Covid-19.

His policy further requires tenants declare in writing that they can\u2019t pay due to Covid-19, and that they have documentation, which could be a hurdle for undocumented workers, people with non-traditional employment and those dealing with medical crises.</p> <p>It also does not stop landlords from moving forward with evictions for reasons other than non-payment, such as remodeling or taking a rental off the market.</p> <p>\u201cIt includes a lot of ways for tenants to trip up,\u201d said Michael Trujillo, staff attorney at the Law Foundation of Silicon Valley\u2019s housing program, adding, \u201cThe governor has the power right now to just prohibit all evictions.\u201d</p> <p>In a state where many workers have to divert a significant portion of their paychecks to rent, activists have called for a complete moratorium on evictions and foreclosures and a statewide suspension of rent, meaning a rent freeze or forgiveness so that tenants do not wind up with insurmountable debts.</p> <p>\u201cFor some, the decision is pay rent and starve, or don\u2019t pay rent and pay for food,\u201d said Chris Estrada, an organizer with the Los Angeles Center for Community Law and Action, which has fielded calls from dozens of tenants who don\u2019t have the cash to pay this week. For many others, he said, the reality is, \u201c\u2018If we pay April, will I starve in May?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In a city such as San Francisco, where the median rent for a one-bedroom is $3,479, paying retroactively will be impossible for many. \u201cIf six months later, I had a $20,000 debt waiting for me that I was expected to pay off right away, that would not be possible, especially after months of not having a stable paycheck,\u201d said Lupe Arreola, executive director of Tenants Together.</p> <p>The city of Oakland has passed what advocates said was the strongest protection in the state, with a <a href=\"https://www.berkeleyside.com/2020/03/27/oakland-passes-2-month-freeze-on-evictions-for-renters-and-small-business-owners\">moratorium</a> that prohibits all evictions and prevents late fees and rent hikes in the next two months. While tenants will owe back rent when the emergency is over, the ordinance prohibits landlords from evicting them because of non-payment during that time, a move meant to encourage payment plans. \u201cThis should be passed everywhere,\u201d said Leah Simon-Weisberg, an Oakland attorney, adding that she did not know a single tenant advocate in the state who supported Newsom\u2019s much weaker policy.</p> <p>LA\u2019s city council stopped short of passing a <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2020-03-27/coronavirus-newsom-eviction-ban-california\">complete ban</a> on evictions and requires tenants defend themselves against an eviction in court. The policy gives tenants a year to repay landlords. San Francisco also continues to <a href=\"https://missionlocal.org/2020/03/covid-19-san-francisco-and-state-eviction-moratoriums-dont-prevent-no-fault-evictions/\">allow</a> limited evictions.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is corporate landlords are already negotiating with their banks to figure out their mortgage situation and how to not pay,\u201d said Kenia Alcocer, 34, who will not be paying rent in East LA and is helping other tenants strike. \u201cWhy not us?

The state\u2019s roughly 400,000 agricultural workers are exempt from shelter-in-place orders, and vital agriculture work is continuing to keep markets stocked nationwide. Growers and labor contractors say they are putting new practices and measures in place to keep workers socially distanced and maintain sanitized common facilities.</p> <p>But workers and their advocates tell a different story: of vulnerable, low-wage workers operating in fear, without proper protections let alone information about the risks involved in their essential labor, and without hope of any share in expanded unemployment benefits should they fall ill or lose work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c9fd55d7f68f9aa1d3a59276b630cc53ba1fb1a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9fd55d7f68f9aa1d3a59276b630cc53ba1fb1a4/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Agricultural workers tend a field in the early morning hours.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Agricultural workers tend a field in the early morning hours.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Farm workers at risk</strong></h2> <p>America\u2019s farm workers have always done the essential work of feeding the nation for little reward and with few codified protections or benefits. Researchers and advocates estimate between 60% and 75% of California\u2019s more than 400,000 agricultural workers are undocumented. The United Farm Workers of America estimates only about 10,000 are unionized. An additional 20,000 are in California on H2A visas, a visa category that has seen some processing delays amid coronavirus shutdown orders.</p> <p>In March, as the coronavirus spread across the US and California ordered residents to stay at home, the United Farm Workers of America sent <a href=\"https://ufw.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID-19-2020-Open-Letter-from-UFW-FINAL.pdf\">an open letter</a> to agricultural employers calling for more sick pay, protections and information for workers in the fields.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we noted immediately was that workers were not being provided protections or information. [Growers are] not even trying. And that\u2019s gotten workers very scared,\u201d said Armando Elenes, secretary-treasurer of the United Farm Workers of America. \u201cThe last hands that touched that produce before the consumer puts it in their mouth is a farm worker\u2019s hands, so we better care about what happens to these workers.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed at the notion of growers voluntarily offering hazard pay to compensate for their new risks, as some frontline workers in other sectors have demanded. \u201cThe \u2018essential\u2019 part doesn\u2019t show up on their paycheck. They\u2019re lucky to get minimum wage,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re getting paid the same, yet they\u2019re exposing themselves to more dangers,\u201d said Irene de Barraicua, spokesperson for L\u00edderes Campesinas,<strong> </strong>an advocacy organization of and for California female farm workers.<strong> </strong>\u201cThere is no standard for safety orientation. Sometimes we\u2019re hearing they just get a five-minute talk \u2013 stay six feet apart, don\u2019t do this, don\u2019t do that \u2013 but they\u2019re working in big crowds.

For now, growers and farm labor contractors are doing it themselves.</p> <p>\u201cWe think that if you do what all the health experts have explained \u2013 if you can keep your social distance, if you can keep things sanitized, if you can keep sick people at home \u2013 we believe that people can work safely,\u201d said Lupe Sandoval, managing director of the California Farm Labor Contractor Association.</p> <p>The association is advising farm labor contractors on best practices to prevent viral spread. Sandoval said some of the contractors who serve as middlemen between farm workers and growers<em> </em>are spacing workers out in the fields and stepping up the sanitization of toilets, water jugs and rest break tables, while some are even considering \u201cbusting out the forehead thermometers\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of employers jumping through a lot of hoops right now trying to figure out how to make this happen properly,\u201d he said.</p> <p>With the more farming-intensive spring season about to set in, and a surge in Covid-19 cases expected statewide, there\u2019s a small and rapidly closing window to establish meaningful safety measures in the fields. An outbreak in the farm worker community would wreak havoc on an already strained food system. But there are currently no known coronavirus infections in California\u2019s agricultural community, said Sandoval, \u201cand we want to keep it that way\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6b74ce63700845a262d5371e433b7aa804b0c793\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b74ce63700845a262d5371e433b7aa804b0c793/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amparo Sanchez, a 73-year-old from Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, picks organic strawberries in Valley Center, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amparo Sanchez, a 73-year-old from Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, picks organic strawberries in Valley Center, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ariana Drehsler/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Sick workers</strong></h2> <p>Farm workers are an ageing labor force facing higher rates of respiratory disease and hypertension: all factors that would put them at greater risk for more deadly Covid-19 complications. And the masks that shield them from dust and pesticides, and that would also protect against the virus, are now in short supply for frontline workers across the world.</p> <p>If they are unfortunate enough to fall ill with Covid-19, farm workers would qualify for the additional sick leave provided through the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, the national legislation that expanded paid leave amid the Covid-19 crisis, but most would probably struggle to pay the resulting healthcare costs. Many farm workers have no health insurance.</p> <p>While Sandoval worries about workers who would abuse new, more abundant paid leave, Elenes of the United Farm Workers of America remains skeptical that workers will be able to utilize it at all.</p> <p>\u201cIn our experience, workers are ridiculed for even trying to use sick pay. They\u2019re asked if they have a doctor\u2019s note, but they don\u2019t even have healthcare. Or sometimes they just flat out deny them,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The disease and California\u2019s response to it have also added pressure to the social services farm workers rely on for routine care and support.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to fill the voids we\u2019re seeing on the ground for the individuals that are most at risk, which are farmworkers \u2013 individuals with chronic diseases, respiratory health illnesses,\u201d said Hernan Hernandez, executive director of the California Farmworkers Foundation. \u201cA lot of organizations have been pulling out of communities for the safety of their own staff. I want to make sure my staff are safe and secure, too. But this is not the time to hide behind your desk or at home, you\u2019ve got to be at the forefront. The situation is critical.\u201d</p> <p>The California Farmworker Foundation operates primarily in the state\u2019s Central Valley, an agricultural stronghold home to the nation\u2019s most productive farming counties and many thousands of vulnerable, low-wage farm workers. In response to Covid-19, the organization is launching a pop-up telemedicine clinic, increasing food distributions to farm worker communities, and partnering with growers to provide education on the virus at work sites.</p> <p>Hernandez is concerned that the loss of vital services could be just as dangerous to farm worker communities as the virus itself, especially if necessary routine medical care is reduced.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3e9b86a476d7bd1886c23a01d96d00dc1bc8e779\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e9b86a476d7bd1886c23a01d96d00dc1bc8e779/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Agriculture workers in Oxnard wear face masks as they pack celery for shipping.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Agriculture workers in Oxnard wear face masks as they pack celery for shipping.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brent Stirton/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Trickling </strong><strong>down</strong></h2> <p>Even as grocery stores struggle to keep shelves stocked, farm workers and their advocates worry their essential work could nonetheless dry up.</p> <p>\u201cEverything\u2019s slowing down, and it\u2019s going to trickle down in the next couple of weeks,\u201d said Hernandez. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see less work for farm workers.

And they don\u2019t really give them any notice,\u201d said De Barraicua.</p> <p>Growers maintain that overall, the food system is healthy,<strong> </strong>but the near total closure of food service in restaurants, event centers, office parks and college campuses has decimated business for some farms.</p> <p>\u201cThe foodservice sector represents roughly half of all fresh produce sales,\u201d said Cory Lunde, a spokesman for<strong> </strong>the Western Growers Association. \u201cWith the near-complete evaporation of this outlet for fresh produce, many growers in Arizona and California have seen their orders cancelled, or requests for delays in payment from their buyers.\u201d</p> <p>Farming logistics and existing supply chains leave many of these farmers with inventory rotting in cold storage or still stuck in the dirt.</p> <p>\u201cWe are concerned that while the larger operations may be better equipped to survive this market disruption, many of the smaller farms may be unable to absorb the financial shock,\u201d said Lunde.</p> <p>That shock is passed down to farm workers who are even less capable of absorbing it. In the case that they lose work, the undocumented majority of farm workers would not be eligible for expanded unemployment benefits or the one-time $1,200 payment from the federal government.</p> <p>Strawberry picker Amadeo Sumano lives with seven other people in an apartment, stoking his concerns about exposure to coronavirus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bfa6efe32ba30aeaae35be1f9ab3bbc756e022ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfa6efe32ba30aeaae35be1f9ab3bbc756e022ec/0_0_3170_2550/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Strawberries are ripe for picking.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"804\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Strawberries ripe for picking.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris O\u2019Meara/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI have lived and worked in this country for many years and paid taxes, but cannot access benefits,\u201d said Sumano. \u201cIf either working hours are cut or we contract the virus, we are likely to not be able to pay rent and would become homeless.\u201d</p> <p>While the coronavirus stimulus package contains billions to support agriculture businesses hit by Covid-19 shutdowns, there will be no bailout for the essential workers who still pick the nation\u2019s strawberries with their bare hands.</p>",

All the prisoners in \u201cisolation\u201d are sharing cells. Meals are brought to them and some report not being allowed out for showers.</p> \n<p>The measures form part of guidance <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-prisons-and-other-prescribed-places-of-detention-guidance\">issued to prisons last week</a> by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). \u201cIf facing multiple cases of those displaying symptoms, \u2018cohorting\u2019, or the gathering of potentially infected cases into a designated area, may be necessary,\u201d it reads.</p> \n<p>A source at HMP Wandsworth told the Guardian that there were no plans for further testing at the jail, and prisoners who display symptoms are instead being placed on the isolation wing. The source said 52 prisoners were now classified as \u201cinfected\u201d. Separately, they reported that D wing at the prison has had no hot water supply for a week.</p> \n<p>The revelation came as the Guardian learned that the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, was looking at releasing pregnant prisoners, amid growing concern about the vulnerability of inmates to the spread of coronavirus. It is understood that the government is not considering a larger-scale release of low-risk prisoners.</p> \n<p>An 84-year-old man became the first British prisoner to die after contracting coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/first-prisoner-in-uk-dies-from-coronavirus\">last week.</a> As of Sunday night, 2 prisoners had died from Covid-19, while 55 had tested positive. Thirteen prison staff had tested positive across seven prisons, while four Prisoner Escort and Custody Services staff had tested positive.</p> \n<p>The Prisoners Advice Service ( PAS) on Monday <a href=\"http://www.prisonersadvice.org.uk/compassionate-early-release-template-letter-to-download-and-use/\">published a template for prisoners</a> and their families to refer to in the event that they contracted coronavirus and needed to ask for release on compassionate grounds, under the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Current restrictions on legal aid means prisoners are unlikely to get free legal representation for such applications.</p> \n<p>Lubia Begum-Rob, the director of PAS, said placing prisoners who tested positive for coronavirus alongside those with only symptoms breached prison service guidelines, which state: \u201cAny prisoner or detainee with a new, continuous cough or a high temperature should be placed in protective isolation for seven days.\u201d</p> \n<p>She said: \u201cCohorting prisoners, because of multiple cases of inmates displaying symptoms, can only work in containing the virus if each prisoner is kept in his or her own cell.</p> \n<p>\u201cSuch prisoners should not be sharing a cell with another displaying symptoms, given that one prisoner may have the common flu and the other may have Covid-19.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b7a15541-85bf-49d3-9a7e-d239ccd804d7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/g3xoGpVF7R8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A report, published in 2018, found 15% of the prison population had respiratory issues.

There are about 1,700 prisoners over 70, with many in their 80s and a growing number over 90.</p> \n<p>Last week, the MoJ announced that all prison visits in England and Wales were cancelled until further notice. All prisoners are confined to their cells apart from cleaners, kitchen staff and other key prisoner workers.

Now you\u2019ve got your trainers on and your music pumping, you can have some fun. If you\u2019re a young buck, start running on the spot. If you\u2019re older, hold on to a chair or a work surface and bring your knees up and down in front of you. Now pretend you\u2019re sitting on the loo. Then it\u2019s time for squats! Lower yourself down, control your stomach, tighten your thigh muscles and squeeze it all in.</p> <p>For older people who aren\u2019t as active, sit straight-backed in a chair and imagine there\u2019s an orange between your shoulder blades.

But be sensible: if you aren\u2019t a regular exerciser, don\u2019t suddenly go mad on a programme. Ease in gently. There\u2019s no rush.

I\u2019m a big fan of getting them to learn their times tables \u2013 but not sitting down at a desk. Instead, sit or stand the children opposite each other and have them throw a ball to one another while doing their times tables. The person who gets the highest is the winner.</p> <p>The best bit of kit in your house is always a chair. Hold on to the back of it at waist height, and use it as you would a ballet barre.

Make sure you\u2019re sitting with a straight back. Hug each knee to your chest, then put it down. You can even grab some bags of sugar or bottles of water to use as light weights: sit on the edge of the chair and do biceps curls.</p> <p>On TV-am, I would always make a point of saying: \u201cClear your space.\u201d You don\u2019t want to hurt yourself.

This is different. Now we are training to not get ill. The stronger and fitter you are, the more likely you will be to fight coronavirus off, and your recovery time will be shorter. You are less likely to end up in an intensive care unit bed, and if you do end up in one, more likely to get out of it sooner \u2013 freeing it up for someone else. So try to do something.</p> <p>There\u2019s another good reason to exercise, which is that humans are inherently social animals. We depend on other people for our happiness, our wellbeing, advice and reassurance. Right now, we\u2019re cut off from other people. So exercise is crucial to maintaining mental health. </p> <p>If you can, leave the house regularly and go for walks, but stay away from other people.

It\u2019s when you admit older people to hospital, and they stay in bed all day in their pyjamas. It\u2019s really bad for them: they lose muscle mass fast. So getting dressed in the morning is a good start.</p> <p>Walk up and down your stairs five times. If you have a garden, buy a skipping rope online and go outside and skip. Find a fitness YouTuber you like the look of, and copy their videos. It\u2019s so easy to get caught up in the technical aspects of exercise: how much should I be doing and what should my heart rate be? Do I need the advice of a doctor? But it\u2019s not complicated \u2013 just aim to get out of breath for a few minutes every day. That\u2019s it.</p> <p>If you can, do a simple circuit of press-ups, sit-ups and squats. I stand by the view that something is much better than nothing: one press-up is better than none, and five are better than one. If you don\u2019t know where to start, look up the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMGQzMjeO1k\">Royal Canadian Air Force exercises</a>. They were devised in the 1950s, and are just as relevant today. It\u2019s a great set of movements.</p>",
  "<p>The coronavirus epidemic is \u201cfar from over\u201d in the Asia-Pacific region, and current measures to curb the spread of the virus are buying time for countries to prepare for large-scale community transmissions, a WHO official has said.</p> <p>Even with all the measures, the risk of transmission in the region will not go away as long as the pandemic continues, said Takeshi Kasai, regional director for the western Pacific at the World Health Organization.</p> <p>His warning came as the World Bank said the economic fallout of the pandemic could drive large parts of east Asia into poverty, and as the United States recorded its deadliest day yet, with another 540 deaths taking its fatalities past 3,000.</p> <p>\u201cLet me be clear.

For post-riot-grrrl rock beast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/sleater-kinney\">Sleater-Kinney</a>, that noise reached its peak with their fourth album, 1999\u2019s The Hot Rock \u2013 their saddest, strangest record, and absolutely nobody\u2019s idea of a commercial grab \u2013 likely because their reputation had built to the point that it became their first album to break the US Top 200.</p> <p>While its follow-up was not about to do battle with Britney and Christina for chart supremacy, All Hands on the Bad One is the Pacific Northwest trio\u2019s most accessible record \u2013 poppy, surfy and possessed of utterly alluring girl-gang cool \u2013 and one where they use the idea of accessibility to subversive and provocative ends. They question their male peers (The Ballad of a Ladyman; Male Model), gatekeeping critics (The Professional) and culture at large about who gets to belong, and who sets those terms: in #1 Must Have, Corin Tucker appears to wail from amid thrashing waves about how girl power appropriated the feminist movement that forged her in Olympia, and laments the return of machismo to rock following Woodstock 99, where several women were gang-raped.</p> <p>Tucker and Carrie Brownstein share songwriting and vocal duties on every Sleater-Kinney record, but on AHOTBO, the spotlight thoroughly belongs to Tucker, showcasing her forlorn gospel vibrato (the remarkably prescient Was It a Lie?, about how real-life violence got turned into entertainment), cheeky pop agility (You\u2019re No Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Fun) and acid mockery (Youth Decay). This vigorous, hilarious, provocative record is not only their best, but an all-time rock great.</p> <h2>The three to check out next</h2> <p><strong>Dig Me Out (Kill Rock Stars, 1997)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti1liRM6cao\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ti1liRM6cao?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Sleater Kinney: Dig Me Out \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s hard not to think that the arrival of Janet Weiss, the band\u2019s drummer of 22 years, had something to do with Sleater-Kinney\u2019s third album being their first great one. The beat throughout most of Dig Me Out is relentless, a kind of monomaniacally focused tunnelling that practically causes you to vibrate while listening. Weiss provides the skeleton for Tucker and Brownstein\u2019s songwriting to become indelible, drawing on the pop rigour they dabbled in with I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone from the previous year\u2019s Call the Doctor to write a fairly ridiculous amount of iconic songs. Little Babies and Words and Guitar tap into a similar power-pop vein (while smartly addressing the roles culturally pre- and proscribed for women), while lone ballad One More Hour documents the end of Tucker and Brownstein\u2019s brief romantic relationship, an indie heartbreak anthem as devastating as Yeah Yeah Yeahs\u2019 Maps.</p> <p><strong>The Woods (Sub Pop, 2005)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZA_7FtttRY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vZA_7FtttRY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Sleater-Kinney: Jumpers \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone, Words and Guitar, You\u2019re No Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Fun: Sleater-Kinney had been writing about their existence as rock stars outside of the traditional rock canon since practically day one. On The Woods, their first album for Sub Pop, they storm the barricades, employing Dave Fridmann to produce this steaming, swaggering hard-rock opus indebted to Hendrix and Zeppelin. On Entertain, Brownstein (for this time it\u2019s her record) spits venom at a new wave of boys in bands content to dabble in post-punk cosplay: \u201cWhere\u2019s the \u2018fuck you\u2019? Where\u2019s the black and blue?\u201d she screams. (Later in the song, Tucker\u2019s \u201cWUH UH OH!\u201d rings out like the blinding flash that follows a nuclear explosion.) Sleater-Kinney\u2019s homage is different: subverted not only by the fact that they\u2019re women staging a sit-in of the canon, but by the incandescent fury of their songwriting, whether on The Fox \u2013 an allegory for Bush-era warmongering \u2013 or Modern Girl, Brownstein\u2019s sweet-sour assessment of how society warps and mollifies female desire.</p> <p><strong>The Center Won\u2019t Hold (Mom + Pop, 2019)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5uAH0vNn2s\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E5uAH0vNn2s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Sleater-Kinney: Hurry on Home \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The unwitting centre of a storm, The Center Won\u2019t Hold was made by a trio but released by a duo after Weiss quit during the album\u2019s promotional cycle, citing divergent directions. The presence of St Vincent as producer, plus the encroachment of synthesisers and industrial textures into the band\u2019s sound, stirred up another ridiculous debate about the authenticity of Tucker and Brownstein\u2019s intentions for their ninth album. As the debacle recedes into the past, this epic, expansive record can stand on its own: Tucker\u2019s songs, written in the midst of a depression following the loss of her day job and the state of the world, are her most desperate and forlorn since Sympathy, the coda to 2002\u2019s One Beat about her premature son\u2019s fight for survival; while Brownstein sounds savage, riled up (Hurry on Home) and broken (The Dog/The Body) by betrayals both personal and political.</p> <h2>One for the heads</h2> <p><strong>The Hot Rock (Kill Rock Stars, 1999)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9MA4rFNf7I\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d9MA4rFNf7I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Sleater-Kinney: Get Up \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/28/sleater-kinney-the-center-wont-hold-interview\">Sleater-Kinney: \u2018Music has always been the playground of men\u2019s sexuality\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Supremely underrated, The Hot Rock contains a few anguished punk ragers (Start Together, The End of You, Banned From the End of the World) but it\u2019s the only Sleater-Kinney album primarily made up of softer, sadder songs.

This could be the moment for its downfall | Melissa Benn</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Business rate relief for private schools has become controversial in recent years, with the Scottish government taking the radical step to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-50665658\">abolish it</a> from September 2020 and moves in England, announced in the recent budget, to review it.</p> \n<p>It was after a particularly gruelling budget-setting meeting in 2017 that Lisgo\u2019s colleague Steve Ross, an independent councillor, hit on the idea of asking the four local private schools \u2013 Taunton school, Wellington school, Somerset, King\u2019s College Taunton and Queen\u2019s College Taunton \u2013 each to contribute 10% of their business rate relief. This would provide an overall sum of around \u00a3100,000, out of a rate relief saving of near on \u00a31m, to a community fund that would support libraries, children\u2019s services and other local projects. They put the idea to the council and proposed <a href=\"https://schoolsweek.co.uk/council-launches-investigation-into-benefits-of-private-schools/\">tightening up</a> council scrutiny of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/may/10/private-schools-charitable-status\">public benefit</a>\u201d offered by the schools, their duty under the 2006 Charities Act.</p> \n<p>Conservative-controlled Taunton Deane voted down the proposal. Councillors, many of whom had links to the area\u2019s private schools, instead suggested opening up a \u201cdialogue\u201d with the four schools. Sadly, says Lisgo, that never happened.</p> \n<p>Recently, Lisgo saw her chance to have another go, after the merger of Taunton Deane with neighbouring West Somerset to create Somerset West and Taunton, now under Liberal Democrat control.</p> \n<p>Armed with what she calls her \u201coven-ready idea\u201d, she was more optimistic. \u201cIf austerity was very much on our minds in 2017, it is even more so three years down the line,\u201d she says. This time her motion also proposed the establishment of \u201ca joint consultative body\u201d to explore providing \u201cvolunteering and financial support to our neediest communities\u201d.</p> \n<p>Once again the motion failed. \u201cOne reason put forward by the councillors was that the finances of the local independent schools are on a knife edge,\u201d she says. Lisgo found this hard to take seriously given that \u201cone school has recently hosted <a href=\"https://issuu.com/taunton_school/docs/taunton_alumni_community_final_textured_cover\">receptions in Hong Kong</a>, Dubai and Los Angeles\u201d, with more global events planned. \u201cAnd we are asking for a token amount really: \u00a325,000 each, less than the average cost of a single boarding place.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1ec9e624-fb4c-47a5-a6f9-f3f36fb6bf53\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pN36jVSp1x0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Francis Green, the educational economist and co-author of Engines of Privilege: Britain\u2019s Private School Problem, shares Lisgo\u2019s disappointment. \u201cOne can\u2019t help thinking that the local private schools may have missed a trick here, a chance to earn some goodwill for the long run. Rather than take this low-cost opportunity to transparently discharge their obligation to provide some public benefit, they and their supporters in council have preferred to stick to their legal rights as charities.\u201d</p> \n<p>Undeterred, Lisgo, branded a <a href=\"https://www.somersetcountygazette.co.uk/news/18271547.taunton-councillor-branded-marxist-indepedent-school-donation-plans/\">\u201cMarxist\u201d</a> in one local newspaper headline, is now inviting other councils to have a go \u2013 \u201cmaybe a Labour-controlled council with a reasonable number of independent schools in their area\u201d.</p> \n<p>Will others take it up? Julie Robinson, of the Independent Schools Council, says: \u201cIt is not the role of local councils to regulate local charities or decide how charitable funds are spent. Charities must apply their assets and funds to their primary purpose as stated in their objects. In the case of schools, that is education.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/31/private-education-must-go-westminster-school-melissa-benn\">I returned to my father\u2019s school to say why private education must go</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But opinion may be shifting. In the recent budget, the government announced a review of business rates and the <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/private-schools-100m-rates-relief-at-risk-6z5mnplw2\">Independent Schools Association</a>, which promotes the charitable objectives of private schools, is now warning the sector that business rate relief may not survive beyond 2021. More broadly, there is a widespread sense across the political spectrum that the resources gap between private and state schools is unacceptably wide and reform is necessary. This makes voluntary contributions look like a moderate step rather than an extreme proposal.</p> \n<p>The Conservative-controlled <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/extra-contributions-from-the-rich-are-working-in-westminster-ls6p2hgx6\">Westminster</a> council is currently asking householders in properties worth more than \u00a310m (council tax band H) to contribute a small sum to local services, and has so far raised \u00a3900,000 through this \u201cunofficial mansion tax\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/millionaire-residents-asked-to-pay-mansion-tax-towards-council-services-a4074051.html\">Kensington and Chelsea</a> and <a href=\"https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/surrey-news/surrey-residents-asked-volunteer-pay-17691271\">Surrey</a> councils have implemented similar plans.</p> \n<p>Mark Lehain, a free school founder and Conservative party candidate in the last election, says Lisgo\u2019s plan is an interesting idea but that private schools would need to have \u201ccontrol over how the funds were used to make sure they were for educational purposes\u201d.</p> \n<p>Many in Labour local government dislike the voluntary angle. Steven Longden, a Trafford councillor and co-founder of the campaign Abolish Eton, thinks going down this route merely \u201cgives private schools good PR. Do we really want the voluntary crumbs off their table? No, I want legislation to remove their privileges and tax exemptions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Succeed or fail, the proposal has created a useful mobilising tool. Historically, the political conversation around the private-state divide has tended to be about national inequalities: all those privately educated judges and journalists and old Etonian prime ministers.</p> \n<p>But Lisgo\u2019s initiative brings the issue back down to local earth, shining a spotlight on the vastly discrepant provision often found within a single area. \u201cA lot of people locally have said to me, \u2018I didn\u2019t realise that these schools were charities \u2013 and you mean that they don\u2019t pay business rates like everyone else?\u201d\u2019</p> \n<p> Lisgo remains upbeat. \u201cI have had so many conversations around the proposal. People think it is a jolly good idea. If we had genuinely begun to initiate that dialogue between our schools and the council, things might look different. I still struggle to understand why we can\u2019t make use of those minibuses parked on the other side of the fence.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A failure to invest more in the nursing workforce has put the NHS on the \u201cbackfoot\u201d in combating Covid-19, according to Dame Christine Beasley, a former chief nursing officer (CNO) who now serves as a trustee at the <a href=\"https://www.btfn.org.uk/\">Burdett Trust for Nursing</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe numbers sort of speak for themselves really, don\u2019t they?\u201d says Beasley of the endemic shortage of nurses that has left the NHS vulnerable at a time of crisis.

This \u201cabsolutely demonstrates what we\u2019ve been saying for a long time\u201d, she says.</p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>I don\u2019t think you could ever say that we could get all the people we need for a pandemic, but it has put us more on the backfoot than we might have been if there\u2019d been the proper investment.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>No matter if you\u2019re a cross between Mother Teresa and the Angel Gabriel, you\u2019re not going to be able to sustain day after day of 12-14 shifts</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Figures show that nursing has lagged behind other NHS staff groups over the past decade, with the workforce <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2020-0037/\">growing by just 6.2%</a> between November 2010 and November 2019, compared with 20.6% for hospital doctors, for example.</p> <p>Beasley, who is also chair of the London region of Health Education England<strong>, </strong>points to the fact that the pace of growth has stepped up in recent months. </p> <p>But while figures show an <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2020-0037/\">increase in nurses of 3% between November 2018 </a><a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2020-0037/\">and November 2019</a>, the fact remains that the nursing vacancy rate for England totalled <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2020-0037/\">38,</a><a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2020-0037/\">785 in December 2019</a>. \u201cIn order to deliver modern healthcare \u2013 however you look at it \u2013 and keep people safe, you can\u2019t do it without nurses; they\u2019re pretty critical,\u201d says Beasley. \u201cThis will give us a big impetus to demonstrate that as we begin to learn from what happens with this virus and what we need to do to keep our health service fit for purpose.\u201d</p> <p>Beasley, whose tenure as the government\u2019s chief nurse between 2004 and 2012 straddled the party political switch from New Labour to the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, cites several reasons for the shortage: <a href=\"https://www.nursingtimes.net/roles/nurse-educators/exclusive-disaster-warning-follows-12-drop-in-nurse-training-places-18-09-2012/\">cuts in nurse training places</a> early on in the coalition; the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2UnW5R0\">abolition of nursing bursaries in 2016</a>, which covered university tuition fees as well as providing means-tested maintenance support; an <a href=\"https://www.nursinginpractice.com/professional/nurse-NMC-ageing-workforce\">ageing workforce</a>; and the<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/24/nhs-winter-crisis-thousands-eu-staff-quit\">haemorrhaging of EU nurses</a>. She also mentions poor retention as a significant factor. Figures show that <a href=\"https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/national-retention-programme-two-years-on/\">turnover is still running at just under 12% a year</a>. \u201cAll of that meant that we were in difficulties before this pandemic came along.\u201d</p> <p>Knowing that something needed to be done about nursing numbers, Boris Johnson made an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/24/will-a-conservative-government-deliver-50000-more-nurses\">election pledge for 50,000 more nurses</a> by 2024-25. But the shine soon came off amid accusations of double counting when it emerged that over a third of the figure factored nurses already in the job. </p> <p>Although the government announced an <a href=\"https://www.rcn.org.uk/news-and-events/news/uk-student-grant-response-181219\">annual grant of at least \u00a35,000</a> for healthcare students, which will kick in <a href=\"https://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/nhs-bursary#Funding_NHS_bursary_ENGLAND\">from September 2020</a>, critics say this doesn\u2019t go far enough since <a href=\"https://www.unison.org.uk/news/2019/11/government-must-abolish-tuition-fees-health-trainees-says-unison/\">tuition fee costs</a> will remain a barrier for many. </p> <p>That was before Covid-19 overtook events and it was all hands on deck. To help cope with the crisis, final-year nursing students in England have been asked to join the ranks, and a call-out for experienced hands has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/ex-nhs-staff-rejoin-workforce-coronavirus-outbreak\">5,605 former nurses and midwives</a> come back. It\u2019s a sensible move and one that Beasley very much welcomes, but she doubts that the former nurses coming to help with the pandemic intend to return permanently.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/im-very-nervous-student-nurses-on-the-frontline-against-covid-19\">'I'm very nervous': student nurses on the frontline against Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s down to the government to invest better financial support for nursing students and a more conducive environment for staff already in the workplace, says Beasley.

She also makes the case for the need for nursing practice to change so that we can \u201cmake the most of the nurses that we have\u201d. This means allowing nurses to work to the top of their proficiency, supported by other colleagues such as nursing associates and healthcare assistants, and expecting more patients to manage their own health, including using basic technology. \u201cIt\u2019s happening in parts of the health service, but we need to push that much more.\u201d</p> <p>Beasley completed her own nurse training as far back as 1965, yet her interest in nursing shows no sign of waning. Since retiring as chief nursing officer, she has held a number of non-executive posts, and has been a trustee of the Burdett Trust for Nursing for nine years.</p> <p>The charity, which grants funding to support nurse-led innovation, is also responsible for footing the \u00a3500,000 core costs for<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.who.int/hrh/news/2018/nursing_now_campaign/en/\">Nursing Now</a> \u2013 a three-year global campaign to raise the profile and status of nursing worldwide, which concludes at the end of this year. </p> <p>Beasley says the battle against Covid-19 highlights the combination of technical skills and the \u201chuman touch\u201d that nursing provides. <strong>\u201c</strong>This is a really good, but rather sad and awful, example [that] showcases what nurses can do to contribute to containing and looking after people who get sick through a<strong> </strong>pandemic.\u201d</p> <p>The year 2020 is proving quite the moment for nursing: it has been designated the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/campaigns/year-of-the-nurse-and-the-midwife-2020\">International Year of the Nurse and Midwife</a> by the World Health Organization to coincide with the <a href=\"https://www.florence-nightingale.co.uk/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwyPbzBRDsARIsAFh15JYTxWq0yKz_Hi1_rGc8bBejk5BR9eNeIw1wZIslPFBpo0I8NWKHmMcaAuWDEALw_wcB\">bicentenary of Florence Nightingale </a>\u2013 the pioneer of modern nursing who first identified handwashing as key to infection control.</p> <p>As chief nurse, Beasley pressed home the importance of clean hands during the battle against hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/nov/10/nhsstaff.health\">early noughties</a>. The initiative was very much nurse-led, she says. </p> <p>\u201cMost doctors didn\u2019t believe that it could really make any difference to MRSA because it was a byproduct of modern medicine, and consequently they slightly stepped aside,\u201d Beasley recalls. \u201cObviously they then came on board.\u201d She is pleased that awareness about handwashing, and the use of sanitisers in hospitals in battling infection are now the norm. But they are only part of the story in tackling the latest bug on the block.</p> <p>There is a \u201cbig challenge\u201d in getting testing kits and protective equipment to hospitals to keep staff safe. \u201cThe equipment is getting through, but that needs to be sustained and it needs to be done faster.\u201d</p> <p>Health and safety also means that staff should not be doing 12-14 hour shifts \u201cday after day after day\u201d.

Four per cent of infected people in their 40s needed hospital treatment, as did more than 8% of patients in their 50s. More than 18% of those in their 80s and above needed hospitalisation after catching the virus. Only 0.04% of 10 to 19-year-olds had to go into hospital if infected.</p> \n<p>The analysis found that while the overall death rate for confirmed cases was 1.38% it rose sharply with age, from 0.0016% in the under 10s to 7.8% in those 80 and over. The study reported in Lancet Infectious Diseases was based on analysis of 70,117 laboratory-confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases in mainland China, combined with 689 positive cases among people repatriated from Wuhan. The number of deaths related to coronavirus in the US has passed 3,000, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. Meanwhile today marks a week of no new cases reported in Wuhan city, China, where the outbreak first emerged. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US is almost double those in China.

  "<p>The coronavirus pandemic has forced questions of life and death to the fore around the world. National health infrastructures risk being overwhelmed, food supply chains are struggling to keep up with stockpiling, and restrictions on movement are enforcing social distancing. Worries about loved ones and fears for the future combine with outbreaks of neighbourliness and solidarity.</p> <p>The questions about who is \u2013 or should be \u2013 responsible for mitigating the crisis and addressing its worst effects are being raised urgently. For many this is the new reality. But for those in conflict zones, such as Yemen, basic survival has long been the pressing preoccupation.</p> <p>March marks the fifth anniversary of the Saudi-led coalition\u2019s intervention in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/07/yemen-heads-list-of-countries-facing-worst-humanitarian-disasters-in-2020\">war in Yemen</a>.</p> <p>Five years of attacks on hospitals and other healthcare facilities, on schools, markets and other public buildings: attacks in which the Saudi-led coalition is responsible for the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-35842708\">highest number of civilian </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-35842708\">casualties</a>.

Imagine the UK\u2019s doctors and nurses, on the frontline of treating coronavirus, being bombed while they work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/07/yemen-heads-list-of-countries-facing-worst-humanitarian-disasters-in-2020\">Yemen heads list of countries facing worst humanitarian disasters in 2020</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Five years of war and economic blockade have created <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/25/famine-in-yemen-could-become-one-of-worst-in-living-memory-un-says\">famine </a>and a public health crisis. The vast majority of Yemenis have no reliable access to food, because fighting and the economic blockade prevent shipments getting through, and people cannot afford to pay the rocketing prices. Yemen is also experiencing the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/oct/12/yemen-cholera-outbreak-worst-in-history-1-million-cases-by-end-of-year\">worst cholera outbreak </a>since modern records began.</p> <p>Yemen does not \u2013 as yet \u2013 have any recorded cases of Covid-19 . But add the prospect of a pandemic to its existing public health crisis and you add another stressor to a situation that is already untenable.</p> <p>As we in the UK try to forge social solidarity and reciprocity within our communities, we would do well to consider our country\u2019s role in far-away crises such as that in Yemen. As coronavirus dominates the news, other topics fall even further down the agenda for public attention.</p> <p>But the war in Yemen remains active, with a recent escalation in hostilities after a few months of relative calm. And the UK is intimately involved in the war: through the provision of weapons, military training and support, and diplomatic cover for the Saudi-led coalition. Without the support of the UK, and Saudi Arabia\u2019s primary supporter, the US, the war would have to end.</p> <p>The UK government\u2019s arms export policy made headline news in June 2019 when the court of appeal found it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jun/20/uk-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia-for-use-in-yemen-declared-unlawful\">to be unlawful </a>because the government had not properly assessed risks associated with weapons sales to Saudi Arabia. Since then, the government has committed to not issuing any new licences for exports to the coalition, but is allowing already-registered companies to continue exporting. The overall effect is to permit the ongoing supply of weapons to the coalition whilst also claiming to act in the spirit of the law.</p> <p>It has batted away questions from concerned MPs, repeating the canard that the UK has one of the most robust arms export control regimes in the world. It has not yet concluded the process required of it by the court of appeal, to retake past decisions, this time lawfully. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33c782bda15eeda3d0d3973db0b955a958427400\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33c782bda15eeda3d0d3973db0b955a958427400/0_0_3500_2288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dust rises from the site of a Saudi-led air strike in Sana\u2019a, Yemen, on 30 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saudi-led air strikes have targeted civilians and hospitals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Khaled Abdullah/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One key feature of the way the government is handling the arms export controversy has something in common with its response to the coronavirus pandemic: a desire not to know.</p> <p>With Covid-19, the UK has lagged behind other countries in rolling out testing. This has kept the number of confirmed cases artificially low. Such political expediency seems central to how the government has managed questions of responsibility and action in relation to the pandemic.</p> <p>With its policy on arms exports, the Ministry of Defence has failed to keep track of whether Saudi-led coalition attacks might have constituted a violation of international law. As a result, by claiming not to know whether attacks have been unlawful, the government can allege there is no clear risk that weapons will be misused \u2013 and hence no reason to halt exports. This refusal to track the use of weapons in the war is central to how the government continues to support the Saudi-led coalition while claiming to uphold international law.</p> <p>However, as with coronavirus, not knowing about a problem doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not there; and doesn\u2019t exempt the government from responsibility.</p> <p><em>Anna Stavrianakis is a </em><em>professor of </em><em>international </em><em>relations at the University of Sussex</em></p>",

We refresh the news not because of a civic sense that following the news is important, but because so much may have happened since the last refresh. These developments are coming so fast that it\u2019s hard to remember just how radical they are.</p> \n<p>Cast your mind back a few weeks and imagine someone telling you the following: within a month, schools will be closed. Almost all public gatherings will be cancelled. Hundreds of millions of people around the world will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-unemployment-rate-coronavirus-business\" title=\"\">out of work</a>. Governments will be throwing together some of the largest economic stimulus packages in history. In certain places, landlords will not be collecting rent, or banks collecting mortgage payments, and the homeless will be allowed to stay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/uk-hotels-homeless-shelters-coronavirus\" title=\"\">in hotels</a> free of charge. Experiments will be underway in the direct government provision of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/universal-basic-income\" title=\"\">basic income</a>. Large swathes of the world will be collaborating \u2013 with various degrees of coercion and nudging \u2013 on a shared project of keeping at least two metres between each other whenever possible. Would you have believed what you were hearing?</p> \n<p>It\u2019s not just the size and speed of what is happening that\u2019s dizzying. It\u2019s the fact that we have grown accustomed to hearing that democracies are incapable of making big moves like this quickly, or at all. But here we are. Any glance at history reveals that crises and disasters have continually set the stage for change, often for the better. The global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/06/worst-case-thinking-prevent-pandemics-coronavirus-existential-risk\" title=\"\">flu epidemic of 1918</a> helped create national health services in many European countries. The twinned crises of the Great Depression and the second world war set the stage for the modern welfare state.</p> \n<p>But crises can also send societies down darker paths. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, government surveillance of citizens exploded, while George W Bush launched new wars that stretched into indefinite occupations. (As I write this, the US military\u2019s current attempt at reducing its troop presence in Afghanistan, 19 years after the invasion, is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/world/asia/coronavirus-withdrawal-afghanistan.html\" title=\"\">being slowed</a> by coronavirus-related complications.) Another recent crisis, the 2008 financial crash, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-crisis-change-world-financial-global-capitalism\" title=\"\">resolved</a> in a way that meant banks and financial institutions were restored to pre-crash normality, at great public cost, while government spending on public services across the world was slashed.</p> \n<p>Because crises shape history, there are hundreds of thinkers who have devoted their lives to studying how they unfold. This work \u2013 what we might call the field of \u201ccrisis studies\u201d \u2013 charts how, whenever crisis visits a given community, the fundamental reality of that community is laid bare. Who has more and who has less. Where the power lies. What people treasure and what they fear.</p> \n<p>In such moments, whatever is broken in society gets revealed for just how broken it is, often in the form of haunting little images or stories. In recent weeks, the news has furnished us with countless examples. Airlines are flying large numbers of empty or near-<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/10/eu-airlines-ghost-flights-coronavirus-fightback-airport-landing-rules-empty-planes\" title=\"\">empty flights</a> for the sole purpose of protecting their slots on prime sky routes. There have been <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20200321-french-police-accused-of-fining-homeless-people-amid-virus-lockdown\" title=\"\">reports</a> of French police fining homeless people for being outside during the lockdown. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/09/new-york-is-making-hand-sanitizer-with-prison-labor.html\" title=\"\">Prisoners</a> in New York state are getting paid less than a dollar per hour to bottle hand sanitiser that they themselves are not allowed to use (because it contains alcohol), in a prison where they are not given free soap, but must buy it in an on-site shop.</p> \n<p>But disasters and emergencies do not just throw light on the world as it is. They also rip open the fabric of normality. Through the hole that opens up, we glimpse possibilities of other worlds. Some thinkers who study disasters focus more on all that might go wrong. Others are more optimistic, framing crises not just in terms of what is lost but also what might be gained. Every disaster is different, of course, and it\u2019s never just one or the other: loss and gain always coexist. Only in hindsight will the contours of the new world we\u2019re entering become clear. </p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>The pessimistic view is that a crisis makes bad things worse. People who study disasters \u2013 and especially pandemics \u2013 know all too well their tendency to inflame xenophobia and racial scapegoating. When the Black Death came to Europe in the 14th century, cities and towns shut themselves to outsiders \u2013 and assaulted, banished and killed \u201cundesirable\u201d community members, most often Jews. In 1858, a mob in New York City broke into a quarantine hospital for immigrants on Staten Island, demanded that everyone leave and then burned the hospital down, fearful that it was putting people outside at risk of yellow fever. Wikipedia now has a page collating examples from more than 35 countries of \u201cxenophobia and racism related to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic\u201d: they range from taunts to outright assault.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn a totally rational world, you might assume that an international pandemic would lead to greater internationalism,\u201d says the historian Mike Davis, a renowned American chronicler of the disasters incubated by globalisation. For Davis, who wrote <a href=\"https://thenewpress.com/books/monster-our-door\" title=\"\">a book</a> about the threat of avian flu in 2005, pandemics are a perfect example of the kind of crises to which global capitalism (with its constant movement of people and goods) is particularly vulnerable, but that the capitalist mindset (with its inability to think in terms beyond profit) cannot address. \u201cIn a rational world, we would be ramping up production of basic essential supplies \u2013 test kits, masks, respirators \u2013 not only for our own use, but for poorer countries, too. Because it\u2019s all one battle. But it\u2019s not necessarily a rational world. So there could be a lot of demonisation and calls for isolation. Which will mean more deaths and more suffering worldwide.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the US, President Trump has tried hard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\" title=\"\">to brand</a> the new coronavirus as inherently \u201cChinese\u201d, and to use the pandemic as a pretext for tightening borders and accepting fewer asylum seekers. Republican officials, thinktanks and media outlets have <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/republican-xenophobia-coronavirus-pandemic/\" title=\"\">claimed or implied</a> that Covid-19 is a man-made Chinese bioweapon. Some Chinese officials, in turn, have pushed the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-china-conspiracy-theory.html\" title=\"\">conspiracy theory</a> that the outbreak came to China by way of American soldiers. In Europe, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, recently announced: \u201cWe are fighting a two-front war: one front is called migration, and the other one belongs to the coronavirus. There is a logical connection between the two, as both spread with movement.\u201d</p> \n<p>When you\u2019re fighting a war, you want to know as much about the enemy as possible. But it\u2019s easy, in the rush of crisis, to put in place surveillance tools without thinking about the long-term harm they might do. The scholar Shoshana Zuboff, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/02/age-of-surveillance-capitalism-shoshana-zuboff-review\" title=\"\">author of</a> The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, reminded me that, prior to 9/11, the US government had been in the process of developing serious regulations designed to give web users real choice about how their personal information was and wasn\u2019t used. \u201cIn the course of a few days,\u201d Zuboff says, \u201cthe concern shifted from \u2018How do we regulate these companies that are violating privacy norms and rights\u2019 to \u2018How do we nurture and protect these companies so they can collect data for us?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>For governments looking to monitor their citizens even more closely, and companies looking to get rich by doing the same, it would be hard to imagine a more perfect crisis than a global pandemic. In China today, drones search for people without facemasks; when they are found, the drones\u2019 built-in speakers <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/01/coronavirus-watch-drones-scold-maskless-civilians-in-china.html\" title=\"\">broadcast scoldings</a> from police.

Lockdowns have made many of us, sitting at home glued to our computers and phones, more dependent than ever on big tech companies. Many of these same companies are actively pitching themselves to government as a vital part of the solution. It is worth asking what they stand to gain. \u201cPeople have a hard time remembering privacy rights when they\u2019re trying to deal with something like a pandemic,\u201d says Vasuki Shastry, a Chatham House fellow who studies the interplay of technology and democracy. \u201cOnce a system gets scaled up, it can be very difficult to scale it back down. And then maybe it takes on other uses.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the space of a few weeks, the prime ministers of both Israel and Hungary have effectively been given the power to rule by decree, without interference from courts or legislature. Meanwhile, the UK\u2019s recently rolled-out coronavirus bill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-suspects-may-be-detained-under-uk-emergency-powers\" title=\"\">gives police</a> and immigration officers the authority \u2013 in place for the next two years \u2013 to arrest and detain people suspected of carrying the virus, so that they can be tested. The US Department of Justice has, since the outbreak began, filed <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/doj-suspend-constitutional-rights-coronavirus-970935/\" title=\"\">a request</a> with Congress for a new rule that would allow judges to suspend courtroom proceedings in emergencies, creating the possibility of people being jailed without ever being able to formally object. \u201cThose of us who follow the police know how this goes,\u201d said Kevin Blowe of Netpol, a UK group focused on protest rights. \u201cThese powers get put in place, and it sounds reasonable enough at the time \u2013 and then very quickly they\u2019re applied for other purposes that have nothing to do with democracy and nothing to do with public safety.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a 2008 <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/report/pandemic-preparedness-need-public-health-not-law-enforcementnational-security-approach?redirect=cpredirect/33642\" title=\"\">report</a> on the legal aspects of pandemic response, prompted by the increase in pandemic flu outbreaks, a team of historians and medical ethicists assembled by the American Civil Liberties Union bemoaned a common tendency \u2013 resurgent, in their view, since 9/11 \u2013 for government to address public health problems using mindsets more appropriate to tracking down criminals. This suspicious mindset, they argued, ended up most affecting racial minorities and the poor. Tactics like these can make fighting the disease harder, by driving a hard wedge of distrust between government and citizens. As the report put it: \u201cPeople, rather than the disease, become the enemy.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4af07576-d7aa-4d4c-98dc-13da3ec13aef\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RnTfvrhJs88?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>There\u2019s another school of thought that looks at crisis and sees glimmers of possibility. For thinkers in this camp, the example of the 2008 financial crash looms large. But where, from their view, 2008 led to defeat \u2013 with the broad public giving up a great deal while a small few profited \u2013 Covid-19 might open the door to political progress<strong>.</strong></p> \n<p>\u201cI think we\u2019re just so different to how we were before we saw the aftermath of the 2008 crash,\u201d said the American writer Rebecca Solnit, one of today\u2019s most eloquent investigators of crises and their implications. \u201cIdeas that used to be seen as leftwing seem more reasonable to more people. There\u2019s room for change that there wasn\u2019t beforehand. It\u2019s an opening.\u201d</p> \n<p>The argument, in its simplest form, is this: Covid-19 has revealed the political status quo to be broken. Long before anyone had heard of the new coronavirus, people died of diseases we knew how to prevent and treat. People lived precarious lives in societies awash with wealth. Experts told us about catastrophic threats on the horizon, including pandemics, and we did next to nothing to prepare for them. At the same time, the drastic measures governments have taken in recent weeks testify to just how much power the state <em>does</em> have \u2013 the extent of what government can accomplish (and quickly!) when it realises it must act boldly or risk being seen as fundamentally illegitimate. As Pankaj Mishra <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-17/coronavirus-will-revive-an-all-powerful-state\" title=\"\">recently wrote</a>: \u201cIt has taken a disaster for the state to assume its original responsibility to protect citizens.\u201d</p> \n<p>For years, in mainstream politics the conventional line \u2013 on everything from healthcare to basic living expenses such as housing \u2013 has been that even if the world has its problems, expansive government intervention is not a feasible solution. Instead, we have been told that what works best are \u201cmarketplace\u201d solutions, which give large roles to corporations motivated not by outdated notions like \u201cthe public good\u201d but by a desire to make a profit. But then the virus started spreading, governments spent trillions in days \u2013 even going so far as to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-us-bailout-what-you-need-to-know\" title=\"\">write cheques</a> directly to citizens \u2013 and suddenly the question of what was feasible felt different.</p> \n<p>From this perspective, the task today is not to fight the virus in order to return to business as usual, because business as usual was already a disaster. The goal, instead, is to fight the virus \u2013 and in doing so transform business as usual into something more humane and secure.</p> \n<p>In her 2009 book, A Paradise Built in Hell<em>,</em> Solnit used case studies of disasters \u2013 including the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, the 2001 terror attacks and Hurricane Katrina \u2013 to argue that emergencies aren\u2019t just moments when bad things get worse, or when people inevitably become more scared, suspicious and self-centred. Instead she foregrounded the ways in which disasters opened up human reserves of improvisation, solidarity and resolve, pockets of purpose and joy, even in the midst of loss and pain. The book was not a call to celebrate disaster \u2013 but to pay attention to the possibilities it might contain, and how it might shake us loose from old ways. In Solnit\u2019s telling, \u201cofficial\u201d disaster responses had a tendency to muck things up by treating people as part of the problem to be managed, not an invaluable part of the solution.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\" no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Sometimes this mismanagement is a result of mere incompetence \u2013 other times it is more sinister. In her 2007 book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/15/politics\" title=\"\">The Shock Doctrine</a>, the Canadian writer Naomi Klein laid out a dark account of crisis politics. In Klein\u2019s view, there is always Disaster 1 \u2013 the earthquake, the storm, the military conflict, the economic slump \u2013 and Disaster 2 \u2013 the bad things that people with power subsequently get up to, such as ramming through extreme economic reforms or gobbling up post-crisis opportunities for self-enrichment, while the rest of us are too dazed to notice. (In fact, Klein argued, these people sometimes engineer Disaster 1 to get the process started.)</p> \n<p>Unlike Solnit\u2019s book, The Shock Doctrine doesn\u2019t have much to say about the resilience of everyday people when everything goes horribly wrong. (Indeed, Solnit directly criticised Klein for this omission.) But the two books fit together like puzzle pieces. Both address crisis not in terms of what inevitably \u2013 or \u201cnaturally\u201d \u2013 happens as they unfold, but in terms of choices that people make along the way. And both were well-timed to contribute to the political conversations taking shape in the rubble of the financial crash.</p> \n<p>In 2008, days after Barack Obama\u2019s election, his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, famously said: \u201cYou never want a serious crisis to go to waste.\u201d Today\u2019s leftists, for whom Obama mostly represents disappointment, are prone to agree. They feel that, in the wake of recent crises, they lost, and now is the time to make amends. If, facing a pandemic, we can change this much in a few weeks, then how much might we change in a year?</p> \n<p>For anyone making this argument, the contrast between 2008 and the present crisis is striking. Compared to the opaque financial crisis, with its credit default swaps and collateralised debt obligations, the coronavirus is relatively easy to understand. It is a dozen crises tangled into one, and they\u2019re all unfolding immediately, in ways that cannot be missed. Politicians are getting infected. Wealthy celebrities are getting infected. Your friends and relatives are getting infected. We may not quite all be \u201cin it together\u201d \u2013 as always, the poor are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-outbreak-inequality-austerity-pandemic\" title=\"\">hit worse</a> \u2013 but there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-means-we-really-are-finally-all-in-this-together\" title=\"\">more truth</a> to the idea than there ever was in the wake of 2008.</p> \n<p>In this, the optimists believe, there is hope that we might begin to see the world differently. Maybe we can view our problems as shared, and society as more than just a mass of individuals competing against each other for wealth and standing. Maybe, in short, we can understand that the logic of the market should not dominate as many spheres of human existence as we currently allow it to.</p> \n<p>\u201cMore people are in a position to connect the dots,\u201d Klein said. \u201cIt has to do with people\u2019s experiences; for people of a certain age, their only experience of capitalism has been one of crisis. And they want things to be different.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>That screaming buzzsaw noise in the background of this conversation is the sound of the climate crisis. If 2008 is the disaster that Klein and like-minded thinkers want to avoid repeating, climate change is the much bigger disaster they see coming \u2013 that they know is already here \u2013 and that they want to fight off. Indeed, in the years since publishing The Shock Doctrine, Klein has made climate change her central focus, framing it as the paradigmatic emergency that must be wrenched from the clutches of fossil-fuel profiteers and their enablers in government.</p> \n<p>Although Covid-19 is likely the biggest global crisis since the second world war, it is still dwarfed in the long term by climate change. Yet the two problems have suggestive similarities. Both will require unusual levels of global cooperation. Both demand changes in behaviour today in the name of reducing suffering tomorrow. Both problems were long predicted with great certainty by scientists, and have been neglected by governments unable to see beyond the next fiscal quarter\u2019s growth statistics. Accordingly, both will require governments to take drastic action and banish the logic of the marketplace from certain realms of human activity, while simultaneously embracing public investment. In other words, to think of this new level of state intervention as a temporary requirement is to ensure that we continue barrelling down the path to climate disaster.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying for years to get people out of normal mode and into emergency mode,\u201d said Margaret Klein Salamon, a former psychologist who now heads the advocacy group The Climate Mobilization. \u201cWhat is possible politically is fundamentally different when lots of people get into emergency mode \u2013 when they fundamentally accept that there\u2019s danger, and that if we want to be safe we need to do everything we can. And it\u2019s been interesting to see that theory validated by the response to the coronavirus. Now the challenge is to keep emergency mode activated about climate, where the dangers are orders of magnitude greater. We can\u2019t think we\u2019re going to go \u2018back to normal\u2019, because things weren\u2019t normal.\u201d</p> \n<p>The analogy between the two crises only goes so far. There is no getting around the fact that the impacts of climate change are more gradual than those of Covid-19. Most people do not feel they or their loved ones could die from the climate crisis this month, and so emergency mode is harder to activate and sustain. As Salamon pointed out to me, if we truly accepted we were in a climate emergency, then every day the news would lead with updates about which countries were reducing their emissions the fastest, and people would be clamouring to make sure their leaders were adopting the policies that worked.</p> \n<p>But it is not unimaginable that the experience of Covid-19 could help us understand climate change differently. As the virus has reduced industrial activity and road traffic, air pollution has plummeted. In early March, the Stanford University scientist Marshall Burke <a href=\"http://www.g-feed.com/2020/03/covid-19-reduces-economic-activity.html\" title=\"\">used pollution data</a> from four Chinese cities to measure changes in the level of PM2.5, a particularly harmful pollutant that attacks the heart and lungs. He estimated that, in China alone, emission reductions since the start of the pandemic had in effect saved the lives of at least 1,400 children under five and 51,700 adults over 70. Meanwhile, people around the world have been sharing their own anecdotal findings online \u2013 stories of sweet-smelling breezes, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philipoltermann/status/1244189207867854848\" title=\"\">expanded</a> bike lanes and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/29/uk-wildlife-enjoys-humans-lockdown-but-concerns-raised-over-conservation\" title=\"\">birdsong returning</a> to neighbourhoods \u2013 in a way that almost resembles a digitally distributed Rebecca Solnit project: people catching glimpses, in the midst of a disaster, of a future they know they want and need.</p> \n<p>Alongside these hopeful signs, a far less heartening story is unfolding, which fits Klein\u2019s \u201cshock doctrine\u201d framework. Disaster 1: Covid-19. Disaster 2: the dismantling of even the meagre existing rules designed to protect the environment. On 26 March, following lobbying from the energy industry, the US Environmental Protection Agency <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/27/trump-pollution-laws-epa-allows-companies-pollute-without-penalty-during-coronavirus\" title=\"\">announced that</a>, in recognition of the pandemic\u2019s effects on the workforce, it will not punish violations of pollution regulations so long as companies can link those violations to the pandemic. China\u2019s environmental ministry has started <a href=\"https://news.bloombergenvironment.com/environment-and-energy/china-relaxes-environmental-rules-to-curb-viruss-economic-hit\" title=\"\">waiving inspections</a> that assess the environmental impact of industrial facilities. And advocacy groups funded by the plastics industry have launched a <a href=\"https://heated.world/p/the-right-is-using-covid-19-to-wage?fbclid=IwAR3v3a7oV_CSeQE448S_fMVv-CpVBTst75tAiHD7HDKUIOSi_ugkikxR6nQ\" title=\"\">public relations blitz</a> on behalf of single-use plastic bags, spreading the unproven claim that the virus is less likely to stick to plastic than to the cloth fabric of reusable bags. Looking back at the crisis of 2008, we can see that emissions dropped then, too \u2013 only to rebound drastically in 2010 and 2011.</p> \n<p>Salamon believes that one lesson of the coronavirus crisis is the power of shared emotion, which has helped make possible radical action to slow the pandemic. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about people giving each other medical expertise. I\u2019m talking about people calling each other up and saying: \u2018How are you doing? Are you scared? I\u2019m scared. I want you to be OK, I want us to be OK.\u2019 And that\u2019s what we want for climate, too. We need to learn to be scared together, to agree on what we\u2019re terrified about.\u201d Only then, she said, would governments be forced to act. \u201cIt\u2019s good that we\u2019re entering emergency mode about the pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cBut unless we also do it for climate \u2026 \u201d She didn\u2019t finish the sentence.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>What kind of actions would it take for the optimists\u2019 vision to materialise? The historian Philip Mirowski, author of <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/1613-never-let-a-serious-crisis-go-to-waste\" title=\"\">Never Let a Serious Crisis Go to Waste</a>: How Neoliberalism Survived the Financial Meltdown, warns against complacency. \u201cThe left thought it was so obvious to everyone that the crisis revealed the utter bankruptcy of a certain way of looking at the economy,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t obvious to everyone, and the left lost.\u201d How do we prevent the world from going back to a version of the way it was before Covid-19, with the virus vanquished but all of the old ongoing disasters still unfolding?</p> \n<p>\u201cThe political outcome of the epidemic,\u201d said Mike Davis, \u201cwill, like all political outcomes, be decided by struggle, by battles over interpretation, by pointing out what causes problems and what solves them. And we need to get that analysis out in the world any way we can.\u201d One major obstacle, of course, is social distancing, which certainly hinders many time-tested methods of waging such struggles, such as political canvassing and street protest. \u201cThe biggest risk for all of us,\u201d said Klein, \u201cis going to be frittering away this time sitting at home on our social media feeds, living the extremely limited forms of politics that get enabled there.\u201d</p> \n<p>Davis hoped protesters would find their way into the streets sooner rather than later, and speculated that a street action with all the sign-holding participants spaced 10 or 15 feet apart would make a dramatic media image. He lives in San Diego, and as our conversation wrapped up, he mentioned that he was planning to spend part of the afternoon doing his part by standing by himself on a street corner, holding a sign. He hadn\u2019t decided what to write on it yet, but was thinking about \u201cSUPPORT THE NURSES\u2019 UNION\u201d or \u201cDEMAND PAID SICK LEAVE\u201d.</p> \n<p>Solnit told me she was taking heart from all the new ways people were finding to connect and help each other around the world, ranging from the neighbourhood delivery networks that had sprung up to bring groceries to people who couldn\u2019t get out, to more symbolic interventions, such as kids playing music on an older neighbour\u2019s porch. The Italian political scientist Alessandro Delfanti said he was finding hope from a post-outbreak <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/staten-island-amazon-warehouse-workers-strike-coronavirus-2020-3?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">wave of strikes</a> roiling Amazon warehouses in the US and Europe, and also the steps that workers across different sectors of the Italian economy were taking to help each other secure equipment they needed to stay safe.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/inside-the-race-to-develop-a-coronavirus-vaccine-covid-19\">'It\u2019s a razor\u2019s edge we\u2019re walking': inside the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What happens next might depend on the optimists\u2019 ability to transport such moments of solidarity into the broader political sphere, arguing that it makes no sense to address Covid-19 without at least trying to fix everything else, too, creating a world where our shared resources do more for more people. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have a language for this emotion, in which the wonderful comes wrapped in the terrible, joy in sorrow, courage in fear,\u201d wrote Solnit in A Paradise Built in Hell. \u201cWe cannot welcome disaster, but we can value the responses, both practical and psychological.\u201d </p> \n<p>The world feels awfully strange right now, but not because \u2013 or not <em>just</em> because \u2013 it is changing so fast and any one of us could fall ill at any time, or could already be carrying the virus and not know it.

  "<p>For some time this pandemic will focus almost all of our attention. It is a tragedy that will play out differently in different parts of the world; the poor world will suffer more than the rich one. We will see it as a potential turning point, a portent, a sign that we should have cared more and prepared better. However, human progress was slowing before this pandemic began, and our world will continue to slow down for some time to come \u2013 long after the pandemic has ended. I mean slowing down in almost every way that matters. Because the slowdown was itself slow, we had hardly noticed it. In fact, many people thought that we were still accelerating.</p> <p>For older generations everything had changed so fast, but in fact that fast pace ended years ago. There is no normal for us to return to; the normality of economic growth is an illusion. </p> <p>A century ago the pace of change was faster than it had ever been and would become faster again. During the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/spanish-flu-pandemic-centenary-first-world-war\">Spanish global flu pandemic</a> of 1918-19, carbon emissions fell by 14%. Industrial production and consumption slowed down dramatically. But then, just a year later when most of the sick had recovered, production and pollution rose by 16% in the year to 1920. Back then we were on the upswing. We were seeing ever faster population growth worldwide; back then a pandemic could not slow us down for long.</p> <p>In 1918, influenza had a far greater effect on <em>worldwide</em> trends in industry, production and consumption than the first world war \u2013 which was a war almost entirely confined to Europe. A century ago that worldwide influenza pandemic killed tens of millions of people, no one knows for sure how many. Yet today when we look back at demographic and economic trends, that last great pandemic appears as a small blip with few long-term consequences. </p> <p>Over the past two centuries, the number of people alive in the world has doubled and doubled and doubled again; from 1 billion shortly before 1820, to 2 billion by 1926 and 4 in 1974; it will be 8 billion in 2023. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/27/what-goes-up-population-crisis-wrong-fertility-rates-decline\">crucially the rise is slowing</a>. As I write, our numbers are rising by 80 million people a year. Next year it will be by 79 million, the year after by 78 million. We are still growing in number as a species, but that growth has been slowing for more than half a century already.</p> <p>We do not yet know what effect the current pandemic will have on worldwide demographics. But it is actually slightly more likely to increase future populations than decrease them. If the actions of governments, or at least of most governments, make people feel more insecure, economically and socially, then younger people may in the near future have more children than they would have had; and the pandemic will, counterintuitively, very slightly increase the total future population.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b310ccc5fb76ba44c75c42b4afc0ee0a212c2eec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b310ccc5fb76ba44c75c42b4afc0ee0a212c2eec/0_0_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The dramatic fall in concentrations of nitrogen dioxide over China between 1 January and 25 February is related to the coronavirus quarantine, Chinese New Year and an overall economic slowdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The dramatic fall in concentrations of nitrogen dioxide over China between 1 January and 25 February is related to the coronavirus quarantine, Chinese New Year and an overall economic slowdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nasa/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Security matters. In normal times this point has to be laboured because many readers of newspapers in affluent countries do not realise how precarious the safety net is for most people in the world. But today they are feeling as most people in poorer countries feel most days. Such insecurity played a part in the great acceleration in human population that began more than two centuries ago. It is worth looking back before looking forward.</p> <p>In 1859 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/feb/09/darwin.bestseller\">Charles Darwin wrote</a> about \u201cthe numerous recorded cases of the astonishingly rapid increase of various animals in a state of nature, when circumstances have been favourable to them during two or three following seasons\u201d. Darwin used examples ranging from minuscule seedlings to giant elephants; he discussed the very rare cases in nature when exponential population growth occurred in a species. Darwin had no way of knowing it, but he was writing just as his own species was about to have its favourable seasons.</p> <p>The word \u201cslowdown\u201d was first used in the 1890s, with its meaning being to go forward more slowly. Our current belief systems \u2013 economic, political and sociological \u2013 are all built on assumptions of rapid future technological change and perpetual growth. Yet even since the 1930s, technological change has slowed; the rate of economic growth has slowed every decade after the 1950s; population growth similarly has slowed since before the 1970s; and since at least the 1990s we have started to behave more like our parents again. By the 2010s we (at least in the rich world) were no longer seeing each generation better-off than the one before.</p> <p>The general slowdown we are living through is advantageous. Recognising this requires us to shift our fundamental view of change, innovation and discovery as unalloyed benefits. We need to stop expecting ceaseless technological revolutions. We need to worry about what mistakes we will make if we carry on assuming that slowdown is unlikely and new great shifts lie just around the corner.</p> <p>The time has come to properly contemplate what will happen if things stay much the same as they are now, while the rate of change simply slows down.</p> <p>An era is ending \u2013 and this was obvious years before the pandemic arrived. The great acceleration that has occurred in recent generations created the culture in which we still live. It created our current expectation for a particular kind of progress. By \u201cus\u201d I mean the large majority of older people now living on Earth, those who have for the most part seen their health, housing and workplaces improve, those who had seen both absolute and relative poverty recede, but who now have a sense that their children\u2019s generation will not be better off than they themselves are, those who are feeling a sense of let-down due to slowdown.</p> <p>The alternative to slowdown is unimaginably bad. If we do not slow down, there is no escape from disaster far worse than a pandemic. We would wreck the planet we live on. Slowdown means we need not fear the nightmare scenario of worldwide famine depicted at the end of Paul and Anne Ehrlich\u2019s 1968 book <em>The Population Bomb</em>, in which they concluded of India that its people should be allowed to starve: \u201cUnder the triage system [suggested by them] she [India] should receive no more food.\u201d This kind of brutal conclusion was rife in the recent past. Images of out-of-control acceleration became commonplace. That was just half a century ago, at the peak of human population acceleration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f6cb9829db9b283af27985e30cce415293cbed14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6cb9829db9b283af27985e30cce415293cbed14/0_80_1569_1962/800.jpg\" alt=\"A child in 1946 during the Chinese famine last lasted from 1958-61.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A child in 1946 during the Chinese famine last lasted from 1958-61.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Silk/Time &amp; Life Pictures/Getty Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although now may not be the time to point it out, the frequency and severity of disaster are both falling. The great Chinese famine of 1958\u201361 was worse in its effect than any of the earlier terrible huge Indian famines, or the east Africa famine of the 1980s. But the flu pandemic of 40 years before that famine had been worse still in terms of millions of deaths.</p> <p>Today almost everything is increasing at a slower pace. Prior to the 2020 pandemic, the four great exceptions were: university graduates enrolled worldwide, consumption of goods, carbon pollution and air flights. They have all suddenly slowed due to the pandemic. Before January of this year they all appeared to be rising exponentially and uncontrollably. Today it is even possible that worldwide temperature will not rise in 2020 in the way it rose in 2019, as a reaction to reduced pollution.</p> <p>Outside brief periods of wartime and pandemic, the global rates of population growth have exceeded 1% every year since 1901. However, according to the latest UN estimates published in June 2019, they will now almost certainly fall below that level by 2023, then quickly drop to below 0.9% annual growth around the year 2027. Everything was slowing down already, everything will still slow down when the current crisis ends. But the slamming on of the brakes on the train we were travelling on might, at the very least, wake us out of our stupor.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Danny Dorling is the author of <a href=\"http://www.dannydorling.org/books/SLOWDOWN/\">Slowdown: The End of the Great Acceleration \u2013 and Why It\u2019s Good for the Planet, the Economy, and Our Lives</a>, published 14 April (\u00a314.99, Yale).</em></p>",
  "<p>As Easyjet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/30/easyjet-grounds-entire-fleet-of-planes-because-of-coronavirus-crisis\">grounds its flights</a> and Richard Branson asks his considerable airline workforce to take <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-virgin-atlantic-asks-staff-to-take-eight-weeks-of-unpaid-leave-11958150\">eight weeks of unpaid leave</a>, it is plain that the state will soon step in.</p> <p>Rudimentary details of such action are already out there: workers furloughed rather than fired, with the government paying 80% of their wages. This, rather than putting money directly into the hands of the individual, makes sense: it will be better for any economic recovery if people with jobs keep them, if companies don\u2019t go bust.</p> <p>However, it is unlikely that covering the payroll will be enough to forestall disaster for many firms, and the word \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/27/virgin-atlantic-to-seek-millions-in-state-aid-amid-covid-19-slump\">bailouts</a>\u201d has roared back into fashion. As a talking point, bailouts were largely furloughed five years ago. All that state money of the 00s, poured into saving corporations, then clawed back from social safety nets around the world, was so much spilt milk for many people. But if we\u2019re going to do it again, we must <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-crisis-change-world-financial-global-capitalism\">do it differently</a>.</p> <p>Many failures \u2013 individual, institutional and systemic \u2013 went into creating the financial meltdown of 2008, but it is the failure of the social response that resonates now. It looked like a vindication: ultimate capitalism, when push came to shove, needed ultimate socialism in order to survive. Surely, after that, nothing could go back to the way it was? Well, we failed utterly to appreciate the audacity of wealth, and the masochistic appeal of political narratives that blamed us all for a crisis that the unimaginably rich created.</p> <p>The analogy with the present emergency is not exact, of course, since it is nobody\u2019s fault. But if we\u2019re going to bail out large corporations and businesses, there need to be some conditions. The Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren has already laid this <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/18/business/elizabeth-warren-bailout-buyback-ban/index.html\">out </a><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/18/business/elizabeth-warren-bailout-buyback-ban/index.html\">in the US</a>, and many of her points apply internationally. Any company being bailed out must maintain their payrolls and use funds to keep people employed; they\u2019re permanently barred from <a href=\"https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1dfj9g9mfnqxb/Share-Buybacks-May-Be-Bad-Just-Not-for-the-Reasons-You-Think\">share buybacks</a>, which is one way to funnel state aid directly to shareholders; they should be prohibited from paying out dividends or executive bonuses for three years; and a minimum of one seat on the board should be given to a representative from the workforce. No union agreement can be renegotiated under the relief programme. Warren\u2019s proposal also includes a requirement of a $15 minimum hourly wage, which the UK could frame as a living wage requirement (an actual living wage; not George Osborne\u2019s ersatz <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/george-osborne-s-living-wage-is-not-actually-a-living-wage-says-living-wage-foundation-10375897.html\">\u201cnational living wage\u201d</a>).</p> <p>There is another opportunity here: use state aid to curtail <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/27/tax-avoiders-coronavirus-bailouts\">tax avoidance</a>. No company that isn\u2019t headquartered in the UK should receive help from the British government. The measure doesn\u2019t have to be vindictive \u2013 companies can re-domicile. But if you want the protection of the state, you have to pay tax to that state. </p> <p>And these conditions can be agile, building in fixes as the situation unfolds: write requirements against <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/649a7e5a-6dab-11ea-89df-41bea055720b\">price gouging</a>, particular to Sports Direct (although it denies any wrongdoing), or if Wetherspoons gets a bailout demand that its founder, Tim Martin, pay smaller suppliers.</p> <p>Every sector is having specific crises: <a href=\"https://www.common-wealth.co.uk/reports/emergency-landing-how-public-stakes-can-secure-a-sustainable-future-for-aviation\">grounded planes</a> and shuttered pubs face different challenges to agriculture, where demand has never been more insistent but there\u2019s a shortage of workers. Yet what they all have in common is that, socially, we need them to survive and we need them to emerge from this moving towards a decarbonised and fruitful workplace. Airline bailouts could also require a plan for carbon reduction. The thinktank Common Wealth proposes that agricultural subsidies be used to drive sustainability, <a href=\"https://www.common-wealth.co.uk/interactive-digital-projects/re-wilding-uk\">rewilding</a> and better forestry techniques and soil management. These deeper measures, which are about the next 50 years rather than five months, can be jointly established by government, employers and employees, whose interests are the same: hibernation with the promise of reawakening to something better.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/coronavirus-crisis-tories-cuts\">In this crisis, the Tory cuts can no longer be hidden by empty gestures | Nesrine Malik</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We are now in an era of intense generosity: we want individuals, families, small businesses, large corporations, life as we know it to survive, and there is no space in that for parsimony.

The neighbourhoods were guarded by party members, the official claimed.</p> \n<p>Last week, a senior member of the Hezbollah Executive Council, Hashem Safieddine, said the party had 25,000 medics whom it had mobilised to treat patients. He said the party had placed 1,500 doctors and 3,000 nurses in public hospitals and was preparing empty hotels to be used as isolation areas. The party said it was monitoring 1,200 people who had returned from Iran.

On Tuesday, the party plans to showcase its preparations during a media tour in its stronghold area in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat they didn\u2019t say is that these facilities are needed right now,\u201d said one of the officials. \u201cThis isn\u2019t future planning, it\u2019s dealing with a critical real-time need. The public needs to know that, and so do people formulating a global response. What happens here matters outside the country.\u201d</p> \n<p>Two months into the pandemic, the number of cases across the Middle East continues to steadily rise. More testing in the past week is thought to account for a sharp increase in recent days. Lebanon\u2019s testing had been at the lower end of the regional scale at 150-200 tests a day, but has increased since mid-week. Gulf Arab states have been testing more extensively, with Bahrain at close to 32,000 tests, Qatar 16,700 and Kuwait about 27,000.</p> \n<p>A large number of those infections have been traced to Iran, and borders in all three states have been sealed and are set to remain so for at least the next fortnight.</p> \n<p>In north-west Syria, the head of Idlib\u2019s health directorate, Dr Munzer al-Khalil, said: \u201cIn one year, we lost around 76 health facilities. Donors have cut their funds and medical staff have been killed, arrested or displaced. The health sector in Idlib cannot cope with the inevitable outbreak and we fear 100,000 people could die unless we get supplies immediately.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur ventilators are always 100% occupied and we don\u2019t have one single bed ready for a coronavirus case today. Camps are the perfect breeding ground for the virus and [we are] 400% over capacity, with 10 or more people sharing one tent.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 April 2020 to correct the name of Hashem Safieddine.</p>",
  "<p>The New Zealand government\u2019s swift move to lock down the country when there had been no deaths and only a few hundred cases of Covid-19 has drawn widespread praise - but an epidemiologist told a committee of lawmakers on Tuesday that the rules alone would not be enough to curb the virus\u2019 spread.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like pressing the pause button on your device,\u201d David Skegg, an emeritus professor of epidemiology at the University of Otago, said of the four-week national lockdown that began last Wednesday. He added that the sacrifices New Zealanders had made by staying at home, and the hit to the country\u2019s economy of a national shutdown, would be \u201ca terrible waste if we don\u2019t pull out all the stops now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe could effectively eliminate the virus over the next few weeks,\u201d said Skegg, if officials were more ambitious in their testing and contact tracing measures during the lockdown. He added that the government should ensure the lockdown was as comprehensive as possible, and tighten restrictions on those in quarantine after arriving from overseas \u2013 some of whom have reported being allowed out of their isolation to buy groceries, which should not be allowed.</p> <p>He urged the government to produce a single, clear document explaining its goal, which he said should be elimination of the virus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/bear-hunt-helps-banish-coronavirus-boredom-for-new-zealand-children\">'Bear hunt' helps banish coronavirus boredom for New Zealand children</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe could be one of the very few countries on earth to be functioning normally\u201d after the lockdown, Skegg said, adding that most countries had ordered the public to stay at home \u201cmuch too late\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe still have a window of opportunity but only if we lift our game quickly,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Skegg was speaking to a New Zealand parliamentary committee convened to hold government and public officials to account over their decisions on the Covid-19 pandemic. It is chaired by the leader of the opposition, Simon Bridges, and features MPs from every political party in parliament.</p> <p>New Zealand has recorded 647 cases of coronavirus; 14 people are in hospital with the virus, including two in intensive care, and one person has died.</p> <p>The number of those infected, Skegg told the committee, was \u201clikely far higher\u201d than the number of cases confirmed, and authorities had \u201creally ... no idea of the extent of community spread,\u201d he said. Health officials say 1 to 2% of cases in New Zealand were contracted through community transmission, a rate that they expect to grow.</p> <p>Skegg said that as testing had been \u201cheavily skewed towards those returning from overseas,\u201d it was unsurprising that the figures of community spread were so low. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/coronavirus-has-forced-new-zealanders-abroad-to-choose-do-i-stay-or-do-i-go\">Coronavirus has forced New Zealanders abroad to choose: do I stay or do I go? | Elle Hunt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Separately on Tuesday, the government released <a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/report_for_moh_-_covid-19_pandemic_nz_final.pdf\">modelling </a>that informed its decision to lock down the country, which showed as many as 14,000 New Zealanders could die if coronavirus got out of control, with more than 65% of the population infected.
