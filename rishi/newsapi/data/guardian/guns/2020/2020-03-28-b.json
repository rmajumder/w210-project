  "<p>The chances of an individual Covid-19 vaccine project producing a successful outcome are low, one of Britain\u2019s leading immunisation experts has warned. \u201cScience does not have a track record where most of our vaccine projects work,\u201d Professor Adam Finn, of Bristol University said last week. \u201cWe have a track record where most of them don\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>Finn\u2019s warning came as doctors and epidemiologists stressed how difficult it would be to contain the disease until people can be immunised against it.</p> <p>The crucial point is that if individual projects have low prospects of success, many different approaches will have to be taken to find one that does provide protection against Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cIt is like the Grand National,\u201d said Finn. \u201cA lot of horses start off but only a few make it to the finishing line. And that is why we are going to need a lot of different vaccine projects to start off with \u2013 because only one or two are likely to make it to become fully fledged vaccines. This is not a one-horse race.</p> <p>\u201cAt present, I would estimate there are at least 60 Covid-19 vaccine projects that have started up or are in planning. But the more there are, the better things will be.\u201d</p> <p>Most Covid-19 vaccine projects that have been announced so far have been for a type known as RNA/DNA vaccines. These involve taking genetic material from a virus and injecting into animals or human volunteers. This approach is quicker than other methods which typically involve creating pieces of a virus and using them to stimulate a person\u2019s immune system against it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/inside-the-race-to-develop-a-coronavirus-vaccine-covid-19\">'It\u2019s a razor\u2019s edge we\u2019re walking': inside the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, RNA/DNA vaccines \u2013 which are a recent development \u2013 have yet to be developed for use in human beings. \u201cThey are quicker to start up but we have much less experience with them compared with standard approaches.\u201d</p> <p>All these projects have promise, Finn stressed, but most of those being launched to tackled Covid-19 were unlikely to work in the end. \u201cThe trouble is that we do not have a technology that allows us to be confident from the outset that a vaccine will be effective.\u201d</p> <p>In addition, vaccines that do stimulate strong immune responses can also have adverse side-effects or may even make a disease worse. An example is provided by Dengue fever, which is spread by mosquitoes in Asia and South America. \u201cA vaccine was developed to protect children against one type of Dengue,\u201d said Finn. \u201cThen it was found that it actually made them more susceptible to a second type of the disease.\u201d</p> <p>For these reasons, vaccines have to be put through lengthy trials to ensure any dangerous side-effects are revealed. \u201cWe will have been cautious and not rush forward,\u201d Finn added.</p> <p>On the other hand, it was possible that one of the projects would produce a vaccine that just sailed along, he said. It might turn out to be easy to manufacture, have no side-effects, produce a good immune response, while in trials it prevented volunteers from getting sick compared with those in a control group. For good measure,a factory would be ready to manufacture it.</p> <p>\u201cIn those circumstances, you would have a vaccine in less than a year,\u201d said Finn. \u201cBut it is almost certainly not going to happen like that. There will be stumbles along the way.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p><br>As Boris Johnson went into solitary confinement in his flat above No 11 Downing Street on Friday, having tested positive for Covid-19, a member of his staff noted how the atmosphere had quickly changed at the heart of power. It was not just the PM who had taken himself out of circulation in the preceding hours. \u201cThere are quite a lot of others not here now because they are self-isolating,\u201d said the official. \u201cThose who are, are just getting on with their jobs. The whole place has become very quiet.\u201d</p> <p>Downing Street is a huge rambling complex of corridors and offices in which staff can, in normal times, move fairly freely, running errands and attending meetings in small rooms in No 10, No 11 and the Cabinet Office. Until Thursday, the place had buzzed with activity, day and night. Many members of staff were exhausted, working 18-hour days, or more, at what had for weeks been the national nerve centre for coordinating responses to the pandemic. Some were sleeping in the building to avoid the risks of public transport and to save time.</p> <p>Senior ministers including Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, were regularly in and out of formal meetings and more impromptu discussions with the PM, as were Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser to the government, and Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer. Until the middle of last week, meetings of Cobra, the emergency committee, were still taking place, mainly person to person, rather than remotely. But when Johnson tested positive, having developed a cough and temperature during Thursday afternoon \u2013 and it was later announced that Hancock had contracted the virus, too \u2013 such gatherings, and the free movement of people inside Downing Street, were halted.</p> <p>At lunchtime on Friday, Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, appeared to have recognised the urgency of the situation and was seen running out of the building by a back exit with a large rucksack on his back. A decision was taken to close and lock the door between Nos 10 and 11. Johnson\u2019s solitary confinement meant food, drink and papers had to be left outside his door. Hancock stayed at home. Then, on Saturday, the secretary of state for Scotland, Alister Jack, announced that he was self-isolating after developing coronavirus symptoms. He had yet to be tested.</p> <p>For Downing Street staff who were still at work keeping the machine going, new routes had to be taken. \u201cNow, we have to go via an underground passage if we want to get to another part of the building,\u201d said an insider. After days of telling the public where they could and could not go, staff at the heart of government were having to fall into line, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f309e49bb4b7cef00b58a6d42c69645b004f912\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f309e49bb4b7cef00b58a6d42c69645b004f912/0_248_901_541/500.jpg\" alt=\"Chief Adviser Dominic Cummings runs out of Downing Street shortly after Johnson announced he tested positive for Covid-19.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Cummings runs out of Downing Street shortly after Johnson announced he tested positive for Covid-19.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV News</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The news that Johnson and Hancock had contracted Covid-19 \u2013 and, later on Friday, that Whitty had developed symptoms \u2013 raised two urgent new questions to add to the long list already facing ministers. Most immediately: how was it that three of the four-strong team of politicians and medical experts leading the national appeals to people to stay at home and observe social distancing had allowed themselves to fall victim to the virus? And how could government at this time of national emergency continue to function if Covid-19 took many more victims in high places in Westminster, Whitehall and Downing Street?</p> <p>Johnson had certainly not practised what he had preached. As well as attending Cobra meetings in person, with key ministers and the country\u2019s leading medical experts, he had been pictured in the Commons on Wednesday, after prime minister\u2019s questions, in a close cluster around the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle. On Friday, Hoyle felt he had to issue a statement saying he was fit and well, given Johnson that had just tested positive. On Wednesday too, the prime minister posed for pictures standing alongside the Labour MP Rupa Huq and her son. The London MP writes an article for Sunday\u2019s <em>Observer</em> on the failure of parliament to adapt to safer working practices during the outbreak.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/28/coronavirus-has-completely-changed-how-uk-politics-works\">Coronavirus has completely changed how UK politics works</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fellow Labour MP Lucy Powell said the whole of government should have decided to operate remotely far earlier: \u201cIt is extraordinary that we did not take measures to close parliament earlier than we did. Westminster and Whitehall have not set a good example to the country, which may be why people have been slow to act on the advice. There are high numbers of MPs who have already had the virus or have got it now. Nadine Dorries had it two weeks ago. So parliament could, and should, have moved to working via [video conferencing platform] Zoom instead of gathering in an epicentre and then disbursing round the country.\u201d</p> <p>By and large, the public is still supportive of the government\u2019s actions and responses, aware of the complexity and enormity of the crisis, and the unprecedented nature of the challenge. An Opinium survey for the <em>Observer</em> taken in the latter half of last week, but before news of Johnson\u2019s illness broke, shows 65% of voters approve of the handling of the coronavirus outbreak. But 56% think government did not move fast enough on a number of fronts, including testing and social distancing. As the number of cases of and deaths from coronavirus grows, questions about the adequacy and speed of the response will only grow. Jonathan Ashworth, Labour\u2019s health spokesperson, who has offered support to the government where possible, said the most criticisms came from within the medical establishment so could not be dismissed as mere political point scoring.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cA pandemic demands resolve and rapid action from governments. In recent weeks, there have been more and more voices in the wider medical community questioning whether the UK was moving at the speed necessary. NHS staff have continued to warn of delays in accessing protective equipment, we still have not got the ventilators that will be vital, we are not testing at the levels the World Health Organization recommends and many believe social-distancing measures should have been implemented earlier.\u201d</p> <p>Inevitably at such a time, there have been tensions at the heart of government, notably between Hancock and Gove, over the handling of the crisis and signs of a lack of central control. Whitehall insiders say there is concern that No 10 has not been clear to other departments what their roles should be. There is also dismay that Downing Street has leaked out initiatives, such as plans for a total lockdown of London, which it has not then gone on to announce, causing huge confusion and alarm. \u201cAt times, it has seemed that one arm of government does not know what the other arm is doing,\u201d said one source.</p> <p>Last week, some in medical circles were questioning why ministers had not opted to take part in an EU bulk-buying scheme for ventilators, which it was eligible for as the UK is still in its Brexit transition phase. At one stage, Downing Street said it had missed a vital email about a deadline for joining the system. The <em>Observer</em> also understands that offers from foreign companies, including at least one from China, to provide badly needed medical equipment to the UK were held up because of bureaucracy and the UK\u2019s insistence that they would be subject to high customs duties. Chinese companies have found that trying to donate ventilators to the UK has proved far more difficult than it has been to other European countries because of paperwork and arguments over whether they meet NHS standards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ede9da996af13b9707faf4905f552cd736701ced\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ede9da996af13b9707faf4905f552cd736701ced/0_0_542_471/500.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Hancock\u2019s twitter, making the announcement that he has tested positive for the virus.\" width=\"500\" height=\"435\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Hancock\u2019s twitter, making the announcement that he has tested positive for the virus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @MattHancock/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The acting co-leader of the Liberal Democrats Ed Davey said confusion over the orders of ventilators was inexcusable: \u201cWho in their right mind wouldn\u2019t want to act with other countries to source ventilators?\u201d Referring to the UK\u2019s failure to join the EU scheme, he added: \u201cWhat it shows is, when it comes to the European issue, the government is so unclear about how they are going to handle the relationship with Europe that they can\u2019t get their act together. It\u2019s quite irresponsible.\u201d</p> <p>Writing in the <em>Observer</em> , the Tory MP Dr Dan Poulter, who works part time in the NHS as a psychiatrist and is treating many patients with Covid-19, says testing of NHS staff is urgently needed and could be a \u201cgame changer\u201d. Based on his experience of the NHS frontline, he writes: \u201cNHS staff sickness levels are already high, and they are only going to increase as the Covid-19 outbreak intensifies. Many of us are also worried that we may be infected yet asymptomatic [showing no symptoms] and therefore could be a potential risk to our patients, colleagues and families. That is the last thing that we would want, but we simply do not know. Widespread NHS staff testing would be a game changer and would help NHS clinicians to both protect our patients and return to the frontline faster.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/my-nhs-colleagues-are-committed-but-we-are-at-maximum-stretch\">My NHS colleagues are committed but we are at maximum stretch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>David Hunter, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at Oxford University, said a national effort was needed to ensure testing takes place effectively. He explained: \u201cWe urgently need someone in charge whose only job it is to solve the supply chain, equipment, personnel and IT issues that are inhibiting the maximal testing scale-up and who reports to the public on progress daily until there is adequate capacity.\u201d</p> <p>While Johnson and Hancock insist they can continue to handle the crisis despite having become its victims, there are many who are raising questions about their ability to do so alone. Davey believes opposition parties need to come together to hold the government constructively to account in a newly formed committee along the lines adopted in New Zealand. Others are suggesting a new national government, an idea supported by 44% of voters, according to Opinium.</p> <p>Poulter says, from his own personal experience, that the NHS is already at \u201cmaximum stretch\u201d. Equally worrying is that Boris Johnson\u2019s government is, too \u2013 and yet, as he says in a letter to the nation today, the worst is yet to come.</p>",

(Australian westerns are sometimes referred to as \u201cmeat pie westerns\u201d. Should Aussie productions about organised crime have a similar name? Maybe ... Vegemite gangsters? Schooner and parmigiana mobsters?) But it\u2019s also in the show\u2019s gritty texture and street-side verisimilitude, and the way the escalating force of its drama hits you like a slap on the face.</p> <p>There\u2019s also extensive multi-person voiceover narration, a bold device used in the Scorsese classics Goodfellas and Casino. This counters the scuzzy settings and hotheaded characters with an almost literary intensity \u2013 if that word \u201cliterary\u201d didn\u2019t feel light years removed from the many fiends and lowlifes depicted. Jenkins establishes a cracking pace from the get-go, opening with the sound of a train rumbling down tracks accompanied by bursts of bluesy saxophone as the frame homes in on two nervous-looking men sitting in a car outside a bank.</p> <p>\u201cSomething\u2019s up mate, you made a blue!\u201d yelps Neddy Smith (Tony Martin) to his companion, who assures him that the people they\u2019re waiting for are coming. \u201cSo\u2019s Christmas!\u201d Neddy snaps back, setting in motion a production full of distinctively, inimitably Australian vernacular captured by the screenwriter, Ian David. The \u2019strayan turn of phrase is enunciated by an excellent albeit extremely blokey cast \u2013 including Richard Roxburgh, Steve Bastoni, Peter Phelps, Alex Dimitriades, Bill Hunter, Gary Sweet, John Hargreaves \u2013 and there\u2019s even a brief cameo from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/15/richard-carter-absolutely-unforgettable-great-australian-character-actor-dies\">the great Richard Carter</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6484d42318b0e147ca6bda6d2c4943603db0566\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6484d42318b0e147ca6bda6d2c4943603db0566/0_0_1200_801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Roxburgh as Roger Rogerson in Blue Murder\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Roxburgh as Roger Rogerson in Blue Murder</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then Neddy\u2019s voiceover begins: \u201cThis was a stupid thing for us to do. But I was young and Bobby Chapman swore it\u2019d be an easy go.\u201d The scene we\u2019re watching is a botched robbery; this pair of two-bit crims fail to stop their targets and flee the scene, yelling and screaming. The next scene shows Neddy being nabbed by another key character, Roger \u201cthe Dodger\u201d Rogerson (Roxburgh), who stuffs a pump-action shotgun in this face and exclaims, \u201cGotcha, Neddy!\u201d By this point quite a lot has happened, and yet barely two and a half minutes of running time have elapsed \u2013 demonstrating breathtaking narrative efficiency.</p> <p>The ensuing story, based on true events and set in Sydney during the 1970s and 80s, pivots between Neddy \u2013 who becomes a police informant \u2013 and Rogerson, a notoriously corrupt cop and convicted murderer now in jail <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/02/roger-rogerson-and-glen-mcnamara-given-life-sentences-for-of-jamie-gao\">serving a life sentence</a>.

Where is he? Why aren\u2019t director\u2019s knocking on his door? Bring him back, I say, and give the man a career renaissance. Failing that, you can bring him back to the screen yourself: by adding Blue Murder to your lists of things to check out during self-isolation.

  "<p>Fear is pushing us into a dictatorial future. The only choice is what type of dictatorship.

You only have to look around the world to see they have decided that basic freedoms have to go. They are using surveillance technology to confine carriers of the virus and their contacts to the modern equivalents of the medieval leper colonies or Victorian tuberculosis sanatoriums. <a href=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/03/25/hong_kong_coronavirus/\">Hong Kong</a> enforces home imprisonment, monitored with digital tracking. <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-singapore-technolo/singapore-launches-contact-tracing-mobile-app-to-track-coronavirus-infections-idUKKBN2171ZQ?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews\">Singapore</a> is encouraging citizens to download an app that allows the authorities to learn of their contacts, while Taiwan is using mobile phone data to put an \u201celectronic fence\u201d around infected homes.</p> <p>The alternative to confining the ill is to hide away the over-70s and people with weakened immune systems.

Yet the division between the freedom of the well and the confinement of the sick or potentially sick will hurt. Leap forward a month, and you can see the state requiring citizens to produce documentation showing that it is safe for them to return to normal life or travel abroad.

In these circumstances, paranoia appears more a necessity than a delusion. Yet it remains true that technology is not destiny. Politics counts for more than algorithms.

Most important will be how you and I behave. Will we turn into a nation of little tyrants vindictively calling for needless punishments?

  "<p>When Mary Beard\u2019s new BBC documentary series <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000f1t4\" title=\"\">Shock of the Nude</a></em> began last month, I had high hopes. A new censoriousness is abroad both in the art world, and in our wider culture, and I hoped that she might have something to say about this: something clear, clever and non-prurient. But alas, it was not to be. I disliked her approach to marble fig leaves and the male gaze, and in the <em>New Statesman</em>, where I am the television critic, I said so, calling the series out for what I regarded as its superficiality and modish solipsism. \u201cShe is the star,\u201d I wrote. \u201cAnd Michaelangelo, Courbet and all the rest of them can go hang.\u201d</p> <p>I did not expect her to like this, but neither did I expect to <em>hear</em> that she didn\u2019t like it. Beard, a Cambridge don, is smart and successful. I assumed she would rise above it; given that I once gave a book of hers a rave review, she would know, moreover, that it wasn\u2019t personal. But again, I was wrong. A few days later, Beard <a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/how-do-we-review-television-intelligently/\" title=\"\">devoted the blog she writes for the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/how-do-we-review-television-intelligently/\" title=\"\">Times Literary Supplement</a></em><a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/how-do-we-review-television-intelligently/\" title=\"\"> to TV criticism</a>, having taken exception not only to my review, but to several others too. In it, she ticked each of us off individually. (Had I, she wanted to know, ever considered how few TV minutes in the past had been devoted to Zoffany\u2019s <em>Tribuna</em>?) She then called for a total rethink of TV criticism. It seems that Beard wants new, better TV critics, who will take a new, better approach to television. The inference is that what she really wants are TV critics who will universally praise everything that she does.</p> <p>Beard\u2019s blog infuriated me, not for anything she had to say about my review (she\u2019s entitled to disagree with me), but for the suggestion \u2013 one she appeared to reiterate later on social media \u2013 that I do not take TV seriously. This, of course, is a perennial problem for critics, particularly those who try to write entertainingly; the criticised seem unaccountably to feel that if the critic has the temerity to make light of anything at all, they\u2019re unworthy of the job, and idiotic to boot. In my case, however, the accusation could not be further from the truth. If I love television now \u2013 and I do \u2013 this is as nothing compared to how I felt about it when I was younger. Growing up, it was the principal means, apart from novels borrowed from the library, by which I educated myself: about art, culture, science, nature and, yes, human behaviour. I believe that those who discount television, who are patronising or snobbish about it, are telling you far more about themselves than they are about the medium itself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83d2452c48d0d4a7e9366f1fc92cd87e53b69e26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83d2452c48d0d4a7e9366f1fc92cd87e53b69e26/129_0_2383_1430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Beard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Beard: \u2018she doesn\u2019t have the kind of groupies who go in for trolling\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helena Hunt/BBC/Lion TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are several things that qualify someone to be a critic. They require some expertise; they must be able to write; they should have taste (reviews have everything to do with taste \u2013 and nothing). But the most vital qualification is that they should love whatever it is that they write about. As the late AA Gill put it: \u201cIf you don\u2019t love it, why will you care if somebody does it badly?\u201d What I felt most of all when I watched Beard\u2019s show was a sense of amazement that she and the BBC had together used our money, in the form of the licence fee, to make something so inert, so contentless, so strangely (for a programme about art) unbeautiful and ordinary. And so, like the boy in the fairy tale, I pointed at what I was watching \u2013 in this case, not a naked emperor, but a naked professor of classics (I mean this both literally and metaphorically, since Beard posed for a life drawing in the series) \u2013 and I laughed. Personally, I don\u2019t believe you have to agree with me to think that I was right to do so. What is the point of a critic if not to tell the truth as they see it? </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>I\u2019ve written about Beard not to stir a feud, but because it illustrates so perfectly the current moment when it comes to criticism. In the 21st century, critics write in an environment where those who disagree with them, whether makers or consumers, can respond immediately and directly. Artists now quite often use social media to encourage their fans to diss the so-called experts, urging them on by telling them that they are right, not the critic. Beard doesn\u2019t have the kind of groupies \u2013 assuming she has groupies at all \u2013 who go in for trolling, but many artists do, and when stirred, whether the incitement is deliberate or not, things can get out of control pretty quickly. Think of Samuel L Jackson, who in 2012 asked his Twitter followers if they could help the film critic AO Scott to find a new job, \u201cone he can actually do\u201d (Scott, of the <em>New York Times</em>, had been disobliging about <em>Avengers Assemble</em>, in which Jackson stars). Or think of Lana Del Rey, who last year <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/events/1169745989697036288?lang=en\" title=\"\">tweeted her displeasure at Ann Powers\u2019s review of her new album to her 9.5 million followers</a>. The subsequent pile-on included calls for Del Rey to \u201cend\u201d Powers.</p> <p>You have to be quite tough \u2013 or at any rate, cool-headed \u2013 to put up with this kind of thing. But then, to be a critic, you have to be tough generally these days. Jobs are thin on the ground. For the past decade, newspapers, their budgets under threat and their determination to build online traffic driving their priorities in terms of copy, have been laying off large numbers of critics. Who will forget the day, in 2013, that the ill-fated <em>Independent on Sunday</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jul/29/independent-titles-cut-back-arts-coverage\" title=\"\">sacked its entire team</a>? Some art forms have been affected by this situation more than others: as Alex Ross, the <em>New Yorker</em>\u2019s music writer, pointed out in a melancholy piece in 2017, fewer than a dozen American newspapers now have a full-time classical critic. And the realms of film and theatre are hardly immune. To take one example, in 2019, the <em>Evening Standard</em>, a newspaper cited \u201cnecessary cost-cutting\u201d when laying off both of its long-standing theatre critics in favour of two writers with other roles on the paper.</p> <p>It being hard to make ends meet, the critical ecosystem grows ever more fragile. Many book critics, for instance, rely more and more on chairing events and running literary festivals for income, something that can \u2013 and does \u2013 take its effect on their reviews. Who is going to be negative about a book by a writer with whom they\u2019ll shortly share a green room? Writers do tend to know one another; their air kisses have long graced the literary pages. But the muffled sound of punches being pulled now emanates not only from, say, novelists who occasionally review, but from jobbing writers who make the majority of their income from criticism. Hatchet jobs still get written. These days, however, you\u2019re more likely to find a perfectly ordinary book acclaimed as a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d. Critical inflation is rife, and pity the innocent reader, about to rush out and buy a new hardback.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"72bd5dc8a306c4a85d8b338ccb7622d2af55bf9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72bd5dc8a306c4a85d8b338ccb7622d2af55bf9a/0_0_6064_4082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An English National Opera production of Verdi\u2019s Luisa Miller at the Coliseum, where critics were recently stripped of their plus-ones in order to make more room for bloggers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An English National Opera production of Verdi\u2019s Luisa Miller at the Coliseum, where critics were recently stripped of their plus-ones in order to make more room for bloggers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then there is the pressure that comes from places it shouldn\u2019t. Editors who insist not only on star ratings, but who prefer one-star or five-star reviews (Mark Shenton, former theatre critic of the <em>Sunday Express</em>, claimed that he was once asked to \u201camend\u201d his). Publishers and publicists who bear a grudge (a negative review for one writer may mean that you will not be given, say, an interview with another one from the same stable, irrespective of your enthusiasm for their work). Individuals who attempt what we might call news management (<em>Time Out</em>\u2019s arts editor, Eddy Frankel, recently revealed that one artist would not provide the magazine with images <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eddyfrankel/status/1222561191786172416\" title=\"\">unless he or she was given copy approval of a review prior to publication</a>). Organisations that have decided to go along with the notion that expertise counts for nothing. (Last year, English National Opera stopped giving critics a second ticket for performances in order to make more seats available to novice bloggers: \u201cOpera can be seen as a closed art form, and we think people should be able to review it more emotionally... The question is: did it make you cry, did it make you happy?\u201d said its chief executive, Stuart Murphy, of this decision.) How to work in such an environment, let alone to make a living? How to remain independent and free-thinking, passionate and engaged? It\u2019s enough to make even the best of us give up.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>That, though, is the last thing we should do \u2013 give up, I mean. Criticism is important, and the critic has a vital role to play in our culture. Some things never change. We will always need something to push against. As Julian Barnes, once the TV critic of the <em>Observer,</em> puts it: \u201cApart from anything else, criticism is a standard against which to judge our own ideas.\u201d But given the general din, the assumption that everyone is a critic now, the flummery and fake news, the sheer <em>speed</em> at which our world moves, perhaps the work of the critic is becoming more important than ever. The hot-take economy is blithely indifferent to lasting value, to working out what a work of art means, and what it might tell us about ourselves. \u201cTo me, the work of criticism is the work of close reading,\u201d says Simran Hans, the <em>Observer</em> film critic, and a writer young enough to have come of age online. For her, as for me, criticism isn\u2019t just an opinion. It\u2019s a historical document: a record of a time, a place, a particular sensibility. \u201cI don\u2019t think art exists in a vacuum,\u201d she says. \u201cI think criticism should be a work of record that is able to distil what an artwork is saying about the world in which it was made. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/04/the-most-powerful-piece-of-film-criticism-ever-written/359996/\" title=\"\">James Baldwin\u2019s The Devil Finds Work</a> [a 1976 critique of the racial politics of American cinema] is my gold standard for this.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t agree with those who assert that critics are simply those who can\u2019t write a book, shoot a film, or paint a picture themselves, and that this therefore disqualifies them from the job (the singer Lizzo once claimed only musicians should be allowed to review albums). Yes, there are dance critics who used to be members of a ballet corps, and architecture critics who were trained to design buildings; these people bring reserves of knowledge and experience. But when I published a book after years of having written about other people\u2019s, it didn\u2019t make me a better critic, nor even a more sympathetic one (in fact, I\u2019m less tolerant now than before of books that are lazy or glib). Not being able to do something oneself is no guide at all to a person\u2019s skills as a critic; to their ability to notice what matters. \u201cA critic is a man who knows the way, but can\u2019t drive the car,\u201d as the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s great theatre critic, Kenneth Tynan, once put it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9eb8906d0f0b0b002d096f80c7822162a6bbbd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9eb8906d0f0b0b002d096f80c7822162a6bbbd4/94_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taika Waititi in Jojo Rabbit\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taika Waititi\u2019s film Jojo Rabbit recently divided audiences and critics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fox Searchlight</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nor do I think it matters if the critics and the public disagree \u2013 as happened with Taika Waititi\u2019s Oscar-winning second world war story, <em>Jojo Rabbit</em> (the critics mainly loathed it; the public absolutely loved it). Consensus is a growing problem in our culture. It is inescapably the case that some artists, like some kinds of art, are deemed to be beyond criticism \u2013 something that, in my view, stifles debate every bit as much as cancel culture (it also makes life very bland and boring). Lone voices, if their disagreement is based on knowledge and insight, are crucial, and when you hear such a cry in the dark, it\u2019s often with a sense of relief. I felt this recently when I read the only review of the late Deborah Orr\u2019s memoir <em>Mother</em><em>well</em> \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2020/01/deborah-orr-s-motherwell-memoir-family-insights-and-dark-asides\" title=\"\">by the journalist Janice Turner</a> \u2013 that expressed any reservation at all about it (Turner pointed out that Orr\u2019s obsession in the book with narcissism is completely bewildering unless you know \u2013 and how could you know? \u2013 that she is really writing about her ex-husband, Will Self).</p> <p>You will say that I have a vested interest in all this, and it\u2019s true: I do. But there are lots of people, not only readers, but artists, too, who would miss critics if they were to disappear. \u201cIt completes the circle,\u201d says Richard Eyre, the theatre and film director. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have a dialogue between the work and a person who is assessing it. That is valuable.\u201d When he ran the National Theatre in the 90s, he had to read a pile of cuttings every day. How much anxiety did this cause him? \u201cA lot,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was quite painful.\u201d Did a review ever make him change his mind? \u201cI think so, yes. The ones who write and argue in the context of what you\u2019ve tried to do \u2013 you do listen, and sometimes you think: \u2018Yes, of course; I hadn\u2019t realised it could be seen like that, but I do now.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>David Eldridge, the playwright, agrees. \u201cI do read reviews. It would seem perverse not to. After all the work of writing the play, the love and the thought, and then the company pulling it together, it would be odd to avoid what people are saying about it. At their best, the critics can really share something of an evening in the theatre with their readers \u2013 and they can keep artists honest. But I tend to think reviews are most useful months after the play has closed, when you can be more reflective and thoughtful. I think they\u2019re good at picking up something being amiss, even if their diagnosis as to the cause is wrong.\u201d Reviews have made a real difference to his career \u2013 in both directions. Jack Tinker in the <em>Daily Mail</em> turned his first play, <em>Serving </em><em>It Up</em>, into a hot ticket; the <em>New York Times</em> helped to close <em>Festen</em> on Broadway after only four weeks when it \u201cpoured a cup of cold sick\u201d over it: \u201cI felt very hurt.\u201d But a writer\u2019s relationship with critics can be about more than bums on seats. He believes that the best critics helped to inform his \u201csense of self as a writer and artist\u201d by spotting his early promise and then, later, suggesting that he\u2019d fulfilled it.</p> <p>Richard Eyre grew up reading, in the <em>Observer,</em> the film critic Penelope Gilliatt, and Ken Tynan \u2013 \u201cYou had to see what their view was, because it mattered\u201d \u2013 and he believes that, at its highest level, criticism can be a work of art in its own right. Which brings us back to where we started: with my jokes about Mary Beard and her nudes. In the end, it\u2019s the job of the critic not only to inform, to challenge, to try to put something down for posterity, but to entertain; to use words to dazzle the reader with a sense of exactitude; to cause a feeling of rightness and sudden conviction to fall on them like \u2013 to pinch from Philip Larkin \u2013 an enormous yes (Larkin, by the way, was a brilliant critic). Criticism that can do these things is not disposable. It\u2019s as timeless, sometimes, as the thing it describes.</p> <p>When I finish talking to Eyre, I carry out a small experiment, opening at random a copy of <em>Tynan Left &amp; Right</em>, a collection of his work from 1967. The first thing I see is a review of a play that was, until recently, on at the Almeida theatre in London: <em>The Duchess of Malfi</em> by John Webster. Naturally, the actors who were then appearing in it at the Aldwych \u2013 Peggy Ashcroft and Eric Porter \u2013 are both long dead; his thoughts about their performances don\u2019t really interest me. But every word of what he says about Webster \u2013 to which he devotes most of his review \u2013 is so thrillingly veracious as to be almost preposterous. (\u201cIdeally, one feels, he would have had all his characters drowned in a sea of cold sweat,\u201d Tynan writes of the playwright\u2019s horrible way with his own creations.) Here was a review that felt brand new: as alive to me in 2020 as it must have been to the subeditor who received it late one night in 1960 and, realising in an instant it was pure gold, treated himself to another cigarette.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Rachel Cooke is a feature writer and book critic for the Observer</em></p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>The parents of young adults who break coronavirus lockdown rules should be sanctioned, a senior police officer has said, amid confusion over the enforcement of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-suspects-may-be-detained-under-uk-emergency-powers\">new powers</a> to prevent the spread of Covid-19.</p> <p>Ken Marsh, the head of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said that the parents of older teenagers should be forced to pay fines if they were caught ignoring government guidance.</p> <p>On Thursday, emergency legislation granted police new powers that allow officers to issue \u00a360 on-the-spot fines or even make arrests for breaches of the UK\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules.</p> <p>Marsh, whose federation represents 30,000 officers in the capital, said that the new rules did not provide adequate enforcement measures where more than two teenagers had gathered and refused to follow a police instruction to go home: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take them home, but when we take them home, why can\u2019t we fine their parents?

On Friday, Derbyshire police were criticised after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/uk-police-use-drones-and-roadblocks-to-enforce-lockdown\">releasing drone footage</a> of walkers at a beauty spot along with the warning that such exercise did not constitute \u201cessential travel\u201d.</p> <p>Former justice secretary David Gauke described Derbyshire Police\u2019s shaming of ramblers as \u201cbadly misjudged\u201d. The Irish government this weekend announced new restrictions including a rule that all exercise must take place within 2km of people\u2019s homes.</p> <p>Cumbrian police have warned that the Lake District is closed and <a href=\"https://northyorkshire.police.uk/news/covid-checkpoints/\">checkpoints have been put in place</a> at beaches and other locations to try to stop people travelling there to walk their dogs or exercise.</p> <p>The majority of the public appear to be following the social distancing guidance although police chiefs have confirmed that within 24 hours of the new powers coming into operation they had started issuing fines. No overall numbers have been released.</p> <p>Officers policing London believe that the weekend will provide a better indication of whether the public will abide by the lockdown measures.</p> <p>Marsh said: \u201cThis weekend will be the acid test, particularly if the weather is nice. The public need to come with us on this one because we police by consent. In a European country it\u2019s very easy because they can point a gun in their face, we can\u2019t do that. You\u2019ve got to cajole, educate.\u201d</p> <p>He said that enforcing the measures could be \u201cvery challenging\u201d particularly if officers had to arrest a person who refused to comply with the coronavirus measures, while following the government\u2019s guidance to stay two metres away from other people: \u201cIts going to be very challenging if they turn around and say: \u2018Bugger off\u2019 because, firstly, we\u2019re meant to be two metres from them.\u201d</p> <p>Every force in England and Wales has drawn up contingency measures for coping with absentees as large numbers of officers report sick or self-isolate. March said that the Met had 3,600 officers off sick \u2013 12% of its total workforce, although officers were returning to the frontline when they recovered.</p> <p>He warned that the capital could become difficult to police in \u201cthree to four days\u201d if there were a sharp downturn in officer availability owing to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s relatively hands-off approach to policing the coronavirus crisis differs markedly from some other countries. South African police, for example, yesterday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/south-africa-police-rubber-bullets-shoppers-covid-19-lockdown\">fired rubber bullets</a> on hundreds of shoppers queueing outside a supermarket in Johannesburg.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Q: I\u2019m a huge fan of John Mortimer and have yet to find a replacement for Rumpole.

But, for stories that have the ability to distract and even entertain, you could try the Robbie Munro series by William McIntyre (himself a Scottish solicitor). The books feature a criminal defence lawyer who lifts the lid on the peculiarities of Scots law through his cases. The latest, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/fixed-odds-9781912240722.html\" title=\"\">Fixed Odds</a></em>, is thoroughly entertaining.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/take-it-back-9780008314675.html\" title=\"\">Take It Back</a></em> by Kia Abdullah gives a different take on a legal thriller, with a former criminal barrister, Zara Kaleel, seeking justice in a topical and gritty story of an explosive rape trial.</p> <p>There\u2019s plenty of action, both in and out of court, to be found in the Michael Devlin books by practising barrister Tony Kent, the most recent of which is <em>Power Play</em>. Devlin is a maverick criminal barrister with a past, drawn into a series of high-octane adventures, the scope of which go far beyond the Old Bailey into the world of geo-political conspiracy.</p> <p>If that sounds a bit too disturbing for our troubled times, try <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/nov/20/featuresreviews.guardianreview13\" title=\"\">Old Filth</a></em> by Jane Gardam. The journey of Sir Edward Feathers, from failed London barrister to Hong Kong judge and beyond, is very moving, perhaps even too much so right now.</p> <p>There are a few nonfiction books I\u2019d suggest that show how close Rumpole is to the truth of practice. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/28/secret-barrister-stories-law-review-justice-system\" title=\"\">The Secret Barrister</a></em> speaks for itself, and Alex McBride\u2019s <em>Defending the Guilty</em> drew many a breath of recognition (and laughs) from me in its description of the early years of criminal practice. Back to fiction, Caro Fraser\u2019s <em>The Pupil</em> also offers an insight into the machinations of chambers, as do Tim Kevan\u2019s books <em>Law </em><em>and Disorder</em> and <em>Law </em><em>and Peace</em>.</p> <p>Finally, I advise seeking retreat in the Just William stories by Richmal Crompton.

  "<p>Where did the virus causing the current pandemic come from? How did it get to a food market in Wuhan, China, from where it is thought to have spilled over into humans? The answers to these questions are gradually being pieced together, and the story they tell makes for uncomfortable reading.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start at the beginning. As of 17 March, we know that the Sars-CoV-2 virus (a member of the coronavirus family that causes the respiratory illness Covid-19) is the product of natural evolution. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9\">A study of its genetic s</a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9\">equence</a>, conducted by infectious disease expert Kristian G Andersen of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, and colleagues, rules out the possibility that it could have been manufactured in a lab or otherwise engineered. Puff go the conspiracy theories.</p> <p>The next step is a little less certain, but it seems likely that the original animal reservoir for the virus was bats. Andersen\u2019s team showed \u2013 like the Chinese before them \u2013that the sequence of Sars-CoV-2 is similar to other coronaviruses that infect bats.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Since other bat coronaviruses have transited to humans via an intermediate animal host, it seems likely that this one did too. That animal was probably one that some Chinese people like to eat, and that is therefore sold in \u201cwet\u201d markets (those that sell fresh meat, fish, seafood and other produce). This animal may have been the scaly mammal called a pangolin. That can\u2019t be conclusively proved, but several groups have found sequence similarities between Sars-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses that infect pangolins.</p> <p>If this is indeed the route the virus took to humans, it has two critical interfaces: one between us and the intermediate host, possibly a pangolin, and one between that host and bats. Most of the attention so far has been focused on the interface between humans and the intermediate host, with fingers of blame being pointed at Chinese wet markets and eating habits, but both interfaces were required for the pandemic to ignite. So where and how did the spillover from the bat to the pangolin \u2013 or other wild or semi-wild intermediate host \u2013 occur?</p> <p>\u201cOur study does not directly shed light on the geographical origin of the virus,\u201d says Andersen. \u201cHowever, all the available evidence shows that it was inside China.\u201d</p> <p>Case closed then, and President Trump is right to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\">call S</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\">ars-CoV-2 the \u201cChinese virus\u201d</a>. Well, no, because if you want to understand why this pandemic happened now and not, say, 20 years ago \u2013 since Chinese people\u2019s taste for what we in the west consider exotic fare is not new \u2013 you have to include a number of other factors. \u201cWe can blame the object \u2013 the virus, the cultural practice \u2013 but causality extends out into the relationships between people and ecology,\u201d says evolutionary biologist Rob Wallace of the Agroecology and Rural Economics Research Corps in St Paul, Minnesota.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af1a5624e7aad3f184147d07b18c1f58af9f6e76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af1a5624e7aad3f184147d07b18c1f58af9f6e76/0_185_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, in China\u2019s Hubei Province, in January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, in China\u2019s Hubei Province, in January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noel Celis/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Starting in the 1990s, as part of its economic transformation, China ramped up its food production systems to industrial scale. One side effect of this, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-shutting-down-chinese-wet-markets-could-be-a-terrible-mistake-130625\">as anthropologists </a><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-shutting-down-chinese-wet-markets-could-be-a-terrible-mistake-130625\">Lyle Fearnley and Christos Lynteris</a><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-shutting-down-chinese-wet-markets-could-be-a-terrible-mistake-130625\"> have documented</a>, was that smallholding farmers were undercut and pushed out of the livestock industry. Searching for a new way to earn a living, some of them turned to farming \u201cwild\u201d species that had previously been eaten for subsistence only. Wild food was formalised as a sector, and was increasingly branded as a luxury product. But the smallholders weren\u2019t only pushed out economically. As industrial farming concerns took up more and more land, these small-scale farmers were pushed out geographically too \u2013 closer to uncultivable zones. Closer to the edge of the forest, that is, where bats and the viruses that infect them lurk. The density and frequency of contacts at that first interface increased, and hence, so did the risk of a spillover.</p> <p>It\u2019s true, in other words, that an expanding human population pushing into previously undisturbed ecosystems has contributed to the increasing number of zoonoses \u2013 human infections of animal origin \u2013 in recent decades. That has been documented for Ebola and HIV, for example. But behind that shift has been another, in the way food is produced. Modern models of agribusiness are contributing to the emergence of zoonoses.</p> <p><br>Take flu, a disease that is considered to have high pandemic potential, having caused an estimated 15 pandemics in the past 500 years. \u201cThere is clearly a link between the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses and intensified poultry production systems,\u201d says spatial epidemiologist Marius Gilbert of the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e0573688276e584fe1409eb5358e14f24d95fff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e0573688276e584fe1409eb5358e14f24d95fff/0_41_3008_1806/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pangolin, the scaly mammal thought to be a possible intermediate host for the coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pangolin, the scaly mammal thought to be a possible intermediate host for the coronavirus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: N/A</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The reasons, many of which were documented in Wallace\u2019s 2016 book <em><a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9781583675892/big-farms-make-big-flu/\">Big Farms Make Big Flu</a></em>, include the density with which chickens, turkeys or other poultry are packed into factory farms, and the fact that the birds in a given farm tend to be near genetic clones of one another \u2013 having been selected over decades for desirable traits such as lean meat. If a virus gets introduced into such a flock, it can race through it without meeting any resistance in the form of genetic variants that prevent its spread. Both experimental manipulations and observations in the real world have demonstrated that this process can result in a ratcheting up of the virus\u2019s virulence. If it then spills over into humans, we are potentially in trouble.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2018.00084/full\">a paper published in 2018</a>, Gilbert\u2019s group reviewed historical \u201cconversion events\u201d, as they call them \u2013 when a not-very-pathogenic avian flu strain became much more dangerous, and found that most of them had occurred in commercial poultry systems, and more frequently in wealthy countries. Europe, Australia and the US had generated more of them than China.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t let China off the hook. Two highly pathogenic forms of avian flu \u2013 H5N1 and H7N9 \u2013 have emerged in that country in recent decades. Both infect humans, though not easily (yet). The first human cases of H7N9 were reported in 2013, and there were small annual outbreaks thereafter. But, says Gilbert, \u201cnothing was done until the virus turned out to be pathogenic for chickens as well. Then it became an important economic issue and China started to mass-vaccinate its poultry against H7N9, and that ended the transmission to humans.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a48b0309e695838ee46c8ce80a8107f492bff522\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a48b0309e695838ee46c8ce80a8107f492bff522/0_24_4928_2959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A banner reading \u201cWe are all pangolins\u201d hangs on a balcony in Bordeaux, France\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A banner reading \u2018We are all pangolins\u2019 hangs on a balcony in Bordeaux, France. The entire country has been on coronavirus lockdown since 16 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicolas Tucat/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>China is one of the world\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.worldstopexports.com/chicken-exports-by-country/\">major exporters of poultry</a>, but its poultry industry is not wholly Chinese-owned. After the recession of 2008, for example, New York-based investment bank Goldman Sachs diversified its holdings and <a href=\"https://thepoultrysite.com/news/2008/08/goldman-sachs-buys-chinese-poultry-farms\">moved into Chinese poultry farms</a>. So if China has its share of responsibility for spillover events, it isn\u2019t alone. That is why Wallace insists on talking about relational geographies rather than absolute geographies, when it comes to identifying the causes of disease. Or as he puts it: \u201cFollow the money.\u201d</p> <p>Not everybody sees a straightforward link between factory farming and new and dangerous forms of flu. Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona, points out that before they were brought into factory farms, poultry were kept outside. The factory model may ramp up virulence, he says, but it probably protects a flock from being infected by a virus in the first place.</p> <p>Still, Worobey doesn\u2019t doubt that farming and other human-animal interactions have shaped our disease ecology. His group collects the sequences of flu viruses from a range of animal hosts, including humans, and plots them on a family treeto try to understand how flu has evolved over time. Flu is constantly mutating \u2013 that\u2019s the reason the seasonal flu vaccine has to be updated each year \u2013 but it mutates at different rates in different hosts, which means that his flu family tree is informative both about the parentage and intermediate host of each strain and about the approximate timing of past spillover events.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible \u2013 though by no means certain \u2013 that flu first became a disease of humans after the Chinese domesticated ducks about 4,000 years ago \u2013 drawing that animal reservoir into human communities for the first time. But humans can also catch flu from, and give flu to, pigs \u2013 another animal we have lived alongside for millennia. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24531761\">A few years ago, Worobey suggested</a> \u2013 controversially \u2013 that birds might not always have been the main intermediate host for human flu viruses. Until about a century ago, he reported, people may have caught flu from horses. Around the time that motor vehicles supplanted horses as transport, poultry farming was expanding in the western hemisphere, and it\u2019s possible, Worobey argued, that birds then took over as the main intermediate host of flu for humans.</p> <p>Not everyone buys that scenario. Wendy Barclay, a virologist at Imperial College London, says that if horses were once the main intermediate host for flu, \u201cmost avian viruses would contain the mammalian adaptation\u201d, and they don\u2019t. David Morens of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, thinks that it is more likely that the horse was a temporary detour, and that the main intermediate host of flu for humans has always been birds \u2013 especially wild ones. But all agree that humans have shaped these host-pathogen relationships, through our use of land and other animal species. And as Worobey points out, the sheer size of the human population today means that in the 21st century, we are doing so on an unprecedented scale. He estimates, for example, that domesticated ducks probably outnumber wild ones by now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77547b476425077b6dfa0119ca40c060471263b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77547b476425077b6dfa0119ca40c060471263b8/0_276_4356_2614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traders selling bat meat at a market in Tomohon City, Indonesia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traders selling bat meat at a market in Tomohon City, Indonesia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronny Adolof Buol/Sijori Images via Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And we\u2019re not just talking about birds. Gilbert believes a ratcheting up of viral virulence is happening in pig herds, too. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), a disease of pigs that was <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9545131\">first described in the US in the </a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9545131\">late 1980s</a>, has since spread to herds across the worldand strains detected recently in China are more virulent than the early American ones. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms7696\">A </a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms7696\">2015</a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms7696\"> study</a> carried out by Martha Nelson of the US National Institutes of Health and colleagues mapped the genetic sequences of swine flu viruses and found that Europe and the US \u2013 the largest global exporters of pigs \u2013 are also the largest exporters of swine flu.</p> <p>There have been claims on social media, sometimes posted by vegans, that if we ate less meat there would have been no Covid-19. Interestingly, some of these have been <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/03/18/coronavirus-fact-check-covid-19-caused-eating-animals/5073094002/\">blocked by mainstream news organisations</a> as \u201cpartly false\u201d. But the claims are also partly true. Though the links they draw are too simplistic, the evidence is now strong that the way meat is produced \u2013 and not just in China \u2013 contributed to Covid-19.</p> <p>It is clear that to prevent or at least slow the emergence of new zoonoses, as Fearnley and Lynteris have argued, China\u2019s wet markets will need to be better regulated. But we also need to look behind those markets, at how our food is produced globally.</p> <p>Though it may not feel like it now, Wallace says, we have been lucky with Sars-CoV-2. It appears to be far less lethal that either H7N9 \u2013 which kills around a third of those it infects \u2013 or H5N1, which kills even more. This gives us an opportunity, he says, to question our lifestyle choices \u2013 because chicken isn\u2019t cheap if it costs a million lives \u2013 and vote for politicians who hold agribusiness to higher standards of ecological, social and epidemiological sustainability. \u201cHopefully,\u201d he says, \u201cthis will change our notions about agricultural production, land use and conservation.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>With the result of the Labour party leadership contest imminent, I thought I\u2019d be so happy to see the back of Jeremy Corbyn. Now I\u2019m wondering if we ever will.</p> <p>While I would never trivialise coronavirus, at least we\u2019ve been spared mass gatherings of people in \u201cJust say Jez\u201d T-shirts sobbing mawkish goodbyes to the man who \u201cwon the argument\u201d, while tanking two general elections (including the worst Labour result for 85 years). He also presided over a culture of (cough) \u201calleged\u201d antisemitism now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/equality-body-launches-investigation-of-labour-antisemitism-claims\">under investigation </a>by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and facilitated Brexit.</p> <p>Despite all this, not so long ago Corbyn was angling for a shadow cabinet position. One wonders which element of his failure, incompetence and disgrace he thinks could prove useful? Such puffs of hubris indicate that he is having a hard time relinquishing the power he claims to have so little interest in. Corbyn has no intention of going quietly, or indeed at all.</p> <p>None of this has been helped by the protracted leadership contest, though thank Christ they didn\u2019t shorten it, or we\u2019d never have heard the end of it (\u201cIt was rigged!\u201d). Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband left quietly. As did Tony Blair \u2013 and <em>he</em> actually won elections. Compare and contrast with Corbyn and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-mcdonnell\">John McDonnell</a>, and their relentless self-eulogising blather.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The blood turned to ice as Corbyn said: 'My voice will not be stilled. I\u2019ll be around\u2026 I\u2019ll be arguing.'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52048213\">recent interview</a>, Corbyn asserted that the government\u2019s response to coronavirus proved him \u201cabsolutely right\u201d about public spending. (I\u2019m no Tory, but since when did acute emergency measures prove anybody\u2019s point?) He also complained yet again about media abuse. Dude, seriously, it\u2019s part of the job! The way Corbyn goes on, you\u2019d think all previous opposition leaders were transported into election campaigns reclining upon velvet cushions, fanned with ostrich feathers by an adoring, indulgent media.</p> <p>At Corbyn\u2019s final PMQs, Boris Johnson paid tribute to his \u201csincerity\u201d. Corbyn bristled, and quite right too: Johnson should have thanked him properly for enabling the huge Tory majority. However, the blood turned to ice as Corbyn said: \u201cMy voice will not be stilled. I\u2019ll be around\u2026 I\u2019ll be arguing.\u201d Yes, Jeremy, but arguing with whom? The Tories, or the next leader of the Labour party?</p> <p>So people like me might as well pack away the bunting \u2013 whisper it with dread: <em>Corbyn isn\u2019t going anywhere</em>. It\u2019s bad enough that we\u2019re going to have to keep putting up with his unique brand of peevish moral superiority \u2013 far worse is the now turbo-boosted entitlement he clearly feels to make the next Labour leader\u2019s life a living hell.

Good.\u201d Is this the lifelong <em>froideur</em> we have to look forward to with Kim Kardashian and Taylor Swift, now that their ancient ding-dong has been reprised?</p> <p>Recap: in 2016, Kardashian\u2019s husband, Kanye West, released the song Famous, containing the lyric \u201cI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex. Why? I made that bitch famous\u201d, referring to his on-stage interruption of Swift at the 2009 MTV awards. When Swift objected to \u201cbitch\u201d, he said she\u2019d given him permission over the phone, leading Kardashian to release a recording of Swift apparently doing just that.</p> <p>Now it emerges that Kardashian trimmed the recording and permission wasn\u2019t given. Swift acknowledged this development, but urged her fans to focus on a hunger relief charity. Kardashian wasn\u2019t quite so full of grace, spraying around tweets calling Swift a liar, then announcing: \u201cThis will be the last time I speak on this because, honestly, nobody cares.\u201d</p> <p>Not so fast, Kim. Right now, under lockdown, like many others running out of amusing cat photos to post online, I\u2019m prepared to \u201ccare\u201d about all kinds of doo-dah. Indeed, however this spat ends, I\u2019d like to thank Ms Kardashian for her lack of self-awareness. It\u2019s impressive that her levels of self-absorption can\u2019t even be halted by a pandemic.</p> <p>Right now, in the \u201ccovidiot\u201d era, questions are being asked about what we really want from celebrities. Sometimes, the honest answer is <em>this</em>: monstrous out-of-control egos making fools of themselves. Kardashian is correct \u2013 no one cares, but the fact that people like her still do is a tonic right now.</p> <h2>Not so cushy working from home, is it, people?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f358f4af8e63f60ab93875925998c0e0e676cb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f358f4af8e63f60ab93875925998c0e0e676cb3/0_334_7157_4296/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man trying to work at a laptop surrounded by small children\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Show me the child who cares one jot about your deadlines.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a time for us all to pull together as one. Still, habitual office-goers of Britain, admit it \u2013 working from home isn\u2019t such a doddle, is it?</p> <p>I\u2019ve been noticing items about lawyers, business types and the like, who\u2019ve been forced to work from home, trying to carve out a modicum of workspace privacy, in some cases, putting \u201camusing\u201d signs on home office doors to keep the kids away. Ha ha ha! Amateurs!</p> <p>People across the land seem to be finding out that working from home isn\u2019t the cushy number it\u2019s made out to be. It\u2019s not just about typing in your pyjamas (though obviously that\u2019s a major perk). As all we seasoned home-workers know, the needs of the house, and its occupants, tend to seep osmosis-style into your personal workspace. Show me the child who cares one jot about your deadlines. Feel the deepening rage when somebody wonders if you could just pop some washing on if you \u201cget a mo\u201d. And so on. Every minute of every hour of every day. For ever.</p> <p>Perhaps now it\u2019s clearer to office-bound folk that one doesn\u2019t have to travel to another building to be working. One positive thing to emerge from all this may be some overdue respect for the nation\u2019s stoic, beleaguered home-workers.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist</em></p>",
  "<p>There has been much talk during the current crisis of wartime measures and the \u201cblitz spirit\u201d amid the reports of good deeds and selfless volunteering. What may receive less publicity are the activities of those, as in the second world war, who will use these extraordinary circumstances not so much to help others as to help themselves.</p> <p>While the traditional picture of wartime Britain is of a nation pulling steadfastly together, in fact the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/aug/29/blitz-london-crime-flourish-blackout\">crime rate rose by 57</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/aug/29/blitz-london-crime-flourish-blackout\">% </a>and everything from black-market racketeering and looting of bombed premises to the forging of ration cards and even murder disguised as enemy action was taking place.</p> <p>As is happening now in some countries, the outbreak of war in 1939 led to the early release of some criminals from prison. One of them was Billy Hill, a dapper gangster who would later recount his delight at being able to plunder at home as the nation fought Hitler abroad. \u201cThat big, wide, handsome and, oh, so profitable black market walked into our ever open arms,\u201d said Hill in his ghosted autobiography, <em>Boss of Britain\u2019s Underworld</em>. \u201cSome day someone should write a treatise on Britain\u2019s wartime black market. It was the most fantastic side of civilian life in wartime.\u201d</p> <p>The items sought on the black markets then \u2013 whisky, candles, sugar, light bulbs and so on \u2013 may differ from toilet paper, hand sanitisers and ventilators but the shortages and panic provided the same openings for the canny crook. Despite spells back inside, Hill emerged from the war a wealthy man.</p> <p>Already we are hearing of thefts and break-ins to chemists and warehouses. Essex police reported last week that they had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/21/three-men-arrested-in-essex-after-haul-of-loo-roll-found-in-van\">arrested three people</a> for burglary after a 999 call and found the thieves\u2019 van stuffed with stolen toilet paper. The nickname given the alleged culprits in the media \u2013 \u201cthe bog roll bandits\u201d \u2013may not have quite the same cachet as the Great Train Robbers but doubtless a film is already being planned. In Hong Kong last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/17/hong-kong-armed-gang-steals-toilet-rolls-as-coronavirus-panic-buying-spreads\">armed robbers stole 600 toilet rolls </a>from outside a supermarket. Who would have thought that one day the professional criminal would move from payroll to toilet-roll robberies?</p> <p>And who would have thought that in 2020 the recommended outfit for the responsible citizen would be the criminal\u2019s uniform of choice \u2013 a mask and gloves? During the blitz, thieves liked to kit themselves out with an ARP (air raid precautions) warden\u2019s helmet and armband as they helped themselves to goods from bomb-damaged shops. Now Leicestershire police have already <a href=\"https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/warning-issued-after-doorstep-scammer-3933848\">issued warnings</a> about people, doubtless with a very convincing self-made ID card, knocking on doors offering instant Covid-19 tests for cash.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Who would have thought that one day the professional criminal would move from payroll to toilet-roll robberies?</p> <footer> <cite>Duncan Campbell</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Metropolitan police warned last week of <a href=\"http://news.met.police.uk/news/warning-issued-to-the-public-over-coronavirus-related-fraud-397764\">fraudsters</a>, purporting to be from research organisations affiliated to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), who are contacting people by email and asking them to click on to a bogus website. \u201cThe emails are often sophisticated and look quite convincing,\u201d say the Met. Another scam is a site that offers advice on free school meals, asking parents to send their financial details to see if they qualify for help.</p> <p>The government is now promising compensation to those whose jobs are lost or businesses bankrupted. One wartime scam came into play after Luftwaffe raids because the government would pay \u00a3500 to those who had lost their homes to the bombs. In those trusting days, one chap, Walter Handy, claimed to have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/aug/29/blitz-london-crime-flourish-blackout\">\u201cbombed out\u201d on 19 occasions</a>. He pushed his luck and was eventually jailed for three years. While the vast majority of those seeking help now are doubtless honest and in need, there may be no shortage of what the wartime BBC described as \u201cspivs and drones\u201d among them.</p> <p>Rationing has yet to be introduced even for the elusive toilet roll but, at the height of the war, theft of clothing coupons was rife. Even Ivor Novello, composer of the famous first world war song, Keep the Home Fires Burning, was <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/129235/Britain-s-war-crimes\">jailed for four weeks </a>in 1944 for the misuse of petrol coupons given to him by a female fan and by the end of the war there had been more than 114,000 prosecutions for black marketeering.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So far today, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-crisis-leads-to-precipitous-drop-in-recorded\">overall crime figures have dropped</a>. Andy Cooke, the Merseyside chief constable, noted on Wednesday that \u201cthere is less violence from pub fights, less burglaries as everyone is at home\u201d but warns that \u201cwhat you will see are increases in domestic violence, with people cooped up in the same home, and internet crime such as fraud and scams\u201d.</p> <p>Profiteering from the current crisis is already under way at an international level. Last week, US customs officers seized what appeared to be <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/fake-coronavirus-test-kits-seized-los-angeles-airport/story?id=69600617\">fake Covid-19 tests</a> at Los Angeles airport in a package that had come from Britain. Jury trials are currently suspended for the foreseeable future but when they return those who have used the virus for their own ends may find that \u201clockdown\u201d in Wormwood Scrubs or Barlinnie jail is not quite as cosy and public-spirited as the one currently imposed on the nation.</p> <p>In 1941, at the height of the blitz, one <a href=\"https://steemit.com/story/@claudia/the-world-of-crime-harry-dobkin-the-blitz-butcher\">Harry Dobkin</a> strangled his wife, Rachel, and left her body at a London bomb site in the hope that she would be seen as a victim of the Luftwaffe rather than a cunning husband. He didn\u2019t get away with it and was hanged in Wandsworth prison. So far there have been no reports of similar opportunistic attempts but who knows, with the police\u2019s attention elsewhere and few potential witnesses on the street, what quiet gangland revenge plot could now be under way to arrange the \u201csocial distancing\u201d of a rival for ever?<br></p>",

Scotland 3-2 Holland (Rep 72)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Yep, this is Scotland all right. Having battled to within one goal of making it through, here comes instant deflation. Hartford slides a pass forward to Dalglish on the edge of the D. The striker looks to turn to his right but is crowded out. So close to breaking through for that killer blow. But then comes the killer blow Scotland didn\u2019t want. Krol jogs towards the halfway line and finds Rep on the right, just inside his own half. Rep flicks back to Krol, who has advanced down the channel. Krol then returns the favour, with Rep underlapping him on the inside, picking up speed. Scotland don\u2019t close him down, and from 30 yards he unleashes a rising shot towards the top-left corner. Rough does his best to get a hand to it \u2013 the ball might even have brushed the tips of his gloved fingers \u2013 but that just can\u2019t be stopped! Rep turns, a toothy grin spreading over his face more in relief than celebration. In the background, Gemmill looks totally distraught, his once-in-a-lifetime achievement, his career pinnacle, his work of art, rendered worthless junk after 202 seconds.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e7f7aa98f081e5eda238a56\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-28T16:28:17.553Z\">4.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>70 min:</strong> That was arguably the greatest goal ever scored at a World Cup! What a slalom! What genius! But this is Scotland, and so inevitably it\u2019s nearly followed up by the most laughable own goal of all time. Jansen goes on a lumber down the right and wins a free kick, shoulder-charged with unnecessary force by Buchan. Boskamp takes the set piece, whipping the ball through the six-yard area. Rough flaps. Kennedy connects at the far post, knocking a downward header behind for a corner \u2013 but only missing the left-hand post by an inch or so! It\u2019s a small wonder that didn\u2019t find the net. He was under no pressure whatsoever! Nothing comes from the resulting corner, but dearie me.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e7f7a2b8f0878a2a48ac1e5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-28T16:26:01.231Z\">4.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">GOL! GOL!!! GOOOOOOOL!!!!! Escocia 3-1 Holanda!!!!!!! (Gemmill 69)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Kennedy scoops the ball down the right to Dalglish, who picks up possession ahead of Poortvliet on the right-hand edge of the area. He steps out towards the wing and makes space to turn, then looks to burst into a gap between Poortvliet on his right and Jansen to his left. He manages that, but Krol slides in to tackle. The ball breaks back up the wing to Gemmill, who takes six of the best touches you\u2019ll ever see in a World Cup finals! One: to nip the loose ball inside and away from Jansen. Two: he turns and faces goal. Three: he nudges the ball past Krol, desperately sliding out but destined to skitter hysterically upfield and out of the picture. Four: he prods the ball into the area past another hapless slide from Poortvliet. Five: he takes a touch to allow himself to open his body up to goal. Six: he caresses an exquisite chip into the middle of the goal, over the hopeless spread of Jongbloed. Wow! Gemmill is entitled to race 16 times around the stadium after that, but satisfies himself with a few fist clenches and a jog back to the halfway line. That\u2019s a thing of artistic beauty, made better by poor Jongbloed\u2019s position during the money shot: splayed chest down on the turf, but looking up and backwards in impotent distress as the ball sailed into the net.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6f92e4904b34061ef08775f60d721c5822c4204\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6f92e4904b34061ef08775f60d721c5822c4204/0_0_2016_1210/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Archie Gemmill scores\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Archie Gemmill jinks one way ....</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae588500844f9f65a6e1cfe5484b1f30cbf037cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae588500844f9f65a6e1cfe5484b1f30cbf037cf/0_0_1888_1134/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Archie Gemmill scores\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Then the other ...</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3556fa27f55f5aee0617a8809142fbd2d5a5a391\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3556fa27f55f5aee0617a8809142fbd2d5a5a391/0_0_1824_1095/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Archie Gemmill scores\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Then nutmegs Jan Poortvliet ...</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dcbe70364cebaf0a605ac382d7318cf70ad87c45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dcbe70364cebaf0a605ac382d7318cf70ad87c45/0_0_3455_2786/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Before slotting the ball home.

It\u2019s all right playing well tonight, and we\u2019re playing exceptionally well, but it\u2019s all down to attitude.

He turns, contemplating a backpass, but his dithering allows Rensenbrink to prod the ball away from him, down the Dutch left. Rep swarms in to pick up the loose ball and race into the area. He looks to go outside the advancing Rough, but he\u2019s bundled over by Kennedy, desperate to catch up and atone. A no-brainer for the referee.

Boskamp pings a crossfield pass to Rene van der Kerkhof down the right. The resulting cross is headed down lamely by Forsyth to the edge of his own area, where Souness is forced into a desperate last-ditch tackle as Boskamp rushes in to shoot. Scotland rush upfield through Dalglish. He races sportingly past Rijsbergen, who has been down for a minute or so after landing awkwardly from an aerial challenge with Jordan. Fair enough, the Dutch were more than happy to attack while their player was rolling about in agony. Dalglish hoicks up the wing to Rioch, who is shoved out of the way by Rep, then hacks at the Dutch star\u2019s ankles in frustration.

The striker\u2019s clear, but he\u2019s not getting to the ball ahead of Rough, who races from his area and slides along the ground to smother with his hands! Either he\u2019s still suffering from that bang to the noggin, and maybe too much sun to the neep, or more likely that was as cynical as it comes. He trots back to his goalline with the ball tucked under his arm, not a trace of guilt or regret on his face. All Holland get is a free kick just to the left of the D.

As harbingers go, this one\u2019s been a doozy.</p> <p><strong>In retrospect, perhaps they\u2019d have been better off putting the thing into neutral and letting it run all the way back down the mountain before getting the first available return flight.</strong> Because ever since then, nothing at all has gone the way of Ally MacLeod and his beleaguered squad. The <em>selecci\u00f3n escocesa</em> is brimming with world-class talent - reigning European club champions Kenny Dalglish and Graeme Souness of Liverpool; Archie Gemmill, who has just won the First Division with Nottingham Forest; the well-regarded Manchester United pair of Joe Jordan and Martin Buchan - so hopes of returning home with \u201ca medal of some sort\u201d weren\u2019t too fanciful. It seemed a fair-enough shout at the time: at the outset, they were the fifth favourites with the bookies, behind Brazil, Argentina, West Germany and Holland. But you can bet your bottom peso that Ally now wishes he had kept his mouth shut and his feet on the ground, and hadn\u2019t tempted the gods and goddesses of fate in such a brazen, reckless manner.</p> <p><strong>As we\u2019re all too painfully aware, Scotland\u2019s Group Four campaign has been a downright, copper-bottomed, risible fiasco.</strong> They were thoroughly outplayed by Teofilo Cubilas and Peru, then humiliated by Iran. Throw on top Willie Johnston and his pep-pills; Don Masson\u2019s ludicrous false confession that he was also necking speedy sweeties, an attempt to take some heat off Johnston that must have made sense in his head at the time; rows in the camp over pooled sponsorship cash and bonus money; and the press conference Ally held after the Iran debacle, which saw him attempt to pat a stray dog while self-deprecatingly quipping that \u201cthis wee fellow is my only friend at the moment!\u201d The dog bit him. Of <em>course</em> it did.</p> <p><strong>All of which means to say: </strong>Scotland really will shake \u2018em up if they win the World Cup ... because in order to stay in this year\u2019s tournament, they\u2019ll have to beat Holland by three clear goals tonight at the sparkling new Estadio Ciudad de Mendoza, set in a sunken natural bowl at the foot of the Andes. Good luck with that, then! At least the views are good.</p> <p><strong>But there\u2019s no point going into battle completely bereft of hope.</strong> And Scotland should take heart from the fact that this Dutch side aren\u2019t anywhere near as good as the 1974 vintage that really should have won the World Cup in West Germany. They don\u2019t have the recalcitrant Johan Cruyff around any more, for a start. They also haven\u2019t been on particularly good form here in Argentina, slightly flattered by a 3-0 win over Iran, toothless up front during a goalless draw with Peru. So Scotland aren\u2019t dreaming an impossible dream. Mind you, Holland do still have Ruud Krol, Johnny Rep, Johan Neeskens and Rob Rensenbrink in their ranks. Two teams meet tonight having played well below their potential; it\u2019ll all depend on who finally clicks into gear.

It has been estimated that the cull has cost the taxpayer more than \u00a360m.</p> <p>The figures were supposed to have been published months ago but were delayed as the efficacy of the government\u2019s policy came in for criticism.</p> <p>\u201cBadgers are now being slaughtered at such a rate across England that they could face local extinction in areas of the country which they have inhabited since the Ice Age,\u201d Dyer said.</p> <p>\u201cDespite this mass destruction of a protected species, the government has failed to produce any reliable evidence to prove that the culling of badgers is making any significant impact on lowering bovine-TB in cattle in or around the cull zones.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/05/badger-cull-phased-out-replaced-vaccinations-bovine-tb-england\">'Seismic shift\u2019: ministers signal end of badger cull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In response to an independent review into its TB policy, the government recently acknowledged that the mass slaughter of badgers was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/05/badger-cull-phased-out-replaced-vaccinations-bovine-tb-england\">not a long-term solution</a> to reducing bovine-TB. Instead there is to be a new emphasis on vaccinating cattle against the disease.</p> <p>But farmers insist a cull is necessary. The <a href=\"https://www.nfuonline.com/sectors/animal-health/animal-health-rh-panel/bovine-tb/\">National Farmers Union</a> has expressed frustration that culling and badger vaccination are being given a \u201cfalse equivalence\u201d. The NFU said vaccination had never been demonstrated to reduce bovine-TB with the same efficacy as culling.</p> <p>Following the change in government policy, the NFU deputy president, Stuart Roberts, said: \u201cIn areas where TB in badgers is endemic, we must retain culling as a vital tool enabling industry to get on top of the disease quickly and reduce further transmission.\u201d</p> <p>A Defra spokesperson said: \u201cBovine TB leads to the slaughter of over 30,000 cattle every year and considerable trauma for farmers as they suffer the loss of highly prized animals and valued herds. As independent research has shown, the badger cull has led to a significant reduction in the disease but no one wants to continue the cull of this protected species forever. We recently set out the next phase of our strategy to combat bTB, which includes field trials of a cattle vaccine, plans to vaccinate more badgers against the disease and improved testing to intercept bTB earlier.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 March 2020 to include a comment from Defra.</p>",
  "<p>As we wait for the tsunami, the mood becomes increasingly apocalyptic. This is right and proper, but not for the reason you might think. The <em>Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</em> tells us that \u201capocalypse\u201d actually means \u201crevelation\u201d and that sounds spot-on to me.</p> <p>In his magisterial book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Epidemics-Society-Black-Present-Courses-ebook/dp/B07YLQJWWG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=OFGLCI4CRJ7A&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=epidemics+and+society&amp;qid=1585146528&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=epidemics+and+%2Caps%2C128&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><em>Epidemics and Society</em></a>, the historian Frank Snowden examined ways in which disease outbreaks have altered the societies through which they have spread. \u201cEpidemics,\u201d he said in a recent interview, are \u201ca category of disease that seem to hold up the mirror to human beings as to who we really are. That is to say, they obviously have everything to do with our relationship to our mortality, to death, to our lives. They also ... show the moral relationships that we have toward each other as people, and we\u2019re seeing that today.\u201d They are, in other words, revelations.</p> <p>Two recent episodes illustrate that point nicely. Waiting to check out at Aldi one day, I noticed that a box of hand sanitisers near the till was empty, and mentioned it to the cashier. He said that they sold out every time they put up a new box. Being a soap-and-water man, I was unperturbed, but on arriving home I logged onto amazon.co.uk to see how matters stood online. There were pages and pages of hand-sanitiser gel, though relatively few with the 60%+ of alcohol content recommended for the coronavirus. But I found one for \u00a36.99 with free delivery and so put it in my basket, only to discover that the \u201cfree\u201d delivery would only get it to me a month hence. On the other hand, I could get it in a week if I opted to pay. Q: how much was delivery? A: \u00a348. The polite term for this is price-gouging.</p> <p>Exhibit B is a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/technology/coronavirus-purell-wipes-amazon-sellers.html\" title=\"\"><em>New York Times </em>story<em> </em></a>from across the pond. According to the newspaper, on 1 March, the day after the first coronavirus death in the US, two Tennessee brothers, Matt and Noah Colvin, went to every store in their home town and cleaned it out of hand sanitiser. Over the next three days, Noah embarked on a 1,300-mile road trip across Tennessee and into Kentucky, filling a rented truck with thousands of bottles of the stuff and thousands of packs of antibacterial wipes.</p> <p>Having cornered the market, the Colvins then set about selling their wares on Amazon. Initially they sold 300 bottles for between $8 and $70 each, and presumably started laughing all the way to the bank. The glee was short-lived, however, for the next day Amazon pulled their items and thousands of other listings for sanitiser, wipes and face masks. The company also suspended some of the sellers behind the listings and warned many others that if they kept increasing prices, they\u2019d lose their accounts. In this way, the Colvin boys found themselves with 17,700 bottles of sanitiser and nowhere to sell them. (In the end they donated two-thirds of them to charity; the remaining third were confiscated by the Tennessee attorney general\u2019s office, which had launched an investigation.)</p> <p>These two stories demonstrate how a pandemic reveals aspects of human nature that we\u2019d prefer not to think about. But they also reveal an important truth about our economies, namely the extent to which Amazon has become so central \u2013 and so powerful. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/the-us-of-amazon-how-the-coronavirus-has-created-a-governance-vacuum-the-tech-giant-is-quickly-filling%0D\" title=\"\">as Julia Carrie Wong pointed out the other day</a>, Amazon in the US is beginning to behave more like a government than is the Trump administration. Wong likens the hiring of 100,000 staff and a $2-an-hour pay rise to a 21st-century version of FDR\u2019s famous Works Progress Administration (WPA). The company\u2019s sudden support for small businesses around its Seattle HQ (so that they might live to serve Amazonians another day) is, she says, akin to a government stimulus package. And its decision to stop accepting non-essential products from third-party sellers who use its warehouses essentially amounts to government-style market regulation.</p> <p>This pandemic will radically transform the industrial and commercial landscape of western societies. Lots of companies \u2013 large and small \u2013 will go to the wall, no matter how fervent government promises of support are. But when the smoke clears and some kind of normality returns, a small number of corporations \u2013 ones that have played a central role in keeping things going \u2013 will emerge strengthened and more dominant. And chief among them will be Jeff Bezos\u2019s everything store.</p> <p>What we will then have to come to terms with is that Amazon is becoming part of the critical infrastructure of western states. So too perhaps are Google and Microsoft. (Apple is more like a luxury good \u2013 nice but not essential, and the only reason for keeping Facebook is WhatsApp.) In which case, one of the big questions to be answered as societies rebuild once the virus has finally been tamed will be a really difficult one: how should Amazon be regulated?</p> <h2>What I\u2019m reading </h2> <p><strong>Tipping point </strong><br>\u201cThe last global crisis didn\u2019t change the world. But this one could.\u201d A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-crisis-change-world-financial-global-capitalism\" title=\"\">terrific <em>Guardian</em> column</a> by William Davies.</p> <p><strong>Speaking ill </strong><br>\u201cDisease as Political Metaphor\u201d: a <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1978/02/23/disease-as-political-metaphor/\" title=\"\">famous essay</a> by Susan Sontag in the <em>New York Review of Books</em>.</p> <p><strong>Facing facts </strong><br>\u201cWe need to save ignorance from AI\u201d. <a href=\"http://nautil.us/issue/61/coordinates/we-need-to-save-ignorance-from-ai\" title=\"\">A provocative article</a> on the Nautilus site by Christina Leuker and Wouter Van Den Bos.</p>",
  "<p>The global impact of the coronavirus pandemic poses a fundamental question: is this one of those historic moments when the world changes permanently, when the balance of political and economic power shifts decisively, and when, for most people, in most countries, life is never quite the same again?</p> <p>Put more simply, is this the end of the world as we know it? And, equally, could the crisis mark a new beginning?</p> <p>Genuinely pivotal global moments, watersheds or turning points (pick your own terminology) are actually quite rare. Yet if the premise is correct \u2013 that there can be no return to the pre-Covid-19 era \u2013 then it poses many unsettling questions about the nature of the change, and whether it will be for better or worse.</p> <p>For countless individuals and families, normal life has already been upended in previously unimaginable ways. But how will the pandemic influence the future behaviour of nation states, governments and leaders \u2013 and their often dysfunctional relationships? Will they work together more closely, or will this shared trauma further divide them?</p> <p>Some analysts see grounds for optimism, for example in beneficial environmental effects in northern Italy and China. Countries hitherto at odds, such as Iran and the UAE, are cooperating, at least temporarily. In the Philippines, the crisis prompted a ceasefire with Communist rebels. Global interdependence and the importance of collective, multilateral approaches have been vividly underscored.</p> <p>But there is also a more pessimistic view, typified by Stephen Walt, professor of international relations at Harvard University. \u201cThe pandemic will strengthen the state and reinforce nationalism. Governments of all types will adopt emergency measures to manage the crisis, and many will be loath to relinquish these new powers when the crisis is over,\u201d he wrote in <em><a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/20/world-order-after-coroanvirus-pandemic/\">Foreign Policy</a></em><a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/20/world-order-after-coroanvirus-pandemic/\"> </a>magazine.</p> <p>Walt continued: \u201cCovid-19 will also accelerate the shift in power and influence from west to east. The response in Europe and America has been slow and haphazard by comparison [with China, South Korea and Singapore], further tarnishing the aura of the western \u2018brand\u2019\u2026 We will see a further retreat from hyper-globalisation, as citizens look to national governments to protect them and as states and firms seek to reduce future vulnerabilities.</p> <p>\u201cIn short, Covid-19 will create a world that is less open, less prosperous and less free.\u201d</p> <p>Is Walt right? The cop-out answer is only time will tell. Yet the outcome is not preordained. The responses of everybody, from presidents and prime ministers to ordinary citizens, to the myriad challenges and upheavals arising from the pandemic will help determine what happens next.</p> <p>It\u2019s a chance to reset both global and personal landscapes. Notwithstanding present feelings of powerlessness, there are choices to be made about what kind of future awaits. After Covid-19, everything could be up for grabs.</p> <h2>Balance of power</h2> <p>After early blunders, China\u2019s government is working hard to turn Covid-19, first detected in Wuhan in November, into a national success story. It claims draconian measures to suppress the disease have largely worked. Now, by offering assistance to Italy and other badly affected countries, China is reinforcing its credentials as a global leader. The virus has become a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/china-prepares-to-seal-itself-off-from-the-world-to-stem-imported-coronavirus-cases\">soft power tool</a> to overtake its superpower rival, the US.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If the US remains absent without leave, China may take the crisis as an opportunity to start setting new rules</p> <footer> <cite>Mira Rapp-Hooper, US Council on Foreign Relations</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cA critical part of this narrative is Beijing\u2019s supposed success in battling the virus. A steady stream of propaganda articles, tweets and public messaging, in a wide variety of languages, touts China\u2019s achievements and highlights the effectiveness of its model of domestic governance,\u201d wrote commentators Kurt Campbell and Rush Doshi in <em><a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-03-18/coronavirus-could-reshape-global-order\">Foreign Affairs</a></em> magazine.</p> <p>In contrast, Donald Trump is struggling to dispel a widespread perception of gross incompetence. \u201cThe US government\u2019s pandemic leadership has been its own special brand of catastrophe\u2026. [It] has placed its own citizens in unnecessary peril, while sidelining itself from acting as a global crisis leader,\u201d wrote Mira Rapp-Hooper of the US Council on Foreign Relations.</p> <p>\u201cThis domestic and international governance crisis could change the nature of the international order in several ways \u2026. If the US remains absent without leave, China may take the crisis as an opportunity to start setting new rules according to its own global governance vision,\u201d she continued.</p> <h2>Authoritarianism and democracy</h2> <p>China\u2019s challenge to US hegemony was already strengthening on many fronts before the Covid-19 crisis erupted. The pandemic may accelerate this shift. For US-allied democracies that value open governance, civil rights and free speech, this is a worrying prospect.</p> <p>The trend towards centralised, authoritarian rule evident in countries such as India, Brazil and Turkey, and typified by China and Russia, has coincided with the rise of rightwing nationalist-populist governments and parties in Europe. Some are now following China\u2019s lead in attempting to weaponise the virus for political ends.</p> <p>\u201cThe pandemic unquestionably presents an era-defining challenge to public health and the global economy [but] its political consequences are less well-understood,\u201d the independent monitor, International Crisis Group, warned last week. \u201cUnscrupulous leaders may exploit the pandemic to advance their objectives in ways that exacerbate domestic or international crises \u2013 cracking down on dissent at home or escalating conflicts with rival states \u2013 on the assumption that they will get away with it while the world is otherwise occupied,\u201d the ICG said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f677aaf7e4b2682a6d53d427c63656cd83d2c64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f677aaf7e4b2682a6d53d427c63656cd83d2c64/0_316_4928_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, may be tempted to use the pandemic to keep his country in a state of emergency.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isopix/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One example cited by the report was Vladimir Putin\u2019s recent attempt to indefinitely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/18/putin-criminal-incompetent-president-enemy-of-his-own-people-russia\">extend his presidency</a> in Russia (although the virus has since forced him to postpone a vote that could have allowed him to stay in power until 2036). Another was a bid by Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Hungary\u2019s nationalist leader, to renew a state of emergency \u201cthat prescribes five-year prison sentences for those disseminating false information or obstructing the state\u2019s crisis response.\u201d </p> <p>Governments such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/egypt-forces-guardian-journalist-leave-coronavirus-story-ruth-michaelson\">Egypt</a>\u2019s have followed China\u2019s example in expelling foreign journalists, restricting media access and curtailing public discussion. Like Boris Johnson and many European leaders, Trump has also assumed emergency powers. From Bolivia, India, Sri Lanka and Iraq to the US, UK and France, elections have been postponed, parliaments suspended, and lockdowns and curfews imposed.</p> <p>Most people may support such measures in the short term. But what if the crisis is protracted, with a \u201csecond wave\u201d running into next year? And what if the new controls are not relaxed or withdrawn after it ends? This is what Harvard\u2019s Stephen Walt meant about the danger of \u201cless free\u201d post-pandemic societies.</p> <h2>Globalisation and multilateralism</h2> <p>Unprecedented government aid packages for businesses and workers, intended to mitigate the disease\u2019s economic and financial impact, have led some analysts to suggest \u201cthe state is back\u201d \u2013 and that the limits of the postwar neoliberal, free market model have finally been reached.</p> <p>What the crisis has shown, it is argued, is that when the challenge is truly existential, only the state can offer holistic and equitable solutions. A natural corollary is that the high-water mark of globalisation has arrived. These are radical paradigm shifts. Will they endure?</p> <p>\u201cThe pandemic could be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back of economic globalisation,\u201d wrote Robin Niblett, director of the Chatham House thinktank. The architecture of global economic governance established in the 20th century was at risk, he warned, raising the prospect that political leaders may \u201cretreat into overt geopolitical competition\u201d.</p> <p>For Robert Kaplan of the Eurasia Group, \u201ccoronavirus is the historical marker between the first phase of globalisation and the second \u2026. Globalisation 2.0 is about separating the globe into great-power blocs with their own burgeoning militaries and separate supply chains, about the rise of autocracies, and about social and class divides that have engendered nativism and populism \u2026. In sum, it is a story about <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-20/coronavirus-ushers-in-the-globalization-we-were-afraid-of?srnd=opinion\">new and re-emerging global divisions</a>.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The pandemic is a powerful reminder of two things: the shared challenges of our global village, and the deep inequalities we must grapple with to fight them</p> <footer> <cite>David Miliband, International Rescue Committee</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If that\u2019s true, few will mourn the passing of the globalisation era. And support for Kaplan\u2019s theory may be found in increased post-pandemic protectionism if, as some predict, countries attempt to limit future exposure to global threats. The UN warned last week of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-measures-could-cause-global-food-shortage-un-warns\">worldwide food shortages</a> caused by lack of workers, tougher immigration controls, sanctions and tariffs \u2013 and called for a new, more open approach.</p> <p>The weakening of multilateral forums and institutions, evident before the crisis, is another sign of a shrinking world. Trying to revive their collective clout, the wealthy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/g20-hold-emergency-video-summit-discuss-coronavirus\">G20 countries belatedly pledged</a> last week to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to fight the virus. But it remains largely unclear what that entails in practice, and who will take the lead.</p> <h2>Fragile world</h2> <p>The pandemic and its aftermath could be a game-changer for poorer countries with limited resources and means of recovery, and for refugees and people in conflict zones \u2013 but probably not in a good way.</p> <p>The ICG report is blunt: \u201cThe global outbreak has the potential to wreak havoc in fragile states [and] trigger widespread unrest \u2026. If the disease spreads in densely packed urban centres, it may be virtually impossible to control.\u201d This is precisely the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-cases-africa-pass-amid-fears-health-services-south-who\">fear stalking South Africa\u2019s townships</a> right now.</p> <p>The report said the dramatic global economic slowdown would disrupt trade flows and create unemployment in commodity-exporting poorer countries. \u201cIts implications are especially serious for those caught in the midst of conflict if, as seems likely, the disease disrupts humanitarian aid flows, limits peace operations, and postpones diplomacy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0190375cc052fc870ba3abadb496e02bb8a77caa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0190375cc052fc870ba3abadb496e02bb8a77caa/0_212_3200_1921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Displaced Syrians wait for hot meal in Idlib, Syria, last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Displaced Syrians wait for hot meal in Idlib, Syria, last month.

That\u2019s why the UN last week launched an appeal for $2bn in humanitarian aid. Its secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, wants trillions more in global financial stimulus to prevent \u201cmillions\u201d of deaths. \u201cCovid-19 is threatening the whole of humanity and the whole of humanity must fight back,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe pandemic is a powerful reminder of two things: the shared challenges of our global village, and the deep inequalities we must grapple with to fight them,\u201d said David Miliband, who heads the International Rescue Committee. \u201cCoronavirus is not just a problem for rich countries. We are only as strong as our weakest health system.\u201d</p> <p>Whether the international community heeds this and similar calls will be a key test.</p> <h2>Resilience and paranoia</h2> <p>The crisis has exposed an endemic lack of resilience, symbolised by chronically under-resourced healthcare systems in even better-off countries. The decision of many governments to call in the armed forces to help with logistics and manpower partly reflects fears that weakening social cohesion may lead to disorder on the streets.</p> <p>\u201cIf governments have to resort to using paramilitary or military forces to quell, for example, riots or attacks on property, societies could begin to disintegrate. Thus the main, perhaps even the sole objective of economic policy today [rather than supporting financial markets] should be to prevent social breakdown,\u201d wrote Branko Milanovi\u0107, a professor at the London School of Economics.</p> <p>Yet, looked at differently, this kind of national mobilisation can be seen as a positive development rather than a threat to civil liberties \u2013 and as a more beneficial use of military power. In Britain as elsewhere, the call to arms has created new legions of NHS volunteers. This renewed sense of national sharing and identity is a much-needed antidote to the regressive nationalism of recent years.</p> <p>\u201cLooking ahead, governments will have to decide whether to support more cooperative approaches to handling the crisis, not only in global public health terms but also as a political and security challenge,\u201d the ICG said. \u201cAll leaders face pressure to focus on domestic priorities, and in particular to ignore conflict risks in weak states \u2026. But there will be a day after.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's possible that, over the longer term, democracies will come out of their shells to find a new type of pragmatic internationalism</p> <footer> <cite>John Ikenberry, Princeton University</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While there is concern the pandemic could deepen divisions between countries and, for example, exacerbate anti-migrant sentiment, there is a fighting chance it will boost international cooperation, support for the UN, and a willingness to pursue dialogue rather than military and economic confrontation. The future need not be a globally debilitating US-China fight for supremacy.</p> <p>Elisabeth Braw of the Royal United Services Institute warns of a moment of extreme geopolitical vulnerability. \u201cThe coronavirus is a perfect opportunity for the west\u2019s adversaries to watch how countries cope \u2013 or don\u2019t cope \u2013 with a major crisis,\u201d she wrote. But John Ikenberry, professor of international affairs at Princeton University, is less fearful, pointing to the US-led recovery after the 1930s Depression.</p> <p>Intensifying great power rivalry in a fractured, damaged, poorer world might indeed be the future that awaits, Ikenberry suggested. But it was equally possible that, \u201cover the longer term, the democracies will come out of their shells to find a new type of pragmatic and protective internationalism\u201d.</p> <p>In other words, after the nightmare, a fresh start.</p> <h2>Five events that changed the modern world</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9dd28d22659352ae446b264ee8bef0556f913bbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dd28d22659352ae446b264ee8bef0556f913bbf/0_129_4065_2440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The installation of ceramic poppies at the Tower of London in 2014 that marked the centenary of the outbreak of the first world war.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Never again: Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, the ceramic poppies at the Tower of London that marked the centenary of the outbreak of the first world war.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The Versailles peace conference<br></strong>The 1919-20 conference that followed the first world war was a historic turning point.

About 2 million combatants died.</p> <p><strong>The fall of the Berlin Wall<br></strong>The peaceful fall in 1989 of the Berlin Wall, the actual and symbolic dividing line between the Soviet bloc and the west, in effect ended the 44-year-long cold war. The ensuing implosion of the Soviet Union triggered the collapse of Russian-backed regimes around the world, leading the US to proclaim itself the sole global superpower.</p> <p><strong>The 9/11 attacks<br></strong>The attacks launched by al-Qaida on New York and Washington DC in September 2001 punctured American illusions of invulnerability and prompted George W Bush to declare a \u201cglobal war on terror\u201d. This led directly to the US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and the ensuing expansion of anti-western jihadism typified by Islamic State.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

The Department for International Trade has a specialist team to promote UK arms sales.</p> <p>In 2018, the latest figures available, the UK won arms contracts worth \u00a314bn. Between 2008 and 2018 the UK was the second biggest arms exporter in the world, with 19% of the market share. Three-fifths of arms sales over the period went to the Middle East.</p> <p>Some \u00a35.3bn of arms have been licensed to Saudi Arabia since the war in Yemen began. There are concerns that the Saudi-led coalition, which is fighting Houthi rebels in the country, may have committed human rights violations by targeting civilian infrastructure.</p> <p>Smith said the crisis in Yemen showed how policies to promote UK arms sales could backfire: \u201cOver the last five years we have seen the devastating impact of UK-made fighter jets, bombs and missiles on Yemen. The war has killed tens of thousands of people, and created the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Those arms sales need to end now, but so do the policies that allowed them to happen in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>The Treasury did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>The increasing privatisation of children\u2019s care homes is \u201cplaying into the hands of abusers\u201d and putting children in danger of exploitation, according to a new report, seen by the <em>Observer</em>. </p> <p>Market forces are being allowed to dictate the housing and care of vulnerable children over their best interests, the study concludes, putting them at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/29/how-did-childrens-homes-become-centres-of-profit-making-and-abuse\">greater risk</a> from \u201ccounty lines\u201d drug gangs that are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/05/county-lines-drug-gangs-blackmailing-tracking-children-social-media\">known to target homes.</a></p> <p>The intervention comes from the <a href=\"https://howardleague.org/\">Howard League for Penal Reform,</a> which spoke to hundreds of people involved in children\u2019s residential care as well as police, homeowners, staff, social workers and children.</p> <p>The report reveals that companies that own homes in the increasingly privatised sector are placing them in poorer, more disadvantaged areas, so more children are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/16/councils-unwittingly-helping-drug-gangs-recruit-children-inquiry-says\">moved </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/16/councils-unwittingly-helping-drug-gangs-recruit-children-inquiry-says\"> from their support networks. </a>Three-quarters of homes in England are now private.</p> <p>It also finds that local authorities facing increasing pressure to place children are being charged huge fees by private providers without guarantees about how money is spent. Costs sometimes exceed \u00a3200,000 a year for a single placement.</p> <p>The Howard League warns that councils are struggling to take on large providers after a series of major mergers in the sector. The six largest independent providers of children\u2019s social care services made \u00a3215m profit in 2019. </p> <p>Children in care are known to be targeted by county lines gangs, who groom them to move drugs up and down the country.</p> <p>\u201cThe current residential children\u2019s homes structure is playing into the hands of abusers and contributing to the growth and geographical spread of the problem,\u201d the report states. \u201cWith the primary focus on profits this means that children\u2019s homes are usually situated in less expensive parts of the country and frequently in disadvantaged areas.</p> <p>\u201cToo often children are placed wherever a bed can be found. The lack of places for children in care has led to what one police officer described as children being \u2018dumped\u2019 in emergency placements, sometimes into environments where people who are already exploiting children are operating and which puts them in danger.\u201d </p> <p>There are now calls for the government to look at the childcare home market as part of a promised review of the care system. Andrew Neilson, director of campaigns at the Howard League, said: \u201cThe whole business model of \u2018county lines\u2019 has particularly thrived in the residential care market because children in residential care in England in particular are being moved around at the mercy of market forces, not their best interests.\u201d </p> <p>Judith Blake, chair of the Local Government Association\u2019s children and young people board, said provision from independent companies would continue to be important, but warned that although councils tried to place children in homes near their family, soaring demand was creating problems. </p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cLocal authorities are required by law to ensure that accommodation for children in care is of high-quality and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 that it is safe. </p> <p>\u201cWe continue to work with the police, courts and care settings to keep these children safe and in education.\u201d</p>",

  "<p><strong>As a child I was </strong>nurtured, but also pushed. My education and life chances were the most important things to my parents. That gave me a tremendous sense of: what am I going to do with my life? How am I going to use this life I\u2019ve been given?</p> <p><strong>Some of the things</strong> my parents did were tough. They weren\u2019t happy with the education options in Saudi Arabia, so at 12 I was sent to boarding school in the UK. It was hard to be thousands of miles away, but now I feel incredibly fortunate. It was character building. It taught me to be independent.</p> <p><strong>Nerves are always </strong>a part of my life. I don\u2019t necessarily feel them every second I am on air, but I do during the bigger moments \u2013 the bigger interviews. There\u2019s always an element of the unknown. Sometimes the adrenaline can be overwhelming.</p> <p><strong>The closest I came </strong>to death was when I was covering the elections in India in 2014, in Aligarh.

You have the capacity to think: this isn\u2019t the be-all and end-all.</p> <p><strong>Fifteen years ago</strong>, I would have wondered and worried about my career longevity as I get older. But for women in my industry, we\u2019ve really progressed since then. I do wonder what it\u2019s going to be like to hit 50, though. There\u2019s a certain apprehension that might creep in at that point about what old age is going to look and feel like.</p> <p><strong>People say </strong>communication is the secret to a happy marriage. I think it\u2019s more specific than that. It\u2019s so easy to forget the basic niceties. Treating each other with civility is so important.</p> <p><strong>I try to accept </strong>uncertainty \u2013 that there are things in life that are going to be out of my control.

  "<p>If last week now seems forever ago to most of us, a geological aeon has elapsed since Donald Glover \u2013 a then medium-famous US TV actor \u2013 was widely derided as a try-hard rap dilettante. His 2011 debut album as Childish Gambino, <em>Camp</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/nov/13/childish-gambino-camp-review\">drew curiosity</a> and <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16074-camp/\">disdain</a>. Now, Glover\u2019s fourth studio effort, named after the day it was first streamed with little warning via <a href=\"http://donaldgloverpresents.com/\">donaldgloverpresents.com</a>, feels like one of the year\u2019s major musical events. It comes in two forms, one without track breaks, credited to Donald Glover, and one with, credited to Childish Gambino.</p> <p>It is long delayed, probably because Glover was busy playing the young <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/05/21/donald-glover-lando-calrissian-stole-solo-star-wars-story/617699002/\">Lando Calrissian</a> in <em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em> and <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/lion-king-2019-donald-glover-simba/\">Simba</a> in <em>The Lion King</em>; his father also died, and last year Glover made a short film, <em><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/donald-glover-collaborators-wrote-made-guava-island-822135/\">Guava Island</a></em>, starring Rihanna. A song like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1B9Fk_SgI0\">Feels Like Summer</a> \u2013 now renamed 42.26 \u2013 was a hit two years ago; Glover\u2019s last <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/30/childish-gambino-o2-london-review\">UK tour 12 months ago</a> found room for both the hard-hitting <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgJqV06P-yM\">Algorhythm</a> \u2013 a dance tune about how humans are outsourcing decision-making to AI \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D8m_uBu9mk\">Time</a>, which blanches at the impending apocalypse alongside Ariana Grande. But this record was worth the wait and is worth your time, a comprehensive deep-dive made for the dedicated concentration of self-isolation.</p> <p>Apart from Algorhythm and Time, every track is named after the time at which it appears on the album, and Glover packs in anger, despair and personal eureka moments, moving from an angelic falsetto to self-harmonising a cappella (39.28) to heavily Auto-Tuned soothsaying. At this album\u2019s twisted heart is a sardonic country music nursery rhyme about selling drugs that sounds a little like MIA.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gezFLhUznSk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gezFLhUznSk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gezFLhUznSk\">Listen to Childish Gambino\u2019s new album in full</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>There are meditations here on love and self-love, and hook-ups with girls while high on magic mushrooms. Like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYOjWnS4cMY\">This Is America</a> \u2013 the standalone track that was one of the cultural high-water marks of 2018 \u2013 or <em>Atlanta</em> \u2013 the groundbreaking TV series Glover created in 2016 \u2013 <em>3.15.20</em> is as layered as an onion. Keen to wow a mainstream audience, Glover and his collaborators continue the bravura fusion of soulfulness, funk and trap established by his two previous breakthrough albums, 2016\u2019s soul-drenched <em>Awaken, My Love!</em> and its 2013 predecessor, <em>Because the Internet</em>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>3.15.20 really excels when Glover experiments with form, texture and sensory overload</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Because of Glover\u2019s background as an actor and show-runner, some of these songs have the feel of narrative fiction. The excellent 12.38 could be an episode of <em>Atlanta</em>, in which Earn \u2013 the central everyman character played by Glover \u2013 has an encounter with a girl who feeds him psilocybin (he is comically unsure what psilocybin is). Throughout, his phone vibrates with text messages from his girlfriend. The sexual tension is played for laughs, but a thrown-out line rails against overcrowded prisons.</p> <p>As engaging as these songs are on multiple levels, <em>3.15.20</em> really excels when Glover experiments with form, texture and sensory overload. One sequence at the end of another Prince-ish track, the slow, straightforward love song 24.19, finds Glover running as though in fear, but reaching what sounds more like a sexual climax; a passage at the end of 35.31 is sung backwards.</p> <p>Debuted at Coachella in 2019, the next song (then called Warlords and now called 32.22) is an aggressive tour de force; its appetite for tearing up sound rulebooks recalls 00s Kanye West. The track features whispered exhortations and, later, whoops, shrieks and synthetic jungle noises. It\u2019s like something great left off the <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcO5klPyfX4\">Black Panther</a></em> soundtrack (Glover\u2019s longtime collaborator, the film composer-turned-producer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson, worked on the film). But it\u2019s impossible to parse the meaning of the workaday farm animal noises at the end.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYOjWnS4cMY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VYOjWnS4cMY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYOjWnS4cMY\">Watch the video for This Is America</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>If Glover tackles the roles of lover and partner, elsewhere he plays both a son and a father. On 19.10, a powerful funk-pop outing that nods again to Prince, Glover recalls being warned about the iniquities of the world by his own father \u2013 the kind of thing Ta-Nehisi Coates was writing about with his 2015 article <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/tanehisi-coates-between-the-world-and-me/397619/\">Letter to My Son</a>. By the end of 47.48, another song about explaining the violence of black life to innocent children, Glover enlists Legend, his eldest son now aged three, to talk about who he loves.</p> <p>\u201cDo you love yourself?\u201d asks Legend. Glover is taken aback for a beat. \u201cI do love myself,\u201d he answers, in his best dad voice. It\u2019s a skewering moment, because Glover has talked (and written and sung) about his extreme discomfort <a href=\"https://genius.com/Childish-gambino-open-letter-on-instagram-lyrics\">in his own skin</a> since the beginning of his musical career. More recently, however, in the wake of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/23/donald-glover-atlanta-robbin-season\">Atlanta</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/23/donald-glover-atlanta-robbin-season\">\u2019s</a> success, he was capable of discussing his own greatness with a <em><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/05/donald-glover-cant-save-you\">New Yorker</a></em><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/05/donald-glover-cant-save-you\"> profiler</a>.</p> <p>As a topic, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYzlVDlE72w\">self-love has had a long history in African American music</a>. Often a little opaque to outsiders, at its root is the struggle to overcome the learned self-hatred of racism. 53.49 takes up the theme, but with joy. Glover is self-aware enough to note this song is a \u201cYeezy Boost\u201d, the kind of elevation Kanye West has been aiming for with his Sunday Services (and his trainer line). The song is yet another letter, of sorts, to Glover\u2019s sons. \u201cI did what I wanted,\u201d he beams, preaching hard-won self-acceptance and a message to remember to seize love where it is. \u201cI said, I love me!\u201d Glover exclaims, still a little taken aback. But it\u2019s not just grandstanding.</p>",

Tara Reade, who worked with Biden when he was a Delaware senator, alleges he inappropriately touched her and penetrated her with his fingers without consent in 1993.</p> <p>\u201cIt happened all at once, and then \u2026 his hands were on me and underneath my clothes,\u201d Reade recalled in an interview <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/katie-halper/tara-to-post\">with podcast host Katie Halper</a> on Wednesday. \u201cHe said \u2018come on, man, I heard you liked me. For me, it was like, everything shattered \u2026 I wanted to be a senator; I didn\u2019t want to sleep with one.\u201d</p> <p>Rightwing news outlets have gleefully seized upon the accusations against Biden; the story has also been discussed by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zackbeauchamp/status/1243246641072738304?s=20\">left</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/zackbeauchamp/status/1243246641072738304?s=20\">wing commentators</a>. However, the mainstream media has largely ignored the allegations. Instead there have been headlines like <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/politics/joe-biden-kamala-harris-elizabeth-warren-amy-klobuchar/index.htm\">The top 10 women Joe Biden might pick as VP</a> (CNN) and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/d71a735b53f8a5c9c417e144de9af544\">Joe Biden\u2019s inner circle: No longer a boy\u2019s club</a> (AP).</p> <p>It is hugely frustrating to see conservatives, who couldn\u2019t give a damn about the multiple sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump, weaponize the accusations against Biden. However, it\u2019s also frustrating to see so many liberals turning a blind eye. The accusations against the former vice-president are serious; why aren\u2019t they being taken seriously?</p> <p>One obvious reason is that Reade\u2019s accusations are very hard to prove. The incident happened a long time ago and there weren\u2019t any witnesses. Reade also gave a slightly different version of events last year; she <a href=\"https://www.theunion.com/news/nevada-county-woman-says-joe-biden-inappropriately-touched-her-while-working-in-his-u-s-senate-office/\">accused Biden</a> of touching her neck and shoulders in a way that was inappropriate and uncomfortable, but did not say anything sexual took place. This inconsistency obviously doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s lying; unfortunately, it is easy to use against her.</p> <p>Reade\u2019s story may be impossible to verify, but this is the case with the vast majority of sexual assault allegations. It is nearly always a case of \u201che said, she said\u201d \u2013 and it is nearly always the \u201che\u2019 that is automatically believed. The #MeToo mantra \u201cBelieve Women\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that women never lie; it means that our systems of power are biased towards believing men never lie. It means that it takes decades of allegations and scores of women coming forward for powerful men like Harvey Weinstein, Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Cosby to be brought to justice. All the mantra means is that you shouldn\u2019t automatically disbelieve women.</p> <p>You know who has talked publicly about the importance of taking women seriously? Biden. During the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, Biden stood up for Dr Christine Blasey Ford, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/joe-biden-when-a-woman-alleges-sexual-assault-presume-she-is-telling-the-truth/2018/09/17/7718c532-badd-11e8-a8aa-860695e7f3fc_story.html\">noting</a>: \u201cFor a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus, nationally, you\u2019ve got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she\u2019s talking about is real.\u201d</p> <p>Does this presumption not apply when the guy being accused is a Democrat running for president? It would seem that way. In January, according to <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/24/joe-biden-metoo-times-up/\">reporting from the Intercept</a>, Reade asked for help from the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, which has supported accusers of high-profile people like Weinstein. Reade was reportedly told by the National Women\u2019s Law Center, the organization within which the Time\u2019s Up fund is housed, that it couldn\u2019t assist with accusations against a presidential candidate because it would jeopardize their non-profit status. The Intercept further notes that \u201cthe public relations firm that works on behalf of the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund is SKDKnickerbocker, whose managing director, Anita Dunn, is the top adviser to Biden\u2019s presidential campaign\u201d.</p> <p>There are some people who will insist that drawing attention to the new allegations against Biden is playing into the Republicans\u2019 hands. That it will destroy Biden\u2019s campaign and guarantee us four more years of Trump. Not only is that argument hypocritical, it is also hugely unlikely that Reade\u2019s accusations will do any damage whatsoever to Biden\u2019s ambitions. Allegations of sexual assault certainly haven\u2019t posed any hindrance to Trump. The allegations against Kavanaugh didn\u2019t stop him from becoming a supreme court justice. The allegations against Louis CK didn\u2019t kill his career in comedy. And the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-allegations-women-2020-campaign-2019-6\">multiple women</a> who have accused Biden of touching them inappropriately in the past haven\u2019t exactly derailed his career.</p> <h2>Why does coronavirus kill more men than women?</h2> <p>Around the world, men in every age bracket are dying from coronavirus at higher rates than women. Men have accounted for 71% of Covid-19 deaths in Italy, for example. And in Spain twice as many men as women have died. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/men-are-much-more-likely-to-die-from-coronavirus-but-why\">Nobody is entirely sure what\u2019s causing this gender gap</a>. Biology, lifestyle and behaviour probably all play a role but we won\u2019t know what the balance is until sex-disaggregated data is more widely available.</p> <h2>Telegram sexual abuse scandal shocks South Korea</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/outrage-in-south-korea-over-telegram-sexual-abuse-ring-blackmailing-women-and-girls\">Police have named</a> 25-year-old Cho Ju-bin as the man who allegedly ran a sexual blackmail ring on the app Telegram. Women and underage girls were blackmailed into sending degrading images of themselves through the app; the images were then made available to subscribers.

  "<p>In 1939, in <a href=\"https://gutenberg.ca/ebooks/lewiscs-transposition/lewiscs-transposition-00-h.html\" title=\"\">a sermon</a> preached at Oxford University in the midst of a different global crisis, CS Lewis made a distinction that\u2019s worth revisiting today. It wasn\u2019t the case, he pointed out, that the outbreak of war had rendered human life suddenly fragile; rather, it was that people were suddenly realising it always had been. \u201cThe war creates no absolutely new situation,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIt simply aggravates the permanent human situation so that we can no longer ignore it. Human life has always been lived on the edge of a precipice\u2026 We are mistaken when we compare war with \u2018normal life\u2019. Life has never been normal.\u201d</p> <p>In this time of acute collective anxiety, this sort of insight might not bring much peace of mind on its own. But it is a crucial first step, because it suggests that something about our gut-churning feelings of helplessness \u2013 the sense that we\u2019re facing an absolutely horrible, unprecedented emergency, which we\u2019ll surely lack the personal resilience to cope with \u2013 isn\u2019t wholly accurate. And it implies that we might be much better than we think at dealing with radical uncertainty \u2013 because in fact, every hour of every day, we already do.</p> <p>The special trouble with uncertainty is that it\u2019s a doorway to infinity. When you\u2019ve no idea what tomorrow will bring, it\u2019s easy to fill that gap with fantasy, and the world of fantasy knows no bounds. It\u2019s possible to imagine things getting limitlessly bad. (Most of us are vulnerable to what the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbg-pwEfu90\" title=\"\">psychotherapist Bruce Tift</a> calls \u201cannihilatory panic\u201d: the unconscious belief that there are certain feelings that would literally destroy us if we had to feel them.) Unsurprisingly, this feeds the destructive and self-perpetuating thought pattern that cognitive therapists call \u201ccatastrophising\u201d: taking every morsel of bad news as evidence that things are going to be globally, absolutely and eternally terrible. By contrast, when even extremely bad things happen, the situation, however dire, remains finite. An event occurs; it\u2019s over; then the people directly affected can begin to reconfigure their lives.</p> <p>One overarching strategy for dealing with the experience of intense uncertainty is to do whatever you can to bring yourself back to the world of the finite \u2013 to things as they actually are in your own concrete world, and the concrete things you can control. As a first step, try not to see anxious feelings as something you\u2019ve got to get rid of. <a href=\"https://www.lisamarchiano.com/\" title=\"\">Lisa Marchiano</a>, a therapist and writer based in Philadelphia, suggests making it your mission \u201cto tolerate uncertainty, rather than having to make it go away. That creates a different frame for thinking about things: all you have to do is tolerate it. Of course, that may be very difficult \u2013 but it can get us out of this place where we\u2019re spinning our wheels, trying to fix something it isn\u2019t within our power to fix.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I recommend the \u2018shaking practice\u2019 which has the added benefit of being so ridiculous as to be incompatible with misery</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many of the most fruitful techniques for coping with uncertainty involve a similar move: they are ways to refocus your attention away from your runaway fantasies. If you\u2019re confined to your home at the moment, giving yourself some structure by drawing up an approximate schedule can reconnect you to the texture of the day. (\u201cEven if we hate our jobs, having somewhere to be at 9am is very containing, psychologically,\u201d Marchiano says.) You\u2019ll get a related \u201cgrounding\u201d effect by returning to the body through virtually any form of physical exercise. (As a specific antidote to anxious feelings, I highly recommend the \u201cshaking practice\u201d demonstrated by the coach Deepika Sheleff <a href=\"http://www.deeperintolife.com/videos.html\" title=\"\">on her website</a>, which is what it sounds like \u2013 and has the added benefit of being so ridiculous as to be incompatible with total misery.)</p> <p>There\u2019s no harm in a little distraction, if you can manage it. But one of the most intriguing insights of Buddhist psychology is that focusing on discomfort is even more effective. In another demonstration of the power of returning to concrete reality, if you spend a few moments paying attention as closely as possible to the physical sensations you\u2019re experiencing at this very moment, you\u2019ll probably find them much easier to tolerate. The meditation teacher <a href=\"https://kennethfolkdharma.com/\" title=\"\">Kenneth Folk</a> frames this as a matter of \u201cattentional bandwidth\u201d: your capacity to pay attention is strictly limited \u2013 and so the more of it you manage to dedicate to the experience you\u2019re having, the less remains available for dwelling on how unpleasant it is. (Complement this with the powerfully calming <a href=\"https://www.drweil.com/videos-features/videos/breathing-exercises-4-7-8-breath/\" title=\"\">4-7-8 breathing technique</a>: breathe in through your nose for a count of four, hold your breath for a count of seven, then exhale through your mouth, emptying the lungs as fully as possible, for a count of eight.)</p> <p>Meanwhile, as your to-do list isn\u2019t going anywhere \u2013 depending on your situation, it may just have become unfeasibly longer \u2013 you\u2019ll need a way to get things done in the presence of uncertainty, and here, too, a short-range, down-to-earth, finitude-focused approach is likely to the most effective. Even at the best of times, it\u2019s a good idea to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/05/how-to-tackle-your-to-do-lists-oliver-burkeman\" title=\"\">limit the number of tasks</a> you\u2019re working on at any given moment to three or four, seeing them through to completion before embarking on others; and in times of high stress, it may be worth reducing that limit to one. Pick a task, write it on a Post-it, position it somewhere prominent, then do that task; for that moment, it\u2019s the only goal you need to worry about accomplishing. Then repeat. Soon, you\u2019ll accumulate a pleasing number of Post-its, a testament to all the constructive stuff you\u2019ve managed to get done.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/17/silver-linings-how-to-stay-positive-during-the-coronavirus-crisis\">Silver linings: how to stay positive during the coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the anxiety abates a little, it may even become possible to glimpse the profound truth that, as Marchiano puts it, \u201ca crisis can heighten the opportunity to find meaning, to get clear about what matters most\u201d. What\u2019s your role here? There\u2019s solace to be found in figuring out what this moment demands from you, then doing it as well as you can. It may not look like anything heroic from the outside. (\u201cMaybe it\u2019s just making sure the kids stay on top of their schoolwork, or doing your job as a clerk in a grocery store,\u201d Marchiano says.)

All while frequently wearing a bedazzled face mask inside her Atlanta mansion.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Cardi\u2019s lectures can occasionally veer off course and become more InfoWars than CNN. During one, she briefly indulged in rumors, spread within China, that the US or another superpower had planted Covid-19 in China. \u201cA lot of people owe money to China, y\u2019all,\u201d she said. Before that, she wondered if the government was paying celebrities to say they have coronavirus. Why they would do so Cardi never made clear and, after days of pondering on this wild, off-the-cuff accusation, I still can\u2019t come up with an explanation, because the last thing Miss Rona needs is more publicity. Regardless, Cardi is not concerned with the morality of such an elaborate conspiracy theory \u2013 she simply wants a check too. \u201cIf you are \u2026 pay me too!\u201d she pleaded to the government, implying she would be willing to lie about having the virus. \u201cBitch tryna get paid.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PopCrave/status/1242629195517362176\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Cardi B calls out celebrities &amp; the government:<br><br>\u201cIf [Trump] is saying \u2018if you don\u2019t have any symptoms of the Coronavirus do not get tested because we don\u2019t have enough tests\u2019 but a celebrity is saying \u2018I don\u2019t have symptoms but I got tested &amp; I\u2019m positive\u2019 that causes confusion\u201d <a href=\"https://t.co/VgKFqIBH8h\">pic.twitter.com/VgKFqIBH8h</a></p>&mdash; Pop Crave (@PopCrave) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PopCrave/status/1242629195517362176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 25, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2><strong>Lil Yachty creates his own virtual Fear Factor game</strong></h2> <p>Rapper Lil Yachty loves a good laugh \u2026 at the expense of his own fans.

  "<p>In recent days, we have witnessed an astonishing about-face by Republican politicians on policies that were anathema to them just a few short years or even weeks ago. Democrats must use the occasion to press home the fundamental wrongheadedness of the Republican worldview before they inevitably reverse course and pretend that nothing has changed.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with stimulus. I remember early 2009, when the economy was melting under the weight of home foreclosures and bankruptcies that led to what is now called the Great Recession, the second worst economic downturn in history after the Great Depression.</p> <p>Conservative economists opposed fiscal stimulus for various reasons. They said it would not work because the deficit took out of the economy whatever the stimulus put in, making it a wash, economically. They said that any government stimulus would delay the necessary economic readjustment and sow the seeds of the next recession. The deficit was already too large and stimulus would only make it worse; fiscal prudence would do more to revive the economy than make-work jobs and such, many argued.</p> <p>Implicitly, Republicans favored a do-nothing policy. I don\u2019t recall any meaningful alternative stimulus program. Indeed, I still recall some saying government spending should be slashed to reduce the burden of government, which would be the best stimulus. None seemed to be aware that this is exactly what Franklin Roosevelt did in 1937 and it quickly led to a <a href=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/recession_of_1937_38\">sharp economic downturn</a>.</p> <p>Republicans also decried bailouts for private businesses, especially those carried out under <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/TARP-Programs/Pages/default.aspx\">Tarp</a>, the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Subsequently, Republicans universally blamed Barack Obama for any problems with this program even though it was proposed, enacted and signed into law by George W Bush.</p> <p>A few conservative academic economists resisted the do-nothing approach, rightly fearing a replay of the Great Depression, which only got so bad because of Herbert Hoover\u2019s do-nothing policies in 1929-1933. But they also argued that fiscal stimulus was unnecessary and counterproductive. Rather, they said that the Federal Reserve could fix the problem easily with no need to expand government.</p> <p>Such economists, such as <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/event/infrastructure-spending-grow\">Anna J Schwartz</a> and Robert Lucas, harkened back to the work of Milton Friedman, who died in 2006. He had <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/books/frie65-1\">argued</a> that the Great Depression was due solely to the Fed\u2019s mistake in allowing the money supply to shrink by a third, which created deflation. This came about because when banks went under in those days depositors lost everything; their money, which was mostly in the form of checking accounts, literally disappeared.</p> <p>Friedman said that the Fed could have countered this deflation by buying vast amounts of Treasury securities and creating the money out of thin air to do so. Indeed, that is the Fed\u2019s standard operating procedure to this day, which is called an <a href=\"https://www.stlouisfed.org/in-plain-english/a-closer-look-at-open-market-operations\">open-market operation</a>. It increases the money supply and leads to economic expansion \u2013 and inflation, eventually. Conversely, when the Fed sells securities from its portfolio the money supply shrinks and inflationary pressure diminishes.</p> <p>As it happened, the chairman of the Fed at that time was a Republican economist named Ben Bernanke, who had previously served as George W Bush\u2019s principal economic adviser. Bernanke was also extremely familiar with Friedman\u2019s work, having devoted his academic career to studying it. Bernanke implemented exactly the policies Friedman would have advocated and it successfully kept the banking system from imploding as it did during the Great Depression.</p> <p>Rather than praise Bernanke, however, conservative economists largely turned against him. So opposed were they to any stimulus whatsoever they even opposed what Friedman advocated. By 2010, they were predicting hyperinflation from Bernanke\u2019s policies and he was urged to <a href=\"https://economics21.org/html/open-letter-ben-bernanke-287.html\">reverse them as soon as possible</a>.</p> <p>Now, of course, all these conservative ideas have gone out the window. Republicans are pushing a $2tn stimulus, even though just a few weeks ago the $1tn Green New Deal to save the planet itself was deemed too expensive. A huge chunk of the stimulus is in the form of bailouts for big businesses. Opposition to such bailouts led to creation of the Tea Party in 2009. Where are they today? (Sound of crickets chirping.)</p> <p>The chairman of the Fed, Republican Jay Powell, appointed by Donald Trump, is pumping up the money supply with his foot all the way down on the accelerator. (Disclosure: Powell and I worked together at the treasury department.) Yet Trump and his staff continually berate him for not being even more aggressive. No letters from conservative economists warning of hyperinflation are anywhere in sight.</p> <p>The hypocrisy is so thick you can choke on it, but at least for now we need fiscal stimulus, easy money and maybe some bailouts too for the same reasons we needed them back in 2009, when virtually every Republican in Congress voted against Obama\u2019s $800bn stimulus, much more modest than Trump\u2019s.</p> <p>However, Republicans\u2019 propensity to lie and reverse course when it suits them means they will inevitably become born-again deficit hawks warning about the evil Fed and its hyperinflationary policies one minute after Joe Biden is elected.

In fact, the number of panic attacks decreased, because they were suddenly faced with other, very concrete things they had to fear. They needed to protect themselves, and so needed to have control over their bodies.\u201d</p> \n<p>Germans who suffer from angst or panic at an avalanche of coronavirus news can turn to a fear-free news service, <a href=\"https://www.angstselbsthilfe.de/angstfrei-news/\">angstfrei.news</a>, which twice a day publishes a short news overview so that they can stay informed without being overwhelmed by horror stories.</p> \n<p>French psychologists echo the importance of realising that the pain is shared.

Many have taken to running up and down the communal staircase. One father reported that his daughter was keeping up volleyball practice at home, using a toilet roll as a ball so as to avoid breakages.</p> \n<p>Many, too, have been faced with the delicate challenge of educating elderly relatives they would habitually visit at least once a week in the use of mobile technology. \u201cI\u2019ve taught my 82-year-old mother how to make video calls,\u201d said Reme, one Barcelona resident. \u201cNow there\u2019s no stopping her.\u201d</p> \n<p>Italians, also suffering from having to lead an indoor life, cheered the world in the early stages of their confinement by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/solidarity-balcony-singing-spreads-across-italy-during-lockdown\">singing or playing musical instruments from their balconies</a> each night in a show of solidarity, although reports suggest that has tapered off over the past week.</p> \n<p>Many have now taken to doing online yoga or are sharing their fitness regimes.

Similar provisions to those in the act were contained in a previous law that was declared unconstitutional in 2005.</p> <p>Barishaki said it \u201cdefies logic as to why parliament would rush to pass an act of parliament containing provisions that are <em>pari materia</em> [the same] with those that were declared unconstitutional\u201d.</p> <p>The police used the law to brutally disperse rallies organised by opposition politician Kizza Besigye in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/22/ugandan-opposition-leader-kizza-besigye-detained-election-row\">lead-up to the 2016 elections</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/06/ugandan-police-arrest-bobi-wine-fire-teargas-break-up-rally\">more recently</a> to block meetings and concerts by pop star turned politician Bobi Wine.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kizzabesigye1/status/1243195683567476744\">tweet</a>, Besigye said: \u201cCongratulations <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickopiyo\">@nickopiyo</a> &amp; the petitioners for this important court decision nullifying Uganda\u2019s obnoxious POMA Law! Without rule of law however, Uganda police will continue to act with impunity (as it did before this law was made) but without a false cover. Shame on Uganda parliament.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Livingstone Sewanyana, executive director of the Foundation for Human Rights Initiative, welcomed the ruling, saying it had been \u201can obstacle to the enjoyment of the right to freedom of expression, association and assembly in Uganda\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cGranting unfettered powers to police to deny, disperse and block meetings had a chilling effect on the democratic rights of Ugandans, particularly the political opposition, human rights defenders and activists,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International\u2019s director for east and southern Africa, said the law had been used as a tool of repression.</p> <p>\u201cUnder this law police have brutally dispersed spontaneous demonstrations and opposition rallies, while opposition politicians have been beaten up and arrested simply for exercising their rights,\u201d she said, adding that Ugandan lawmakers must now repeal the entire act, which contradicted the constitution, ahead of next year\u2019s presidential elections.</p> <p>In January, police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/06/ugandan-police-arrest-bobi-wine-fire-teargas-break-up-rally\">arrested</a> Wine and fired teargas at his supporters when he tried to hold a rally to mark his 2021 presidential bid.</p> <p>Since he became a legislator in 2017, Wine has rattled Ugandan authorities, who see him as a threat to President Yoweri Museveni.

And this question that keeps coming to us from various places: is Australia ready? Is the healthcare system ready? </p> \n   <p>Well, I can really assure people that the healthcare system in Australia is very adaptable. And it is absolutely ready for this matter. In terms of intensive care, we have doubled the capacity ... and there are beds available right now with the ventilators right now to deal with people if they require it. [Intensive care] is a very small component of those now 3,400 cases in Australia, as I mentioned. Only 30 in total. And less than that currently. </p> \n   <p>We will not be seeing a peak on the 10 April, as has been reported in some places. That is not the case. The other matter I would refer to, just in terms of cruise ships, there is an emerging issue off the coast of Western Australia at the moment in relation to several cruise ships, two in particular.<br></p> \n   <p>One is a local ship, the Vasco Da Gama. The other is the Artania, which mainly has people from Germany. There are people with Covid-19 on that ship and we are working as a federal government with the WA government very closely, as well as with the German government, to repatriate anyone who is fit to fly back to Germany and other places in Europe tomorrow.

  "<p>You have to hand it to Rian Johnson. To go from directing a<em> Star Wars</em> franchise entry to trying out a genre widely perceived as having had its heyday in the 1930s is the kind of risk more blockbuster directors should take. Better yet, it paid off: with more than \u00a3260m in the bank, <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/01/knives-out-review-rian-johnson-superior-whodunnit-agatha-christie\" title=\"\">Knives Out </a></strong>proved that there\u2019s life yet in the dusty old country-house mystery. Naturally, a sequel has already been greenlit.</p> <p>The film, available on streaming and DVD this week, is lively, limber entertainment for a quarantined night in. The spirit of Agatha Christie is strong in this jazzy old-school whodunnit revolving around a dead mystery writer, his bewildered Latina nurse and his money-grubbing family \u2013 all investigated by Daniel Craig\u2019s peculiarly southern-fried gumshoe \u2013 though its modern twist of Trump-era class politics finds fresh crannies of meaning in its classic family mansion location.</p> <p>The manor house has long been an ideal hothouse for storytellers seeking to amp up tensions \u2013 social, romantic, homicidal \u2013 between a motley array of characters. There needn\u2019t always be a mystery element: Jean Renoir\u2019s scalpel-sharp comedy of manners <strong>The Rules of the Game</strong> (<a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-la-regle-du-jeu-1939-online\" title=\"\">streaming on BFI Player</a>) has all those aforementioned conflicts, but its streak of blood is almost wickedly incidental.</p> <p>Its DNA is equally present in Johnson\u2019s romp, but one\u2019s mind goes first to the out-and-out murder mysteries, beginning with cinema\u2019s many and varied Christie adaptations. None is more pure than the 1945 version of <strong>And Then There Were None</strong>, directed by Frenchman Rene Clair in the last of his Hollywood ventures. Beyond its reliance on the racist nursery rhyme that gave Christie\u2019s book its original title, it\u2019s one of Christie\u2019s most macabre, playfully contrived narratives, as eight strangers answer an invitation to a remote Devon getaway \u2013 and get picked off one by one. With a splendid cast of golden-age character actors, it\u2019s tighter and nervier than the campy all-star Christie extravaganzas of later decades.

Or dip into a different franchise: in the 1930s and 1940s, more than 40 B-movies centred on intrepid Hawaiian detective Charlie Chan, but 1934\u2019s <strong>Charlie Chan in London</strong> was the one foray into classic country-house territory. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETEKnse3utQ\" title=\"\">Also on YouTube</a>, it\u2019s an antiquated hoot.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjXdmXhwIQk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CjXdmXhwIQk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjXdmXhwIQk\">Watch a trailer for Gosford Park.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It also plays a background role in Robert Altman\u2019s supremely chic addition to the genre, 2001\u2019s Oscar-winning <strong>Gosford Park</strong> (<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/gosford-park/id1440776559\" title=\"\">on iTunes)</a>, which mined its Christie-esque set-up for piquant upstairs-downstairs social satire in a comparable way to <em>Knives Out</em>.

  "<p>Government responses to climate breakdown and to the challenges of poverty and inequality must be changed permanently after the coronavirus has been dealt with, leading scientists have urged, as the actions taken to suppress the spread of the virus have revealed what measures are possible in an emergency.</p> <p>The Covid-19 crisis has revealed what governments are capable of doing and shone a new light on the motivation for past policies and their outcomes, said Sir Michael Marmot, professor of epidemiology and public health at University College London, and chair of the commission of the social determinants of health at the World Health Organisation.</p> <p>\u201cThe overriding objective [of governments for the last decade] has been austerity, and life expectancy for the worst-off has declined,\u201d he told journalists at a virtual meeting organised by Plan B and Extinction Rebellion. \u201cHealth tells us something fundamental about the nature of our society.

The result was that over the following decade flooding got worse, as scientists had predicted, but many more people suffered and had their homes and livelihoods put at risk because resources were withdrawn.</p> <p>King also said the government had been warned in 2016 of the dangers of a viral pandemic and should have been better prepared. \u201cIn 2016, a report indicated that our hospitals would not be ready for an epidemic of this kind. But that report has not been made public.\u201d</p> <p>The climate emergency represented a real risk but was being treated too lightly, he warned. \u201cI think the climate emergency is much more serious than people think.\u201d</p> <p>King served as special representative for climate change to the government after leaving his post as chief scientific adviser, and was one of the experts who pushed for the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations\"> Paris agreement in 2015</a>. He warned that the Paris agreement goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C or 2C was probably too weak, however, to save the world from the impacts of climate breakdown. \u201cWe need to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere,\u201d he warned.</p> <p>He pointed to the economic recovery plans after the second world war, and said that after the coronavirus crisis has passed, governments should consider similar plans to redevelop the global economy to adjust to a fossil fuel-free world.</p> <p>Some people have pointed out that the response to the current crisis has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-uk-lockdown-big-drop-air-pollution\">reduced emissions and air pollution</a> in the short term. But Jason Hickel, lecturer in economic anthropology at Goldsmiths University, warned of taking too many lessons from that.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you scale down energy use and industrial production, it does have these ecological benefits but the crucial thing to observe is that this is happening in an unplanned, chaotic way which is hurting people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would never advocate such a thing. What we need is a planned approach to reducing unnecessary industrial activity that has no connection to human welfare and that disproportionately benefits already wealthy people as opposed to ordinary people. There are much more equitable, just and carefully planned ways to approach this kind of problem.\u201d</p> <p>A group of leading economists and global health experts including four Nobel prize-winners has urged the leaders of the G20 countries to devote trillions to helping poor countries out of the coronavirus crisis, or face a continuing crisis of migration, recurring global Covid-19 outbreaks, and social breakdown in the developing world.</p> <p>The experts said: \u201cDeveloping countries are facing an unprecedented collective threat to human life, social cohesion and economic devastation. Massive economic losses will be incurred as countries desperately try to cope; people will migrate out of fear as the epidemic takes hold, leading to social disruption, violence and security issues.\u201d</p> <p>Erik Berglof, director of the Institute of Global Affairs at the London School of Economics and an organiser of the letter, told the Guardian: \u201cIf it will take more than $2tn (\u00a31.6bn), perhaps as much as $6tn, to fix the US, we are not going to fix the rest of the world for less. To attach a specific number now is almost meaningless. What we need are new and creative ways of using global financial muscle to back up existing international financial institutions.\u201d</p> <p>He said that some measures, such as providing emergency resources and medical help, could be taken quickly, but it was important to manage the process with a long-term view as well, using and expanding existing international institutions and programmes. \u201cYou cannot sprinkle money from helicopters in these economies because it would never reach the intended receivers,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need carefully managed programmes and projects that can help these countries through this extremely difficult period.\u201d</p> <p>Infrastructure investment would take longer, but would be vital to ensure that countries can recover from an economic shock that economists say will be greater than that following the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>In providing this help, the developed world would also be benefiting its own citizens, as if efforts to control Covid-19 in poor countries fail, \u201cthe virus could become endemic, producing new waves of destructive outbreaks around the world\u201d, the letter warned.</p>",

But if the title bears any validity, his military tactics have been highly unconventional. He has exacerbated the problems encountered by federal agencies by playing musical chairs at the top of the coronavirus force. </p> \n<p>The president began by creating on 29 January a special coronavirus taskforce, then gave Vice-President Mike Pence the job, who promptly <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/vice-president-pence-announces-ambassador-debbie-birx-serve-white-house-coronavirus-response-coordinator/\">appointed Deborah Birx</a> \u201ccoronavirus response coordinator\u201d, before the federal emergency agency Fema began taking charge of key areas, with <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kushner-coronavirus-team-sparks-confusion-plaudits-inside-white-house-response-efforts/2020/03/18/02038a16-6874-11ea-9923-57073adce27c_story.html\">Jared Kushner</a>, the president\u2019s son-in-law, creating a shadow team that increasingly appears to be calling the shots.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point of responsibility,\u201d the former senior official told the Guardian. \u201cIt keeps shifting. Nobody owns the problem.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Trump: everything\u2019s going to be great</h2> \n<p>Amid the confusion, day-to-day management of the crisis has frequently come directly from Trump himself via his Twitter feed. The president, with more than half an eye on the New York stock exchange, has consistently talked down the scale of the crisis.</p> \n<p>On 30 January, as the World Health Organization was declaring a global emergency, Trump said: \u201cWe only have five people. Hopefully, everything\u2019s going to be great.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5b86d89c-98d6-4d80-ba4b-9c7affda275f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NezEbDx4B9A?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On 24 February, Trump claimed \u201cthe coronavirus is very much under control in the USA\u201d. The next day, Nancy Messonnier, the CDC\u2019s top official on respiratory diseases, took the radically different approach of <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/25/cdc-expects-community-spread-of-coronavirus-as-top-official-warns-disruptions-could-be-severe/\">telling the truth</a>, warning the American people that \u201cdisruption to everyday life might be severe\u201d.</p> \n<p>Trump was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/07/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html\">reportedly</a> so angered by the comment and its impact on share prices that he shouted down the phone at Messonnier\u2019s boss, the secretary of health and human services, Alex Azar.</p> \n<p>\u201cMessonnier was 100% right. She gave a totally honest and accurate assessment,\u201d Konyndyk told the Guardian.

When governors begged Trump to unleash the full might of the US government on this critical problem, he gave his answer on 16 March.</p> \n<p>In a phrase that will stand beside 20 January 2020 as one of the most revelatory moments of the history of coronavirus, he said: \u201cRespirators, ventilators, all of the equipment \u2013 try getting it yourselves.\u201d</p> \n<p>To date, the Trump administration has supplied 400 ventilators to New York. By Cuomo\u2019s estimation, 30,000 are needed.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou want a pat on the back for sending 400 ventilators?\u201d Cuomo scathingly <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/03/24/cuomo-mocks-fema-shipment-you-want-a-pat-on-the-back-for-sending-400-ventilators/#35884a3ca7b8\">asked on Tuesday</a>.

Cities, even individual hospitals, are coping as best they can.</p> \n<p>In an improvised attempt to address such inconsistencies, charitable startups have proliferated on social media.

Silences carry a different weight and patients are saying more than they might if we were actually in the room \u2013 I suspect I am, too.</p> <p>New themes are emerging around the possibility of loss, particularly not being able to see family for some time, and there\u2019s a huge sense of anxiety, which most of the population is probably feeling. People are having to think very carefully about their own autonomy: who am I? What do I do here? Who will be there for me? Who can I be there for? Of course, the conflicts patients brought to therapy beforehand will remain or intensify with isolation or illness. There will also be some creativity and resourcefulness emerging.</p> <p>I am more acutely aware of the discrepancy between those who can and can\u2019t afford therapy. For those whose financial circumstances are hugely impacted, I have substantially reduced my fees \u2013 I don\u2019t want anybody to stop having therapy because they can\u2019t afford it. What I\u2019d suggest to people who can\u2019t, particularly those feeling very anxious, is to set up phone calls with one or two trusted people to share feelings and listen. <strong>S</strong><strong>de</strong><strong>R</strong></p> <p><strong>The illustrator\u2019s take: Igor Bastidas</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dabe49f87b647c488f1e47490f9109424e939f53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dabe49f87b647c488f1e47490f9109424e939f53/0_82_548_548/500.jpg\" alt=\"Illustrator Igor Bastidas\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A Venezuelan artist living in New York, whose illustration appears at the top of this piece, Bastidas says: \u2018In the midst of this collapse, New Yorkers and the rest of the world are looking out for each other.

I have around 20 guys on the street, with approximately 200 regular customers. We have two main concerns now: sourcing drugs and getting enough money. We expect no more cocaine shipments from abroad for the next six weeks, so prices have shot up. I\u2019m maintaining the same prices I\u2019ve always charged but I\u2019m concerned that, when stock begins to run low, people higher up the chain will charge more or cut the cocaine and decrease its quality. People are panicking \u2013 the amounts of cannabis they\u2019re buying is ridiculous \u2013 so we are just dealing to regulars now. I\u2019ve told my workers to be strict with what they sell and who to, but they aren\u2019t changing their behaviour much, other than offering to post through letterboxes and accept bank transfers from trusted customers. People running out of money is a big concern, but we\u2019ll always have the regular cokeheads who buy most days. </p> <p>I\u2019ve been doing this for 12 years and don\u2019t have any dependants \u2013 other than sometimes helping my parents out with bits of cash \u2013 so I\u2019m not financially worried. My biggest concern is handling money. I\u2019ve been wearing gloves. <strong>D</strong><strong>H</strong></p> <h2><strong>The City trader</strong></h2> <p><strong>You can\u2019t trade millions while your child is screaming for hot milk</strong></p> <p>A trader\u2019s life is stressful enough: your work is high frequency, intense and filled with risk. No one wants to screw up and lose a bunch of money for their firm. </p> <p>We\u2019ve been tracking coronavirus for months, but no one thought it would get as bad as in China. So when we heard we\u2019d either have to relocate to a disaster recovery site, away from our offices, or set up a trading desk at home, we were shocked.</p> <p>The idea of a disaster recovery site came about after 9/11. The idea was that major investment banks needed to have a building away from their offices so they could keep functioning in an emergency. Goldman Sachs has offices in Croydon; Barclays is in Northolt; JP Morgan in Basingstoke. But they were created as a solution to a terrorist attack, not to a pandemic. In a London lockdown, some traders will struggle to make it to these sites.</p> <p>Working from home brings a lot of problems. Traders tend not to have four screens on their kitchen table, nor recorded lines to make sure we don\u2019t break compliance procedures. Plus I have kids. You can\u2019t expect to trade millions with a child next door screaming for hot milk. Much of trading involves making fast decisions. We\u2019re struggling through what will probably be the toughest time in our career, and we\u2019re worried about patchy wifi and that our kids will be slowing down the connection by watching a streaming service.</p> <p>Everyone\u2019s trying to keep their spirits up, with funny photos of people\u2019s home setup \u2013 I saw a Persian cat sitting in front of someone\u2019s screens, looking like a trader. But this disruption will affect our ability to get the economy back on its feet, at what may be a defining moment in our lives. </p> <p><strong>The illustrator\u2019s take: Yang Sio Maan</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6863fb9768d6af1e3be688d7362654553f2a6057\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6863fb9768d6af1e3be688d7362654553f2a6057/0_599_2917_2834/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of people wearing face masks exercising in a park, with tower blocks behind and cars on the road\" width=\"1000\" height=\"972\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e5a0cb6ae260cfbd7755d3f7e045a28d8a0ea43d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5a0cb6ae260cfbd7755d3f7e045a28d8a0ea43d/41_42_452_496/452.jpg\" alt=\"Head shot of illustrator Yang Sio Maan\" width=\"452\" height=\"496\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Yang, who is based in Macau, southern China, says, \u2018This is the most densely populated region in the world. Since the outbreak in late January, most people have been working from home. But while the streets and malls are a ghost town, Coloane island has never been so crowded. This is the lung of the city, covered in hiking trails, and at the weekend, the traffic gets backed up. People exercise wearing surgical masks: jogging, hiking, yoga, or simply absorbing some vitamin D after another week in quarantine.\u2019</p> <h2><strong>On not touching Dad, by Tom Lamont</strong></h2> <p><strong>Hugging was really great</strong></p> <p>A couple of weekends ago, for the first time since the 90s, when I was a shoegaze-addled teen who thought misanthropy was quite sophisticated, I waved hello to my dad. He is 75 now. Never one to take more than his share of anything in the past, he\u2019s recently started stockpiling underlying health conditions, and this puts him among the 30 million vulnerable and/or elderly people in the UK who\u2019ll be getting some coronavirus clearing room for the foreseeable future, whether any of us like it or not. I warned him on the way in: \u201cI\u2019m only going to wave, Pa! From the other side of the room!\u201d Overdoing it, making light of it, first with the chorus dancer\u2019s jazz hands, then with the big, all-arm, side-to-side motion, as if I was a gameshow contestant encouraged to say hi to a parent watching at home.</p> <p>It felt about as silly and contrived as a gameshow, greeting him this way. Not hugging your dad? We chuckled it off at the time. We settled, on different sofas, into our usual routine of company and snacks. I felt weirdly agitated, as if I\u2019d left something unfinished \u2013 like when you keep one hand out of bath water, to hold a magazine or a phone, and the rest of your body seems to nag at you: \u201cSubmerge the other hand, Tom. Submerge the bloody hand!\u201d</p> <p>I come from a family that, for the most part, could be defined as Way-Tactile Jew. We kiss each other. We hug. We really get in there. I am not by nature overfamiliar, but this tactility when saying hello is hardwired in me. It has led to more than my share of greetings errors with men who vaguely resemble my father or grandfather, yet who don\u2019t, weirdly, relish the full bear hug on a first encounter.</p> <p>Maybe for this reason I\u2019ve always been interested in how, physically, we say hello. A couple of years ago, I wrote a story for this magazine on the subject, interviewing dozens of people about their own habits. There was a lot of contradiction, between generations and genders and cultures. Hand slaps. Fist bumps. \u201cA curt nod and a please-move-on-now look.\u201d The one- or two-arm hug. Chaos, someone called it. An 80-year-old told me she was tired of it all. Why couldn\u2019t we just choose a few blanket rules and stick to them?</p> <p>Coronavirus has given us those rules. Strangers get a wide berth \u2013 the government-mandated two metres \u2013 so that now we slalom the pavements to get to the supermarket, avoiding accidental incursions by anyone travelling the other way. </p> <p>Among friends and relatives, the transition has been the hardest. For a while (until about 10 days ago, at the time of writing), the hugging and kissing carried on with a kind of fuck-you heedlessness. No global pandemic was about to stop us grabbing a bezzie around the shoulder, or giving Mum a peck on either cheek. Then, with a creeping sense of the seriousness of things (seven days ago? six?), there was a period of honest forgetfulness. People would smash a wet one on you and then touch their foreheads, remembering. Horribly quickly it became unthinkable. Kissing would be like punching somebody in the mouth. No more arm-squeezes, no wrist-grabs. So there I was, in my parents\u2019 living room, with my back against the wall, waving. \u201cHOW ARE YOU OVER THERE?\u201d</p> <p>By the end of the visit, I had realised how much we used to communicate around the edges of our talk. You can tease \u2013 but without the fond finger-jab on the shoulder, teasing registers as mean. You can suggest a hot drink \u2013 but without the palm on the thigh, to mean, \u201cI know you like one around now\u201d, this may as well be the offer of a well-intentioned stranger. There was that sense of something half-done, and when it was time to say goodbye, this feeling clarified into a more fundamental one of abandonment. My dad knew why I was waving at him as if he were a distant parade float. I knew why. This didn\u2019t change the fact that a wave was inadequate.</p> <p>I worry that when this is over, we\u2019ll all have been reprogrammed not to touch, to fear proximity. I worry that the self-conscious elbow bump will become the standard, and that entering a stranger\u2019s two-metre exclusion zone will for ever be considered uncool. I worry that we\u2019ll never rid ourselves of the sense, bedding deeper as I write, that to do the most natural thing in the world and embrace someone elderly and ailing and who we love might only be to hurry them on their way. </p> <h2><strong>The Guardian magazine model</strong></h2> <p><strong>Winston will miss being in the Guardian\u2019s All Ages fashion shoots</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"46422517478f189ebfc4c812ab2edeb9bb58ee68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46422517478f189ebfc4c812ab2edeb9bb58ee68/615_188_1224_3016/406.jpg\" alt=\"All Ages model Winston\" width=\"406\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018All Ages is like a family. \u2018</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Newby/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I started modelling when I was 73. I\u2019m 83 now, though people tell me I look 56. I was introduced to modelling by chance, by my neighbour Lydia, and I\u2019ve been lucky. Coxy, my agent, says: \u2018\u2018There is something in your face that people like.\u201d I\u2019ve been a regular in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/series/fashion-for-all-ages+mens-fashion\">All Ages</a> for four years, and I\u2019ve worked all over the world.</p> <p>I\u2019ve had five shoots cancelled so far. All Ages is suspended after this week because we need to self-isolate; work trips to Romania, Sweden and Nigeria have been called off. I was supposed to play a dead body in a film shoot in Germany; that\u2019s off. I\u2019m lucky that, as a retired engineer, modelling isn\u2019t my only source of income. I don\u2019t know what the future holds, but I don\u2019t have too many worries. The one thing I will miss is the company of the Guardian team: All Ages is like a family. </p> <p>A friend told me I am supposed to stay indoors now, but I do go out, just to shop. I live alone and my daughter comes at weekends to check that Daddy is OK. I\u2019m very cautious. I wash my hands and use Dettol. If I saw a person coughing on the bus, I would stay far away.</p> <p>Touch wood, I\u2019ve always been lucky health-wise. I eat a strict diet; I like green tea, cabbage, chicken, wild salmon. I\u2019ve been weightlifting since I was 15. In 1997 we extended our garage and put barbells in there, so I can exercise at home.</p> <p>I saw people fighting over toilet paper on the news. To me that is selfishness, though I\u2019m lucky again there: in the 80s, I bought a dozen packets of toilet paper in a cash and carry, and I\u2019m still getting through them now. <strong>H</strong><strong>M</strong></p> <h2><strong>The life-drawing model</strong></h2> <p><strong>Getting naked in a stranger\u2019s living room can be cosy</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m an actor, but like most I am often between roles. I started life modelling as a way to earn extra money and it\u2019s been a good source of income. When coronavirus started limiting public gatherings, I was concerned I wouldn\u2019t be able to model any more, just as theatres were closing and acting work was drying up. But one of the drawing clubs I model for, <a href=\"http://atyn.co.uk/\" title=\"\">All The Young Nudes</a>, has begun running a livestreamed class and they asked me to model for the first one.</p> <p>We did it at an organiser\u2019s home. Sometimes these sessions are cold and uncomfortable \u2013 you have to sit on a plastic chair \u2013 so it was nice being in a warm room with a fire and a couch. There was a camera operator there to set up the technical side. Around 100 artists then paid \u00a34 (a normal session is \u00a36) to get a link to the private stream, for two hours.</p> <p>It might seem strange to watch a livestream when you could just draw from a picture, but all the artists I\u2019ve spoken to say that, psychologically, it\u2019s a very different practice: you\u2019re responding to something in the moment (often poses are held for only five minutes) and you\u2019re time-limited. It makes people draw differently, and it still felt like a drawing club because there was an online chat with some discussion of the works, which people posted on social media afterwards.</p> <p>For me, the only thing the technology changed was that there was a lag on the camera. So sometimes when I changed pose I\u2019d glance at the monitor and see how I\u2019d looked. It made me remember: life drawing poses are not meant to be flattering. And at moments it felt strange, in the way that being alone and naked in someone else\u2019s living room would.</p> <p>I\u2019m aware livestreaming is more open to abuse than live sessions: someone could be screenshotting me, or they might be at home wanking. It\u2019s important I am not recognised as a model in other areas of my life, and there\u2019s a greater risk of that happening online. I\u2019m placing a lot of trust in the artists. <strong>Sam Wolfson</strong></p> <h2><strong>The IndyCar racer</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.indycar.com/Series/IndyCar-Series/Felix-Rosenqvist\" title=\"\">Felix Rosenqvist</a> finds a virtual car race is sweatier than a real one</strong></p> <p>I was in Florida for the start of the IndyCar Series when they cancelled the whole thing. Two days later, back home in Indianapolis, I put on shorts and socks \u2013 no shoes \u2013 and got into my racing simulator in my little man cave. Most pros now practise in simulators before each race weekend. It\u2019s a whole business: companies scan tracks and sell them to teams who integrate them into their simulators. I got mine so I could mess around in winter; it\u2019s got a racing seat and pedals, and a 49in screen.</p> <p>A lot of pros are on<a href=\"https://www.iracing.com/\" title=\"\"> iRacing</a>, an online simulation game where you get matched against people with the same rating. I use it a bit, and sometimes I\u2019ll get tagged in an Instagram post: \u201cOh, Felix Rosenqvist just drove into me!\u201d It\u2019s a pretty cool way for fans to engage with racers, though the best gamers always beat us. It kind of lowers your self-confidence, but it\u2019s different because they don\u2019t need to be brave.</p> <p>After the Formula One season also got suspended because of the pandemic, a company called <a href=\"https://torqueesport.com/\" title=\"\">Torque Esports</a> organised an all-star e-racing battle. They invited pro gamers as well as pro racing drivers from IndyCar and F1 to compete, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/max-verstappen\" title=\"\">Max Verstappen</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/piquetjr/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Nelson Piquet Jr</a>.</p> <p>About 70,000 viewers watched the battle stream live. I got to the final and started 12th but finished 7th and was the best driver. It\u2019s weird: I sweated more in that race than I do on the track, because I was concentrating and squeezing the wheel so hard. I was done for the day. Real driving will always be my priority, but this is something new, and these strange times will put it on the radar. <strong>S</strong><strong>U</strong></p> <p><strong>The illustrator\u2019s take: Rebecca Hendin</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"11cc5fce201e0282307fd77a0b2b26fd1aafb555\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11cc5fce201e0282307fd77a0b2b26fd1aafb555/0_0_2627_1693/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of woman in blue-tinted room sitting looking out of window with pink flowers and leaves outside it\" width=\"1000\" height=\"644\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e51816c3829e5ae9612a3cdc4f4ad6a252afc813\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e51816c3829e5ae9612a3cdc4f4ad6a252afc813/0_0_548_548/500.jpg\" alt=\"Headshot of illustrator Rebecca Hendin\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The London-based American illustrator and animator, who won <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/04/guardians-rebecca-hendin-wins-award-for-boris-johnson-cartoon\">2019\u2019s political cartoon of the year</a> award, says, \u2018I wanted to focus on the dichotomy of the horrific news, and the world outside.

But it\u2019s also up to me to decide what we do when something serious happens outside the Big Brother house. The 14 contestants for the current series went into the house on 10 February, when there were only 14 confirmed infections in Germany.</p> <p>As a general rule, the contestants are not meant to know what is going on in the outside world. But when the number of Covid-19 cases in Europe began to increase dramatically, we knew we needed to tell them. Cancelling the show wasn\u2019t an option, but if one of the people had told us they wanted to be with their family, we would have let them. At the end of the day, it\u2019s just television.</p> <p>We didn\u2019t want there to be a great drama; just to give the contestants a sober account of what was happening outside. That\u2019s why we sat the Big Brother doctor, who assessed the contestants, next to the host, behind a glass wall. The German Big Brother container is located near Cologne, in North Rhine-Westphalia, the German state that has seen the highest number of infections and deaths.</p> <p>There were a lot of shocked faces, and some tears. But 23 hours later, life in the Big Brother house had pretty much resumed as normal.</p> <p>After the contestants were given an update, there were individual messages from parents, siblings and friends. Luckily, they are all fine. The sister of one of the contestants is in quarantine, but only as a precautionary measure. A lot of relatives begged the contestants to stay in the house. It\u2019s the safest place in Germany right now: you are effectively already under quarantine.</p> <p>It\u2019s also the only place in Germany that doesn\u2019t need to apply any social distancing measures, or handwashing routines, because we know all the contestants are healthy. The celebrities who were introduced to the house later on were all tested beforehand. If Angela Merkel had wanted to give her corona address to the nation from inside the Big Brother house, we would have let her in.</p> <p>What would we do if the next contestant to be voted out asked to stay? If they\u2019re voted out, they have to leave the house. Those are the rules. <strong>P</strong><strong>O</strong></p> <h2><strong>The Jesuit sister</strong></h2> <p><strong>A simpler life might lead more people to </strong><strong>God, hopes Jane Livesey</strong></p> <p>Normally I live a peripatetic life. A significant part of my work, as general superior of the <a href=\"https://www.congregationofjesus.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Congregation of Jesus</a>, is visiting communities all over the world \u2013 we have about 1,500 sisters in 20 countries \u2013 to support and encourage them. But now we\u2019re all in lockdown \u2013 I\u2019ve been out once in 12 days \u2013 and I can see cabin fever is not unlikely. We\u2019re a small community in Rome, aged mainly from our mid-50s to mid-70s, and like everyone else we don\u2019t go out. People are only allowed to the supermarket and pharmacy. Fortunately, we have space and gardens, unlike most Romans. We\u2019re trying to keep in touch with our communities in the wider world. At least we\u2019re blessed to be enduring this crisis in a time of technology and social media. We\u2019re completely wired up here.</p> <p>Normally we have Mass daily; not now, but we\u2019re praying more. Faith is important to people in times such as this. For all of us, the crisis is triggering questions about what is important. Having a pope like Francis is wonderful; he sent out a beautiful message: \u201cTonight before falling asleep, think about when we will return to the street, hug again\u2026 We will go back to laughing together. Strength and courage. See you soon!\u201d</p> <p>It will be interesting to see what happens in the longer term \u2013 whether some people turn to faith. Faith is about finding meaning, and everyone is now trying to do that. People are living a stripped-back life and that means they\u2019ve been given time for reflection. This crisis has shown us that vulnerability has something to teach us; suddenly, we\u2019re all vulnerable.</p> <p>The temptation is to retreat, to look inwards. But once this is over, do we stay behind borders or will we have learned things? We might have opened our hearts in ways we hadn\u2019t thought about before. <strong>HS</strong></p> <h2><strong>The round-the-world sailor</strong></h2> <p><strong>You\u2019re safe in the middle of the ocean, says Afshin Ahmadian</strong></p> <p>I don\u2019t have any sailing background; I was working in finance in London when I saw an ad on the underground for the <a href=\"https://www.clipperroundtheworld.com/\" title=\"\">Clipper Round The World Race</a>. It started in September from St Katharine Docks in east London, with a crew of all nationalities: Chinese, French, Iranian, British, Australian, Swedish and Italian. We went to Portugal, Uruguay, South Africa, across the Southern Ocean to Australia; then we were supposed to go to Sanya in south-west China.</p> <p>When we set off, there was no sign of coronavirus; we were just happy to be going to sea. Everything was new and interesting \u2013 the watch system, the storms, the sunrises and sunsets.</p> <p>Then the skipper got an email saying the destination would be changing because of an outbreak. That was in February; we thought it was just an isolated incident. On the boat you are quite shut off, just focusing on the race and how to keep yourself fit, fed and hydrated.</p> <p>When we arrived in the Philippines, I realised the situation in Iran had become severe \u2013 for a time, it had the highest number of cases after China, before the Italian situation worsened. My family is in Iran and my girlfriend is Italian; they are OK, but all the countries close to my heart were badly affected.</p> <p>We were in no danger on the boat: we were in the middle of the ocean and hadn\u2019t been in any contaminated regions. But when we came back to the Philippines, around 14 March, the whole event was postponed. We had five more months to go.</p> <p>I have a flight booked to Italy, and will move into my girlfriend\u2019s place. We are all hoping that in 10 months\u2019 time we can continue the race. <strong>Sam Wollaston</strong></p> <h2><strong>The prison inmate</strong></h2> <p><strong>A hotel-size bar of soap, says Joe Vanderford, doesn\u2019t last a week in jail</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve been in US prisons across three states for 33 years. Never in my life did I think I would envy an Iranian prisoner [85,000 were temporarily released this month]. I\u2019m in the Shakopee women\u2019s correctional facility in Minnesota. There have been no commutations or early releases in this state so far. Cases of Covid-19 on the outside are rising: 89 at the time of writing. We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s in our facility yet.</p> <p>There\u2019s no rhyme or reason to how this virus is being managed inside these walls. One officer travelled to Europe and returned to work. Another went to a nearby state, and hasn\u2019t been allowed back in. One guard says this is all an overreaction, a conspiracy against Trump, and refuses to clean anything. Another is constantly wiping her shoes with hospital-grade disinfectant. When I went for my arthritis checkup, they\u2019d taken most of the chairs out of the waiting room, an attempt to force social distancing. But the trash was overflowing, a rubber glove lying on the filthy floor.</p> <p>Meanwhile, people are being transferred in from county jails every day, and service providers are coming in from other states. Yesterday, an eye doctor who services a bunch of prisons in the area treated several women here. In the middle of appointments, he was stopped: the Wisconsin system, where he had just seen patients, has people quarantined. He said he had no symptoms, but the women who were treated are furious.</p> <p>If someone here gets diagnosed with Covid-19, I don\u2019t know where they\u2019ll go. We have an isolation room intended for a single person. They\u2019ve already taken two people up there, with more to follow. One of them had already been quarantined for days in her cell with two roommates who remain in the general population. They\u2019re serving the sick people food on paper plates. In another unit, someone has fallen ill; she was using the open restrooms, which means people go to the bathroom while you brush your teeth. They\u2019re testing them all for the virus. No results yet.</p> <p>I\u2019m on a biohazard task crew. We have special gear, but we\u2019re short on supplies. They\u2019re rationing toilet paper and giving us each a hotel-sized bar of soap, which won\u2019t last a week with handwashing alone. There\u2019s no hand sanitiser, except in the kitchen. I see on the news the public is hoarding, panicked. As incarcerated people, we\u2019re the bottom of the barrel. Times will just get tougher for us.</p> <p>Most of my friends are older: women in wheelchairs, women with respiratory conditions, women who spray the door handles without being asked. We\u2019re a village, trying to protect each other. It\u2019s a matter of when, not if, we will be exposed. I\u2019m 52. I wasn\u2019t sentenced to death. But it\u2019s a crapshoot from here on out. <strong>Jvd</strong><strong>L</strong></p> <h2><strong>The musician</strong></h2> <p><strong>We\u2019ll be desperate to dance when this is over, says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/frank-turner\" title=\"\">Frank Turner</a></strong></p> <p>My last three shows \u2013 in Bath, Aylesbury, Southend \u2013 were three of the weirdest days of my life. My tour started on 3 March and the first week was fine. You don\u2019t believe it\u2019s real at first, then the bad news starts piling up and what you can\u2019t contemplate becomes reality at remarkable speed. Every day was a rollercoaster. I\u2019d wake up thinking we should cancel everything, then I\u2019d do a show and think, actually, this is what people want. There was a redemptive feeling in the room.</p> <p>Usually, my line of work survives catastrophic events because people want to gather and lose themselves in art, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re supposed to be doing right now. Looking out at a room full of people who were standing close to each other was troubling on a moral level. You ask yourself: am I part of the problem? I mentioned coronavirus halfway through the show in Bath and people got nervous. I realised I wasn\u2019t exactly reassuring them about their decision to come.</p> <p>Over that weekend, the national mood shifted. I started copping a lot of flak on social media from people who were very angry the shows were going ahead. By the time we got to Southend, we still had 800 people but the mood was really odd. It felt like last orders. Before I went on, I was 95% sure this was the last one; when I came off stage, I told my tour manager, \u201cYeah, we\u2019re done now.\u201d</p> <p>The idea of doing a live stream seemed obvious. I set up a fundraiser for my touring crew, because if they don\u2019t work they don\u2019t get paid. As we speak it\u2019s raised \u00a343,000, which is incredible, but it\u2019s a one-off for a specific cause. I\u2019m not sure I could make my living this way. I think when shows become viable again, there may well be a golden period because people will be extremely relieved to be out of the house. The problem is nobody knows how far off that is. My worry is how much of the live infrastructure is still going to be there. All my friends who run independent venues are staring into the abyss right now. It\u2019s catastrophic. <strong>D</strong><strong>L</strong></p> <p><strong>The illustrator\u2019s take: Andrea Ucini</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"03e010bba98ce0561562a309281772910da159a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03e010bba98ce0561562a309281772910da159a8/0_451_2734_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of people under umbrellas sitting at opposite ends of zebra crossing in the rain\" width=\"1000\" height=\"720\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a9ebad416b90cc4cfafc2d4117f57be061a269c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9ebad416b90cc4cfafc2d4117f57be061a269c4/0_339_342_342/342.jpg\" alt=\"Illustrator Andrea Ucini\" width=\"342\" height=\"342\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Originally from Italy and now living in Denmark, Ucini illustrated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/elena-ferrantes-weekend-column\">Elena Ferrante\u2019s weekly Guardian Weekend column</a> in 2018.

The next week we limited everything. But even then, loo roll, kitchen roll, wipes, baby milk and nappies are going in a flash. As soon as we bring a pallet out, it\u2019s gone before we can get it on the shelves. There\u2019s one lonely tin of oxtail soup where there used to be a whole section of tinned tomatoes and kidney beans. Our supply chain is good but they can\u2019t get it to us fast enough.</p> <p>Of course, if you see an empty shelf, you panic. It\u2019s human nature. This morning there were 150 people snaking around the car park half an hour before we opened. We\u2019re selling more than Christmas Eve every day, seven days a week.</p> <p>You\u2019re seeing everyday dramas unfold. One minute, there\u2019s someone with the last four packs of pasta and they\u2019re giving two to an older person; the next you\u2019re seeing an 18-year-old mum in floods of tears because there\u2019s no baby milk and she\u2019s got newborn twins. I would say that 90% of people are fine, but I\u2019ve had girls I work with called the worst names you can imagine just for saying, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, you can\u2019t have that whole trolley-full of loo roll.\u201d There\u2019s been an unspoken divide in this country between people who are mindful of how their actions might affect people who are less comfortable than them, and the small minority who don\u2019t care about anybody else. We\u2019ve got zero tolerance for them.</p> <p>Morale is really good. The company\u2019s been brilliant. What was a mundane job has turned into a really important social responsibility. We feel like the fifth emergency service. You know those magnetic sirens <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/mar/26/kojak-your-next-box-set\" title=\"\">Kojak</a> used to put on his car?

My first action was to make sure we were not bringing in any unessential staff. We also started screening staff before they depart for Antarctica. We are a small community and live in relatively close proximity. But there\u2019s always a doctor here, even in winter when we go down to 20 people; right now we have two.</p> <p>When something like this happens, we feel a long way away but well connected. We have good internet access and great support from our headquarters in Cambridge, England. We also have our own dedicated medical unit, experts in telemedicine who can give a whole station advice.</p> <p>My folks are in Fort William, Scotland, and my father said very cheerfully that it gives him a perfect excuse to spend lots of time in the garden by himself. That and turning down social engagements makes him very happy. <strong>Sam Wollaston</strong></p> <h2><strong>The drum\u2019n\u2019bass DJ</strong></h2> <p><strong>Club culture will return with the mother of all parties, says <a href=\"https://andyc.cc/about\">Andy C</a></strong></p> <p>The last shows I played were in Moscow and Prague at the end of February. We landed in Moscow and they wouldn\u2019t let us off the plane. Without explanation, a woman with a mask got on and started going up to every passenger and taking their temperature. Then in the airport a whole planeload of people arriving from the far east of Russia were herded into a corner. There were people in hazmat suits taking temperatures before you got to baggage claim. Then the whole airport was locked down. We thought we were going to be quarantined in Moscow. That was unnerving. The show was actually fantastic \u2013 a beautiful vibe \u2013 but the urge to get home to my family was huge.</p> <p>At that point my diary was still full. The first cancellation was Ultra in Miami. I should have been in Vienna on 14 March but that got cancelled. Would I have gone if it hadn\u2019t been cancelled? It\u2019s a difficult question to answer now. If I don\u2019t turn up, nobody gets paid, but then the moral approach is to make sure everybody\u2019s safe. If we all work together and heed these warnings, then this is going to be over quicker. My kid got sent home with a cough, so we\u2019re indoors for 14 days.</p> <p>On a personal level, the next few months are wiped out but my main concern is covering the people who put the stages together, do the lighting, work behind bars, security\u2026 It\u2019s savage for our industry. Loads of DJs are doing tutoring online, uploading mixes, doing virtual sets. I\u2019m definitely going to be in the studio a lot more. I\u2019m holding on to the hope that the second half of this year is going to be a lot more positive. The drum\u2019n\u2019bass scene is such a beautiful, communal scene and we will bounce back with the mother of all parties. I was listening to a set earlier and thinking, oh yeah, that\u2019s when we used to go out and rave. <strong>DL</strong></p>",
  "<h2>Island of Ponza, Italy</h2> <p>As fate would have it, I arrived back in my tiny Venice apartment on 8 March, the day the city was locked down. Since then, restrictions have become increasingly \u2013 and rightly \u2013 more stringent, so today I can only go 200 metres outside, apart from a trip to the shops. Luckily I have a great view over the city from my rooftop terrace. From there, I can sit and dream of places I\u2019ll revisit when I have the chance. Top of the list is the tiny island of Ponza, 20 miles off the west coast between Rome and Naples in the turquoise Tyrrhenian Sea. Getting there is no easy task, but with minimum carbon footprint, I enjoyed a memorable journey: a scenic train ride across Italy from my home in Venice down to Formia, boarding an antiquated ferry, then slowly chugging into Ponza\u2019s harbour, a mass of bobbing boats surrounded by rising tiers of pastel-coloured houses, as the setting sun lit up the sky in a blaze of colours.</p> <p>Everyone in the main town seems to offer genuine family B&amp;B accommodation, and our host, Gino Pesce, also had the perfect name for his fish restaurant, <a href=\"https://www.acquapazza.com/\">Acqua Pazza</a> (crazy water). Sitting down for dinner, a fisherman walked in carrying a crate of wriggling giant red prawns, the speciality of these waters. Simply cooked by Gino\u2019s mamma in a rich tomato and olive sauce, they were served on a bed of homemade tagliatelle, and I have honestly never tasted anything so fresh, so succulent.</p> <p>Each day is a different adventure on this wild volcanic island that is five miles long and never more than a mile and a half wide. There is hardly a car to be seen, and while hiring a bike is fun, the roads are hilly and very windy, so mostly we set off on the excellent local bus and then hiked through the mountainous countryside, where steep paths along brilliant white, jagged cliffs lead down to idyllic narrow inlets and hidden bays. The best experience was going out for the day with a fisherman, mooring in a deserted creek with not another soul in sight, then plunging into the crystal clear water surrounded by shoals of multicoloured fish.</p> <p>Ponza is invaded in July and August, so I dream of going back there when flowers are budding in springtime or when the vineyards are ready for harvest in autumn.<br><strong>John Brunton, Venice</strong></p> <h2><br>Els Ports de Beseit, Aragon, Spain</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56643f573fa285e0281844ec79199eec59b3b8a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56643f573fa285e0281844ec79199eec59b3b8a6/0_0_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matarranya Apicture taken 12 years ago that shows writer Stephen Burgen\u2019s son Louis jumping into the pool.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen Burgen\u2019s son leaps into a natural pool in the Els Ports in a picture taken 12 years ago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Burgen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I mostly work from home, so in many ways the lockdown has affected me less than others but, like most homeworkers, I need to get out for some exercise. Mostly I walk, and that\u2019s what I crave right now, a long walk in wild countryside. And if I could choose one place, it would be Els Ports de Beseit.</p> <p>Els Ports is a range of limestone hills and canyons that straddles the border between Aragon and Catalonia. My favourite walk is El Parrizal de Beseit, a 20km round trip up the gorge carved out by the Matarranya River.</p> <p>There is a harsh, almost forbidding beauty about the place, like much of Aragon, a part of Spain I\u2019ve always been a bit in love with, where delightful villages appear in the midst of inhospitable landscape or on inaccessible mountain tops.</p> <p>The walk begins at the village of Beseit and follows the course of the Matarranya. It starts out flat but gradually you are funnelled upwards into the narrowing gorge, the river rushing and gurgling alongside the whole way. The sense of scale is so vast it feels like Colorado or Arizona.</p> <p>Wooden bridges cross the river, and in places there are walkways fixed to the side of the gorge. It\u2019s not a tough walk \u2013 I\u2019ve done it with children \u2013 but this is real wilderness; wander off and you might never find your way back. And it\u2019s tough enough to feel you deserve a plunge into the deep, green pool that awaits near the end of the journey.</p> <p>The water is always shockingly cold, even in August, but right now, mothballed at home and restless as a rattlesnake, I can think of nothing more satisfying than throwing myself into the cold, dark waters of the Matarranya.<br><strong>Stephen Burgen, Barcelona </strong><br></p> <h2><strong>Gori\u0161ka Brda, Slovenia</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"78ca25d4060ec767b6640cd156522e3d75424968\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78ca25d4060ec767b6640cd156522e3d75424968/0_3_5006_3003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Slovenia, Goriska Brda\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ia, Goriska Brda, views from near Medana</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dorling Kindersley/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a sun-soaked corner in the far west of Slovenia, where Hemingway set A Farewell to Arms<em> </em>and where the border was drawn with Italy after the first world war. Gori\u0161ka Brda is Slovenia\u2019s cradle of wine. It is actually a cluster of many tiny villages embowered by the Alps to the north and the Adriatic to the south, each photogenically situated upon soft-rolled hilltops and flysch soil, with a unique terroir that has been named one of the best in the world for white wine.</p> <p>I was there last summer to participate in a professional wine tasting. The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KruhInVino/posts/552145958539646\">Rebula Masterclass</a> is an annual event held at the elegant palace of Vila Vipol\u017ee, an elegant palace, that brings together nearly 100 of the world\u2019s leading wine professionals to sample an indigenous wine varietal of international renown. Rebula grapes (called ribolla gialla a few paces away in Italy) produce an umami, mineral white that has the complexity of a red.</p> <p>Or so I was told. I didn\u2019t really know what I was doing. I was the only novice at the masterclass, seated between the editor of a wine magazine and the oenologist of a Chilean winery. I wasn\u2019t even sure what the ominous-looking black buckets were for (spittoons). But the wines were wonderful. All 15 of them. Before lunch. My favourite was Rebula Journey from the <a href=\"https://www.medot-wines.com/\">Medot vineyard</a>, which is the family estate of Zvonimir Sim\u010di\u010d, a local and wine world legend.</p> <p>Sim\u010di\u010d set up <a href=\"https://klet-brda.si/en/\">Klet Brda</a> here, the largest winery in former Yugoslavia, which still produces millions of bottles a year. It is thanks to him that Gori\u0161ka Brda rose from an idyllic but impoverished region to international prominence for wine of the highest quality. It is where in-the-know locals and tourists come for lavish but low-key wine tastings, an ideal wine trail off the beaten track. In these quarantine days, I fondly remember that masterclass, the sun pouring through those buttery rebulas, and I look forward to revisiting Slovenia\u2019s land of the golden wine when circumstances allow.

This was followed two days later with a decision to close all stores other than chemists and food shops. We were told to stay at home as much as possible and to limit our use of public transport. All of which means that the 80 miles separating Brussels from Spa, in the French-speaking east of the country, now feels a very long way. Prosecco and strawberries at the <a href=\"https://www.thermesdespa.com/home/\">hilltop thermal baths</a>, always beautiful, now seems as distant a prospect as lobster in Manhattan\u2019s Grand Central Oyster Bar.

The mineral water baths are surrounded by spectacular countryside walks. <a href=\"http://www.latonnellerie.be/en/le_restaurant.htm\">La Tonnellerie</a>, right next to the funicular up the steep central hill, will give you a cosy room and excellent food. It\u2019s a sleepy provincial spot, with few if any big-name chain shops, where many restaurants close early in the evening.

Since then I\u2019ve mostly stayed home, missing the mountains where I\u2019ve had so many adventures in the seven years I\u2019ve lived here.</p> <p>Back in 2013, I\u2019d only recently moved to Switzerland and was desperate to explore. It was a beautiful August weekend, and a savvy Swiss friend had recommended a hike to a remote cabin in the Valais. Which is how my boyfriend and I came to be on a post bus winding its way up a narrow mountain road from Sion, blasting its tuneful horn \u2013 as singsong as the Swiss-German accent \u2013 while passing through tunnels carved out of the rock, a sheer drop-off to our left.</p> <p>The destination was well worth my nail biting: <a href=\"http://www.derborence.ch/\">Derborence lake</a>, a pristine pocket of still water reflecting lush woodland and high peaks. This was the starting point for a challenging hike of five hours \u2013 more, for us, due to my less than Swiss fitness level \u2013 through meadows strewn with wildflowers, a vast glacial valley, a boulder field and large patches of snow as we trekked ever higher. This being my first visit to a <a href=\"https://www.sac-cas.ch/en/\">Swiss Alpine Club</a> hut, I didn\u2019t know that reaching them usually means tackling a final, punishingly steep ascent just when you think the end\u2019s in sight. So it was with <a href=\"https://www.sac-cas.ch/en/huts-and-tours/sac-route-portal/2147000215/mountain_hiking/\">Cabane Rambert</a>, our home for the night, strategically placed at 2,580 metres for the best view of the Valais Alps, Mont Blanc and beyond.</p> <p>As though we\u2019d stumbled into a village restaurant, rather than a high-alpine cabin hours from civilisation, the place was packed. We chatted with other hikers over a three-course dinner, diced with death to use the toilet \u2013 a wooden shack positioned over a long drop \u2013 and endured the sub-zero night air to spot shooting stars from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2018/aug/14/the-perseid-meteor-shower-in-pictures\">Perseid</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2018/aug/14/the-perseid-meteor-shower-in-pictures\"> meteor shower</a>.</p> <p>When morning came, we lingered in bright sunshine above the clouds, watching ibex grazing nearby. I captured that moment on camera and in my mind \u2013 the perfect memory of what was the best introduction to the country that is now my home.<br><strong>Caroline Bishop, Zinal</strong></p> <h2><strong>Skyros</strong><strong>, Greece</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"98f0fe4efa77d63b3c89b3e6507ba3c1081d79c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98f0fe4efa77d63b3c89b3e6507ba3c1081d79c2/0_215_4920_2952/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chora, the main settlement and capital of the island of Skyros, in Sporades complex, central Aegean sea, Greece\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Schools in Athens closed on 11 March. Over the past two weeks, life has ground to a halt. Since Monday 23 March, we are on full lockdown.</p> <p>In a world that is irrevocably changed, we all long for the unchanged. The comfort of a familiar place steeped in memories. For me, that place is Skyros \u2014 an out-of-the-way Greek island where I have spent every long, hot summer since the age of five, when my parents bought a tiny stable in the hilltop village.</p> <p>From the vine-shaded hammock on our terrace, you can see a tumble of roofs and a haze of receding hills, a solitary chapel or cypress tree. Every so often, a jangling trail of sheep plods across the horizon. Stray cats curl up under the jasmine or stretch out on the low, whitewashed wall where we drink coffee, write postcards, sketch, or toast the sunset with Camparis.</p> <p>At night, we throw rag rugs over that wall and our friends perch with plates of baked chickpeas, garlicky red peppers, and crisp triangles of cheesy filo on their laps. Friends who come from Athens, Berkeley, Copenhagen, Basel, London, New York, Lugano, Toronto, and Paris to relive the same simple rituals year after year. A far-flung community that has grown up and grown old together. Every summer, there might be a new baby, grandchild, or boyfriend; a divorce; a death. But the presence of those who are gone is all around, etched into our collective memory like the whitewash that outlines the paving stones in the village lanes. And the delicate caper blossoms that emerge miraculously from dry stone walls remind us that life goes on.</p> <p>My apartment in Athens is not much bigger than our one-room home on Skyros. Our balcony barely has enough space for two folding chairs, and our limited view is of the interior lives of our neighbours. Like moths drawn to light, they too flit aimlessly on their ledges, staring at empty streets at once familiar and foreign. Trapped inside with a young child, I dream of a different view \u2013 of sunlight dancing on vines and a distant speck of sea.<br><strong>Rachel Howard, Athens</strong></p> <h2>Colorado Proven\u00e7al, Rustrel, France</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c9e505bb72f65a64777e9db8ce13e5ffb7f8307b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9e505bb72f65a64777e9db8ce13e5ffb7f8307b/0_170_5100_3061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colorado Provencal, rocks of ochre under a blue sky\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Since France went into lockdown at midday on 17 March, everyone in my family has been fighting to walk Rio.

We followed the Sahara pathway past soaring orange pinnacles, red pools beneath ruby and green cliff faces and <em>chemin\u00e9es des </em><em>f\u00e9es</em> (fairy chimneys, which are also known as hoodoos). It began raining, and all the different pigments ran down the earth, flooding into amber-coloured pools. The place is deceptively perilous; you have to stick to the paths or could easily plunge down a vermillion precipice or skid across an ivory and peach slope into a wilderness of broom bushes and pine trees.</p> <p>The surrounding villages have their food specialities: Banon has goat\u2019s milk cheese wrapped in chestnut leaves and spindly cured sausages called <em>brindilles</em>, which they sell in metre-long poster tubes; Saint-Saturnin-l\u00e8s-Apt is famous for its black cherries; Simiane-la-Rotonde for lavender cordial and chunky, mint-flavoured meringues. Apt is the world capital of crystallised fruit. The selection makes for a quirky picnic, but then Rustrel is the closest you can get to lunch on Mars.</p> <p>When the rain stopped, the turmeric-coloured powder turned to gold on my children\u2019s hands, and what had appeared brick-red from the roadside, left my cream chinos with a tie-dye of copper and bronze. Meanwhile, our white dog, Rio, who has spent most of his life being told to get off sofas, down from beds and out from behind cushions, leapt unscolded on to the back seat of the car shaking out his new coat of russet and purple and pink.<br><strong>Jon Bryant, Nice</strong></p> <h2>Serra da Estrela, Portugal</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9bed3cb5a863cd4a3d9126b62aed4fae81cedb35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bed3cb5a863cd4a3d9126b62aed4fae81cedb35/0_289_3662_2198/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A runner in the Serra da Estrela, Portugal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It has been nearly two weeks since we closed the door on the outside world and hunkered down at home. As a keen runner, the fact that Portugal\u2019s emergency measures permit \u2013 for now \u2013 a brief daily run is helping keep my spirits up. I\u2019ve been going out alone, running along the empty streets in our downtown neighbourhood in Porto.</p> <p>Grateful as I am, pad-padding along the tarmac is still not a patch on trail running. Boy, how I miss the feel of earth underfoot and big skies above. If I could transport myself anywhere right now, I\u2019d flee the city and make a beeline for the isolated delights of Serra da Estrela.</p> <p>Located bang in the centre of Portugal, this sprawling, mountainous natural park is home to frothing rivers and majestic waterfalls, berry-fattened boars and all-seeing eagles. I went for a two-day bimble this time last year with my friend Patrick. A local contact cobbled together a zigzagging 90km route for us, from Seia on the park\u2019s western edge to Covilh\u00e3 on the east.</p> <p>For 36 sweaty, muscle-aching, blissful hours, we barely saw a soul. Fifteen minutes out of Seia and we were deep in classic mountain country; narrow dirt tracks, perfume-packed pine woods, the rustling of animals in the undergrowth. The ever-shifting, always-sloping landscape kept our legs in motion and our mouths agape. From arboreal foothills, we climbed up to bare, boulder-strewn plateaux, before plunging back down to shaded valleys below.</p> <p>The highlight came on the morning of the second day, as we wove our way slowly up the glacial Z\u00eazere valley, before eventually joining a hairpin road for a final, lung-bursting assault on Torre, the highest point in mainland Portugal. The ache in my legs, the wind on my face, the world at our feet: would that I were there right now.<br><strong>Oliver Balch, Porto</strong></p> <h2>Nationalpark S\u00e4chsische Schweiz, Germany</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1a989b6158c442115e6a0748c8093cee5403f176\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a989b6158c442115e6a0748c8093cee5403f176/0_444_7360_4415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"View to the Bastei rock formation at sunrise. Bastei Area, Saxon Switzerland National Park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Since Germany imposed social restrictions a week or so ago \u2013 tightening them even more on the 23 March \u2013 my activities have been more or less limited to my apartment and the increasingly empty streets around me for shopping and running. Although we don\u2019t have a complete lockdown like those in Spain and Italy, it\u2019s difficult not to start dreaming about an escape.</p> <p>Germany offers plenty of possibilities for a daunting dash. From the Black Forest in the south to the Baltic Sea a couple of hours north of Berlin, there are a wealth of <em>\u201csch\u00f6ne ecken\u201d</em> (beautiful corners or spots), some obvious, some hidden. But if I had to choose right now, it would be a personal favourite: the <a href=\"https://www.saechsische-schweiz.de/en/region/national-park.html\">Nationalpark S\u00e4chsische Schweiz</a> (Saxon Switzerland national park), which is as famous for needing a few schnapps to pronounce it, as it is for its natural beauty.</p> <p>The park is located east of Dresden, right on the Czech border, and is contiguous with the <a href=\"https://www.czechtourism.com/c/bohemian-switzerland-national-park/\">Bohemian Switzerland </a><a href=\"https://www.czechtourism.com/c/bohemian-switzerland-national-park/\">national </a><a href=\"https://www.czechtourism.com/c/bohemian-switzerland-national-park/\">park</a> on the other side. Getting there by train, car or bike from Berlin \u2013 I\u2019ve done all three \u2013 involves meeting and following the Elbe to one of the entry points; the pretty towns of Pirna or Bad Schandau, for example. Watching the river calmly wind its way north always makes me slowly exhale.</p> <p>I usually walk a section or two of the park\u2019s Malerweg or \u201cpainter\u2019s trail\u201d, named after its origins as a destination for the many romantic artists \u2013 Caspar David Friedrich included \u2013 who sought inspiration here. It\u2019s easy to see why they did so. An amalgam of undulating sandstone peaks, lush forests and moss-covered ravines, parts of it are utterly spectacular, not least the famous Bastei Bridge, which looks out across the wide, dreamy expanses of the Elbe valley.</p> <p>It\u2019s usually packed with tourists here as it\u2019s accessible by bus, but the rest of the trail is usually not heavily trafficked at all, especially the further you push into the park. The eight Malerweg trail stages are 10-15km long, some pretty easy-going, others quite challenging, and all weaving between quaint villages that offer overnight stays and restaurants with traditional fare like schnitzel and <em>sp\u00e4tzle</em>. They all have something of interest, from Richard Wagner memorials, old castles and medieval fortifications, to caves, grottos and even health spas. It\u2019s really like entering another world.<br><em>\u2022 </em><em><a href=\"https://www.saechsische-schweiz.de/en/region/national-park.html\">saechsische-schweiz.de</a></em><br><strong>Paul Sullivan, Berlin</strong></p> <h2>N\u00e4set beach, Sweden</h2> <p>Sweden has taken a different tack from the rest of Europe, preferring to keep primary schools open and not declare a lockdown. But public gatherings of more than 50 people are banned, teaching in secondary schools and universities has moved online, and people are urged to work from home.

It is no exaggeration to say that we live for this moment. Suddenly the evenings seem endless, just like the possibilities of the summer ahead. Our hibernation is over. The daylight is like a drug.<br><br>For me, normality will return to Sweden only when I can grab a towel and a sandwich to go people-watching on the crowded <a href=\"https://www.goteborg.com/en/naset/\">beach at N\u00e4set</a>, on Gothenburg\u2019s south-west coast. Here on a summer\u2019s evening, diverse crowds of local people gather, jostling good-naturedly to find a patch of shade or sun. <br><br>The smell of barbecues mingles with smoke from shishas and cigarettes. Kids in burkinis play with kids in bikinis, grandmas are slicing watermelon, and everyone splashes about in the sparkling clear sea. Towards the evening, there is a shiver of anticipation as the boomboxes come out.<br><br>N\u00e4set beach sums up for me everything that is welcome in the new, multicultural Sweden, which tends to get a bad press.

  "<p>I say it a lot, but don\u2019t take my own advice enough. Experiencing nature is about slowing down \u2013 stopping, in fact. The stiller you stay, the more you see. Nature confides when you\u2019re not blundering through it. But that\u2019s only half the story. The rest is attention. It takes mental effort to stand, orient, step and not fall on your face. Backroom brainwork for sure, but it still absorbs neural capacity, and so the best way to see is to sit.</p> <p>The bench under the kitchen window is as good a place for this as I know. Three metres from the bird feeder, a bed of overgrown lavender and rosemary, a backdrop of grass too scruffy to be called a lawn and a wooded slope that limits the horizon to less than 100 metres. We\u2019re lucky, I know it. In this space, if need be, we can exercise the dog and ourselves. We can feel the sun, listen to the birds, sniff the wind without fearing what the air might contain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/29/how-to-make-the-most-of-the-spring-wildlife-carnival-on-your-doorstep\">How to make the most of the spring wildlife carnival on your doorstep</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I settle.

A wren peeks. Robin sings. Long-tailed, coal and willow tits return to the feeder and tree sparrows skirr past in a small, hectic squadron. A blue tit alights on the wall of the house and begins inspecting every cranny in the stonework, pausing every second to check its surroundings with eyes black and bright as thought itself.

Despite wings and swift feet, their lives will likely be lived wholly in the arena I can see now.

The other 30% had begun to decline as people stayed home and private hospitals responded to calls to save dwindling supplies of protective equipment for urgent cases.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re sort of between a rock and a hard place when our revenue has been cancelled on us without notice,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that the states and other providers and us will get an other arrangement in place promptly, but if this doesn\u2019t happen soon what we have seen [with staff being stood down] in the last few days will be a small impact compared with what we will see in the next week once elective surgery stops completely.\u201d</p> <p>Atkins\u2019s statement was supported in a joint statement by the Australian Private Hospitals Association, Catholic Health Australia and Day Hospitals Australia.</p> <p>The groups called on the states and territories to deal with concerns raised by the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, as part of a national coronavirus partnership on Wednesday, and guarantee the viability of the private sector in return for a guarantee all hospitals would be geared to treat the virus.</p> <p>Michael Roff, from the Australian Private Hospitals Association, said negotiations with states and territories had been fragmented. \u201cThe states don\u2019t seem to understand the urgency of reaching a deal this weekend. If they don\u2019t do that the beds they need in a few weeks\u2019 time may no longer be available,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Catholic Health Association\u2019s Pat Garcia said all hospitals should be using the time before the \u201cfull coronavirus onslaught\u201d to train existing clinical staff and hire additional staff. \u201cHospitals cannot simply close down entire wards and ICUs then turn them back on at the flick of a switch,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Hunt said the national cabinet, made up of the prime minister, state premiers and territory chief ministers, had committed on Friday to urgently finalising agreements with private hospitals to ensure they had \u201csufficient and viable\u201d capacity during the pandemic and once it was over.</p> <p>He said it was an \u201castonishing breach of faith\u201d that a private health provider would let nurses go at a critical time of need. \u201cI urge the state and territory governments to complete whole-of-sector agreements with the private hospital sector in the timeframes agreed at national cabinet,\u201d Hunt said.</p> <p>Brett Holmes, general secretary of the NSW Nurses and Midwives\u2019 Association, estimated more than 600 nurses across the state had been stood down since Thursday night and hundreds more could follow. He accused the federal government of bungling the announcement of the elective surgery ban.</p> <p>The government announced on Wednesday that all non-urgent surgery except for category 1 (operations classified as required within 30 days) and urgent category 2 (procedures required within 90 days) would be postponed from midnight that day.</p> <p>The start of the ban was later pushed to 1 April. Holmes said the biggest private operator, Ramsay Health Care, stopped non-urgent surgery on Friday.</p> <p>\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to have been a lot of forethought of the consequences of sending people on leave and laying them off and, when the shit has hit the fan in four weeks\u2019 time, relying on them coming back into what will be a pretty daunting situation,\u201d Holmes said.</p> <p>The Victorian health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said the state was working to secure an agreement. \u201cThe private healthcare sector in Victoria has, and will continue to be, an important and integral component of Victoria\u2019s healthcare system.\u201d she said.</p> <p>A NSW Health spokeswoman said it was talking to private hospital operators \u201cfocusing on how private hospitals can help support the health system with their facilities and workforce\u201d.</p>",

Trump tried to dissuade the Massie from holding up the vote.<br></p> \n  <p>In a series of tweets on Friday morning, he assailed Massie as a \u201cthird rate Grandstander\u201d and \u201ca disaster for America, and for the Great State of Kentucky!\u201d Trump also suggested Republicans should \u201cthrow Massie out\u201d of the party.</p> \n  <p>Massie\u2019s statement reads in full:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I swore an oath to uphold the constitution, and I take that oath seriously. In a few moments I will request a vote on the CARES Act which means members of Congress will vote on it by pushing \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d or \u201cpresent.\u201d</p> \n   <p>The Constitution requires that a quorum of members be present to conduct business in the House. Right now, millions of essential, working-class Americans are still required to go to work during this pandemic such as manufacturing line workers, healthcare professionals, pilots, grocery clerks, cooks/chefs, delivery drivers, auto mechanics, and janitors (to name just a few). Is it too much to ask that the House do its job, just like the Senate did?</p> \n   <p>I am not delaying the bill like Nancy Pelosi did last week. The bill that was worked on in the Senate late last week was much better before Speaker Pelosi showed up to destroy it and add days and days to the process.</p> \n   <p>This bill should have been voted on much sooner in both the Senate and House and it shouldn\u2019t be stuffed full of Nancy Pelosi\u2019s pork \u2013 including $25 million for the Kennedy Center, grants for the National Endowment for the Humanities and Arts, and millions more other measures that have no direct relation to the Coronavirus Pandemic. </p> \n   <p>That $25 million, for example, should go directly to purchasing test kits. The number one priority of this bill should have been to expand testing availability and creation of tests so that every American, not just the wealthy and privileged, have access to testing. We have shut down the world\u2019s economy without adequate data. Everyone, even those with no symptoms, needs immediate access to a test. This bill creates even more secrecy around a Federal Reserve that still refuses to be audited. It allows the Federal Reserve to make decisions about who gets what, how much money we\u2019ll print. With no transparency.</p> \n   <p>If getting us into $6 trillion more debt doesn\u2019t matter, then why are we not getting $350 trillion more in debt so that we can give a check of $1 million to every person in the country?</p> \n   <p>This stimulus should go straight to the people rather than being funneled through banks and corporations like this bill is doing. 2 trillion divided by 150 million workers is about $13,333.00 per person. That\u2019s much more than the $1,200 per person check authorized by this bill.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-27T16:09:23.450Z\">at 4.09pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7e212b8f081e5eda23815f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-27T15:52:50.041Z\">3.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump invokes Defense Production Act in urging GM to manufacture ventilators</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Donald Trump has invoked the Defense Production Act in a series of tweets urging General Motors to take the lead in manufacturing ventilators. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1243559373395410957\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!!

She added in a statement on Friday: \u201cMuch more must be done. The president must use the full powers of this law to address the dire, widespread shortage of materials required to fight this pandemic, including diagnostic test supplies, masks and other personal protective equipment.\u201d</p> \n<p>Critics say Trump ignored early warnings about the threat of the pandemic and had he acted sooner, mass production of ventilators would now be well under way. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/us/politics/coronavirus-ventilators.html\">The New York Times reported</a> estimates that if the White House had reacted to the shortage in February, the private sector might have had them ready in mid- to late April; instead it is now unlikely to be before June.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s call for the building of more ventilators comes one day after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/trump-ventilators-coronavirus-cuomo-new-york\">he expressed scepticism</a> about New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and medical experts\u2019 prediction that his state would need 30,000 to 40,000 ventilators when the coronavirus outbreak peaks there.</p> \n<p>On Friday Trump refused to back down on his comments, saying: \u201cI think their estimates are high. I hope they\u2019re high.\u201d</p> \n<p>He suggested the ventilators produced by GM and others would serve not only New York but other parts of the US was well as helping the UK, Italy, Germany and Spain. When he called Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, who has tested positive for the virus, Johnson immediately said, \u201cWe need ventilators,\u201d Trump recalled. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of our needs but we\u2019re also going to take care of other countries.\u201d</p> \n<p>During Friday\u2019s briefing, Trump also lashed out at state governors. \u201cAll I want them to do, very simple, I want them to be appreciative.

These cutting-edge vaccines don\u2019t use weakened forms of the germ to build our immunity, as all vaccines once did; rather, they contain short copies of parts of the germ\u2019s genetic code \u2013 its DNA or RNA \u2013 which can produce fragments of the germ within our bodies.</p> \n  <p>Thus, for the first time ever, scientists have been able to muster up vaccine prospects mere weeks into a new, fast-spreading disease. Right now, there are at least 43 Covid-19 vaccines <a href=\"https://milkeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/Covid19%20Tracker%20032020v3-posting.pdf\">in development</a> around the world \u2013 in Brisbane and Hong Kong, in the US and the UK, in the labs of universities and companies. Most of these are DNA or RNA vaccines. One vaccine, made in 63 days by an American biotech firm named Moderna, <a href=\"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/nih-clinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins\">moved into</a> human trials on 16 March, entering the bloodstream of the first of 45 healthy adult volunteers in Seattle. It was a \u201cworld indoor record\u201d, said Anthony Fauci, the doctor who heads the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \u201cNothing has ever gone that fast.\u201d</p> \n
