As the economy reopens and people return to work, person-to-person contact will increase and an already \u201cshocking number of infections and deaths among workers will rise,\u201d the union said.</p> <p>In its two-page ruling, the appeals court said OSHA is authorized to issue an emergency temporary standard, or ETS, if it determines that employees are exposed to grave danger from a new hazard in the workplace, and that an emergency rule is needed to protect them from that danger.</p> <p>The decision not to issue an ETS \u201cis entitled to considerable deference,\u2019\u2019 the court said.</p> <p>\u201cIn light of the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the regulatory tools that the OSHA has at its disposal to ensure that employers are maintaining hazard-free work environments, OSHA reasonably determined that an ETS is not necessary at this time,\u2019\u2019 the ruling said.</p> <p>The ruling was signed by Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson, Robert Wilkins and Neomi Rao. Henderson and Rao were appointed by Republican presidents and Wilkins by a Democrat.</p> <p>The Labor Department said in a statement Thursday that officials were pleased at the ruling, which backed its contention that existing rules and regulations are protecting Americas workers and that an emergency temporary standard is not needed.</p> <p>\u201cOSHA will continue to enforce the law and offer guidance to employers and employees to keep Americas workplaces safe, said the statement, issued by Loren Sweatt, a top Labor Department official who oversees OSHA, and Kate OScannlain, the department\u2019s top lawyer.</p> <p>OSHA\u2019s performance came under fire at a contentious House hearing last month, in which Democrats accused the agency of being largely invisible during the pandemic.</p> <p>Instead of an emergency standard, OSHA has relied on voluntary guidance that recommends companies erect physical barriers, enforce social distancing and install more hand-sanitizing stations, among other steps.</p> <p>But the guidance is not mandatory, and Covid-19 cases have spiked at meatpacking plants, prisons, nursing homes and other workplaces deemed essential during the pandemic.</p> <p>AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said he was disappointed that three federal judges \u201cdid not deem the lives of Americas workers worthy of holding an argument or issuing a full opinion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe post-it length response to the union\u2019s lawsuit acknowledges the unprecedented\u201d nature of the coronavirus pandemic, \u201cbut repeats the false claim by Big Business that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration already has done what is needed to protect workers,\u2019\u2019 Trumka said in a statement.</p> <p>More than two million Americans have been infected with Covid-19, and more than 110,000 have died, according a count compiled by Johns Hopkins University.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\"

Beijing-backed influence operation that deceptively spread messages favorable to the <strong>Chinese </strong>government, including about coronavirus.</p> <p>The company suspended a core network of 23,750 highly active accounts, as well as a larger network of about 150,000 \u201camplifier\u201d accounts used to boost the core accounts\u2019 content.</p> <p>Twitter, along with researchers who analyzed the accounts, said the network was largely an echo chamber of fake accounts without much further traction.</p> <p>The company also removed two smaller state-backed operations which it attributed to Russia and Turkey, both focused on domestic audiences.</p> <p>Twitter said the Chinese network had links to an earlier state-backed operation dismantled last year by Twitter, Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube that had been pushing misleading narratives about political dynamics in Hong Kong.</p> <p>The new operation likewise focused heavily on Hong Kong, but also promoted messages about the coronavirus pandemic, exiled Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui and Taiwan, the researchers said.</p> <p>Renee DiResta, at the Stanford Internet Observatory, said the network\u2019s coronavirus activity ramped up in late January, as the outbreak spread beyond China, and spiked in March.</p> <p>\u201cAccounts praised China\u2019s response to the virus, while also using the pandemic to antagonise the United States and Hong Kong activists\u201d, she said.</p> <p>Open-source researchers at Graphika and Bellingcat had earlier flagged the re-emergence of the so-called \u201cSpamouflage

legitimate non-governmental organizations and journalists.</p> <p>A Twitter spokeswoman on Thursday said the network it removed was not related to what the State Department had identified.<br></p>

Or do not socially distance themselves?\u201d Huffman asked during Senate testimony.</p> <p>\u201cCould that just be the explanation of why theres a higher incidence?</p> <p>Dawson, who is black, responded: \u201cThat is not the opinion of leading medical experts in this country.\u201d</p> <p>Dawson was among a number of people testifying in support for the resolution that would establish a variety of resources to address racism in the state.</p> <p>Shibani Chettri, an epidemiology PhD student and researcher at Ohio State University, also testified Tuesday as a proponent for the resolution and said witnessing Huffman\u2019s comments was egregious.</p> <p>\u201cThis really brings attention to how we need to do a better job of addressing pervasive racism in health care if a sitting senator and medical professional can ask these sort of patronizing and racist questions\u201d, Chettri said.</p> <p>In a statement, Huffman said he regretted how his question was perceived.</p> <p>\u201cI asked a question in an unintentionally awkward way that was perceived as hurtful and was exactly the opposite of what I meant,\u201d the senator said.</p> <p>\u201cI was trying to focus on why Covid-19 affects people of color at a higher rate since we really do not know all the reasons.\u201d <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ee29f888f08969537f780c9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T21:21:40.348Z\">10.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Friday\u2019s UK edition of The Guardian.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1271188324192063490\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">GUARDIAN: Tensions rise over race as more statues are targeted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TomorrowsPapersToday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TomorrowsPapersToday</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/dMT42IvxUU\">pic.twitter.com/dMT42IvxUU</a></p>&mdash; Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1271188324192063490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 11, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ee29e508f08969537f780c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T21:13:36.065Z\">10.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>UK </strong>has scrapped plans for full border checks with the EU on January 1st amid pressures caused by the pandemic, according to Friday\u2019s edition of the Financial Times.</p> <p>It reports that Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, has accepted that businesses cannot cope with problems caused by the outbreak and deal with post-Brexit disruption at the border and is considering a temporary light-touch system at ports.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1271184160531664903\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">FT UK: Post Brexit border controls to be limited after government U turn <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TomorrowsPapersToday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TomorrowsPapersToday</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/x5ZE2AOqeG\">pic.twitter.com/x5ZE2AOqeG</a></p>&mdash; Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1271184160531664903?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 11, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T21:14:26.793Z\">at 10.14pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ee29c368f08969537f780b3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/hannah-devlin\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T21:04:51.817Z\">10.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There was no \u201cpatient zero\u201d in the <strong>UK\u2019s Covid-19 epidemic</strong>, according to research showing that the infection was introduced on at least 1,300 occasions.</p> <p>The findings, from the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium, have prompted further criticism that opportunities to suppress the spread of infection in February and March were missed.</p> <p>The study by the consortium \u2013 which was set up to sequence the virus\u2019s genetic code \u2013 shows that introduction of the virus into the UK peaked in mid-March at a time when infection rates were surging in European countries, but before the government clamped down on non-essential travel.

He told the Fox Business Network: \u201cAt this point, we don\u2019t see an increase in new cases now, nearly two weeks on from when the first protests took effect. Many people at protests were wearing masks and engaging in some social distancing.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert on the White House task force Pence chairs, has expressed concern about the protests taking place during the pandemic. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/california-coronavirus-cases-spikes-latest\">nine California counties have reported a spike in new coronavirus cases or hospitalizations</a>. New diagnoses are up partly due to more available testing, but loosening of restrictions and flouting of public health rules are also factors. </p> <p>Here are the other key developments from the last few hours: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Mexico City will embark on a large-scale testing effort as the centrepiece of its plan to reopen its economy,</strong> its mayor, Claudia Sheinbaum, has said. The plan sees it diverge from the federal government\u2019s strategy, which has shunned widespread testing as a waste of resources. The goal will be performing about 100,000 tests per month by July and trying to detect and isolate new infections as quickly as possible, Sheinbaum said. The Associated Press reported that it would be paired with an intensive information campaign.</li> <li><strong>France saw a below-average increase in deaths.</strong> The death toll has risen by only 23 \u2013 well below the average daily increase of 53 seen over the last two weeks \u2013 to 29,319. That is the fifth-highest nominal total in the world.</li> <li><strong>Hollywood productions will be allowed to resume from Friday, local authorities said.</strong> While work could resume, cinemas must remain closed, California state officials said.</li> <li><strong>S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s most populous state, has reported a record number of deaths for the second day running</strong> \u2013 even as its metropolis allowed shops to reopen. The centre of the Brazilian epidemic has recorded 340 new deaths in the last 24 hours, raising the state\u2019s confirmed death toll to 9,862, a fourth of the country\u2019s total fatalities, the governor\u2019s office said.</li> <li><strong>The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, is to be questioned as part of an investigation driven into alleged errors made by authorities</strong>. Prosecutors in Bergamo, the Lombardy province worst-hit by the virus, will also question the health minister and the interior minister.</li> <li><strong>A US pharmaceutical company claimed a drug specifically designed to treat Covid-19 could be authorised for use as early as September.</strong> The chief scientist at Eli Lilly and Co told Reuters the feat could be achieved if all goes well with either of two antibody therapies it is testing.</li> <li><strong>Prince Joachim of Belgium has been fined \u20ac10,400 by authorities in Spain after going to a party in Cord</strong><strong>\u00f3</strong><strong>ba, </strong><strong>where he caught Covid-19</strong><strong>. </strong>Joachim flew from Brussels to Madrid, then travelled to Cord\u00f3ba to attend a party with 27 other guests on 26 May, at a time when gatherings were restricted to a maximum of 15 participants.<br></li> <li><strong>France is likely to suffer 800,000 job losses in coming months, the finance minister has warned</strong>, as the economy reels from the effects of lockdown. Bruno Le Maire told a finance committee in parliament: \u201cOur evaluation is that 800,000 jobs will be lost in the coming months, or 2.8% of total employment.\u201d</li> <li><strong>Moscow will report 57% more deaths for the month of May than in the three previous years</strong>, a leading Russian radio station has reported, indicating that the city\u2019s coronavirus death toll for the month may be at least two times higher than official tallies for the month.</li> <li><strong>The global economy will contract at least 6% this year</strong>, with the unprecedented loss of income and \u201cextraordinary uncertainty\u201d caused by measures to contain the coronavirus outbreak, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has said.</li> <li><strong>Airlines are set to lose $84bn (\u00a365.9bn) as a result of the coronavirus pandemic</strong>, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has forecast. With most of the world\u2019s airliners currently parked, IATA said revenue would likely halve, falling from $419bn from $838bn last year.</li> <li><strong>China was accused of running disinformation campaigns inside the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">European Union</a></strong>, as the bloc set out a plan to tackle a \u201chuge wave\u201d of false facts about the coronavirus.

  "<p>If Harold Varner spends Sunday evening in Texas posing with a trophy, we will have been supplied further evidence of sport\u2019s propensity to deliver moments that scriptwriters would reject as too fanciful. If golf is true to a rising commitment, Varner won\u2019t find himself in rare company for too much longer.</p> <p>Before the PGA Tour made this comeback following a 91-day absence, at the Charles Schwab Challenge, Varner was in recorded and meaningful conversation with Jay Monahan. The PGA Tour\u2019s commissioner has committed to \u201camplifying voices and efforts to end systemic issues of racial and social injustices\u201d following the horrific death of George Floyd. Varner is integral to the discussion as one of only three black American players who routinely feature on the PGA Tour. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/10/my-hero-was-tiger-woods-his-skin-colour-didnt-matter-rory-mcilroy\">'My hero was Tiger Woods': Rory McIlroy urges tolerance and education in golf</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The amiable 29-year-old, who once chased Tiger Woods for an autograph, has not yet won at this level; what a tale it would be if Varner further laughed in the face of prehistoric attitudes by prevailing at Colonial Country Club. So far, so good on that front. Varner\u2019s opening round of 63, seven under par, meant he joined Justin Rose atop the leaderboard. </p> <p>\u201cI just want to play well,\u201d said Varner. \u201cThe platform I have is through golf so I have to focus on that.\u201d In Varner\u2019s only other appearance at this tournament, he missed the cut. Eighteen greens in regulation, then, represented quite the turnaround. </p> <p>Monahan stood with head bowed on the 1st tee as the clock struck 8.46am. This pre-planned moment of reflection was introduced \u2013 and shall remain for the next three days \u2013 following events in Minneapolis. It will take more than golf to heal the gaping race relations wound in the United States but this sport \u2013 where white men dominate \u2013 appears to have discovered a new level of consciousness.</p> <p>By the time Rory McIlroy, Jon Rahm and Brooks Koepka led the afternoon wave of play, events inside the ropes at least appeared pretty standard. Outside came the marked change; there are no galleries.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/golf\">Golf</a> in this form is flat, of that there is no question. There are members of this 148-man field who would quietly disclose that events without spectators are fine by them \u2013 \u201cGet in the hole\u201d jars after the 30,000th scream \u2013 but the spectacle is diminished. Rare applause was left to volunteers or coaches and even they appeared bashful. Golfers, as with all sportspeople, are notoriously caught up in their own bubble but one imagines the novelty of a backdrop akin to a junior tournament will inevitably wear off.</p> <p>Not that Rose seems remotely bothered. The 39-year-old spent two weeks in quarantine before this tournament, after he arrived in the US from his home in the Bahamas. Whatever Rose did during that isolation worked; he was seven under before saving par from 92ft at the 4th, his 13th. Five subsequent pars carried him home with a blemish-free card.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93f2ab27d3ce49a1b8938a3aea11c6ddaaac627c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93f2ab27d3ce49a1b8938a3aea11c6ddaaac627c/0_187_3179_1907/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Rose\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Justin Rose said of golf\u2019s return: \u2018It felt great, but obviously the fans were missed.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Martinez/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs a professional, you love going up against great players,\u201d Rose explained. \u201cI was playing with Dustin Johnson and Bryson DeChambeau, I haven\u2019t had that competition at home to deal with, so that obviously makes it feel pretty real. You\u2019re back playing the PGA Tour when you tee it up with guys like that. So it felt great, but obviously the fans were missed.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps Rose also relished his chance to reset. Having reached the summit of the world rankings early in 2019, the Englishman has endured a curious slide. He entered this week at No 14. Rose has a curtailed season in which to continue a remarkable run; he has returned victory at least once in every year since a barren 2009. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/14/justin-rose-olympic-games-golf-gold-medal-great-britain-rio-2016\">Olympic gold</a> is included in that haul. </p> <p>McIlroy, the world No 1, is two under. Rahm is a shot worse off after bogeying the last while Koepka matched McIlroy\u2019s score. That trio will be hoping for Friday fireworks.</p> <p>There were other matters to trigger minor intrigue. Coaches were warned about \u201crepeatedly\u201d getting too close to their pupils in this age of social distancing. \u201cA rope line will be added to the range \u2013 8-10ft behind hitting bays \u2013 as an added safety measure,\u201d read a memo as the Tour looks to control renegade swing masters.</p> <p>The aforementioned Johnson has not been able to shake the habit of spitting, abhorrent enough before personal hygiene became such a matter of significance. If there is a golfing god, one day Johnson will gob all over himself.

Second place shouldn\u2019t be a pipe dream, not quite yet, though it\u2019s extremely unlikely that both of the leaders will slip up and gift Sevilla their first La Liga title since 1946. Closing in on Champions League football is the important thing, and they\u2019ve taken their first step tonight, throwing the gauntlet down at the feet of Real Sociedad, Getafe, Atletico Madrid and Valencia. Real Betis meanwhile remain in 12th, eight clear of relegation bother. Anyway, thanks for reading this MBM, and welcome back La Liga!

Can Espanyol save themselves from ignominious relegation? And who will grab the third and fourth Champions League spots? Only five points currently separate third and seventh: Sevilla, Real Sociedad, Getafe, Atletico Madrid and Valencia will scrap it out over the next five weeks.</p> <p><strong>Sevilla will be looking to consolidate their position at the head of that particular pack this evening.</strong> This fixture\u2019s recent history suggests they\u2019ll do just that; they\u2019ve won five of their last six against Betis at home. They also beat Betis 2-1 at their Estadio Benito Villamar\u00edn back in December. Julen Lopetegui\u2019s men will be favourites against a mid-table Betis side.</p> <p><strong>But Sevilla had won only twice in their last nine games in all competitions before the enforced break, so nothing is certain. </strong>True, that recent record isn\u2019t any worse than their rivals\u2019 pre-lockdown run of one victory in eight, but Betis\u2019s last game was a 2-1 win over mighty Real Madrid. A 5-3 win here two seasons ago will also give Betis succour. And it\u2019s a derby, so anything goes.</p> <p><strong>Betis also have very little riding on this game, local pride aside.</strong> Rubi\u2019s side won\u2019t qualify for Europe; neither will they go down. So perhaps they\u2019ll play with a little more freedom than the hosts, who desperately need all three points.

Price-wise, there have been rumours online of a \u00a3599 start point for PS5, which is <em>high </em>for a console<em>, </em>especially in these challenging times, but not totally unrealistic considering how favourably the tech specs compare with a mid-range PC.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ee286188f0839df653842a6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/keithstuart\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T19:29:33.440Z\">8.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The holding music playing on the PlayStation 5 stream is very Ministry of Sound chill-out room circa 1998.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T19:30:16.832Z\">at 8.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ee285a78f08969537f77fc2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/keza-macdonald\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T19:28:12.903Z\">8.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A bit of good news for those of us who have no chance whatsoever of conquering their PlayStation 4 pile of shame by the end of the year: the PS5 is going to be backwards-compatible with PS4 games (100 of them at first, more as time goes on).

The console will come with a built in 825GB solid state drive, which will allow extremely fast loading times, and it will support advanced visual effects such as real-time ray tracing.

  "<p>Sports stars including Dina Asher-Smith, Jesse Lingard, Maggie Alphonsi and David Beckham have put their names to a letter calling for greater diversity across the UK sports media, in response to the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <p>The letter has been sent to all leading broadcast and print outlets across the country, including the Guardian, by the Black Collective of Media in Sport (BComs), a non-profit organisation that for over a decade has been working towards increasing the historically low number of people from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds who work in the industry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/09/chris-hughton-looking-at-the-protests-wondering-if-it-will-change-things-yes\">Chris Hughton: 'If I\u2019m looking at the protests and wondering if it will change things, the answer is yes' | Jacob Steinberg</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is frustration within BComs at the lack of progress made on this issue and given the largely positive response to Black Lives Matter, it is felt from those involved that now is the time to make a concerted push towards securing genuine and long-standing change.</p> <p>A seven-point plan is presented in the letter, which has also been backed by , Yaya Tour\u00e9, Jermain Defoe, Denise Lewis and Christine Ohuruogu, and Guardian columnists Ugo Monye and Eni Aluko. A number of journalists not involved with BComs have also signed up, including the BBC presenter Gabby Logan and TalkSport host Laura Woods.</p> <p>\u201cThese last few weeks have brought an exhausting and overwhelming sense of frustration, grief and sadness, following the violent deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Aubrey. Although these incidents occurred in the USA, the systemic racism that enables tragedies like this to occur also exists in the UK,\u201d reads the letter.</p> <p>\u201cThe role of the sports media is highly influential in shaping our views, and a sports media that lacks diversity is not fit for purpose. We believe now is the time to hold the industry to account to ensure that the sector is truly inclusive from top to bottom.\u201d</p> <p>Included in the seven-point plan is a call for all media outlets to establish external task forces dedicated to \u201creviewing, monitoring and challenging\u201d their diversity aims, run compulsory unconscious and conscious bias training programmes for senior management using black facilitators, and ensure all BAME staff, including long-standing freelancers, are able to develop and enhance their career at their respective workplaces. </p> <p>The numbers around the lack of diversity in the UK sports media are stark, as seen in BComs\u2019 most up-to-date statistics, which are based on journalists who covered major sporting events in 2018, namely the World Cup, Winter Olympics and Paralympics, Wimbledon, the Commonwealth Games and the inaugural multi-sport European Championships, for the major national newspaper titles and broadcasting networks. Of the 338 who did, only 32 (9.4%) came from a BAME background. Of those 32, only five did not have an association with professional sport, while no BAME women filled any of the 109 newspaper roles and only one black writer, of either gender, attended the World Cup.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/20/leon-mann-we-need-people-in-power-to-show-they-care-about-diversity\">Leon Mann: \u2018We need people in power to show they care about diversity\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is a general acceptance within the industry that things need to change but that has been the case for some time yet little progress is ever made. That was even the case after Raheem Sterling made this a live issue in December 2018 after posting a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sterling7/p/BrKYvF3gH9e/\">message on Instagram</a> in which the Manchester City and England winger accused certain publications of helping to \u201cfuel racism\u201d in this country.</p> <p>\u201cWe at BComs have been actively beating the drum about the greater need for diversity in the sports media for more than 10 years. It is wholly unacceptable that we have been having these conversations with you all, and your predecessors, with little to no change in some cases,\u201d continues BComs\u2019 letter. \u201cMany of you have shown solidarity and support to the Black Lives Matter movement and we see this as a junction which could change the course of the industry. We hope you do too.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Guardian News &amp; Media said: \u201cWe welcome the&nbsp;call from BComs for more rapid change and better diversity across sports media, and would like to meet with BComs to discuss these plans in detail.</p> <p>\u201cLast year GNM published our first report on pay and ethnicity - which showed that while we have made some progress, we also have much to do.&nbsp;We have set goals to improve representation at all levels and in all departments, and to reduce our pay gap over the long term. It is essential that our employees, just like our journalism, reflect the audiences and communities we serve.&nbsp;We will look at any suggestions from BComs and others on how the Guardian can contribute to positive change across the news industry.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Commonwealth Games authorities have promised not to ban or punish any athlete at Birmingham 2022 who takes a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <p>That decision, which has been revealed by the Commonwealth Games Federation chief executive, David Grevemberg, is in direct contrast to the International Olympic Committee, which has warned athletes they will be thrown out if they protest on the field of play or the podium during the Tokyo Games.</p> <p>Grevemberg said it is especially vital athletes are given a platform in such turbulent times. \u201cPeople say are we opening Pandora\u2019s box but no, we are respecting people\u2019s rights to voice opinions,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/24/birmingham-commonwealth-games-2022-shooting-and-archery-to-take-place-six-months-early-in-india\">Birmingham 2022 shooting and archery to take place six months early in India</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe Black Lives movement is challenging all institutions to really look introspectively at what we can do to be more fair, more free, have better equality and have better systems of justice that look after people. Sport is no different.</p> <p>\u201cWe are comfortable with the uncomfortable conversation and we need to embrace it. We maybe have more responsibility because of the shared history of the Commonwealth so we need to find solutions that don\u2019t build walls but rather build bridges.\u201d</p> <p>Grevemberg said the Commonwealth Games Federation had been working on many of the problems raised by Black Lives Matter since 2015 as part of its Transformation 2022 project. He also pointed out that athlete activism had long been part of the Games.</p> <p>\u201cYou go back to Cathy Freeman,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason her moment was so powerful at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 was because of what she did at the Commonwealth Games in Victoria in 1994 when she wrapped herself in the Aboriginal flag after the 200 and 400 metres. That had a profound impact.\u201d</p> <p>Grevemberg also confirmed the start of the 2022 Commonwealth Games has been pushed back 24 hours to 28 July to help athletes recover from the rearranged world championships in Eugene that month.</p> <p>The athletics programme will also be held later in the competition and run over five days and not seven in an effort to persuade Dina Asher-Smith and Katarina Johnson-Thompson to try to win gold medals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/21/birmingham-named-2022-commonwealth-games-host-city\" title=\"\">in Birmingham</a> as well as Eugene and at the European championships in Munich during that summer.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a challenge and athletes like a challenge,\u201d Grevemberg said. \u201cYou could almost create it as a grand slam in terms of hitting all three golds in particular events in three major championships. I think it\u2019s a wonderful challenge \u2013 to do the unprecedented.\u201d</p>",
  "<h2><strong>What have the clubs agreed upon?</strong></h2> <p>The 20 clubs unanimously approved the matchday protocols on player health and safety on Thursday, meaning the final phase of Project Restart has been passed and next week\u2019s fixtures are free to go ahead.</p> <h2><strong>How will we know it is safe to play on the day?</strong></h2> <p>Each player, coach and member of essential staff \u2013 such as medical personnel \u2013 will fill out a screening questionnaire and undergo a temperature check when they arrive at the stadium. They will also present a \u201cclinical passport\u201d. That will take the form of a barcode, probably on their phone but possibly on paper, that is scanned to ascertain their Covid-19 status. If they have tested negative for Covid-19 in the previous five days, they will be allowed to enter. Around 300 people will be inside a stadium at each game; all will have their temperatures checked but only those who require entry to the \u201cred zone\u201d \u2013 the pitch, dressing rooms, tunnel and technical areas \u2013 will need to show their Covid-19 status.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/11/premier-league-shirts-to-show-support-for-black-lives-matter-and-nhs-minute-silence-coronavirus\">Premier League player names to be replaced on shirts by Black Lives Matter</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Will they still use the changing rooms and other facilities?</strong></h2> <p>They will enter a pared-back environment, with the priority being that two-metre physical distancing and good hygiene are enforceable. Work is under way to reconfigure venues where necessary. Changing rooms will be used where possible but it is likely that, particularly in smaller grounds, bigger rooms such as hospitality suites may have to be adapted. Teams are not allowed to enter the pitch side-by-side and may come on via different entrances.</p> <h2><strong>How will</strong><strong> good</strong><strong> hygiene be maintained?</strong></h2> <p>Handshaking will be banned, with spitting and the clearing of nostrils also prohibited. Players will use their own drinks bottles during water breaks, allowed midway through each half, and will be required to use hand sanitiser when they enter and leave the pitch. Technical areas will be increased in size to reflect the increased number of substitutes and the distance required between them. Post-match showers will be allowed at a physical distance. Medical staff will wear PPE \u2013 although not full emergency PPE \u2013 when treating players on the pitch or in the changing room.</p> <h2><strong>Will players be punished for violating any of these stipulations?</strong></h2> <p>Not officially. The league expects players to be accustomed to the behavioural changes. If players forget them and, for example, shake hands or spit, they will be reminded after the game. There is nothing in the laws of the game to accommodate a specific sanction.</p> <h2><strong>Will substitutes wear face masks?</strong></h2> <p>Players may wear masks through choice but they are not compulsory. They will not be required to wear them on the bench or when arriving at games, as has occurred in the Bundesliga.</p> <h2><strong>Will managers carry out</strong><strong> post-match</strong><strong> interviews?</strong></h2> <p>Yes. Broadcast media duties may be conducted outdoors, around the perimeter of the pitch and at a safe distance, after the game. Press conferences may be held via Zoom for the 25 written media likely to be in attendance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/11/tottenham-dele-alli-banned-for-one-game-over-coronavirus-video-fa-manchester-united\">Dele Alli laments 'betrayal' after one-game ban for coronavirus video</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>How will players physically distance on the team bus?</strong></h2> <p>Many clubs will use two coaches and their providers have taken steps to reconfigure them, such as placing seats back to back. Coach drivers are included in the Covid-19 testing programme. The league is encouraging teams to fly on longer-haul trips. Some clubs are chartering larger planes than normal to accommodate physical distancing. The league has been impressed by some of the imaginative solutions clubs have used to ensure they can safely get from A to B.</p> <h2><strong>Will teams stay in hotels</strong><strong> before matches</strong><strong>?</strong></h2> <p>The Premier League is asking them to avoid this but accepts that government guidelines allow an exemption for athletes to use hotels and that for some clubs \u2013 such as Norwich \u2013 there are distance issues that necessitate overnight stays.</p> <h2><strong>What if a player falls ill at a stadium?</strong></h2> <p>This situation is not anticipated but they would be sent home and told to self-isolate. The match may still go ahead but it would depend on the situation. If a player felt unwell during the trip to a match, arrangements would be made for them to return home.</p>",
  "<p>An episode of Fawlty Towers famous for coining the phrase \u201cDon\u2019t mention the war!\u201d has become the latest classic British TV programme to be taken down from a BBC-owned streaming service, as broadcasters continue to conduct a reappraisal of old content.</p> <p>The episode of the 1970s sitcom \u2013 in which John Cleese as Basil Fawlty goose-steps around a Torquay hotel while shouting the phrase \u2013 was recently removed from the BBC-controlled UKTV catch-up service.</p> <p>A spokesperson for UKTV initially refused to clarify why the programme had been removed or whether the decision was permanent: \u201cWe aren\u2019t commenting on individual titles.

When the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies discussed contact tracing in early May, according to <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/888807/S0402_Thirty-second_SAGE_meeting_on_Covid-19_.pdf\">the minutes (pdf)</a> \u201cit agreed that at least 80% of contacts of an index case would need to be contacted for a system to be effective.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But these figures don\u2019t tell the story. There are at least four potential drawbacks.</p> \n  <p><em><strong>1 - Positive cases never referred to the service</strong></em></p> \n  <p>The <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/891703/NHS_test_and_trace_bulletin__England__-_28_May_to_3_June_2020.pdf\">statistical bulletin (pdf)</a> from the Department of Health and Social Care says 8,117 people who tested positive between 28 May and 3 June were referred to the test and trace service for England. But these were probably only a small proportion of the new cases that week. According to <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/5june2020\">an ONS survey</a>, there were an estimated 39,000 new cases in England every week during May. Towards the end of the month the infection rate was falling, but these figures suggest thousands of cases are being missed by test and trace, largely because people are getting infected but not getting a test.</p> \n  <p><strong><em>2 - People who don\u2019t cooperate</em></strong></p> \n  <p>In his video message (in which he also says the system will get better over time), Hancock says that 85% \u201cof all those who needed to be contacted\u201d were contacted. That\u2019s misleading. Some 85% of the contacts who were actually identified - ie, people named as having been in close contact with someone who tested positive - were reached by the service and told to self-isolate.</p> \n  <p>But only 67% of those who tested positive and whose names were passed on to the service provided names of their contacts. For the 33% who did not provide any names, for obvious reasons 0% of their contacts were contacted.</p> \n  <p>If 5,407 people testing positive provided the names of 31,794 contacts, then on average each Covid-positive person had 5.88 contacts who might be at risk. That means if there were 8,117 people testing positive being referred to the service, there were around 47,700 people in total who needed to be reached and told to self-isolate. In the event 31,794 people were contacted - a \u2018success rate\u2019 of 67%.</p> \n  <p>Arguably that\u2019s still quite reasonable for the first week, but it is well short of Sage\u2019s target of 80%.</p> \n  <p><strong><em>3 - People who don\u2019t cooperate on time</em></strong></p> \n  <p>The figure quoted above is based on the 67% of Covid-positive people referred to the service who did provide details of their contacts. But, as the statistical bulletin shows, only 79% of people provided details of their contacts within 24 hours. <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong>, the chair of the Commons health committee, says that if you ignore the other 25% who took longer, you get a different success rate.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Jeremy_Hunt/status/1271060790599200768\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">On the face of it these are encouraging no.s.

But, in <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/06/why-i-broke-boris-johnson\">an article for the New Statesman</a>, he says he has lost faith in the prime minister because he now thinks the PM has given up listening to a wide range of voices and is now intolerant of criticism. Here\u2019s an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It took six years for Margaret Thatcher\u2019s governments to begin to stop listening to alternative voices. The same patterns had emerged within six months of Johnson becoming prime minister, and within six weeks of his general election victory last December. In her early years the Iron Lady relished argument and intellectual debate \u2013 and those internal jousts strengthened her for the public battles with her true opponents. In the starkest of contrasts, the team inside today\u2019s No 10 has often preferred to greet internal dissent with retribution \u2013 much of it pre-briefed to favoured journalists. Throughout the Westminster village every Tory had quickly learned the score: do, say and tweet as you are told \u2013 or else. In February\u2019s reshuffle we learned that earning the disfavour of key prime ministerial adviser Dominic Cummings was fatal, even if you were chancellor of the Exchequer. Everyone was dispensable. Except Dom.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In an interview on the World at One, Montgomerie, who is particularly close to Sajid Javid, the former chancellor who was effectively sacked because he would not let No 10 choose his advisers, said he was especially worried about the influence of Cummings, Johnson\u2019s chief adviser.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What I worry about is that [Cummings] is a brilliant figure, but half of his ideas are crazy, and half of his ideas are good. He shouldn\u2019t be in a leadership position, he shouldn\u2019t be in a dominant position. And I\u2019m afraid that is what has happened inside Downing Street ... The Vote Leave operation that Dominic Cummings ran during the EU referendum has essentially been transplanted into Downing Street, and there is a lack of diversity in thought and personnel as a result.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6de455cf94a9cdd3a43f6c0b88820254b2b7a3fe\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6de455cf94a9cdd3a43f6c0b88820254b2b7a3fe/165_186_1723_1033/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Montgomerie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Montgomerie.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Meddle/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T13:26:52.470Z\">at 2.26pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2277e8f089c0fbf3588f1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jamie-grierson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T12:47:57.456Z\">1.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Probation services in England and Wales to be brought back into public ownership</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Probation services in England and Wales will be fully restored to public ownership and control, the justice secretary has announced, marking the final nail in the coffin of Chris Grayling\u2019s disastrous privatisation reforms.</p> \n  <p>Under Grayling\u2019s widely derided shake-up in 2014, the probation sector was separated into a public sector organisation, the National Probation Service (NPS) managing high-risk criminals and 21 private companies responsible for the supervision of 150,000 low- to medium-risk offenders.</p> \n  <p>The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) previously announced that all offender management, around 80% of all probation work, would be brought under the state-run National Probation Service (NPS).</p> \n  <p>The remaining services, such as rehabilitation and the provision of unpaid work, will no longer be offered up for private tender, the justice secretary said, marking the complete return of probation services to the public sector.</p> \n  <p>Around 2,000 workers at the private providers, known as community rehabilitation companies (CRCs), are to be brought over to HM Prison and Probation Service.</p> \n  <p><strong>Robert Buckland</strong> told the Commons: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The delivery of unpaid work, behavioural change programmes will be brought under control of the NPS alongside offender supervision when current CRC contracts end in June next year.</p> \n   <p>This will give us a critical measure of control, resilience and flexibility with these services which we would not have had were they delivered under 12 contracts with an umber of organisations.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T13:49:06.816Z\">at 2.49pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2108c8f0880e1bd40304d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T12:41:47.375Z\">1.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Much of the Downing Street lobby briefing was taken up with a discussion of the test and trace figures.

The SNP has actively been exploring the idea - <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong>, Scotland\u2019s first minister recently described it as <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/universal-basic-income-ubi-scotland-uk-nicola-sturgeon-coronavirus-a9498076.html\">an idea whose time has come </a>- and the Scottish government had funded a modest pilot to examine the feasibility of the idea.</p> \n  <p>Its <a href=\"https://basicincome.scot/2020/06/10/draft-final-report-cbi-feasibility-study/\">final report</a> is now out. And the Scottish government has concluded that, although the idea is \u201cdesirable\u201d, it would be impossible to introduce one without the support of the UK government because of the way so much welfare and tax policy is still decided in London.</p> \n  <p><strong>Aileen Campbell,</strong> the Scottish government\u2019s communities secretary, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic has exposed the shortcomings of the UK social security system and strengthened calls to further explore how a universal basic income could provide support to people and reduce poverty. We now have the perfect opportunity to take that forward.</p> \n   <p>The Scottish government agree with the report\u2019s conclusion that while introducing a basic income pilot is desirable, it can only be done with the full cooperation and collaboration of all relevant parties, particularly the UK government. That is why I have written to UK ministers urging them to engage constructively with us on this matter and discuss next steps towards a universal basic income pilot.</p> \n   <p>This is now the time to seriously consider a basic income pilot as part of a UK-wide Covid-19 programme of support to ensure a strong and fair economic and social recovery.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The SNP\u2019s appeal to the UK government for help implementing a universal basic income is almost certainly doomed to failure. <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong>, the chancellor, has repeatedly said he is not in favour (eg<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-uk-live-news-lockdown-extended-peak-dominic-raab-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e95e8d48f082c29014b0d46#block-5e95e8d48f082c29014b0d46\"> here</a>).</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T11:16:41.317Z\">at 12.16pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee20e848f089c0fbf358766\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/richardadams\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T11:03:30.356Z\">12.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>After Boris Johnson yesterday said that all pupils would return to school in <strong>England</strong> after the summer holidays, one of the UK\u2019s main teachers\u2019 unions has issued what it calls a \u201cnational education recovery plan\u201d.<br><br>The prime minister said that Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, will next week issue details of what he called \u201ca huge amount of catch-up for pupils over the summer months\u201d.

The NEUs 10-point plan addresses significant issues that have to be considered.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The truth is that we has actually peaked in infection rates before we went into lockdown, and that was therefore coming already down.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And he went on to allege that Ferguson and his epidemiological modelling was discredited. Duncan Smith said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think this piece of information comes from the man who ran the Imperial College model which has been now roundly trashed by almost every single scientist, particularly in Oxford and Edinburgh.

  "<p>The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has urged China to step back from the brink by abandoning plans to impose new security laws on Hong Kong, as he accused Beijing of treating a member of Foreign Office staff in a way \u201camounting to torture\u201d.</p> <p>Raab attacked the Chinese government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/former-uk-official-simon-cheng-in-hong-kong-tortured-in-15-day-china-ordeal\">brutal </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/former-uk-official-simon-cheng-in-hong-kong-tortured-in-15-day-china-ordeal\">treatment of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/former-uk-official-simon-cheng-in-hong-kong-tortured-in-15-day-china-ordeal\">Simon Cheng</a>, a former employee of the British consulate in Hong Kong, who was kept in custody for 15 days after travelling to the mainland.</p> <p>Defending the UK\u2019s right to comment on Hong Kong by noting other countries have a right to hold Beijing to account if it does not uphold international treaties, Raab added: \u201cChina has not provided an adequate response on its undertaking to investigate Cheng\u2019s mistreatment.\u201d</p> <p>Urging the Chinese government not to interfere in elections for a new Hong Kong legislature due to be held in September, he said Beijing should stop using its economic power to try to influence business in the territory. Late last week HSBC bank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/10/mike-pompeo-criticises-hsbc-for-corporate-kowtow-to-china-hong-kong\">announced its support of the new security laws</a>, an act described as \u201ccraven\u201d by the former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind.</p> <p>The warnings come in the latest six monthly report on Hong Kong submitted by Raab to the UK parliament. In some of the strongest language ever seen in the oftentimes bland reports, Raab warns the plans to impose new security laws bypassing the Hong Kong legislature are in direct conflict with international law.</p> <p>The Foreign Office is trying to build a diplomatic alliance against the security measures in an attempt to convince China that the reputational and economic price for going ahead with the new security laws is too high.</p> <p>Raab argues the way out of the impasse is for both sides to invest in dialogue and reconciliation, underpinned by a robust, independent inquiry into police repression of the protests.</p> <p>The six monthly report covers the period July to December 2019, encompassing some of the most violent of the wave of mass protests sparked by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/hong-kong-lam-to-withdraw-extradition-bill-say-reports\">a currently shelved extradition bill</a>.</p> <p>Raab directly warns China not to interfere in the Hong Kong legislature elections due to take place in September saying \u201cthey must be free, fair and without violence or intimidation\u201d. There is a concern that China will cancel the ballot fearing the pro-democracy movement will do too well. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/25/a-tsunami-of-public-opinion-unexpected-winner-hails-hong-kong-voters\">District elections in November</a> saw a record turn-out and 57% of the vote going to pro-democracy candidates, a result described in the Foreign Office as a landslide.</p> <p>Raab says although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/china-vote-npc-national-security-laws-hong-kong-us-protest\">the planned emergency security legislation </a>has yet to be published, the outline \u201craises the prospect of prosecution in Hong Kong for political crimes, which would undermine existing commitments to protect the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong\u201d.</p> <p>He adds: \u201cSuch legislation would be a clear violation of China\u2019s international obligations, including those made under the Sino-British Joint Declaration. The proposals also include provision for the authorities in Hong Kong to report back to Beijing on progress in pursuing national security education of its people, which is a sobering prospect.\u201d</p> <p>He also reiterates the promise that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/uk-will-extend-visas-for-300000-hong-kong-residents-says-raab\">British National Overseas passport holders will be entitled to a 12 months extendable visa opening a path to citizenship</a>.</p> <p>However, this offer is coming under increasing scrutiny from Hong Kong campaigners who are demanding to see the small print in order to assess its true value.</p> <p>Rifkind, speaking this week to the Henry Jackson Society, said: \u201cChina does have an Achilles heel when it comes to Hong Kong. If China pushes too far with what they are seeking to do, they will not absorb a prosperous significant financially important Hong Kong into the body of China. They will be left with a hollow shell.</p> <p>\u201cIf it ceases to be an enclave of freedom, many young Hongkongers, the brightest people in the world, will not live under Chinese totalitarian control, but leave \u2013 some to Britain and some to other countries. It will be a tragedy and to its permanent shame of having destroyed the freedoms of Hong Kong.\u201d&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>Only a fifth of UK universities have committed to reforming their curriculum to confront the harmful legacy of colonialism, an investigation by the Guardian has found.</p> <p>The disclosure comes as universities are under pressure to modernise their syllabuses to address the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/mar/29/english-universities-show-gaps-in-black-students-attainment-data-reveals\">attainment gap between white students and those from black and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds</a>.</p> <p>The campaign to give a fuller version of British history that reflects injustices and lauds the contributions of black British people has also won widespread support from the&nbsp;Black Lives Matter protesters.</p> <p>Academics and students said the Guardian\u2019s findings reflected a reluctance in British higher education towards addressing the impact of colonialism on present day racism.</p> <p>They said many universities apparently failed to grasp that \u201cdecolonising the curriculum\u201d went beyond adding black and non-western scholars to reading lists, arguing that reform should involve challenging and remaking the current pedagogy, which was rooted in imperial and colonial ideas about knowledge and learning, at an institutional level.</p> <p>Responses to freedom of information (FoI) requests from 128 universities found only 24 said they were committed to decolonising the curriculum. Of those, 11 were committed to reform across the whole institution, with most efforts confined to a few departments, or just one, or a handful of academics and students.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2020-06-11T12:56:53/embed.html\" data-alt=\"decolonise\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2020-06-11T12:56:53/embed.html\">decolonise</a> </figure>  <p>Queen Mary\u2019s University of London, said decolonising was confined to the school of English and Drama, while Newman University said one course in the English department explicitly referenced decolonising the curriculum.</p> <p>The University of East London reported it had run decolonising workshops in the school of art and digital industries. </p> <p>Only nine of these universities had put their commitment to decolonise in writing, with just two, including Bristol University, mentioning it in their core strategic plan and another two noting it in their main curriculum framework.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2020-06-11T12:58:56/embed.html\" data-alt=\"decolonise\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2020-06-11T12:58:56/embed.html\">decolonise</a> </figure>  <p>Educational experts said the findings showed that little progress had been made in decolonising higher education since the Rhodes Must Fall campaign \u2013 to demand the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/protesters-rally-in-oxford-for-removal-of-cecil-rhodes-statue\">removal of a statue of the Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes from Oxford University\u2019s Oriel college</a> \u2013 began in 2015.</p> <p>Fope Olaleye, black students\u2019 officer at the National Union of Students, said the lack of progress was \u201cshocking\u201d. \u201cDecolonising the curriculum means providing an accurate portrayal of history and providing students and staff with the tools to critically identify [how] the university reproduces colonial hierarchies. This will empower them to confront and reject the status quo and ensure knowledge production reflects our diverse society.\u201d</p> <p>Prof&nbsp;Kalwant&nbsp;Bhopal, the director of the centre for research in race and education at Birmingham University, said the sector should be ashamed of the findings. She added: \u201cEvery university should have this as a priority. If it\u2019s not in the strategic plan, it\u2019s not considered important to the university.\u201d</p> <p>Sunny Singh, professor of creative writing and inclusion in the arts at London Metropolitan University, one of the universities committed to decolonising, said: \u201cDespite the small pockets of resistance, as a sector, higher education in the UK is unconcerned or not bothered, if not actively hostile, to the idea of decolonisation.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very glad I work in a university that has for the last year and a half been happier and more supportive of my efforts. But I can also say that we\u2019re an exception.\u201d</p> <p>A further 84 universities said they were committed to other kinds of curriculum reform \u2013 making the syllabus more diverse, more international or more inclusive. </p> <p>Of the 106 universities committed to decolonising and other forms of curriculum reform, only 35 said BAME students were formally engaged in some way in this work, although the degree to which varied widely.</p> <p>Race equality specialist Sofia Akel, who last year wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/10/goldsmiths-university-to-tackle-racism-after-damning-report\">a report on racism at Goldsmiths, University of London</a>, raised concern that universities were often leaving such curriculum reform to BAME students.</p> <p>\u201cSome universities are saying they\u2019re doing work, but what they really mean is the students are doing the work for them for free,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd often they\u2019re met with hostility from senior members of staff.\u201d</p> <p>Only 36 universities said they were providing relevant staff training on designing and teaching more inclusive and diverse courses \u2013 with just nine of those providing dedicated training, and three institutions making this training mandatory.</p> <p>Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour\u2019s shadow education secretary, said: \u201cBlack and Asian people and their history are hugely underrepresented in academia and throughout our education system.&nbsp;Understanding the breadth of Britain\u2019s history is crucial to tackling the injustices and racism in our society and around the world that persist today.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty universities declared that they were currently doing no formal work to reform their syllabuses in this manner. </p> <p>Akel said: \u201cI think the universities that have just outright said no were probably the ones being the most honest because when you really drill down, it can come down to one or two academics, or a humanities subject, usually sociology, maybe anthropology.\u201d</p> <p>Some universities that said they were making their curriculum more international based this on having an overseas campuses. Heriot-Watt&nbsp;University said students on its campuses in Dubai and Malaysia were taught the same programmes as those in the UK. A spokesman added: \u201cThis means we are more attuned to the different cultures and cultural assumptions in the programmes we teach.\u201d</p> <p>Heidi Mirza, visiting professor of race, faith and culture at Goldsmiths, said the findings showed \u201ca poverty of understanding\u201d of what decolonisation entailed: \u201cWe\u2019ve still got archaic, anachronistic tutors and curricula that\u2019s never changed. I\u2019m shocked at how stark this is.\u201d</p> <p>Mirza said other approaches, such as internationalising or diversifying the syllabus, often were a watered down approach to reform. \u201cYou can have an overseas campus but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re changing your curriculum,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you including Chinese philosophy or just a white western knowledge you\u2019re imparting in an imperialist way. It\u2019s a tourist approach to the curriculum.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian asked students involved in campaigns to decolonise the curriculum on their first thoughts to these figures.</p> <p><strong>Sabrina, 21, studying international relations, Decolonise S</strong><strong>oas</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It doesn\u2019t surprise me. It\u2019s not in the universities\u2019 interest and nationally people don\u2019t want to see this kind of discussion take place because it requires us to revisit the UK\u2019s relationship with empire and have an honest conversation about race construction and racism which is very different than what we are told and taught. The British empire and European imperialism was founded on a white supremacist ideology which exploited the bodies and labour of Black and brown people in the colonies.</p> <p>Decolonising is about de-centring Eurocentric knowledge production. It\u2019s acknowledgement of alternative forms and centres of knowledge and contribution to the world, especially from revolutionary academics and thinkers who aren\u2019t old white, middle-aged men. This is more than just about reading lists and racism.</p> <p>Critics suggest that by decolonising you\u2019re erasing history, but in fact you are just accurately portraying history. If you look at the way in which the British nation has been constructed, it\u2019s very much been an exclusionary space, an exclusively white space.</p> </blockquote> <h3><strong>Fides Dagongdong, 24, studying law and politics, Decolonise Keele</strong></h3> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s very hard to not just convince, but to attempt a new conversation on this issue. So the data is what I expected it to be.&nbsp;You can see it with the BLM protests. A lot of the comments were, like, I don\u2019t understand why these statues are being either forcibly removed or crowds are gathering, protesting for its removal. </p> <p>Other students think decolonising is about completely eradicating the current system, which is not the case at all, we just want to make it more inclusive.&nbsp;</p> <p>Why is it that in the UK in most history curriculums it\u2019s usually an elective to learn about colonisation? It\u2019s very strange considering colonising was major part of British history. When I was a teenager, I was taught about American history, but nothing about British colonialism.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Sumayyah, 21, </strong><strong>religion, </strong><strong>politics and </strong><strong>society, Decolonise Kings College London</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think many institutions see it as a lot of work for something they don\u2019t really care about \u2013 that\u2019s why such initiatives are usually only responses to student demands, when the work to silence these students becomes more than the work to engage with them. Also, our entire education system, and even our concept of what knowledge is, cannot be untangled from its colonial roots and once we start looking at the curriculum, we provide non-white students with the power to demand more change and more justice.</p> <p>Most people I know can point to a text that they read that empowered them to advocate for change \u2013 by including such texts and ideas in the curriculum, universities know that they\u2019re placing their power structures at risk and they refuse to do that.</p> <p>Attempts by universities to \u2018decolonise the curriculum\u2019 will always be performative without a proper confrontation of how white supremacy and colonialism continue to manifest within academic institutions. The curriculum is a product of its environment and starting and ending our work with the curriculum will not create lasting change.</p> <p><strong>Additional reporting by Aamna Mohdin</strong></p> </blockquote>",

Best believe people are going to be fighting over a lot more than just toilet paper.\u201d</p> <h2>Samantha Bee</h2> <p>After time off, Samantha Bee returned to Full Frontal with an emotional segment on the long, terrifying history of anti-Black police brutality in America. \u201cIt is so fucking frustrating that this keeps happening, and that it took a nine-minute video of a man being killed to get people to understand that this is an emergency,\u201d Bee said of the killing of George Floyd by four Minneapolis police officers.&nbsp;</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwNGWIcy6YU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RwNGWIcy6YU?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cA sea change is happening, and it is step one, the first of many, to upend white supremacy,\u201d Bee said of the subsequent nationwide protests.&nbsp;\u201cWe have to change the infrastructure of police and justice in this country. It all comes down to this: Black lives matter.\u201d</p> <p>Protests have erupted in America\u2019s major cities and small town, \u201cand to show how not brutally violent they are, the police have responded with absolutely brutal violence\u201d, Bee said, citing numerous videos of police attacking otherwise peaceful protesters. \u201cIt is horrifying that the authorities are beating, gassing and running over peaceful protesters,\u201d Bee said. \u201cThey\u2019re so out of control, I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t ticket the people they ran over for scuffing up the paint job.\u201d</p> <p>Moreover, Bee continued, abuse in law enforcement is rarely met with accountability. Derek Chauvin, the officer who killed George Floyd, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/us/derek-chauvin-george-floyd.html\">had at least 17 prior complaints</a> against him \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t know the right number of complaints it should take to get a police officer fired, but it definitely should not be more than the number of stamps to get a free smoothie at Jamba Juice,\u201d Bee said. And of the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/us/derek-chauvin-george-floyd.html\">more than 2,600 misconduct complaints </a>against Minneapolis police officers since 2012, only 12 resulted in an officer being disciplined.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important that we\u2019re talking about George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, but that\u2019s only the first step,\u201d Bee concluded. \u201cWe also need to be talking about Tony McDade, David McAtee, Michael Lorenzo Dean, Eric Reason, Atatiana Jefferson, Christopher Whitfield, Christopher McCorvey, Dominique Clayton, Pamela Turner, Botham Jean, Antwon Rose II, Stephon Clark, Ronell Foster, Aaron Bailey, Jordan Edwards, Alteria Woods, Paul O\u2019Neal, Terence Crutcher, Philando Castile, Alton Sterling, Sylville Smith, Salvado Ellswood,\u201d all names of Black people killed by police, which kept rolling as the screen faded to black.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Seth Meyers</h2> <p>And on Late Night, Seth Meyers discussed troubling new polls for Trump, which found <a href=\"https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/405578-trump-approval-at-47-percent-says-hilltv-poll\">47% </a><a href=\"https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/405578-trump-approval-at-47-percent-says-hilltv-poll\">t of American</a><a href=\"https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/405578-trump-approval-at-47-percent-says-hilltv-poll\">s \u201cstrongly disapproved\u201d</a> of his handling of the protests. \u201cWow, it\u2019s bad enough when the majority disapprove of you, but to have nearly half say they strongly disapprove of you must be depressing,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing if you pass a note to a classmate that says \u2018do you like me?\u2019 and they check no. It\u2019s another thing if they write in: \u2018I\u2019d rather eat a burrito filled with dog turds.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s unpopularity is in stark contrast with the public approval for the protests spurred by the killing of George Floyd by four police officers in Minneapolis last month. \u201cMajorities of Americans are finally coming around to the reality that acts of police violence against Black people aren\u2019t just isolated incidents from a few bad apples,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cThey\u2019re part of a fundamentally corrupt system based on a history of racism and exploitation.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a point where you have to ask yourself, can it even be reformed?\u201d Meyers added. \u201cOne bad flight, and you\u2019re like \u2018maybe we can make air travel better.\u2019 But if every flight you take ends up in the Hudson River, you might think it\u2019s time to defund Spirit Airlines.\u201d</p> <p>Which is why calls to defund the police \u2013 as in, to divert funding from police departments to other, more effective community solutions such as mental health care, social services and housing to decrease interactions between armed police and citizens \u2013 have soared in popularity, leaving \u201cconservatives and many Democrats freaking out\u201d. Meyers played clips of said freakouts, such as Tucker Carlson outlandishly claiming a \u201cwoke militia\u201d would enforce \u201cdemocratic party orthodoxy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s spend the money we\u2019re lavishing on police departments on other nonviolent alternatives like mental health resources, substance abuse resources or, if Tucker Carlson\u2019s the one calling, we can send the woke militia to force-feed him vegan sausage,\u201d Meyers concluded. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll like it \u2013 maybe that will be the end of it all.\u201d</p>",

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany.

There were a further 4,809 that they either failed to reach or failed to persuade to stay at home.</p> \n<p>But Lady Harding said the programme was in its very earliest stages and she accepted that there was much still to do.</p> \n<p>\u201cTens of thousands of people have engaged with NHS Test and Trace in its first week, either by taking a test if they\u2019ve got symptoms or sharing their contacts if they test positive and then following the advice to self-isolate if they\u2019ve been contacted. We clearly have got more to do to make sure that we reach everyone.\u201d</p> \n<p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he was pleased with the way test and trace had worked in its first week. \u201cIt\u2019s already had a huge impact: the system is working well, and as we\u2019ve both said from the start, we\u2019ll keep improving it. It will keep getting better,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Speaking at the daily Downing Street press briefing, he repeated his message that it was the public\u2019s \u201ccivic duty\u201d to comply with requests from contact tracers.</p> \n<p>However, Hancock also underlined the scale of the challenge when he said the ongoing Office for National Statistics study of the prevalence of the coronavirus in the community has shown that as many as 70-80% of those who test positive have no symptoms.</p> \n<p>Asked about the NHSX coronavirus app, originally slated for launch in mid-May, Hancock played down its significance, saying, \u201cthe app will help, and we\u2019ll bring it in when it is right to do so\u201d.</p> \n<p>He also acknowledged that further easing of lockdown restrictions will depend on how successful the new system is. \u201cThe better test and trace is, the more lockdown measures we can relieve safely.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot more to do to improve the speed of the entire service,\u201d Harding said, \u201cbut actually we have really significant testing capacity and the single biggest thing we can do to improve the process is actually encourage anyone with symptoms to get a test.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2020-06-11T16:45:49/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Tracing graphic 1\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2020-06-11T16:45:49/embed.html\">Tracing graphic 1</a> \n</figure> \n<p>There were many reasons why the contacts of a third of those who tested positive could not be tracked down, she said.

  "<p>A council\u2019s plans to remove a statue of the founder of the Scout movement amid fears that it would be targeted by anti-racist activists were thwarted when it was surrounded by dozens of locals refusing to allow it to be taken away.</p> <p>Former scouts were among those who formed a ring around the statue of Robert Baden-Powell, a divisive figure who has been accused of support for Adolf Hitler, on the quayside in Poole. They vowed that they would not let either council workers or activists get to the statue.</p> <p>The flags of St George and Dorset were draped over the monument, and a woman held out a sign reading: \u201cBritish history matters.\u201d</p> <p>Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council said it was not able to remove the statue on Thursday because it had misjudged the depth of the foundations, but privately council leaders admitted that they had no chance of removing it because of the crowd.</p> <p>The council said security guards would be stationed around the clock at the statue until it could be removed and insisted it would be put back as soon as it was judged that the threat against it had passed.</p> <p>The statue was installed in 2008 and faces Brownsea Island in Poole harbour, where the Scout movement began. In 2010, declassified MI5 files revealed that Baden-Powell was invited to meet Hitler after holding friendly talks about forming closer ties with the Hitler Youth organisation. He has also been accused of holding racist and homophobic views.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"668d7a7526da19d054e250c0c8c1857485048eeb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/668d7a7526da19d054e250c0c8c1857485048eeb/0_0_4401_3020/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Baden-Powell statue in Poole draped in flags.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Baden-Powell statue in Poole draped in flags.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cllr Mark Howell, the council\u2019s deputy leader, said: \u201cOur decision to temporarily remove the statue of Lord Baden-Powell from Poole Quay was taken following the listing of the statue on a website detailing potential targets for protesters.

We made the decision quickly in order to protect it.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that local people feel proud of Lord Baden-Powell\u2019s and the Scout movement\u2019s links with Poole, and that some people feel that we would be giving in to the protesters by temporarily removing the statue. However, we feel it is responsible to protect it for future generations to enjoy and respect.</p> <p>\u201cWe will not be removing the statue today [Thursday] as the foundations are deeper than originally envisaged and we need further discussions with contractors on the best way to remove it safely.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough we cannot say when any temporary removal may take place, we will be providing 24-hour security until it is either removed or the threat diminishes. Should the statue be removed temporarily, barring unforeseen circumstances we will return it to the quay as soon as the threat level subsides.\u201d</p> <p>After the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/11/edward-colston-statue-retrieved-bristol-harbour-black-lives-matter\">statue of the slave trader Edward Colston</a> was hauled down and dumped into the harbour in Bristol, the Baden-Powell monument was one of more than 60 that appeared on a \u201cTopple the Racists\u201d hit list.

  "<p>Unsurprisingly, Benjamin Netanyahu has now made things starkly clear. On 28 May the Israeli prime minister explained that when \u2013 not if \u2013 his government goes ahead with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/what-would-israel-annexing-the-west-bank-mean\">unilateral annexation</a> of parts of the occupied West Bank, thousands of Palestinian residents would be granted neither citizenship nor equal rights.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/palestine-says-it-will-declare-statehood-if-israel-annexes-west-bank\">Palestine says it will declare statehood if Israel annexes West Bank</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shortly before that, a group of Israeli settlers <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium--1.8894785\">posted a photograph</a> of themselves gazing at a map of what they, like Netanyahu, call by the biblical names of Judea and Samaria, prompting comments from Palestinians \u2013 and liberal Israelis \u2013 that the image captured the institutionalisation of a formal apartheid system. It is hard to argue with that conclusion.</p> <p>Netanyahu made his statement after three deadlocked elections enabled his Likud party to finally <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/03/27/in-israel-benny-gantz-decides-to-join-with-rival-netanyahu/\">form a coalition</a> with his former rival, the centrist Blue and White leader Benny Gantz. Under their agreement, from 1 July, in coordination with the US, steps will be taken to formally annex illegal Israeli settlements and the Jordan Valley.</p> <p>It is not yet certain exactly what will happen. Donald Trump\u2019s re-election prospects are an important variable, given the volatile domestic situation in the US, as are likely reactions from Jordan and Egypt \u2013 the only Arab states to have peace treaties with Israel. But the devil is not in the detail. If annexation of any territory goes ahead it will flagrantly breach international law and countless UN resolutions. It cannot go unanswered. Israel should face sanctions, just as Russia did when it annexed the Crimea from Ukraine.</p> <p>And worse, it will be the final nail in the coffin of what for decades has been rightly seen as the only possible solution to the world\u2019s most intractable and divisive conflict \u2013 two sovereign states for the two peoples who inhabit the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan river, whether they like it or not (and many, of course, do not).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It has become fashionable to argue that Netanyahu\u2019s move will clarify, once and for all, that two states is a fantasy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Increasingly, supporters of Palestinian rights welcome this looming Israeli threat.&nbsp;\u201cBring annexation on!\u201d they insist.

The current, \u201cone-state reality\u201d has been in place for a long time.</p> <p>Advocates insist that annexation will mean no longer focusing in vain on a cost-free occupation, but on a rights-based approach that will transform Israel into apartheid-era South Africa, albeit one with more or less equal populations \u2013 not the 11% white minority that ruled from Pretoria until 1994. Impunity will end.</p> <p>Now, it is certainly hard to claim that two states is within reach. No peace negotiations have been held since 2014. In 2008 Ehud Olmert and Mahmoud Abbas <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinians-israel-abbas-olmert/abbas-says-olmert-was-two-months-from-peace-deal-idUSBRE89D0G420121014\">came close to a deal</a> but failed to deliver it. Before that, the high hopes of the first intifada in 1987 evaporated as it became clear that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/sep/10/israel-plo-oslo-agreement-1993\">Oslo agreement of 1993</a> was not going to deliver a Palestinian state. The second intifada dealt them a near-fatal blow. But is there an alternative?</p> <p>The truth is that no one has a remotely workable strategy for achieving one unitary state with equal rights for all. On the Israeli side, the tiny movement of \u201cTwo States, One Homeland\u201d is the nearest anyone has come to mapping out a confederal relationship: that would permit, in theory at least, Palestinians to exercise their right of return and Israeli Jews being able to live in places that matter to them on religious or nationalist grounds. It is a stretch to believe in that, to put it mildly.</p> <p>Annexation will make things worse: short-term risks include the collapse of the Palestinian Authority and an end to what remains of Oslo, a crisis in Israel\u2019s relations with Jordan and Egypt with its de facto allies in the Gulf, and, above all, a resurgence of violence that could make the last intifada look tame. It will also destabilise an already volatile region, offering rich opportunities for Iran and Hizbullah to exploit.&nbsp;</p> <p>Palestinians will suffer directly. \u201cIt will lead,\u201d as the lawyer <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-the-three-most-common-mistakes-about-the-annexation-1.8893292\">Michael Sfard has warned</a>, \u201cto massive expropriation, automatic in some cases, of Palestinian land and property, the subsequent expulsion of individuals, families and entire communities from the annexed territories.\u201d And the situation in blockaded Gaza, home to two million Palestinians, will remain unchanged.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the big picture, annexation will mark a historic turning-point for Palestine. Future historians will compare it with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/17/centenary-britains-calamitous-promise-balfour-declaration-israel-palestine\">Balfour Declaration of 1917</a> and the wars of 1948 and 1967. It will overturn the fundamental principle, recognised by <a href=\"https://ecf.org.il/issues/issue/234\">Britain\u2019s Peel Commission in 1937</a> and by the fledgling United Nations in 1947, that the only way to resolve the conflict is to partition the Holy Land into separate Jewish and Arab states, guaranteeing national self-determination for both peoples who claim it as their own.</p> <p>Amidst unprecedented global distractions, signs of a concerted international response are hardly encouraging. Trump\u2019s \u201cdeal of the century\u201d has understandably been dismissed by Palestinians, wherever their loyalties lie. The democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, is not radical enough to undo the damage Trump has caused. The European Union is divided. Britain is preoccupied by the unresolved issues of a post-Brexit world, and looks unlikely to act in any meaningful way.</p> <p>Unilateral annexation will lead Israelis and Palestinians and their profoundly asymmetrical conflict into uncharted territory. But if history teaches one lesson, it is that facts on the ground, illegal or not, are unlikely to be reversed without violence. And even if annexation is delayed or does not happen, the situation will not have improved.

  "<h2><strong>Why has JK Rowling chosen to write </strong><strong>about her concerns?</strong></h2> <p>The Harry Potter author has published a 3,600-word <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/10/jk-rowling-says-survivor-of-domestic-abuse-sexual-assault\">essay</a> setting out in more detail than before the development of her already well-known stance in sex and gender debates. In it, she reveals for the first time her own experience of serious sexual assault and domestic violence which, Rowling explains, she felt compelled to write about after reading of the Scottish government\u2019s latest progress towards changing gender recognition laws.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/10/jk-rowling-says-survivor-of-domestic-abuse-sexual-assault\">JK Rowling reveals she is survivor of domestic abuse and sexual assault</a> </p> </aside>  <p>&nbsp;\u201cI couldn\u2019t shut out those memories [of my own assault] and I was finding it hard to contain my anger and disappointment about the way I believe my government is playing fast and loose with women\u2019s and girls\u2019 safety,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>Rowling underlines that she also wants trans women to be safe. Many other women who share her views likewise insist transgender people have the right to equality and dignity.</p> <p>But beyond this there is huge disagreement about how different positions \u2013 whether those of transgender activists or gender-critical feminists \u2013 express that commitment in practice, and indeed what the nuances of those different positions are.</p> <p>Gender critical feminists disagree with the trans rights activists\u2019 view that gender identity is separate from one\u2019s biological sex, and that it should be given priority in terms of law-making and policy. They fear that sex is being argued into non-existence and that this will erode rights hard-won by women in the face of historical biological discrimination.</p> <p>Others regard the focus on biological sex as transphobic. They argue that while they do not deny the reality of biological sex there must be a recognition of complexities beyond binary definition, and that people should have the right to privacy around their sex characteristics at birth (as was agreed in the European convention on human rights in 2002, which led to the current Gender Recognition Act).</p> <h2><strong>Can a person change their gender at will nowadays?</strong></h2> <p>Rowling says many people do not know that \u201ca man who intends to have no surgery and take no hormones may now secure himself a gender recognition certificate and be a woman in the sight of the law\u201d. But this has been the case since initial gender recognition legislation was passed in 2004, under which the only legal requirement for changing a birth certificate is proof of living in one\u2019s preferred gender.</p> <p>The Scottish government\u2019s proposals \u2013 which have been put on hold for the duration of the pandemic \u2013 remove the current requirement for applicants to provide medical evidence of their diagnosis of&nbsp;gender&nbsp;dysphoria, but other checks and balances remain. Those applying for a gender recognition certificate are entering into a legal agreement to live in their preferred gender for the rest of their life \u2013 any breach of this is punishable with up to two years in prison \u2013 and there remains a requirement that a person has lived in the acquired gender for three months before signing the statutory declaration, and waits for a further three-month reflection period before the certificate is granted.</p> <h2><strong>Are women-only spaces under threat?</strong></h2> <p>Rowling says that \u201cwhen you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms to any man who believes or feels he\u2019s a woman \u2026 then you open the door to any and all men who wish to come inside\u201d.</p> <p>Those supportive of transgender law reform \u2013 which has also been put on hold by the UK government \u2013 argue that anxiety around single sex-spaces relates to women\u2019s understandable lack of faith in how seriously violence against them is dealt with. Organisations such as Rape Crisis Scotland and Women\u2019s Aid Scotland have operated trans-inclusive policies with few reported problems. Transgender groups point out that they still make up only 0.6% of the population and that \u201cthe amount of obsession over where we pee is disproportionate to the likelihood of bumping into one of us\u201d.</p> <p>Others express the concern that the spectrum of people who identify particularly as trans women is expanding to include male-appearing people who \u2013 rightly or wrongly \u2013 might be perceived as a threat, and feel sceptical about whether inclusion policies have been properly tested or if individual cis women will be too afraid or uncomfortable to challenge male-bodied people in their spaces.</p> <h2><strong>Is there evidence that more young people are transitioning, and then regretting it?</strong></h2> <p>The problem is that there has been no systematic tracking in the UK of what happens to people after transitioning, so it is hard to offer evidence other than the anecdotal. Rowling refers to a controversial US paper that questions whether transgender identification in teenagers could be a form of social contagion. She notes that \u201cthe UK has experienced a 4,400% increase in girls being referred for transitioning treatment\u201d.</p> <p>Critics of Rowling say it is easy to exaggerate demand because the percentages involved are already so tiny. According to the Scottish Trans Alliance, it is estimated that less than 0.1% of under-18s in Scotland have been referred to a gender identity clinic, and the majority of them will receive psychological support at this stage. STA also reports that the numbers of people de-transitioning are \u201ca handful\u201d. </p> <h2><strong>Has the debate become irreconcilable/too toxic to move forward?</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/10/eddie-redmayne-joins-daniel-radcliffe-in-opposing-jk-rowling-trans-comments\">Eddie Redmayne joins Daniel Radcliffe in opposing JK Rowling's trans comments</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rowling describes the online threats and abuse she has encountered since making her position clear about two years ago, something that many others who speak out on transgender rights, whether supportively or critically, have also reported.</p> <p>Equalities organisations insist that supporting transgender rights should not and must not excuse abusive behaviour, but also make a plea not to conflate angry and anonymous voices online with organised campaigners: it is dangerous to decide the merits of equality principles based on what is said on Twitter.</p> <p>There is also concern that, when a woman of such influence and popularity as Rowling sets out a critical position, then the wider public, who are largely supportive of transgender people according to most recent <a href=\"https://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/media/39358/5_bsa36_relationships_and_gender_identity.pdf\">British Social Attitudes research</a>, may begin to question their fundamental rights.</p>",

But less than two years later, an expert committee poured icy water on the authenticity of the discoveries. As well as pointing out that some of the pieces bore traces of modern glue, they found references to non-existent gods \u2013 and to the 17th-century French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes.</p> <p>Further suspicions emerged when it was noted that the crucifixion scene bore the abbreviation RIP, which would have called into question Christ\u2019s resurrection and divinity.</p> <p>Equally suspicious was the fact that the first letter of the name of the Roman god Jupiter had been spelled not with an I but with a J, a letter than does not exist in the Latin alphabet.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re either a joke or a fraud,\u201d Mart\u00edn Almagro, a professor in prehistory from Madrid, said at the time, adding: \u201cHow has something like this been taken seriously for so long?\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>On Wednesday a court in Vitoria found Gil and his collaborator Rub\u00e9n Cerd\u00e1n <a href=\"https://www.efe.com/efe/espana/destacada/condenan-a-exdirector-de-yacimiento-alaves-por-falsificar-grafitos-romanos/10011-4267820\">guilty of fraud and keeping false records</a>.</p> <p>It ruled that the finds had been manipulated \u201cwith contemporary incisions that were intended to suggest they contained inscriptions or markings of the same age as the objects themselves, and that they possessed a historical and cultural value of which they were devoid\u201d.</p> <p>Gil was sentenced to a total of two years and three months, while Cerd\u00e1n was handed a 15-month sentence.

  "<p>Robert Jenrick is facing increased political pressure to explain his intervention in a planning decision to save a property developer millions of pounds, after ducking a parliamentary question on the subject and sending his deputy instead.</p> <p>Labour have demanded the communities secretary release the correspondence showing his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/10/labour-calls-on-robert-jenrick-to-make-statement-over-billionaires-donation\">contacts with the former Express newspapers owner</a> Richard Desmond ahead of the decision over a residential development in east London.</p> <p>Separately, the Liberal Democrats have written to Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, to ask whether Jenrick potentially breached the ministerial code. Ed Davey, the party\u2019s interim leader, wrote that there appeared to be \u201can increasingly expanding web of links between Mr Jenrick and Mr Desmond\u201d.</p> <p>Labour has also demanded the Conservatives hand back a \u00a312,000 donation from Desmond, received two weeks after Jenrick <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/richard-desmond-housing-project-unlawfully-approved-robert-jenrick-isle-dogs-london-avoid-40m-hit\">overruled the local council</a>&nbsp;and the government\u2019s planning inspectorate to approve the 1,500-apartment, 44-storey complex in London.</p> <p>The decision came a day before the introduction of a community infrastructure levy (CIL) imposed by Tower Hamlets council, which would have cost Desmond\u2019s company at least \u00a340m, to be used for local education and health projects.</p> <p>After the council challenged his decision, Jenrick accepted it had been unlawful. It has since emerged that Jenrick sat on the same table as Desmond at a Conservative fundraising event in November.</p> <p>Following days of pressure over the issue, Labour secured an emergency question in the Commons on Thursday. But rather than respond himself, Jenrick sent Chris Pincher, a junior minister in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, to field the questions.</p> <p>Steve Reed, the shadow communities secretary, asked why Jenrick did not personally answer the urgent question, even though he was apparently at parliament.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2eb492fdda375170daf665292feb6da3fe5ac37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2eb492fdda375170daf665292feb6da3fe5ac37/0_32_1724_1035/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The proposed Westferry Printworks development in east London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jenrick overruled planning authorities to approve the proposed Westferry Printworks in east London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis sequence of events raises grave concerns about cash for favours,\u201d Reed told Pincher in the Commons. \u201cIf he wants to restore trust, the secretary of state must immediately publish all documents and all correspondence relating to this decision. The public needs reassurance that the integrity of the planning process cannot be auctioned off at Conservative party fundraising dinners.\u201d</p> <p>Reed said Labour wanted full transparency over Jenrick\u2019s decision in January. He said the minister\u2019s \u201cextraordinary step of admitting his decision was unlawful because of apparent bias\u201d in the court case launched by the council meant he avoided having to hand over correspondence detailing his actions.</p> <p>Reed added: \u201cCan the minister tell us what that apparent bias was?\u201d</p> <p>Pincher argued it was not uncommon for ministers to decide against planning authorities, and dismissed any impropriety. Jenrick, Pincher said, had informed his department of all conversations he had with Desmond, including at the November event, and \u201chas no relationship with the applicant\u201d.</p> <p>He said Jenrick admitted fault at the court case because both he and the council wanted to end the matter swiftly. \u201cThe way to achieve that, technically in law, is to accept the action that was brought by the local authority to the court. That is why he made the decision that he did,\u201d said Pincher.</p> <p>He said Jenrick had never discussed the issue of the CIL payments with Desmond, and knew nothing of the billionaire\u2019s donation to the party, which Pincher said was payment for a ticket to an event.</p> <p>In a statement released after the question, Reed called for the Conservatives to repay Desmond\u2019s donation. He said: \u201cInstead of answering questions about his behaviour, Robert Jenrick sent in a junior minister to speak on his behalf while he&nbsp;apparently&nbsp;laid low in the tea room.&nbsp;This attempt to avoid scrutiny shows contempt for the public who are concerned about the&nbsp;integrity&nbsp;of the planning process.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said the prime minister continued to have confidence in Jenrick.</p> <p>Asked why Jenrick had sent Pincher to answer Labour\u2019s questions, instead of facing them himself, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s appropriate for the housing minister to respond to questions in the house on housing and planning matters.

Root has a growly, twangy, slightly Cornish voice; yet it was only when she appeared in full uniform, including a sinister peaked cap, and said \u201ctop o\u2019 the morning,\u201d that I said out loud: \u201cJudi Dench is supposed to be&nbsp;<em>Irish!\u201d</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl2r3Fwxz_o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fl2r3Fwxz_o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The last time I heard that phrase used to denote Irishness, however ironically, was when Colin Farrell played Bullseye, the Irish supervillain in the little-loved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/feb/14/artsfeatures2\">Marvel movie Daredevil (2003)</a> and Farrell turns out to be in this as well, phoning in his performance for the fantastically dull role of Artemis Fowl Sr, the wealthy and reclusive connoisseur of Irish myth and legend who understands what most do not \u2013 that the fairies and little folk are real. When Fowl Sr is kidnapped by a fairy gone rogue, it is his troubled but brilliant 12-year-old son <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/05/evil-or-genius-what-has-disney-done-to-artemis-fowl-eoin-colfer\">Artemis Fowl Jr (Ferdia Shaw)</a> who has to save him, and deal with this evil abductor\u2019s ransom demand for the fairy-folk\u2019s most precious artefact: the Aculos, the key that governs the fairies\u2019 control of their own domain and their entrance to the human world. But this Aculos is missing. How on earth is young Artemis supposed to get it? Fortunately, his destiny is to coincide with that of an audacious young fairy under Root\u2019s command: Holly Short (Lara McDonnell) and also a roguish and somewhat Hagridian \u201cgiant dwarf\u201d called Mulch Diggums (Josh Gad). Nonso Anozie plays Artemis\u2019s bodyguard and martial-arts trainer, Butler. Together, Artemis and Butler wear some men-in-black-type suits and ties.</p> <p>Dench has one or two moderately funny lines (\u201cGet the fffff \u2026 four-leaf clover out of here,\u201d she stutters at one stage) and there is an amusing setpiece when the fairies impose a kind of mass-hypnotic time-freeze situation on an Italian wedding where a giant, grisly troll is about to run amok, so that Holly can neutralise the horrible beast without any of the humans there remembering afterwards what has happened. (Again, a bit of a men-in-black idea.) Images and characters bounce around like shapes on a screensaver and only McDonnell and Gad\u2019s performances have any fizz. This is a YA-franchise by numbers.</p> <ul> <li><p>&nbsp;Available on Disney+ from 12 June.</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>We woke up on Tuesday to the sound of drilling, something not heard in New York for three months. The streets are still on the empty side, and everyone is wearing masks, but as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/new-york-reopen-coronavirus-lockdown\">lockdown eased</a> this week \u2013 most shops remained closed, but construction sites reopened \u2013 the city entered a new phase. It should have been hopeful; last week, New York reported its first day with <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/new-york-city-reports-first-day-with-no-confirmed-coronavirus-deaths-since-march-11.html\">no deaths</a> from the virus since 11 March. Instead, the slight relaxation of rules brought home how far things still are from normality.</p> <p>There will be anatomies of how we changed during lockdown and whether any of the long-term predictions came to pass. In the short term, however, the experience of re-engaging with the city felt as uncomfortable as blood returning to a deadened limb. At the height of the virus, the sense of urgency ushered in an alternative reality that suspended the need to think much beyond the next day. Now, with no school until September and the temperate nudging towards 90F this week, there was a feeling of burnout. Everyone talks about the new normal, and here it was: anticipating a second wave, while trying to process what happened during the first.</p> <p>Certain things during this period have become intolerable: lectures from celebrities, particularly those directing us to \u201cbe kind\u201d; unmasked runners; men whose productivity went up during lockdown while their wives scrambled to fit work around the kids. I recently bought a book for my children based on the effusive recommendation of several friends, and found my tolerance for certain kinds of sentimentality shot through.&nbsp;Perhaps if I\u2019d read The&nbsp;Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse at Christmas, I might have loved it. But not&nbsp;now. There is a particular kind of English whimsy that revolves around the concept of cake and right now feels,&nbsp;very much, like not the time for it.&nbsp;(To give an idea to those who haven\u2019t read the book, at one point the boy discovers something better than cake and it is \u2013 of course \u2013 a hug.)</p> <p>Our own lockdown ended absurdly. After three months of avoiding the doctor, I made an appointment on Monday to see a podiatrist and have a verruca burned off the ball of one foot. The waiting room was empty, and when I arrived the nurse pointed a temperature gun at my head, but apart from that everything proceeded as normal \u2013 albeit with a sense of outlandish decadence at entering a business for less than life-or-death reasons. I\u2019m vain about my high pain tolerance, but when the doctor injected the underside of my foot, I swore so loudly and lengthily it felt like a release from all the weeks of pent-up emotion.</p> <p>Time continues to pass strangely, its usual markers suspended. When school finishes in two weeks, we\u2019ll hardly register the difference. There is no summer camp, no possibility of flying without risk. New York is suffering a <a href=\"https://www.amny.com/coronavirus/no-silver-bullet-to-solve-new-yorks-8-7b-budget-deficit-22-unemployment-stringer/\">huge budget deficit</a>, thanks to the virus, and city pools won\u2019t open this summer. At its height, we were grateful simply to be healthy. Now, for the lucky among us, this isn\u2019t enough. By the very fact of this boredom and desire to turn to other things, the city\u2019s vast divisions start to resurface.</p> <p>Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, lost the heroic status he briefly achieved at the height of the virus \u2013 largely by virtue of not being Trump \u2013 when he <a href=\"https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2020/06/03/george-floyd-protests-new-york-city-nypd-coronavirus-andrew-cuomo/\">endorsed the police</a> during the Black Lives Matter protests last week. He permitted himself some cheerleading on Monday, saying at <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/08/gov-andrew-cuomo-says-new-yorks-mojos-back-as-coronavirus-cases-fall-and-nyc-begins-reopening.html\">a news briefing</a>: \u201cNew Yorkers bent the curve by being smart. We\u2019re celebrating. We\u2019re back. We\u2019re reopening. We\u2019re excited. Our mojo\u2019s back. Our energy\u2019s back. Great. Stay smart.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t know anyone who feels this way. The city feels flat and exhausted. It\u2019s not celebrating in the slightest. More than 20,000 people <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/490c1637-fb5d-3945-bd9a-5e246e06d36d\">have died</a>. There are predictions that the <a href=\"https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/nyc-unemployment-could-hit-22-percent-june-comptroller-says\">unemployment rate will reach 22%</a> this month. Everything that seemed like a temporary adjustment a month ago is starting to shade into the pall of something much longer term. Perhaps, as has been the case from the very beginning of this crisis, things will change rapidly again, and by next week optimism will kick in. But can we first have a moment to exhale?</p> <p>\u2022Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Probation services in England and Wales will be fully restored to public ownership and control, the justice secretary has announced, marking the final nail in the coffin of Chris Grayling\u2019s disastrous&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/21/grayling-probation-changes-led-to-expensive-merry-go-round-says-report\">privatisation </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/21/grayling-probation-changes-led-to-expensive-merry-go-round-says-report\">changes</a>.</p> <p>Under Grayling\u2019s widely derided shake-up in 2014, the probation sector was separated into a public sector organisation, the National Probation Service (NPS) managing high-risk criminals, and 21 private companies responsible for the supervision of 150,000 low- to medium-risk offenders.</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice previously announced that all offender management, about 80% of all probation work, would be brought under the state-run NPS.</p> <p>The remaining services, such as rehabilitation and the provision of unpaid work, will no longer be offered up for private tender, the justice secretary said, marking the complete return of probation services to the public sector.</p> <p>About 2,000 workers at the private providers, known as community rehabilitation companies (CRCs), are to be brought over to HM Prison and Probation Service.</p> <p>Robert Buckland told the House of Commons: \u201cThe delivery of unpaid work, behavioural change programmes will be brought under control of the NPS alongside offender supervision when current CRC contracts end in June next year.</p> <p>\u201cThis will give us a critical measure of control, resilience and flexibility with these services which we would not have had were they delivered under 12 contracts with a number of organisations.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/06/serco-wins-covid-19-test-and-trace-contract-despite-1m-fine\">Serco wins Covid-19 test-and-trace contract despite \u00a31m fine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The NPS will take full responsibility for sentence management, interventions and programme delivery and will at some point in the future be able to commission specialist charities to offer additional support services for offenders. This broadly mirrors the arrangements that existed prior to Grayling\u2019s so-called \u201ctransforming rehabilitation\u201d changes several years ago.</p> <p>Ian Lawrence, the general secretary of the probation union Napo, said: \u201cOur members across the whole of probation, and especially those who have been working tirelessly against the odds to maintain services in the private sector, will breathe a huge sigh of relief that Napo\u2019s relentless campaigning has at last helped to bring certainty over the future of the service.</p> <p>\u201cMinisters have taken a courageous decision to fully reverse the earlier reforms that we opposed from the start and which have also been widely and continuously criticised by parliament and HM Inspector of Probation.</p> <p>\u201cWe will now be urgently engaging with ministers and employers to ensure that all staff currently working in a CRC are guaranteed a future offer of employment in a publicly owned probation service.\u201d</p> <p>The chief inspector of probation,&nbsp;Justin Russell, cautioned the announcement was \u201cnot a magic bullet for improving performance\u201d. He said: \u201cThe&nbsp;probation&nbsp;service must be properly funded. The quality of&nbsp;probation&nbsp;supervision will not improve merely by lifting and shifting large volumes of cases from CRCs back into the NPS next year. Vacancies for&nbsp;probation&nbsp;officers must be filled and staff properly trained for their new responsibilities.\u201d</p> <p>Private providers expressed frustration and disappointment at the announcement.</p> <p>Liz Crowhurst,&nbsp;the head of infrastructure and public sector policy at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said: \u201cThis news will come as a disappointment to the public service suppliers \u2013 including charities \u2013 who have worked hard to deliver innovative probation solutions. All will urgently want to understand the implications for their staff, continuity of provision and their investments amid challenging times.</p> <p>\u201cPublic-private partnerships can deliver high-quality public services, and have done so successfully for decades, in tandem with local and central government.</p> <p>\u201cSo it will be important to keep an open mind and understand what\u2019s worked \u2013 and what hasn\u2019t \u2013 to ensure that public contracts continue to provide people with best-in-class sustainable services.\u201d</p> <p>Grayling ignored&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/dec/15/probation-reforms-put-public-at-higher-risk\">significant warnings from within his department</a>&nbsp;to push through his reforms in 2014. MPs on the public accounts committee said the changes were rushed through at breakneck speed, taking&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/03/chris-grayling-probation-changes-took-unacceptable-risks-with-public-money\">\u201cunacceptable risks\u201d</a>&nbsp;with taxpayers\u2019 money. The justice committee described the overhaul as a \u201cmess\u201d and warned it might never work.</p> <p>Since the reforms were introduced, the government has had to bail out the private providers by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/27/private-probation-companies-contracts-ended-early-justice\">more than half a billion pounds</a>.</p> <p>The shadow justice secretary, David Lammy, said: \u201cThe opposition welcomes this U-turn the government is announcing today. It\u2019s a U-turn we have been calling for for many, many years in this house.\u201d</p> <p>Lammy added it was \u201csuch a shame\u201d Grayling was not present in the House of Commons for the announcement. He said: \u201cSince the reforms reoffending rates have climbed up to 32%, that is members of the public, victims across the country, who have been subject to offenders and to crime that would not have been subject to the trauma that they were put through had this privatisation not been brought in in the first place.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The court of appeal has overturned a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/03/man-who-does-not-understand-consent-has-right-to-pursue-sex-court-rules\">controversial ruling</a> that a man has a \u201cfundamental right to sex\u201d even though he cannot understand the issue of consent.</p> <p>In the original ruling, a judge found in favour of the man, identified only as JB, despite evidence that he represented a \u201cmoderate risk\u201d of sexual offending, particularly against vulnerable women.</p> <p>JB, 36, has autism with impaired cognition and cannot understand that a woman\u2019s consent is relevant in sexual situations, nor that attempting sex without consent is likely to be a criminal offence.</p> <p>JB has never been charged with any criminal offence, but because of his behaviour towards women he has been subject to a care plan by his local authority since 2014 that imposes significant limitations on his freedoms.</p> <p>The local authority wanted the care plan to stay in place, but in her original ruling Mrs Justice Roberts said JB was \u201canxious to have a sexual partner and believes that the current restrictions represent an unfair and unwarranted interference in his basic rights to a private and family life\u201d.</p> <p>Roberts decided that insisting that JB understood the issue of consent before being allowed to pursue sexual relationships would be discrimination because it would \u201cimpose on him a burden which a capacitous individual may not share\u201d.</p> <p>She acknowledged that not having that knowledge might result in JB committing rape or other sexual offences. But she said JB was \u201centitled to make the same mistakes which all human beings can, and do, make in the course of a lifetime.\u201d</p> <p>The local authority took the case to the appeal court, which <a href=\"https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2020/735.html\">found in </a><a href=\"https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2020/735.html\">its favour</a>, overturning 14 years of jurisprudence that had set the test for capacity in decisions involving sexual activity with another person relatively low.&nbsp;</p> <p>Alex Ruck Keene, a barrister at 39 Essex Chambers and a specialist in the field of mental capacity and mental health law, <a href=\"https://www.mentalcapacitylawandpolicy.org.uk/the-court-of-appeal-decision-making-capacity-and-sex-have-we-been-getting-it-all-wrong/\">said</a> the new judgment \u201cmade clear that we have been asking the wrong question in relation to sexual relations.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an extremely significant judgment and it is very likely that the matter will not stop here. By both recasting the question in JB\u2019s case and suggesting that this is the way in which capacity with regard to sexual relations should normally be assessed in most cases, the court of appeal has essentially pressed the reset button on what has become an intensely tangled \u2013 and frankly unsatisfactory \u2013 series of cases,\u201d he added. </p> <p>Before this ruling, the court could only indirectly attempt to try to protect mentally disabled parties who did not understand the need for consent, and their partners, from sexual offences being committed. The court could control their contact with people but that control did not necessarily extend into the bedroom.</p> <p>A legal commentator said: \u201cThe new ruling rebalances the law to allow for protection of the incapacitous person and others as well as promoting their autonomy.\u201d</p>",

If you can make someone laugh to the point where they lose control of their bodily functions then you\u2019ve done the job you\u2019ve been paid to do \u2013 they can\u2019t ask for their money back.</p> <p>I\u2019ve never wet myself laughing, but that\u2019s not to say it\u2019ll never happen ... it just means we haven\u2019t reached peak comedy yet. When I wet myself laughing, all of us comedians can happily retire.</p> <p>The closest I\u2019ve come was probably watching Peter Kay talk about how his family would put a cushion over the VCR when they went on holiday so nobody could think they were rich and try to rob them. It brought back a long-forgotten memory of my family doing exactly the same, and being generally obsessed with our old video recorder and its big rubbery buttons. Trying to set the timer was like being at the controls of Apollo 13.</p> <p>There are three main reasons why people laugh: embarrassment, resonance and surprise, and that joke is the perfect example of resonance for me. It takes me straight back to being a kid; a joke that makes you almost wet yourself is a joke you\u2019ll never tire of.</p> <p>When I was pregnant with my daughter, who\u2019s now almost two, I got first-hand experience of what it\u2019s like to properly lose control. It was a really hot summer\u2019s day in 2018 and I\u2019d driven from London to Reading for a job interview \u2013 back then, I worked as a project manager by day and a comedian by night. After the interview, I downed a bottle of water, only to get stuck in traffic for two hours on the way home. You should have seen the way I parked my car outside my house ... but the moment I put my key in the door, I felt it starting to come out. I\u2019d say I lost 70% down my leg and 30% in the toilet. For a pregnant woman, a traffic jam and a hot day, I call that a win.</p> <p>While I was pregnant, I used an app to remind me to do my pelvic floor exercises, but I preferred doing them out of sight, where nobody could see my facial expressions. Maybe I\u2019m being paranoid but I\u2019m sure every clench made me wink or do something weird with my eyebrows.</p> <p>I\u2019m glad I kept it up though. My daughter was delivered by caesarean and once that had healed, it was important to me to start walking and taking exercise - I wanted everything, including my pelvic floor, to feel like it was working well.</p> <p>As a mum, I want to demonstrate to my daughter a love of movement, health and wellbeing \u2013 I want her to like herself and look after herself. I remember putting her in her bouncy chair so that she could watch me skip in the garden \u2013 I say watch, she was probably just wondering what her milk supply was up to.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-last-taboo/2020/may/29/wetting-yourself-as-an-adult-is-the-stuff-of-nightmares-jenny-eclair-on-bladder-weakness\">'Wetting yourself as an adult is the stuff of nightmares': Jenny Eclair on bladder weakness</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These days I\u2019m a full-time writer and comedian, and I think it\u2019s great that women are so much less apologetic when it comes to talking about so-called women\u2019s issues.

I\u2019m looking forward to talking to my daughter about periods and the patriarchy \u2013 I feel lucky that feminism isn\u2019t just an academic theory now, it\u2019s a way for us to examine the world and speak up for ourselves.</p> <p>There\u2019s no way women should feel embarrassed about wetting themselves in public. Men get caught short all the time and when they do, they find the nearest upright structure, and shamelessly relieve themselves.</p> <p>Sadly we don\u2019t have that luxury, but if it happens \u2013 because of bladder weakness, pregnancy or comedy \u2013 just accept your fate and remember that if you were a man, you\u2019d have had a wall.

He and black YouTube influencer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy3BDnBwfMAMFpqt3j9jHvQ\">Courtney Daniella</a> were credited with helping boost the number of black applicants inquiring about its courses, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/oct/11/stormzy-effect-record-number-black-britons-studying-cambridge-university\">an almost 50% increase in admissions between 2018 and 2019</a>.</p> <p>At the Brit awards in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/22/stormzys-brit-awards-triumph-grime-star-politics\">he castigated Theresa May and the Conservative government</a> over the handling of the Grenfell Tower fire aftermath, using a freestyle rap to say: \u201cTheresa May, where\u2019s the money for Grenfell? \u2026 [you] just forgot about Grenfell, you criminals, and you got the cheek to call us savages.\u201d He also appeared on a version of Bridge Over Troubled Water to benefit victims of the disaster.</p> <p>That year, he also launched #MerkyBooks, an imprint within Penguin Random House to publish writing \u201cfrom underrepresented communities\u201d.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/malorie-blackman\">Malorie Blackman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/21/that-reminds-me-derek-owusu-review\">Derek Owusu</a> and Stormzy himself are among the writers on the roster.</p> <p>Numerous other cultural figures have donated to causes in the wake of the Floyd killing, and amid global Black Lives Matter protests. Korean group BTS, who are the world\u2019s biggest boy band, donated $1m to Black Lives Matter, with the donation later matched by fans via a crowdfunding initiative.</p> <p>Canadian R&amp;B singer the Weeknd, who spent 14 weeks in the UK Top 3 earlier this year with his single Blinding Lights, donated $500,000 across three organisations: Black Lives Matter, <a href=\"https://www.knowyourrightscamp.com/\">Know Your Rights Camp</a> and <a href=\"https://secure.actblue.com/donate/freeblackmamas2020\">National Bail Out</a>. He added: \u201cTo my fellow respected industry partners and execs\u2014no one profits off of black music more than the labels and streaming services. I urge you to go big and public with yours this week. It would mean the world to me and the community if you can join us.\u201d</p> <p>Lady Gaga announced a range of social justice initiatives that she was donating to, while stars including Harry Styles and Drake have donated to bail funds for protesters.</p> <p>Stormzy was scheduled to be on a world tour throughout 2020, playing 55 dates across five continents\u200b, but these shows have steadily been postponed due to coronavirus.\u200b He is currently at No 7 in the UK charts with the track I Dunno alongside rappers Tion Wayne and Dutchavelli.</p>",
  "<p>As kids, Destyne Butler Jr and Kenneth Sims Jr dreamed of boxing glory. Both found early success as youth boxers on the South Side of Chicago \u2013 Butler demonstrated enough promise at age 12 to merit a <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2007-03-25-0703250344-story.html\">profile in the Chicago Tribune</a>, in which he proclaimed his intent to box in the London Olympics, to front a Wheaties box, to haul in winnings. Sims\u2019s determination to box in the 2012 Olympics caught the attention of German film-maker Andr\u00e9 H\u00f6rmann, who made a documentary short on him and his coach \u2013 his father, Kenneth Sims Sr \u2013 in 2009, with the intent to make a feature film on the two boxing prodigies.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/27/jeffrey-epstein-netflix-documentary\">'It's outrageous': inside an infuriating Netflix series on Jeffrey Epstein</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But plans change. Sims failed to qualify for the London Games, a crushing defeat H\u00f6rmann captured on camera, while Butler fell into a burglary ring conducted by a then mentor; he was arrested for residential burglary of Chicago-area homes in 2012, at age 18, and spent four years in prison. And H\u00f6rmann\u2019s film, Ringside, for which he and cinematographer Tom Bergmann moved to Chicago for 18 months in 2013, morphed into a nine-year odyssey of two divergent fighters in and out of the ring. The 93-minute film, which will air on Showtime, is a time-lapse portrait of two steely father-son bonds, two paths of redemption and revision, two families for whom boxing has served as both community and anchor.&nbsp;</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRNf8nMJYtE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jRNf8nMJYtE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cBoxing is the chain that holds everything together, but it\u2019s not the center of the story,\u201d H\u00f6rmann told the Guardian, and Ringside primarily focuses on the push and pull of father and son, of community and sport, outside of the ring. The film interweaves Sims and Butler\u2019s two separate tracks, a sort of Hoop Dreams \u2013 the 1994 documentary, filmed over five years, about two black high schoolers from the South Side who dream of professional basketball \u2013 for millennial boxers.</p> <p>Ringside opens with a cinematic shot from the original documentary short: Sims, introverted and focused, strolling along a patchwork storefront in Chicago\u2019s South Side, a majority-black area in one of America\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/03/chicago-segregation-poverty/556649/\">most segregated cities</a> plagued by violence, racial discrimination and disinvestment. Then 18, Sims was deep in preparation for Olympic qualification, pouring hours into the gym with his father, a bounty of encouragement who cut his teeth as a street fighter. Reserved and circumspect, Sims Jr keeps distractions at a minimum; H\u00f6rmann\u2019s camera toggles between drills in the ring and the Sims family home, a one-bedroom apartment bedecked in boxing ribbons and trophies.</p> <p>Butler, who grew up in the projects, began boxing at age seven as an alternative to fighting in school. \u201cI loved it so much and I was so good at it, so I just stuck to it,\u201d Butler, now 25 and living on the South Side, told the Guardian. At the outset of Ringside, H\u00f6rmann catches up with him a world away from the exuberant local news appearance of his childhood \u2013 in 2013, he talks to his father and mentor, Destyne Butler Sr, on the phone, and shows off his muscles to his mother on video conference from prison.&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the course of the film \u2013 which is to say, the better part of a decade \u2013 both boxers face crushing disappointment: Sims misses the Olympics, struggles with the devastating toll of gun violence in his neighborhood, and wades into the world of professional boxing under the name \u201cBossman\u201d. Butler, with the help of a lawyer and his father, attends a grueling prison boot camp with the expectation of a four-to-six-month release, yet is inexplicably expelled from the program just 10 days from completion. He\u2019s sent back to jail for the rest of a four-year sentence, which only hardened his resolve to return to boxing. \u201cImagine you were planning on doing four to six months, and now you have to do four years of your life,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know how many people would just come up and say, \u2018man, my life is over with, now it is what it is.\u2019 I said no, I\u2019m still going to do what I\u2019ve gotta do.\u201d H\u00f6rmann\u2019s camera finds Butler again at 22, as he emerges from prison on an empty road in southern Illinois to new clothes, his father and brothers, and an immediate, unsteady return to the ring.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a557e12b33df3851559d1d8b27ca7a3d748a56cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a557e12b33df3851559d1d8b27ca7a3d748a56cd/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kenny Sims Sr and Kenny Sims Jr.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kenny Sims Sr and Kenny Sims Jr.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Showtime</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The footage of Butler\u2019s journey \u2013 a promising talent trapped in legal limbo, berated by mostly white officers in boot camp and arbitrarily dismissed from the program \u2013 feel especially resonant now, as protests against anti-black racism, police brutality and America\u2019s double-standard incarceration system flourish across the United States. \u201cPolice brutality and police being unfair \u2013 this is the type of stuff I\u2019ve been going through even before I was locked up, but especially when I got locked up,\u201d said Butler. \u201cThis is what\u2019s been going on. This is going on with my story. So I understand everything that people are talking about with the police.\u201d</p> <p>As a German film-maker who had only read about the South Side of Chicago before traveling to the area for the documentary short in 2008, H\u00f6rmann said he, too, found the American way of incarceration and de facto segregation confounding. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen any place as segregated as Chicago,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I learned about Destyne and Kenny and their dads teaching their sons how to explain to the police every move they make,\u201d \u2013 how to be extra careful around police, how to defuse an encounter with law enforcement made potentially lethal by their skin color \u2013 \u201cthat kind of mindset struck me.\u201d</p> <p>A long nine years in the making but a brisk hour and a half to watch, Ringside offers plenty of classic boxing underdog moments, but no tidy answers. The film is ultimately a two-character peek into a decade of dedication, the community around the ring in a neighborhood full of risk, the possibility of redemption through sport. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do a portrait of the South Side or a political statement in the first place,\u201d said H\u00f6rmann. \u201cI wanted to do it like through the eyes of my protagonists, that point of view. I\u2019m not the right guy to tell anybody about the South Side, though it has to be done.\u201d</p> <p>But Ringside does, according to Butler, point to the untapped and underfunded talent of the South Side. \u201cWe have a lot of talent. We just don\u2019t have as many opportunities as everybody else,\u201d he said. \u201cMusic, boxing, football, basketball, clothing designers, I mean the list goes on.\u201d</p> <p>Nine years in, the two boxers are no longer eager amateurs, but still pursuing their dreams \u2013 Sims, now 26, has a professional record of 14-2-1 and fought at Madison Square Garden. Butler regained his boxing shape, won the Chicago Golden Glove in 2018 and currently has an undefeated 9-0 pro record. And in 2020, he channels the same ambition evinced in his early boxing days 13 years ago. \u201cI\u2019m trying to do a lot of things \u2013 I\u2019m trying to be on billboards, I\u2019m trying to be the biggest athlete out there, I\u2019m trying to model, I\u2019m trying to do a lot of stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to be a star.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Ringside premieres on Showtime on 12 June with a UK date to be confirmed</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>There are only a handful of stars now for whom a major label will finance a full studio recording, and in the top three is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/21/jonas-kaufmann-i-feel-like-an-ambassador\">Jonas Kaufmann</a>, whose debut in the title role of Verdi\u2019s Otello was the hottest ticket at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/22/otello-review-royal-opera-house-verdi-keith-warner-jonas-kaufmann-kaufmann-\">Royal Opera House three years ago</a>. People still argue over how successful that first assumption was, but with this recording he puts his own stamp on it. Kaufmann\u2019s Otello starts out as less the swaggering hero, more the serious commanding officer, and as he becomes more and more defined by his own instability he alternates between a taut, intense tone of anger and certainty and a less tightly focused, more burnished voice full of doubt \u2013 at times it\u2019s almost a Jekyll-and-Hyde-type characterisation, but a subtler one than that might suggest. He dies well: quietly and movingly.</p> <p>His Desdemona is a relative newcomer, <a href=\"https://ammann-horak.agency/index.php/en/artists-en/artist-lombardi-federica-en\">Federica Lombardi</a>, whose light and fresh-sounding soprano plays up the young bride\u2019s innocence beautifully. There\u2019s a little more depth to Verdi\u2019s characterisation of her than she conveys here, but it\u2019s not one of the composer\u2019s most rounded roles: he, like Shakespeare and everyone else, was much <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/25/otello-review-royal-opera-jonas-kaufmann\">more interested in Iago</a>. He sounds properly dangerous as sung by Carlos \u00c1lvarez \u2013 forceful but smooth, he\u2019s as much in control as Otello is volatile, and he sings his nihilistic Credo with relish, the orchestra hurtling along with him until the mention of death brings a moment of pause to make your skin crawl. Here and elsewhere,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/nov/04/antonio-pappano-stays-on-royal-opera-house-london\">Antonio Pappano</a>\u2019s pacing wrings all the drama out of the music, without semaphoring or turning self-conscious. Whether building the mounting urgency of Otello and Desdemona\u2019s confrontation or weaving the web of Iago\u2019s deceit as he frames Cassio, Pappano gets an unflaggingly vivid performance from his Rome orchestra, and you could argue that the odd rough edge in the choral ensemble just adds to the drama. This Otello may be Kaufmann\u2019s showcase, but it\u2019s Pappano who really makes it sing.</p> <h2>This week\u2019s other pick&nbsp;</h2> <p>Other top-rank tenors are available. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-e4bAtsz0\">Vincer\u00f2!</a>, <strong><a href=\"http://piotrbeczala.com/\">Piotr Becza\u0142a</a></strong>\u2019s new disc with the <a href=\"https://www.lesarts.com/en/palaudelesarts/orquestradelacomuni/\">Orquestra de la Comunitat Valenciana</a> and conductor Marco Boemi, finds him with plenty of juice in the tank for a calling-card collection of Italian arias by Puccini and others.

  "<p>Six years ago, when James Scurlock asked his 16-year-old son James Reginald, AKA Juju Da Fu, aka Little James, to attend a rally in Omaha following the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Juju shrugged it off.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not into that,\u201d he told his dad. \u201cWhen I get older, maybe.\u201d</p> <p>But last November, everything changed.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cShe looks just like him,\u201d his older brother Nick Harden says. \u201cHella chill and always smiling.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Her name is Jewels, and she\u2019s seven months old. Juju once jokingly said he wanted 18 kids, but now, with his daughter cradled in his arms, he was wholly absorbed by just the one. Suddenly the world seemed bigger, the future longer, the politics more personal.</p> <p>\u201cHe started worrying more about what was going on in the world today,\u201d his father says. \u201cI think it started to weigh in on him like, <em>whoa, this is really what\u2019s out here? </em>He was like, \u2018Dad, I\u2019m gonna have to have the black talk with her, huh?\u201d</p> <p>Juju hired on with the landfill in nearby Bennington, Nebraska, but his dreams \u2013 bigger than he\u2019d dreamed before \u2013 lay on the horizon. He planned to earn his commercial driver\u2019s license through Omaha\u2019s Metro Community College. Maybe follow in his brother\u2019s footsteps and become a tattoo artist, too. Maybe go to business school. Maybe chase the heels of his idol <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Gates\">Kevin Gates</a>, spinning his lyrics into the next great rap album.&nbsp;</p> <p>And when the country erupted in protest over the death of George Floyd, Juju paid attention. Like his father after the beating of Rodney King by police in Los Angeles, Juju was beginning to wake up. When Omahans protested for the second night in a row, Juju was determined to participate, and on Saturday afternoon, he and his sister attended a peaceful gathering at 72nd and Dodge.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>He was like, \u2018Dad, I\u2019m gonna have to have the black talk with her, huh?'</p> <footer> <cite>James Scurlock's father</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His sister eventually left, but when night fell and the crowd moved downtown, Juju followed. He met up with several cousins and a few more friends, and when they hit the historic Old Market, they scattered. <a href=\"https://www.omaha.com/news/crime/no-charges-will-be-filed-against-omaha-bar-owner-who-fatally-shot-protester-don-kleine/article_8e71702d-d5bf-544e-9fac-26108ac81a24.html#5\">Video obtained by the Omaha World Herald</a> reportedly shows Juju and another individual entering RDG Planning and Design, an architecture firm, through an already shattered window around 10.15pm. They destroy several computer monitors, a desk phone, some drywall, lift their facemasks and move on.</p> <p>\u201cHe was probably in the heat of the moment,\u201d Harden says. \u201cFelt some type of power fighting for what he believes in.\u201d</p> <p>Roughly 40 minutes later, grainy surveillance video shows Juju and another individual approach two adjacent bars called The Hive and The Gatsby, both owned by 38-year-old Jake Gardner, a self-declared \u201clibertarian ex-marine\u201d who, earlier that day, wrote on Facebook: \u201cJust when you think, \u2018what else could 2020 throw at me?\u2019 Then you have to pull 48 hours of military style firewatch.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Gardner has a <a href=\"https://www.omaha.com/news/crime/omaha-bar-owner-could-still-be-charged-with-concealed-carry-permit-violation/article_c9fafdd1-8e7b-51b5-994b-5b1ba1916546.html\">checkered history</a> with law enforcement. In 1997, aged 17, he faced a third-degree assault charge that was later transferred to juvenile court. In 2011, he was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving and carrying a concealed weapon. (The first charge was later dropped, and the second downgraded to \u201cdisturbing the peace\u201d.) In 2013, Gardner pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and theft of services after an altercation. The original charges included two counts of assault and battery and failure to inform an officer about a concealed handgun. And last year, he was issued a verbal warning by Nebraska\u2019s Liquor Control Commission after two separate reports of fighting at his bar.</p> <p>Gardner first sparked online controversy in Omaha in 2016 when he <a href=\"https://www.omaha.com/news/local/the-hive-owner-s-comments-on-transgender-people-bathrooms-spark-a-storm/article_ab33239d-3675-5263-bfbb-f9d58f5a7bf6.html\">posted</a> a message to Facebook suggesting transgender women shouldn\u2019t use the women\u2019s restroom unless they have their \u201cappendage\u201d removed. \u201cIt is well-known in the bar scene in Omaha that Jake Gardner is not a good person,\u201d says Derek Stephens, a local bartender who also participated in the Saturday night protest. Stephens says he came across as a racist, transphobic person. \u201cThere\u2019s a large, large, large group of us that do not like him and disdain him and we do not frequent his business and we try to persuade people to not go there.\u201d</p> <p>Back at the scene, Gardner now stood with his father David on the sidewalk outside his bars. Both were armed, though Gardner\u2019s concealed carry permit had expired.&nbsp;</p> <p>David can be seen in one video twice shoving a member of Juju\u2019s group, after which David is pushed to the ground. Moments later, with Juju and another man approaching, Jake Gardner lifts his shirt to reveal the handgun in his waistband, then draws the weapon to his side.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe mood of the situation changed instantly,\u201d says 40-year-old Robert Fuller, a bystander who briefly tried to break up the confrontation. Around the same time, he says, David also drew out his gun, further escalating the situation.&nbsp;</p> <p>A man and woman then tackle Gardner, still brandishing his weapon, in an apparent attempt to restrain him. They land together in a puddle of water beside some construction equipment, after which Gardner fires two shots. All but his father and Juju, who previously appeared to be in a standoff, flee the area</p> <p>Four seconds later, as Gardner attempts to stand from the puddle, Juju jumps on his back \u201cto try to prevent another shot\u201d, Fuller says. Juju keeps Gardner in a headlock for roughly 20 seconds before Gardner fires one more time over his shoulder, hitting Juju in the neck.&nbsp;</p> <p>Juju died at the Nebraska medical center shortly after.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re talking about how it was self-defense, because Gardner was scared for his life,\u201d Fuller says. \u201cThey never once mentioned the fact that James was scared for his life. I was scared for my life. Everyone around us was scared for our lives. The only two people there with no reason to be scared for their lives were named Gardner.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Within 36 hours of the shooting, #jamesscurlock and #justiceforjamesscurlock were trending on Twitter alongside hashtags for George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. By the end of the week, <a href=\"https://www.ketv.com/article/volunteers-paint-murals-across-omaha-to-tribute-james-scurlock/32769417\">several large murals</a> had already been erected in Juju\u2019s honor, and community leaders were calling for a grand jury investigation.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be honest: James [Juju] is a hero to me,\u201d says Precious McKesson, president of the North Omaha Neighborhood Alliance. \u201cI feel after watching that video that James was stopping an active shooter.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday,<strong> </strong>the<strong> </strong>Douglas county attorney, Don Kleine, announced that he would support a grand jury investigation, though his own view of the shooting \u2013 that Gardner had acted in self-defense \u2013had not changed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a fucking dream, like a movie,\u201d Harden says. \u201cFrom the Trayvon Martin stuff to George Floyd all the way up, all the people in between, I would have never expected my brother.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e271f04afbc7c22460f39b381e8742cc0f1e40b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e271f04afbc7c22460f39b381e8742cc0f1e40b5/0_0_2400_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People march in Omaha after James Scurlock\u2019s death.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People march in Omaha after James Scurlock\u2019s death.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Reed/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just two years after Juju was born on 15 February 1998, his father \u201ccaught a felony case\u201d and landed in the Nebraska state penitentiary. \u201cInstead of letting my ex-wife Rajeanna struggle\u201d, he says, he sent Juju and his six other children to Denver to live with his mother. With his father incarcerated and his mother now enrolled with the Job Corps in Utah, Juju and his siblings hopped from one Denver suburb to the next with their grandmother, a registered nurse.</p> <p>Despite his scattered family, Juju kindled moments \u2013 rock wars in the backyard, live-action Mario Kart<em> </em>down the back alley, his stubborn refusal to wear a shirt or shoes<em> \u2013 </em>that still make his siblings howl with laughter today.</p> <p>\u201cWe just had a good time growing up,\u201d Harden says. \u201cOne time he thought he was gonna run back away to Omaha, and this guy loaded up a box of cereal and a gallon of milk in a stroller and went walking down the street like he was going home.\u201d</p> <p>Juju and his siblings stayed in Colorado for roughly seven years before his mother brought them back to Omaha, a still heavily segregated city of roughly half a million people.</p> <p>During the Great Migration, Omaha\u2019s meatpacking district \u2013 one of the largest in the world \u2013 lured thousands of African Americans from the south; the boll weevil beetle had decimated the cotton fields, leaving many without work, and Jim Crow laws prevented many from finding employment elsewhere. But decades of discriminatory housing policies ultimately fenced Omaha\u2019s burgeoning black community into a two-square-mile box north of downtown. Though it has produced an astonishing number of brilliant athletes and intellects \u2013 from Malcolm X to<a href=\"https://www.omaha.com/sports/th-glory-the-intersection-of-civil-rights-and-omaha-s/article_53f282e4-6aca-5601-af93-ffca8f7260c2.html\"> Bob Gibson</a>, arguably the greatest pitcher of all time \u2013 for such a small community, North Omaha today <a href=\"https://www.omaha.com/news/achievement-gap-still-tests-ops/article_1a93f175-1f77-5309-ae33-a7868450b2a7.html]%20[https://www.ibtimes.com/omaha-nebraska-most-dangerous-place-america-be-black-1548466\">struggles</a> with educational achievement gaps, high crime and drug rates, and other challenges tied to more than a century of white supremacy.&nbsp;</p> <p>And yet, because the state is overwhelmingly white, Nebraskans often have \u201ca false sense of normalcy, a false sense of peace, a false sense that these things don\u2019t really exist\u201d, says Preston Love Jr, a longtime community activist and adjunct professor in the Black studies department at the University of Nebraska-Omaha.</p> <p>Juju\u2019s father knows the disparities well, has protested them before, and is doing so now in the most painful of scenarios. But while Juju\u2019s life was far too short, he says, the time he spent was good, surrounded always by loved ones.</p> <p>In total, Juju would claim 22 siblings: full, step and half. Growing up, he and his younger sister Rajeanna, were inseparable, like \u201csiamese twins\u201d, says April Whiteman, Juju\u2019s stepmother. In the Scurlock extended universe, the genealogical technicalities don\u2019t count for much. It isn\u2019t that they never disagree, Harden says, or that it\u2019s always perfect. But they unite when it matters most. Cousins are brothers. Stepmothers are mothers. Aunts are mothers, too. When any one of them needs help, the others step in. And for Juju, that family meant everything. In Hebrew, he tattooed \u201cfather\u201d above one eye, \u201cmother\u201d above the other.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the big thing about Juju: he\u2019s always with some type of family,\u201d says his cousin Jamal Thompson. \u201cIf he wasn\u2019t with us, he was with his daughter. I\u2019ve never really seen him without one of his relatives.\u201d</p> <p>He was always high energy, with a laugh \u201clike lightning\u201d, his aunt says, and an uncanny ability to lift the mood of the entire room. \u201cHis personality is like the weather,\u201d his father says. \u201cOne minute you would think he\u2019s dead serious, and then you\u2019d get the biggest joke in the world.\u201d He loved a good prank. He used to hide stray dogs under the bed. Chickens too. Ducks from the neighborhood park. Despite Juju\u2019s often bold attempts at a rough exterior, his brother says, the numerous illustrations and murals trending online in the wake of his death reveal the bright spirit he truly was.</p> <p>\u201cI love seeing him in the pictures people have drawn \u2013 the cartoon pictures,\u201d he says. \u201cHe just looks like a nice kid. A big ol\u2019 smile.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"61261f7b7cffb7ad97d42d43c5259ba6cda26471\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61261f7b7cffb7ad97d42d43c5259ba6cda26471/0_0_2880_2004/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Scurlock II, Juju\u2019s father, salutes the crowd during a solidarity rally on 7 June 2020 in Omaha, Nebraska.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"696\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Scurlock II, Juju\u2019s father, salutes the crowd during a solidarity rally on 7 June 2020 in Omaha, Nebraska.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Z Long/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though Juju\u2019s parents had long been separated, they had never legally divorced. When the siblings slowly began to divide themselves between homes, Rajeanna moved them all to Norfolk, a much smaller community two hours north-west of Omaha. Juju was 16. They stayed for less than two years, but while there, Juju found himself one evening playing lookout for his brother and two much older men during a home invasion.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like when you start sports, and then you go to band, and you\u2019re just looking for your pack, you know?\u201d his father says. \u201cHe started hanging out with the wrong crowd for a little while, trying to find his place.

And though he abhorred formal writing, loathed his English classes, he often roused the party with spontaneous freestyle raps.</p> <p>\u201cThe lyrics are where it was really at, though, because he could break some shit down to you and piece it back together again,\u201d Harden says. \u201cHe beats on his chest or snaps his fingers and that\u2019s all he needs.\u201d</p> <p>In January 2019, Juju was charged with assault and battery and spent 23 days in the Douglas county jail. And earlier this spring, he served 57 more for third-degree domestic assault. He pleaded guilty to both \u2013 \u201cyou did it, you own,\u201d his father taught him \u2013 and he spent the bulk of both stints penning lyrics and letters to his friends. Upon his release last month, he told his family: \u201cJust call me Juju, but don\u2019t call me Da Fu no more, because I\u2019m not that person.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe just got influenced by the streets, so he started getting into some bad habits \u2026 But he wasn\u2019t a <em>criminal</em> criminal,\u201d Harden says. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t out there just looking for something to do. That\u2019s why it hurt so much, because he really was trying to get something started for himself.\u201d</p> <p>Juju always had that natural rhythm, had always been musical, but his time in prison helped him find his voice, his family says. He hadn\u2019t recorded professionally \u2013 not yet. But he dreamed about it. He grew up listening to his own father\u2019s album, to Biggie and Tupac and Public Enemy. \u201cYou could always catch him listening to whoever was the hardest rapper telling the truth,\u201d his father says. He loved Kodak Black. He loved NBA Youngboy. But no one rapping today enthralled him half so much as Kevin Gates, especially the song Great Man:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Look in the mirror (ay)</em></p> <p><em>And I see a great man (when I)</em></p> <p><em>Look in the mirror (oh, ay, oh)</em></p> <p><em>I see a great man</em></p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cMusic was the way that Juju talked,\u201d says Diamond Davis, a close friend who lived with Juju and his family for several years. \u201cHe was never recorded, but he\u2019ll rap for the family. And in one of his raps, he said, \u2018I\u2019m gonna die a legend.\u2019 And my best friend died a legend.\u201d</p>",

It spurred more than two weeks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/09/george-floyd-killing-triggers-wave-of-activism-around-the-world\">of worldwide protests</a>.</p> <p>From 1882 to 1986, Congress failed to pass anti-lynching legislation 200 times, but this moment appeared to be different.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/cory-booker\">Cory Booker</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/13/tim-scott-senate-floor-speech-racism-police-shootings\">Tim Scott</a>, the only three African American members of the Senate, led the unanimous passage of the legislation in that chamber in 2018 and 2019. The House of Representatives then <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/us/politics/anti-lynching-bill.html\">passed it by a 410-4 vote</a> in February but renamed it for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/emmett-till-long-wait-for-justice\">Emmett Till</a>, a 14-year-old boy lynched in Mississippi in 1955.</p> <p>That was the only change that returned the bill to the Senate, which makes Paul\u2019s sudden objection all the more idiosyncratic.</p> <p>The Democratic congressman Bobby Rush, who proposed the House legislation, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepBobbyRush/status/1267988133477564417?s=20\">tweeted</a>: \u201cThe language of the Emmett Till Antilynching Act is IDENTICAL to the bill that was unanimously approved by the Senate. The only conclusion I can draw from Rand Paul\u2019s sudden opposition is he has an issue with the House bill being named after Emmett Till.\u201d</p> <p>But Paul, a licensed doctor, is notorious for rousing colleagues\u2019 ire by stalling legislation and for a life and career that are seldom conventional.</p> <p>In 2017 he was physically assaulted by a neighbour while mowing his lawn; in 2018 he visited Russia and delivered a letter from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin\">Vladimir Putin</a>; earlier this year he became the first senator to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-rand-paul-senator-tests-positive-covid-19\">test positive</a> for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a>, shortly after being the only one to vote against a bipartisan $8bn deal to provide emergency coronavirus funding.</p> <p>He now argues that the anti-lynching legislation is drafted too broadly and could define minor assaults as lynching.</p> <p>\u201cThe bill as written would allow altercations resulting in a cut, abrasion, bruise, or any other injury no matter how temporary to be subject to a 10-year penalty,\u201d Paul said. \u201cMy amendment would simply apply a serious bodily injury standard, which would ensure crimes resulting in substantial risk of death and extreme physical pain be prosecuted as a&nbsp;lynching.\u201d</p> <p>He has previously worked with Democrats in pushing for criminal justice reform and taken a more progressive stance than many Republican colleagues.</p> <p>On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://hosted.ap.org/reformer/article/72d611401f3306ac4c058a68ebba83fb/sen-rand-paul-kentucky-strong-words-about-floyds-death\">the Associated Press reported</a>, while speaking with activists in Louisville in his home state of Kentucky, Paul criticised no-knock search warrants, such as the one used at the home of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Breonna Taylor</a>, who was shot dead by police in March, and the militarisation of police departments. And he said he is likely to support some form of federal legislation aimed at overhauling police procedures.</p> <p>Challenged about his opposition to the bill, Paul called lynchings a \u201chorror\u201d of American history and said he supports the bill, the AP added, but reiterated that its language is too broad.</p> <p>Last Thursday, as Floyd was mourned at a memorial service in Minneapolis, Paul proposed an amendment to the bill, which would require a vote of the full Senate and would send the bill back to the House \u2013 currently out of session \u2013 for additional consideration.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/politics/rand-paul-anti-lynching-bill-senate.html\">The amendment was defeated</a> after emotions ran high on the Senate floor. Booker, of New Jersey, said: \u201cOne man, one man is standing in the way of the law of the land changing because of a difference of interpretation. Does America need a win today on racial justice?\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/501652-kamala-harris-insulting-rand-paul-held-up-anti-lynching-bill-on-day-of-george\">Appearing on The View</a> on the ABC network, Harris described the senator\u2019s contrarian stance as \u201cinsulting\u201d, adding: \u201cWhat Rand Paul is doing, which is one man holding up what would be a historic bill recognising one of the great sins of America \u2013 and it was on the day of George Floyd\u2019s funeral which just added insult to injury and frankly made it so painful that on that day that\u2019s what was happening.\u201d</p> <p>Although Paul is often an outlier, there are fears that the holdup could be indicative of wider Republican reluctance to tackle systemic racism in the police and embrace reforms. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/moevela?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Moe Vela</a>, a former senior adviser to Joe Biden, said on Wednesday: \u201cMy thoughts on it are very simple: birds of a feather.</p> <p>\u201cIf Rand Paul somehow doesn\u2019t believe we need an anti-lynching bill in the United States and his Republican colleagues can\u2019t get him to release the hold, to me it says everything Americans need to know about the Republican party. Either you\u2019re for lynching or you\u2019re against lynching. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d </p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.tarasetmayer.com/\">Tara Setmayer</a>, a political commentator and former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, was less critical, noting the consistency of Paul\u2019s libertarian streak.</p> <p>\u201cI understand that he wants to strengthen the bill with certain language as an amendment,\u201d she said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want it to go away. He wants it to be strengthened from his perspective.</p> <p>\u201cBut I think it\u2019s a bit out of step with the political climate that we\u2019re in \u2026 So he\u2019s going to get the backlash, but <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/tim-scott-says-he-wants-to-team-up-with-rand-paul-on-anti-lynching-bill\">Senator Tim Scott said</a> he\u2019s going to talk to him and see if they can work something out in the language.

  "<p>Sometimes it takes a bootleg T-shirt to stop a bootleg T-shirt. For years, the military, the police and white supremacists have displayed the skull symbol of Marvel\u2019s comic-book outlaw the Punisher on unauthorised clothes, bumper stickers and spray-paint stencils. But, as Black Lives Matter protests around the world draw attention to institutionalised racism, Gerry Conway, the Punisher\u2019s politically progressive co-creator and writer, is launching an unusual fundraiser: <a href=\"https://www.customink.com/fundraising/black-lives-matter-skulls-for-justice-presented-by-gerry-conway\">his own line of shirts designed by people of colour</a> to take the symbol back from the right, with proceeds to go to Black Lives Matter.</p> <p>\u201c[The skull] should be a symbol for Black Lives Matter,\u201d Conway says. \u201cIt should be a symbol for people on the outside of the justice system.

website Viagogo, piling more misery on a deal signed weeks before coronavirus brought live theatre, music and sport to a halt.</p> <p>The Competition and Markets Authority said it feared a combination of two firms who share 80% of the ticket resale market would drive up prices and reduce choice for consumers.</p> <p>It has given Viagogo five days to propose \u201cclear-cut\u201d measures to allay its concerns, or it will move to an in-depth phase two investigation, an escalation that could result in the deal being blocked.</p> <p>The $4bn deal brought together two businesses that have faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/mar/19/mps-call-for-viagogo-boycott-ticket-touting-laws-dcms\">outcry from MPs</a>, campaigners and the public for their business practices, which include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/15/shady-world-of-the-ticket-touts\">forging alliances with powerful ticket touts</a>.</p> <p>While both have avoided serious sanction in the UK, the CMA\u2019s intervention adds to the pressure on two firms that have been rocked by the impact on live events of Covid-19.</p> <p>Viagogo\u2019s founder and boss, Eric Baker, said in February he believed the virus was isolated to Asia.</p> <p>The spread of the pandemic since then has meant the takeover, partly funded by the Walton family behind Walmart, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/noahkirsch/2020/05/27/worst-deal-ever/#b63606288d11\">has been labelled the \u201cworst deal ever\u201d</a> by Forbes magazine.</p> <p>StubHub, which leads the US market, is thought to be in financial difficulty due to the pandemic and has faced criticism for withholding refunds from fans who have bought tickets for cancelled events, offering them credit instead.</p> <p>The two firms are by far the leading players in ticket resale in the UK, the key factor in triggering the CMA investigation, but they have also fallen foul of the regulator before.</p> <p>The CMA has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jul/18/competition-watchdog-warns-viagogo-court-action-will-continue\">previously threatened</a> Viagogo with legal action for

the pop star barred entry to his gigs to fans who had bought through the company.</p> <p>The firm filed a claim in Germany shortly before it was due to be grilled about its behaviour by MPs on the culture select committee and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/05/viagogo-refusal-speak-mps-in-house-commons-gross-discourtesy\">said the legal proceedings meant it could no

accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/jan/29/stubhub-misleading-online-ticket-buyers-says-regulator-cma\">misleading ticket buyers</a>, while the Guardian revealed earlier this year that the company was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/13/football-tickets-being-resold-on-stubhub-at-huge-profit-full-scale\">selling millions of pounds of tickets to football matches</a>, even though resale of a football ticket is illegal in England.</p> <p>However, the CMA\u2019s investigation relates only to the extent to which the $4bn takeover would affect competition.</p> <p>Viagogo said: \u201cAs we have throughout this process, we will continue to work diligently with the CMA during their review&nbsp;of the transaction.</p> <p>\u201cWe remain committed to our belief that the combination of the two companies is a good move for customers worldwide.\u201d</p> <p>FanFair Alliance, a campaign group backed by music industry figures including the managers of PJ Harvey and Little Mix, said Viagogo\u2019s record meant it should not be allowed to gain even more power over the ticket market.</p> <p>\u201cViagogo remains a highly controversial business,\u201d said spokesman Adam Webb.</p> <p>\u201cThe company has widely flouted consumer protection law in the UK, and remains under investigation&nbsp;in numerous other countries.</p>

  "<h2><strong>Clara Amfo, radio DJ and television presenter</strong></h2> <p>When I gave my speech about racism and George Floyd last week on Radio 1, it was something I had been wanting to say my whole life. I have never felt more myself than I did in that moment. I felt empowered. I\u2019ve been overwhelmed by the messages I\u2019ve received since. I\u2019m proud of people\u2019s humility and willingness to learn.</p> <p>The day before, I called my producer and said: \u201cI cannot come into work today.\u201d I simply could not face it. When you see black bodies disrespected the world over, you take it in. You carry it with you. It affects your mentally. </p> <p>Some people ask: \u201cWhy are you so upset about something that\u2019s happening in America?\u201d First, the UK has a history of racism. And second, the black experience is like being on the same team, like we\u2019re wearing the same football strip. I am connected to other black people. If they suffer, I suffer.</p> <p>We are going through a period of transformation right now. It is uncomfortable, but I welcome the discomfort. The racist ideology I want us to fight seeps into every aspect of our lives. It has to be dismantled. </p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/08/kele-okereke-2042-review-kola-records\">Kele Okereke</a>, musician</strong></h2> <p>As a black person you have to insulate yourself from the images of violence you see because they are too disturbing and too frequent. I thought there would be reform after Michael Brown or Alton Sterling or Philando Castile. My cousin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/apr/29/race.ukcrime\">Christopher Alaneme</a>, was stabbed to death after being racially abused in 2006 when he was 18. But then nothing changes and you have to build up a wall to protect yourself, so you don\u2019t have to deal with something that\u2019s heartbreaking all the time.</p> <p>It has been really encouraging to watch the Defund Police movement gaining traction in the US. People think that the police in the UK aren\u2019t as bad because they don\u2019t carry guns. But they still carry tasers, and taser use has increased <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/27/police-in-england-and-wales-to-be-given-more-tasers-in-10m-rollout\">in recent years</a>. If we have more police with tasers, it is only going to mean more black men being hurt, maimed, injured, possibly paralysed. </p> <p>It has been inspiring to see so many young people from all walks of life on these marches saying: \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d That\u2019s exciting. If we remain engaged, we have every chance of changing things.

We have arrived at a place in the UK where we\u2019ve had a series of inquiries, reviews, reports, and now the cry is for action. Action on the curriculum: a reckoning with Britain\u2019s past, with our colonial heritage. Action on inequalities in employment, in housing.

However, it was also clear that they were using their privilege to challenge the memorialising of someone who murdered so many.</p> <p>In recent years we have seen the rise of populism. Figures such as Donald Trump, Nigel Farage and some of the rhetoric from Boris Johnson have fed into a narrative of hate. But much of the public has had enough of that. That rhetoric is being called out and seen for what it is: shallow and skin deep. Millennials and Gen Z in particular have had enough. They want to get their hands on the levers of power. It is heartening to me, but I don\u2019t want to speak too soon.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/06/people-ask-me-how-they-can-support-black-lives-matter-at-the-moment-all-i-can-feel-is-sadness-and-grief\">Candice Carty-Williams</a>, author&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Last week was horrible. I felt paralysed by sadness the whole time. I was so exhausted. But it also just felt like a more intense version of my normal life. I remember watching a news report about Philando Castile in 2016; I was in tears. White people walked past me, saw I was crying and carried on moving. Black people have been experiencing this pain their whole lives. Now white people are forced to see it, and it\u2019s uncomfortable for them. That\u2019s good.

Your voice is a powerful thing. You should speak out on the things that aren\u2019t right. Whether your platform is 10,000 people or one person, it\u2019s still a platform. Don\u2019t distance yourself from the struggle for fear of not knowing the right thing to say. Go away, do the reading, educate yourself and then say something.&nbsp;Change has to come from the people because our government won\u2019t do anything. </p> <h2><strong>Baroness Valerie Amos, Labour peer and director of S</strong><strong>oas University of London</strong></h2> <p>We have had report after report, which shows the depth and impact of racism in Britain. We have a massive education attainment gap, significant underachievement in schools, a lack of employment opportunities and a disproportionate number of black men in British jails. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/may/16/its-time-for-universities-to-make-race-equality-a-priority\">Only 0.6% of university professors are black</a>. Really, how much more evidence do we need that racism in the UK is real?</p> <p>We need to stop writing reports and actually start tackling it at the root,&nbsp;because issuing national guidelines isn\u2019t working. We need to be more specific than that.&nbsp;There is so much concern about sentencing and the number of black men in jail; let\u2019s look at the sentencing record of every single judge. How have they treated people going through the criminal justice system? Let\u2019s look at our police officers, at individual forces; what is the pattern we are seeing, and how can we shift that? </p> <p>I know how hard it is to bring about change. People often look at the statistics around Soas and think we look good compared with other institutions in the sector. But as far as I am concerned, those figures aren\u2019t good enough. And besides, figures don\u2019t tell you anything about the culture of an organisation. You need to dig beneath the figures and find out what people\u2019s real experiences are. You can\u2019t be frightened of that.</p> <h2><strong>Leomie Anderson, model and entrepreneur</strong></h2> <p>Right now, we are going through our generation\u2019s civil rights movement. It is a huge awakening for a lot of people and it has needed to happen for a very long time. Injustice does exist. White privilege does exist. &nbsp;</p> <p>When I started out as a model, people would tell me that black girls don\u2019t sell magazines. I was hearing that kind of racism from the age of 14. Even now, I know for a fact that I do jobs where I get paid less than my white counterparts.&nbsp;</p> <p>A lot of people are looking to black people right now and asking them: how can things change, how do we fix this? But black people have been having those conversations with white people for decades. Clearly, black people explaining what white people are doing wrong isn\u2019t working because white people get defensive. They say: \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything racist.\u201d They don\u2019t see that as long as you are a white person who has benefited from the systematic oppression of black people, you are part of the problem. I implore those white people to educate themselves, understand that white supremacy is real and people of colour are oppressed.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/28/if-we-did-nothing-we-would-be-killed-on-the-streets-benjamin-zephaniah-on-fighting-the-far-right\">Benjamin Zephaniah</a>, poet, musician and writer</strong></h2> <p>There is a part of me that thinks something has to change this time. But I thought that when Stephen Lawrence died. I thought that with Windrush. I have thought that so many times. Something awful happens and what the system does is it gets an inquiry going, it writes a report, releases its findings and then the public just forgets about it. Or the anger dissipates. But there is something different now about what\u2019s happening around the world. </p> <p>Probably the only thing that gives me hope is that it is young white people saying: \u201cEnough.\u201d When the statue of Colston came down, it was white people taking it down. This is their ancestor. White people are looking at their history and realising it\u2019s messed up.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Laura Mvula, musician</strong></h2> <p>Right now, I am in the countryside. It is interesting to be physically far from the protests, but to feel so connected to the black community on the most profound level. Being out here, I have had a lot of time to reflect: the ground is moving beneath us, we are seeing shackles being broken and I am channelling that struggle into music.&nbsp;</p> <p>I was speaking to my mum on FaceTime yesterday, just catching up, and she abruptly broke down into tears. She felt so overwhelmed and so heavy with the weight of what is happening in the world right now. It feels like we are moving through a major upheaval. Of course, it is not the first revolution and it doesn\u2019t feel like the last. But it feels like we are finally getting to where we need to be, to where we should have been centuries ago.</p> <p>We\u2019re shifting the deadly disease of racism.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/yomi-adegoke\">Yomi Adegoke</a>, journalist and author</strong></h2> <p>Like many black journalists covering race and racism, I have learned over the years to manage my expectations when it comes to \u201cchange\u201d. </p> <p>Society speaks of monumental change as if the more we say it, the more likely it is that it will happen. Each time an uprising takes place after an incident like this, there is a sense of hope that is undoubtedly paired with a creeping feeling of deja vu. The scenes of people nimbly dodging teargas explosions, of rubber bullets ricocheting off buildings as sprawling crowds march with fists and signs raised: they inspire, but also make us question what comes next. Already, politicians talk of thuggery and criminals, discussing protesters in these terms as opposed to the police being guilty of killing innocent people.&nbsp;</p> <p>But then something does undeniably feel different. When the statue of the slaver Colston was pushed into a watery grave in Bristol, I feared it would only be a symbol of poetic justice. But then came the announcement that the area\u2019s flagship music venue, Colston Hall, would be renamed and a statue of a slave trader in east London taken down. </p> <p>Navigating this period feels like a constant balancing act, walking a tightrope between optimism and cynicism; tenaciousness and tentativeness; Martin Luther King\u2019s dream and the nightmare that we have known all our lives. Now is a time of restrained hope, but hope all the same.&nbsp;<br></p> <h2><strong>Kwame Kwei-Armah, </strong><strong>artistic director of the Young Vic</strong></h2> <p>This is my fourth cycle of civic uprisings. I have seen so much: the Southall riots, the first Brixton riot and the Tottenham uprisings. It would be churlish of me to say there hasn\u2019t been progress. There has been.

So there has been progress. But when my 15-year-old son asks: \u201cDad, can I go to the march?\u201d I feel sadness. I look at him and think: wow, my generation has not fixed things. We can only ask for structural change. We have to look at the mechanisms of power, from our FTSE 500 boards to our front benches, and do an audit. We need to look at access for those communities whose forebears would once have been sold.&nbsp;</p> <p>I think about racism in Britain, and America. To me, the difference is that racism in America is direct, loud racism. The racism inherent in how the American police treat black people is easy to point out, and hard to deny. But the racism that we saw in Central Park, with Amy Cooper [who called the police on a black birdwatcher], is more akin to British racism. It\u2019s insidious; it\u2019s deniable. That\u2019s the racism that we in black Britain face on a daily basis. The insidious world of micro-aggressions.&nbsp;White supremacy is a constantly evolving beast. How does this entity continue to articulate itself, year after year? It adapts itself to keep a disparity alive. Even when white supremacy loses arms and legs, it somehow morphs itself into a different thing. We need to dismantle white supremacy entirely. White people need to recognise that they are a global minority wielding disproportionate power and give some of it away.</p>",

As Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s PR executive Helen heads home early, having just been fired, she rushes for the train and the doors are on the point of closing; in one reality she\u2019s too late, but in the other reality she scrambles aboard, chats to nice John Hannah and gets home to find her creep of a fiance in bed with someone else. (The delay involved in missing the train, in the other universe, meant Helen didn\u2019t return in time to find him <em>in flagrante</em>.) Devastated, Helen breaks off the engagement and throws her ring into the Thames from Albert Bridge. The river is a potent and mysterious symbol of time and chance surging heedlessly onwards.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>8. Fires Were Started (1943)</strong></h2> <p>Humphrey Jennings\u2019 Fires Were Started is a docu-drama classic about firefighters in the second world war, using nonprofessionals. The drama follows the story of a new recruit joining the crew at the most dangerous time. The substation covers the area of Alderman\u2019s Wharf in the docks, where a munitions ship on the Thames is being loaded, vital for the war effort.&nbsp;During a terrifying air raid, a warehouse is set ablaze, and a fireboat is despatched on the Thames. One firefighter is to lose his life; Jennings sombrely juxtaposes his funeral with a shot of the ammunition ship steaming down the Thames. The battle against the Nazis goes on in London and the Thames is a dramatic arena for this battle.</p> <h2><strong>7. Shakespeare in Love (1998)</strong></h2> <p>The feelgood romantic fantasy has Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) falling in love with a young woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) who is pretending to be a boy to bypass regulations about women acting on stage. The London riverside locations of the Globe theatre and Hampton Court Palace give the Thames an important role.&nbsp;Boatmen here seem like both our loquacious London cabbies and wannabe-screenwriter Los Angeles drivers. One ferries Shakespeare across the river while saying: \u201cI had Christopher Marlowe in my boat once.\u201d Others have a habit of handing their theatrical passengers plays they have written.</p> <h2><strong>6.

And, of course, there is only one thing to be done withit: use it and/or throw it away \u2013&nbsp;in the Thames, London\u2019s secret and age-old crime depository.

The World Is Not Enough (1999)</strong></h2> <p>The MI6 building at Vauxhall Cross overlooking the river gives James Bond some exciting Thames moments in his corking speedboat chase at the beginning of The World Is Not Enough. In it, 007 launches his rocket-powered hi-tech craft from the SIS HQ,&nbsp;with Q petulantly complaining in his wake that it isn\u2019t ready. He then powers past Parliament, through Docklands and all the way down to the Millennium Dome (as the O2 Arena was then known). In so doing he provides an inadvertent river tour of how east and south London was being redeveloped in the late 90s. Pierce Brosnan keeps getting soaked in yucky Thames water before miraculously appearing groomed and dry in the next shot.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>4.

Julien takes Walcott\u2019s character Archille and morphs him into a young black British figure, played by the St Lucian classical tenor Hansil Jules, who is searching for orientation in a British environment. Julien\u2019s film alludes indirectly to the Windrush experience of an ocean crossing and then the Thames journey into the treacherous and elusive Britain, via Tilbury docks \u2013&nbsp;symbolised in a scene of Walcott and Jules gazing out on to the Atlantic and then a shot of the Thames itself.</p> <h2><strong>3. Close My Eyes (1991)</strong></h2> <p>Clive Owen plays a young guy, troubled by his sexual attraction to his sister (Saskia Reeves), who is married to a wealthy City trader (Alan Rickman). The early scenes between Owen and Reeves are filmed at the then burgeoning London Docklands, where Owen\u2019s character is working as an environmental analyst. Later, we go to Rickman\u2019s lavish home in Henley-on-Thames. The river in the early part of the film is a commercial waterway, the backdrop to growing wealth; by the end, it feels like a teeming delta in the middle of an unbuilt landscape at the end of the world, just about to burst its banks with passion.&nbsp;</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gWjZpkkkIs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0gWjZpkkkIs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2><strong>2. Frenzy (1972)</strong></h2> <p>The opening of Hitchcock\u2019s film is a travelogue-style flight along the Thames, past Tower Bridge and ending with the old County Hall building, well before the London Eye was even thought of. But, in a way, Hitchcock gave us the more bizarre Thames movie-moment with his trailer for the film, which showed us a dummy Hitchcock floating in the Thames; then we cut to a close-up of his great jowly face as he drawls: \u201cI dare say you are wondering why I am floating around London like this. I\u2019m on the famous Thames river, investigating a murder. Rivers can be very sinister places and in my new film,&nbsp;Frenzy, this river, you may say, was the scene of a very horrible murder \u2026\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"517fcb183089c35eaba5e3d41ba1f7d7bd7aef1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/517fcb183089c35eaba5e3d41ba1f7d7bd7aef1d/0_15_1780_1068/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Hoskins in The Long Good Friday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lovely day out on the river: Bob Hoskins in The Long Good Friday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Handmade Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>1. The Long Good Friday (1980)</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/18/gangsters-then-bankers-the-long-good-friday-foretold-the-future-thatcherism-londons-docklands\">First the gangsters, then the bankers: how The Long Good Friday foretold the future</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This British crime classic, from screenwriter Barrie Keeffe and director John Mackenzie, is a vivid history lesson in the Thames itself, the site of shady dealings and adventures, a place to get rich \u2013&nbsp;or drowned. Bob Hoskins stars as an ambitious London mobster, Harold Shand, with his smart, glamorous new wife Victoria (Helen Mirren), who is out of his league socially. At the dawn of the Thatcherite age, he has big dreams of redeveloping the London Docklands with cash provided by the American mafia and, to facilitate this, he stages a riverboat party for the visiting US gangsters, setting off from the then modish St Katharine Docks, cruising past Tower Bridge and the West India Docks to the vast, empty, financially fertile stretches beyond: \u201cMile after mile and acre after acre of land!\u201d as Shand excitedly puts it. Hoisting a glass of champagne, he gives a pompous speech about being a Londoner, and the fact that this party is a day of \u201cgreat historical significance for London\u201d. With 40 years\u2019 hindsight we can see that he is right. The images of the Thames and the city are of historical significance, as they show London on the point of changing. Harold is shown talking to his criminal associate in the blank, empty site of Royal Albert Dock on the Thames \u2013 now the site of London City airport and totally changed. The river scenes show something very different to the glamour and excitement of so many other movies: here, the Thames is cold, grey and threatening.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br></p>",

It was a game that had everything, except a crowd that would have lapped up the drama played out on the field. Much was expected of this match - the first of the rebooted 2020 AFL premiership season - and though it wasn\u2019t a classic in terms of quality, it was a tense encounter that ebbed and flowed from start to finish.</p> <p>Collingwood jumped out of the blocks to establish a four-goal lead at quarter time, dominating stoppages and moving the ball with ease. But from then on it was a case of holding off the surging Tigers. Richmond had most of the play for the final three quarters, and it\u2019s a credit to Collingwood\u2019s defensive structure that they managed to force a stalemate despite scoring just one goal in the final three quarters - and none since halfway through the second term.</p> <p>Brodie Grundy was influential in ruck for Collingwood, with Scott Pendlebury (31 disposals) and Steele Sidebottom (27) finding plenty of ball. Dustin Martin grew in stature as the game progressed while Tom Lynch topped the scorers\u2019 list with three majors. Despite Grundy\u2019s dominance, though, Richmond led the way in clearances and this was reflected in an inside-50 count of 43-32 that will leave them wondering what might have been.</p> <p>This was just the second draw between these two teams, and the first since 1917. It was the kind of result that nobody saw coming, but in a year like no other should surprise no one. Thanks for your company. Isn\u2019t it great to have AFL footy back? Be sure to return for our liveblog of tomorrow night\u2019s Geelong-Hawthorn clash.

That was three goals to one in the second term for Richmond - all from the boot of Lynch - but it\u2019s still Collingwood who hold sway. Grundy is giving his runners plenty of opportunity, with Sidebottom helping himself to a goal and 20 touches - seven more than the next best. So a late flurry from the Tigers, but Collingwood are still on top. The Pies are winning the stoppages and defending well, even if they did lose that quarter. But 14 points is nothing in the modern game.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kongekrabbe87/status/1271030209165365248\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">- Worse places in the world to listen to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AFLPiesTigers?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AFLPiesTigers</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FirstGameBack?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FirstGameBack</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FootyIsBack?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FootyIsBack</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AFL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AFL</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/JVBgINuehM\">pic.twitter.com/JVBgINuehM</a></p>&mdash; J.D.

Stellar work from your good self. Four hours of power. So good in fact that if there wasn\u2019t a match to cover, I\u2019d be tempted to shut the whole thing done now, safe in the knowledge the Guardian faithful got their fill.</p> <p>But there is a match to cover. Oh yes there is. And befitting the AFL\u2019s return after an 11-plus week sabbatical, it\u2019s a rather large one. Richmond v Collingwood. The MCG. Night footy. I saw the contest described today (on a rather reputable website) as a \u2018monster blockbuster\u2019, which not only made me chuckle but got me wondering if there are indeed degrees of \u2018blockbuster\u2019.</p> <p>Is it possible to have a \u2018mild blockbuster\u2019? Have we ever witnessed a \u2018friggin\u2019 epic blockbuster\u2019? Is the zenith, perhaps inevitably by definition, a \u2018blockbuster blockbuster\u2019? If such a list exists, if someone has gone to the trouble of classifying these things, I\u2019d like to know. And I\u2019d like to put it to work. Because I just don\u2019t think the term \u2018blockbuster\u2019 is used enough in sport.</p> <p>But to the nitty gritty of tonight\u2019s game. No Mason Cox for Collingwood. There goes the US audience. No Josh Caddy for Richmond. There goes the golfing audience. Who\u2019ll win? Both teams should be there when the whips are cracking in December, when likely the night grand final in Launceston will be played. Richmond are the better side, but this whole affair is just so weird that it makes perfect sense to tip the roughies. And this is the kind of game Collingwood win. So the Pies for me.</p> <p>Looking forward to your company tonight.

That includes footy. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic the season will restart with a revised schedule in largely empty venues with players and staff adhering to strict biosecurity protocols. Because of the global response to the death of George Floyd, Collingwood come into tonight\u2019s fixture fending off scrutiny of their treatment of H\u00e9ritier Lumumba.

  "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s tough starting from the bottom and trying to work your way up,\u201d says illustrator Chris Martin. The 22-year-old from Milnthorpe in Cumbria is passionate about illustration, but also wants to stay true to his ideals about the type of work he aims to produce, rooted in skate culture. \u201cThe prospect of having my work published nationally felt so distant,\u201d he says. But Chris\u2019s work, along with that of seven other young creatives, will appear next Saturday, 27 June, in a supplement published with The Guardian.</p> <p>Your Voice. Your Way is being created by young people aged between 18 and 25 from across Britain who feel strongly that they and their contemporaries need to be heard when it comes to shaping the future. \u201cI am driven to uncover how our world is steered,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/toe_rag/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chris</a>. \u201cAnd how, not just as creatives, but as people, we can change it.\u201d Commissioned by Levi\u2019s and The Guardian Labs team, the magazine aims to give a platform to the unheard, and amplify their voices.</p> <p>\u201cTheir generation has what I\u2019d call a positive stubbornness,\u201d says Jason Kyriacou, the UK marketing and experience director for Levi\u2019s. \u201cAn uncompromising attitude to what they believe in and the courage to act on it.\u201d</p> <p>Now, that attitude is needed more than ever. When The Guardian Labs and Levi\u2019s started recruiting for the project, in the first months of 2020, issues surrounding climate change, shifting identities and inclusiveness came up in nearly every application. What gave the project even more urgency was the outbreak of Covid-19.</p> <p>Suddenly the future was ever more uncertain, and the assembled contributors \u2013 all with little or no media experience \u2013 had to adjust to working on the project remotely and contacting their mentors from The Guardian Labs using video meetings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb5e00a1f5040e824b16f7f7bc3f184d20015397\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb5e00a1f5040e824b16f7f7bc3f184d20015397/0_0_2000_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fanny Beckman, Anna Marshall, Ayat Mohamed and Chris Martin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fanny Beckman, Anna Marshall, Ayat Mohamed and Chris Martin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Google Hangouts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Writer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kiera_moran/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kiera Moran</a>, 24, has had the unusual experience of self-isolating before, and writes about the experience of seeing her five-year-old son through cancer.

The Guardian Labs and Levi\u2019s were happy to turn over creative control and act as supporters and signal-boosters. The hope is that the conviction and passion displayed by these eight will inspire others to find their voices. The collaborators were paid for their time and work, and will be mentored for six months by The Guardian Labs staff.</p> <p>Beyond encouraging young people to speak out and push for positive change, the aim is to let the world see the power of their potential. \u201cWe want to create a platform that this team perhaps otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had.

  "<p>It should, these days, be easier than ever to make a point in public. If you want to tell your story there are places to blog and host videos, there is social media to help you find an audience, and free software and ever cheaper hardware to get you online.</p> <p>But in practice, not everyone finds it easy to push their ideas into a public space. So where do you begin, particularly if you feel as if you\u2019re on the margins? As part of Levi\u2019s Your Voice. Your Way campaign, The Guardian Labs talked to three young people who, driven by a burning desire to be heard, found their voices through blogging, podcasts and zines.</p> <p>This is their advice to others who are bubbling with ideas and opinions, who know they have something valuable to say, but may feel unchampioned or underestimated. These are the first steps to getting your voice heard ...</p> <p><strong>1. Stay true to yourself<br></strong>You might admire a particular columnist or an influencer, but the world doesn\u2019t need an exact copy of someone else. The world needs you.</p> <p>\u201cI tried lots of voices on for size, but they weren\u2019t really me,\u201d says Jessica Riches, a social media and content specialist. She found her real voice and honed her social media skills during the student protests of 2010 when she became the clearest online voice of the group who occupied University College London in protest at increases in fees.</p> <p>\u201cPolitics was where I found myself,\u201d she says. \u201cI was able to learn and explore that side of myself and I found a community of people.\u201d</p> <p>For <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/raifarafiq/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Raifa Rafiq</a>, a shared interest in books led her to create the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mostlylitpod/?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mostly Lit</a> podcast with her friend <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alexreads/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alex Reads</a>. \u201cThe response we got was phenomenal,\u201d she says of the podcast, which ran for four years, won awards and partnered with Waterstones. \u201cWe did something we enjoyed and ended up putting a different face on culture and arts criticism: you don\u2019t have to be an old white man or a middle class white woman to love books or to talk about them.\u201d</p> <p><strong>2. Consider your platform carefully<br></strong>Who do you want to reach and what are you trying to say? Both of these questions will have an effect on where and how you publish your work. \u201cIn terms of social media, this is key,\u201d says Riches. \u201cIf you are telling a story that is text based, about news or opinion, then head to Twitter. If you want to draw people in with visuals, use Instagram. This sounds really obvious, but the mistake people often make at the beginning is over-committing. Pick the most appropriate platform and start there, that way you won\u2019t end up disappointing yourself. You can always expand later.\u201d</p> <p>Kirsty Fife has published her work on blogs and also created physical fanzines. \u201cI started out blogging, I ran a fat-fashion blog, Fatty Unbound,\u201d she says. \u201cBlogging did create a space that wasn\u2019t there at the time.\u201d Digitally, she honed her writing and found a community, but decided to begin putting out fanzines when her work became more personal.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d define a zine as a handmade leaflet or booklet, a space where you can create any kind of content you want,\u201d says Fife, who has also organised zine festivals and is studying for a PhD centred around archiving DIY subcultures. \u201cI started producing perzines [zines that are closer to personal essays or memoirs],\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s something about the physical nature of them, they can be kept. And you have more control over how many copies there are, you can know how far they will go. For work of that nature, when you\u2019re feeling vulnerable, that\u2019s really important. The internet is great, but trolls are omnipresent.\u201d</p> <p><strong>3. Start creating<br></strong>\u201cThink about what you engage with, what stops your thumb in its endless scroll,\u201d says Riches. \u201cThen think about what\u2019s missing. Write down \u2013 privately \u2013 what you want your content principles to be. What topics are you going to cover, what are your boundaries? What will you enjoy creating? It sounds limiting, but it\u2019s very freeing; it stops you trying to talk about everything at once.\u201d</p> <p>Creating a fanzine, says Fife: \u201cIs still very lo-fi. It\u2019s a Sharpie, sketchbooks, pieces of paper. Although these days I scan everything into my computer and create PDFs to print and distribute. I don\u2019t want any more incidents with things getting stuck in work photocopiers.\u201d</p> <p>The DIY approach has also worked for Rafiq, whose new podcast This Thing Changed My Life launched this month. \u201cBuy equipment and teach yourself,\u201d she says. \u201cSome editing software is free and it might seem scary, but it\u2019s not. YouTube taught me everything, and I started recording in a day. It\u2019s saved me so much time and money.\u201d</p> <p><strong>4. Believe in yourself<br></strong>The biggest barriers, however, often aren\u2019t the practical ones. Why, you might think, would anyone want to hear from you?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to put something out into the world,\u201d says Fife. \u201cI used to think that anything I made had to be perfectly finished and polished. It will never be perfect, so push through those feelings of anxiety. Put whatever you can out there, don\u2019t wait for validation to start.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere will always be someone for whom your work is meaningful.\u201d</p> <p><strong>5. Build your community<br></strong>Fife, Rafiq and Riches all agree they have found communities through their creative work. \u201cI found both friends and collaborators,\u201d says Fife.</p> <p>But it\u2019s worth remembering that an audience won\u2019t appear overnight. \u201cIt\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint,\u201d says Riches. \u201cAnd you need to put the work in. Start where you feel comfortable, ask your close friends to like what you\u2019re doing, then expand to other friends. Build.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/your-voice-your-way/2020/jun/11/voices-from-the-margins-eight-reasons-why-we-need-to-hear-from-a-radical-range-of-people\">Voices from the margins: eight reasons why 'we need to hear from a radical range of people\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Riches also points out that finding a community and finding an audience are very closely linked. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that social media is supposed to be social,\u201d she says. \u201cSupport other people in your field. Collaborate. Share. Showcase others and make connections.\u201d</p> <p>Before starting to produce her own, Fife bought zines created by others. She recommends looking at zine distros \u2013 places that sell and distribute a number of different fanzines. \u201cI go to Pen Fight Distro, Synchronise Witches Press and Vampire Hag. There will be a voice you enjoy out there.\u201d</p> <p>Rafiq proved there was an audience for her work that had been ignored or discounted by much of the culture industry. \u201cYoung people do love the arts,\u201d she says. \u201cArts criticism isn\u2019t just an endeavour for Oxbridge grads. You can be from the inner city, you can be BAME and want this.\u201d</p> <p>The effort is worth it, Fife says. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of people reach out to me over the years because they listened to my voice.

  "<p>It\u2019s easy to look at protesters marching, politicians declaiming or even to read the opinion pages of a newspaper and conclude that speaking up is for other people. That it\u2019s for those who are sure of themselves. For those who can make people listen. That it\u2019s not for you.</p> <p>In reality, though, each one of us has a story to tell and something that we want to say. And that\u2019s the inspiration behind Levi\u2019s Your Voice. Your Way campaign.</p> <p>The aim is to give people who are sometimes overlooked or underestimated a platform where they can tell the world how they feel. To this end, eight talented young creatives were selected to showcase their stories in a zine that will be published with the Guardian on Saturday, 27 June.</p> <p>But how do others from communities that sometimes feel marginalised go about getting their voices heard? Here, two outstanding outsiders explain what inspired them, and why it\u2019s so important to speak out.</p> <p><strong>1. Nobody does you as well as you do<br></strong>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be somebody else,\u201d says Joe Galliano, a former editor of Gay Times and now the co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://queerbritain.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Queer Britain</a>, an organisation dedicated to building the UK\u2019s first LGBTQ+ museum. \u201cEveryone has their own story.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s no good just hearing from one kind of person,\u201d says musician <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hakbaker/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hak Baker</a>, who found his voice via the grime crew Bomb Squad and Southwark Cathedral choir.</p> <p>An alumni of Levi\u2019s Music Project 2016 \u2013 and mentored by the rapper and songwriter Skepta as part of this, he is a solo artist creating music he calls G-folk. \u201cYou take in all kinds of influences to find your path,\u201d he says. \u201cNick a bit from here, nick a bit from there. That\u2019s why we all need to hear from a radical range of people.\u201d</p> <p><strong>2. Other people need to hear your voice<br></strong>As Baker says, the more viewpoints there are for people to consider, the more chance there is of someone else finding something that resonates with them and starting their own journey. There\u2019s also great value in speaking out on behalf of those who can\u2019t. \u201cSo often, LGBTQ+ stories are hidden or lost, sometimes wilfully, sometimes not,\u201d says Galliano, who works with Levi\u2019s as part of a three-year partnership with the brand. \u201cWe started Queer Britain because there were so many people who were losing their history. I wanted to make sure those stories were out there, that people were educated about them, and that they could take an important place in the culture at large.\u201d</p> <p><strong>3. Speaking out shapes your own identity<br></strong>For Galliano, shaping the culture is also important on an individual level. \u201cIf you can\u2019t see yourself reflected in some way, then it\u2019s very hard to know where you\u2019d like to be going and who you\u2019d like to be.\u201d</p> <p>This resonates with Baker who knows that music \u201cis something I needed to do\u201d. Using his emotions to create works for others to hear has helped him to process those emotions. \u201cI know I would be doing this, working in this way, even if I had no idea where my music would end up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e13fb24960075cb71dbe9a39c33624d5e411bed7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e13fb24960075cb71dbe9a39c33624d5e411bed7/0_446_6682_4009/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Galliano.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Galliano.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Boll</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>4. Listening to yourself will help you find your truth<br></strong>A lot of the discussion around finding your voice can make the process sound quasi-mystical and intimidating. But both Baker and Galliano have the same simple advice: listen to yourself. \u201cIt\u2019s your inner voice you want to hear,\u201d says Galliano. \u201cAsk yourself: \u2018Am I saying this for an effect, to give someone a particular idea of me, or is this what I believe?\u2019 We all want approval, but we have to be honest with ourselves.\u201d Baker agrees: \u201cWe all have shells and alter-egos we use for defence, or even offence, but you need to dig deep and get beyond that. Listen.\u201d</p> <p><strong>5. Feedback can empower you<br></strong>Some of us take to heart voices we shouldn\u2019t listen to \u201cfrom people who don\u2019t have our best interests at heart\u201d, says Galliano. \u201cAre you listening to an internal voice with a negative agenda? Then it\u2019s worth stopping and asking yourself if that voice is truly yours or if you\u2019ve picked it up along the way.\u201d</p> <p>Baker, too, emphasises the importance of surrounding yourself with people who do have your back. \u201cCheck in with your friends, make sure you\u2019ve got a good solid set of people. They won\u2019t always say everything is brilliant, but that\u2019s because they\u2019re looking out for you. We all need positive criticism. If you\u2019re super-cocksure about everything you do, and don\u2019t listen to feedback, then you do become a bit of a loser.\u201d</p> <p><strong>6. Your audience helps you learn<br></strong>Even though your voice is important, it\u2019s only as important as the people who hear it. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone should behave as though they are some sort of celebrity god figure,\u201d says Baker. \u201cFirst off, think how lonely that would be. But remember you are not above your audience. You add to their lives and they add to yours. Everyone is the same, everyone is on the same level.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe most powerful thing is listening,\u201d says Galliano. \u201cWithout listening we can never learn.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/your-voice-your-way/2020/jun/11/this-is-our-future-how-eight-talented-young-creatives-found-their-voice\">\u2018This is our future\u2019: how eight talented young creatives found their voice</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>7. Speaking up is a way to spread your ideas<br></strong>\u201cNot everyone is going to be interested in your message,\u201d says Galliano. And that\u2019s OK. It may not be a fit for everyone. But you have to find the people who do need to hear it.\u201d Baker concurs: \u201cI know my music will reach people who want or need something like that.\u201d</p> <p>You can, however, find ways to help your ideas spread. \u201cFor me,\u201d says Galliano, \u201cit\u2019s been important to look at how other people communicate and to try and match that. Are they very direct or are they more discursive? How do they build relationships?\u201d</p> <p><strong>8. Using your voice will give you confidence<br></strong>\u201cWhat do I wish I\u2019d known when I was starting out?\u201d asks Baker. \u201cI wish someone had said: \u2018This is going to be harder than you ever thought, but it really will be worth it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Galliano says: \u201cI wish someone had told me: \u2018You are enough.

  "<p>The government has said it wants to alleviate the loneliness and isolation of people most affected by social restrictions. It emphasises that this is a \u201ctargeted intervention\u201d directed at those who have been cut off from family and friends during lockdown. So what does the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/meeting-people-from-outside-your-household\">new law</a> mean?</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s happening?<br></strong>In England, from 13 June, if you live by yourself or are a single parent with dependent children \u2013 in other words, if there is only one adult in your home \u2013 you can expand your household to include one other household of any size. These are being called support bubbles.</p> <p><strong>So can grandparents now visit their grandchildren and have them to stay in their own homes?<br></strong>Yes and no. One grandparent who lives on their own can form a bubble with one of their grown-up children. But families with two lone grandparents need to choose which grandparent they link up with.</p> <p><strong>Can my partner stay the night with me?<br></strong>Yes, as long as one of you lives alone and you\u2019re in an exclusive bubble.</p> <p><strong>What about parents who have separated but who have children under 18?<br></strong>You\u2019re already allowed to operate as though you\u2019re in a bubble. You can form a bubble with another household, as long as it contains only a single adult.</p> <p><strong>I live alone but I\u2019m shielding. Can I form a bubble?&nbsp;<br></strong>Afraid not. But the government will be setting out further advice next week targeting this group.</p> <p><strong>Can I be in a bubble if I\u2019m clinically vulnerable or have a higher risk of catching coronavirus?<br></strong>If you are at a higher risk of exposure (for example, if someone in your house is a healthcare worker), you should take particular care when deciding whether to form a bubble and with whom.</p> <p><strong>What can I do in a bubble?<br></strong>You can behave as though you live under the same roof with the other people in your bubble: you\u2019re one big family. You can also share things such as sport or garden equipment.</p> <p><strong>Are bubbles safe?<br></strong>The risk of infection rises with the number of people in a bubble and the number of interactions you have with people you do not live with. Good hygiene remains important even for those in the same bubble: keep washing your hands and sneezing into a tissue.</p> <p><strong>How can I get to those in my bubble?<br></strong>There is no limit on how far you can travel but the government recommends that you form a bubble with someone who lives locally, so that you can continue to avoid using public transport and can cycle or walk if possible.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019ve chosen my bubble. Is there anything I can\u2019t do?<br></strong>You can\u2019t change your mind. You can\u2019t swap bubbles or expand them to include more than one household.</p> <p><strong>What happens if someone in my </strong><strong>support bubble develops coronavirus symptoms or we come into contact with someone else who does?<br></strong>You all have to stay at home. If you or a member of your bubble is contacted as part of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works#the-nhs-coronavirus-app\">test and trace programme</a>, the individual contacted must <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection\">stay at home</a>. If the individual becomes symptomatic, everyone in the bubble must then isolate.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>I\u2019ve just returned to the UK from abroad. Can I form a bubble or immediately rejoin my previous bubble?<br></strong>No. You need to self-isolate in one place for 14 days first.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m not eligible to form a bubble. Can I still see my friends and family?<br></strong>This is a targeted intervention for those who really need it. The safest thing is for us all to continue limiting our contact with others by staying at home. You can continue meeting outdoors in a group of up to six people including those you do not live with, as long as you keep at least 2 metres apart.</p> <p><strong>What happens if I break the new </strong><strong>rules?<br></strong>The relevant authorities, including the police, have the powers to enforce them through fines and dispersing gatherings.</p>",
  "<p>Since the worst of the lockdown ended, many of Britain\u2019s parks have turned into splendid open-air gyms. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/oct/01/parkrun-five-mlllion-runners\">Parkrun</a> sadly remains in hibernation but everything else has bloomed. In my local park there are the joggers, cyclists, speed walkers, guys doing chin-ups on the goalposts, individuals stretching on mats, small groups doing workouts and the yoga enthusiasts with their sun salutations. Meanwhile, next door, the neighbours are impressively in the back yard every morning, hamstrings at the ready for Joe Wicks.</p> \n<p>Before the coronavirus, the gym industry was booming. Ten million people \u2013 one in seven of the entire population \u2013 had a gym membership and as a country we were <a href=\"https://www.sportsthinktank.com/news/2019/05/the-2019-state-of-the-uk-fitness-industry-report\">spending a record \u00a35bn on keeping fit</a>.</p> \n<p>Almost all of that spending has come to a shuddering halt, with Britain\u2019s 7,000 gyms and leisure centres still firmly shut. Will enough of us ever go back, now that new habits have been formed (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/11/huge-demand-for-cycles-during-lockdown-set-to-rise-further\">the expansion in cycling</a> is remarkable) and we have learned how to keep fit without paying costly monthly fees?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"77142d5a-0bf3-4a80-b538-c47a11b57f6a\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.</p>\n    <p>The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.</p>\n    <p>The WHO says masks should be made of three layers \u2013 with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.</p>\n    <p>The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Reopening day for leisure facilities is scheduled for 4 July, with gyms in stage three of the government\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/our-plan-to-rebuild-the-uk-governments-covid-19-recovery-strategy/our-plan-to-rebuild-the-uk-governments-covid-19-recovery-strategy#our-roadmap-to-lift-restrictions-step-by-step\"> Covid-19 recovery roadmap</a>.

  "<p>In 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/paulweller\">Paul Weller</a> released his umpteenth compilation, surveying a career now into its sixth decade. More Modern Classics came with sleeve notes written by Weller himself, which ended with a gruff message to his audience: \u201cDon\u2019t be scared of the new, don\u2019t get bogged down in the cliches of, \u2018Oh it\u2019s not as good as \u2026\u2019 or you\u2019ll miss out on what is NOW.\u201d You could say that\u2019s a bit rich coming from Weller, a revivalist from the start, who furthermore could be found in the midst of his 90s renaissance informing the late music writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/31/david-cavanagh-writer-musicians-music\">Dav</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/31/david-cavanagh-writer-musicians-music\">id Cavana</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/31/david-cavanagh-writer-musicians-music\">gh</a> that \u201ceverything\u2019s shit after 68\u201d.

Weller sounded re-energised, the reviews were ecstatic, but the response from the rump of his fanbase \u2013 the feather cut-sporting dads who may well represent the world\u2019s first middle-aged youth cult \u2013 was decidedly mixed.</p> <p>From 2017, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/11/paul-weller-a-kind-revolution-review-robustly-written-and-emotionally-satisfying\">A Kind Revolution</a> and the following year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/14/paul-weller-true-meanings-review-the-modfather-muses-on-mortality\">True Meanings</a> offered the conservative wing of his fanbase some consolation \u2013 the former dialled down the experimentation, the latter explored an acoustic strand of his writing you could trace back to the Jam\u2019s English Rose and Liza Radley \u2013 but Weller clearly isn\u2019t done springing surprises yet. His <a href=\"https://ghostbox.greedbag.com/buy/in-another-room/\">first release of 2020 was an EP</a> of musique concr\u00e8te-style instrumentals on the left-field electronic label Ghost Box. Which brings us to On Sunset, an album on which he gamely attempts to meld the competing desires to be the keeper of musical traditions and a modernist in the original sense of the phrase: if you were looking for a spiritual forebear in Weller\u2019s catalogue, you might alight on 1980\u2019s Sound Affects, where the influence of the era\u2019s wilfully jarring post-punk was overlaid with his obsession with mid-60s Beatles.</p> <p>At one extreme are opener Mirror Ball and Earth Beat. The former goes on for nearly eight minutes and contains shimmering synths that wouldn\u2019t sound entirely out of place on a mainstream 2020 pop single, Beach Boys-worthy harmony vocals, a weird moment where it appears to be shifting into an entirely different tempo before deciding against it, a lengthy free-form interlude that could have come off the aforementioned Ghost Box EP and a lo-fi piano coda. Despite a title that suggests something unspeakable you might stumble across on one of Glastonbury\u2019s outlying stages involving a didgeridoo and a rapping crusty, Earth Beat is a dramatic reworking of The Willows, a track from Ghost Box co-founder Jim Jupp\u2019s 2004 debut as the Belbury Poly, reshaping the original\u2019s eerie electronics into a kind of warped soul track with guest appearance from rising London R&amp;B artist Col3trane and a glam-era glitter-beat.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPXjxQdtawk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HPXjxQdtawk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Paul Weller: Earth Beat \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Another curveball comes with Equanimity, which features Jim Lea of Slade on violin and sounds like David Bowie, an artist Weller paid open homage to on True Meanings: not, it\u2019s worth noting, the Bowie of Ziggy Stardust or Low, but the Bowie found on his eponymous 1967 debut, in thrall to music hall and Anthony Newley\u2019s brand of musical theatre. At the other extreme, meanwhile, there\u2019s Baptiste and On Sunset, offering warm, soul-infused rock that could have been released in 1969 and 1972 respectively.</p> <p>The rest lurks somewhere in between, offering gentle disruptions of the familiar. More offers the kind of relaxed bucolic sound found on 1993\u2019s Wild Wood, but underpinned by a taut, metronomic bass line that leans towards krautrock. Old Father Tyme has a naggingly familiar guitar riff weaving through satisfyingly off-beam production \u2013 a drum machine fades in and out of the mix, Weller\u2019s vocal comes decorated with little bursts of dubby echo \u2013 and one of a number of lyrics on which Weller, who spent his early years as a songwriter obsessed with his own youth, addresses ageing with surprising equanimity.

  "<p>One of the last things I did before lockdown began was to speak at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists at an event on race and maternal mortality. It has been known for a few years now that \u2013 incredibly \u2013 black women in the UK are <a href=\"https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/mbrrace-uk/reports\">five times more likely to die</a> in pregnancy than white women, while Asian women are twice as likely to die. The atmosphere in the room was heavy with anger and disappointment. Black doctors, nurses and midwives were exasperated by the failure to protect women.</p> <p>In the United States, too, black and Native American women suffer greater rates of maternal mortality than white women. This is just one of many examples of racial inequality in health. A US study found last year that black patients were <a href=\"https://www.ajemjournal.com/article/S0735-6757(19)30391-2/fulltext\">40</a><a href=\"https://www.ajemjournal.com/article/S0735-6757(19)30391-2/fulltext\">% less likely</a> than white patients to get the medication they needed to relieve acute pain. A UK study published in January showed that <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32021472/\">Asian patients with dementia</a> were 14% less likely to be prescribed beneficial anti-dementia drugs than white patients were.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Scientists have continued to ask whether there might be deeper genetic factors at play</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It isn\u2019t as though nobody has spoken out about this before. Many of us have been shouting for years into what has felt like the void, trying to get professional health bodies and politicians to act on what has always been apparent in the data: that to be black or brown is to see your body suffer disproportionately and you may even die sooner than average. The problem is particularly pronounced in the US. According to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/015.pdf\">research</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the life expectancy gap between black and white Americans has narrowed over time, but still sits at more than three years.</p> <p>Little did we know that it would take a pandemic to finally put the issue of minority-ethnic health at the top of the agenda. Within weeks, data began to show that ethnic minorities in both the US and the UK were clearly bearing the brunt of the virus. As we began clapping for NHS workers, stories emerged in the press of Asian and black doctors dying in surprisingly high numbers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/doctors-nurses-porters-volunteers-the-uk-health-workers-who-have-died-from-covid-19\">Ate Wilma Banaag</a>, a nurse at Watford general hospital, died in early April. Krishan Arora, a GP in Croydon, died later that month. Cecilia Fashanu, a nurse at Cumberland infirmary, died at the end of it.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7c535d75f06f08939ec261da13e8489cdcd391c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7c535d75f06f08939ec261da13e8489cdcd391c/0_194_5408_3246/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A black nurse wearing a protective face mask  treats a hospital patient during the UK's COVID-19 pandemic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018As we began clapping for the NHS workers, stories started to emerge in the press of Asian and black doctors dying in surprisingly high numbers.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah McKay/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The UK\u2019s Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre found that <a href=\"https://www.icnarc.org/Our-Audit/Audits/Cmp/Reports\">a third of patients</a> needing breathing support in intensive care who had tested positive for the virus were non-white. Data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in early May suggested that black people in England and Wales at that time were around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\">four times more likely</a> than white people to die from Covid-19.</p> <p>The media attention on coronavirus meant these figures couldn\u2019t easily be ignored. But neither should we have been all that surprised. All the factors that have long impacted the health of minorities were inevitably going to play out in the event of a pandemic. When you factor in that London \u2013 which has a <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/uk-population-by-ethnicity/national-and-regional-populations/regional-ethnic-diversity/latest\">minority white British</a> population \u2013 was hit first, and that many high-risk frontline jobs, particularly in hospitals, are held by BAME people, then the data pretty well matched what anyone should expect. We could have predicted this. There was no great riddle here, no scientific puzzle to be solved.</p> <p>What was really odd was all the head-scratching in the press, even in major scientific journals. <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8210941/Mystery-high-risk-black-Asian-Britons.html\">\u201cMystery over high risk to black and Asian Britons</a><a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8210941/Mystery-high-risk-black-Asian-Britons.html\">\u201d</a>, ran an online Daily Mail headline. It was as though people had forgotten that racial disparities in health have always existed. A hasty government review into minority-ethnic deaths due to Covid-19, published last week, scrambled to explain in a few weeks what researchers have been documenting for decades. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/key-findings-from-public-health-englands-report-on-covid-19-deaths\">Public Health England report</a> not only failed to tell us anything we didn\u2019t already know, but even fell short of telling us everything we did, including the considerable health impacts of structural discrimination.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9541227fbea61c40a749947b233ddda8478fd839\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9541227fbea61c40a749947b233ddda8478fd839/0_0_3146_3500/899.jpg\" alt=\"Composite file photos of some of the BAME healthcare staff who have died during the UK\u2019s Covid-19 pandemic.\" width=\"899\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Composite file photos of some of the BAME healthcare staff who have died during the UK\u2019s Covid-19 pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, in their desperation to solve the race puzzle they had invented for themselves, scientists have continued to ask whether there might be deeper genetic factors at play. Could it be possible that BAME people have innate qualities that make them more likely to get sick? You know, those horribly faulty black and brown genes? The UK Biobank, a repository of public DNA, is being mined for correlations as I write. Some medical researchers appear to have forgotten that the racial categories we use every day are socially, not genetically, defined. In the US, for instance, a person can have just one ancestor of African origin and still be categorised as black based on their appearance and society\u2019s perception of them. </p> <p>But then, this is what the medical community has always done: pathologise blackness. In the US in the 19th century, as Harvard historian Evelynn Hammonds has documented, a medical condition known as \u201cdrapetomania\u201d was invented by white physician Samuel Cartwright to describe the phenomenon of black slaves running away from their owners. Because how else to explain the errant behaviour of the naturally enslaved? From bone density and skin thickness to susceptibility to pain, doctors have long sought to isolate what is tangibly different about those who society has already oppressed. Despite their persistent failure to find any meaningful differences, they still do it now.&nbsp;</p> <p>As the pandemic has rolled on, many experts have wondered whether vitamin D might be responsible for the gaps we\u2019ve seen. After all, we know that it\u2019s linked to immunity and that it\u2019s harder to get enough of it when you\u2019ve got darker skin and you\u2019re living in a colder climate. Voila! It\u2019s one of those neat explanations that immediately absolves society of all blame for social disparities in health. The reason those with darker skins are dying is that they\u2019ve simply forgotten to take their supplements! </p> <p>A more likely explanation for some of the disparities we see, as people are slowly beginning to acknowledge following the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/what-have-protests-achieved-george-floyd-death-police-funding-statues\">George Floyd</a> in Minneapolis, lies not in race, but in racism.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tackling racism is just one crucial part of the enormous task of making life fairer for everyone</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Racial health inequality has its roots in the same neck-crushing racism as a bigoted thug with a police badge, but it plays out in more subtle ways: in the white flight that created ethnic ghettos, in the inhumanity shown to migrants and refugees, in the difficulties black and Asian people face in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/07/ethnic-minorities-jobs-gap-bame-degrees\">getting good jobs</a>, in <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/articles/ethnicitypaygapsingreatbritain/2018\">ethnicity pay gaps</a>, in all the little bullets that society fires at you if your skin colour happens to be different. If you want to know how early these bullets begin to be fired, even infant mortality rates are higher in the US among black Americans.</p> <p>Being poor is a crucial social factor when it comes to bad health. The <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l1492\">life expectancy of women</a> living in the most deprived areas of England is more than seven years lower than that of women living in the least deprived, according to the most recent data published by the ONS. <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l1492\">For men</a>, the gap is more than nine years. And it has got worse over the last decade.</p> <p>Poverty overlaps with race, but not entirely. And this means that, as more data comes in, we must also acknowledge that some of the factors that make ethnic minorities more vulnerable also make certain white Britons and Americans more vulnerable, too. As of June, the region in England with the highest death rates from Covid-19, overtaking London, is the north-east, which suffers terrible levels of deprivation and child poverty \u2013 and also has among the whitest towns in the country.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/06/labour-accuses-government-of-cover-up-over-bame-covid-19-report\">Labour accuses government of cover-up over BAME Covid-19 report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Individual disadvantage, as much as we may want to view it as a simple formula, operates in complicated ways. An affluent black Briton may well have better living conditions and diet than a working-class white person living in a former mining town, but then they are also more likely to face racial discrimination when they go to a hospital. There are layers of complexity here, each of which has to be unpicked. Going forward, what we need is fewer knee-jerk official reports and more slow, careful research on the many and varied social determinants of health.</p> <p>In the end, as the data shows, this is also about power. The levers of capitalism have widened inequality between the rich and poor; funds drained from the NHS and local communities have left them less resilient; and populist politics have pitted people against each other when we should be united. The issue is not just racism, but how racism plays out in a society that is already brutalising its citizens. Tackling racism is just one crucial part of the enormous task of making life fairer for everyone \u2013 but it is a necessary one, because a nation that is able to view some of its people as less human than others will never have the moral strength to resolve its other problems.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>Angela Saini is the author of <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/superior-9780008293864.html\">Superior: The Return of Race Science</a></em>, out in paperback on 25 June.</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p><strong>What was the situation like when the league was suspended on 13 March?</strong> Carlo Ancelotti entered lockdown brooding over a painful reality check with his new club. It could be one that benefits him and Everton in the long-term, however. Five wins in his first eight Premier League matches, building on the fine work of Duncan Ferguson as caretaker manager, had encouraged talk from the manager of European qualification and only minor repair work being necessary in the summer transfer market. Anyone who has watched an expensively-assembled squad toil over recent seasons knew both to be hugely optimistic assessments.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/28/evertons-jean-philippe-gbamin-set-to-be-out-until-2021-with-achilles-injury\">Everton's Jean-Philippe Gbamin set to be out until 2021 with achilles injury</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Everton remain a long way off realising the ambitions of the majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri and their three-times Champions League winning manager. That would have been brought home to Ancelotti when his team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/21/everton-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report\">blew a two-goal lead in stoppage time against Newcastle</a>, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/23/arsenal-everton-premier-league-match-report\">defeat at Arsenal</a> and especially in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/08/chelsea-everton-premier-league-match-report\">4-0 reverse at Chelsea</a> in the final game before lockdown. The positives as football entered its enforced break were the new five-year contracts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/07/dominic-calvert-lewin-everton-england-euros\">signed by Dominic Calvert-Lewin</a> and Mason Holgate.</p> <p><strong>What about now? </strong>The return to contact training has at least allowed Ancelotti more time to impose his ideas at Finch Farm, albeit in a restricted fashion. It is time the manager would not usually have had after arriving in mid-season, and the onus is on players he inherited to prove they belong in his long-term plans. One area he is keen to strengthen is central midfield. The squad was beset by injuries in that department prior to lockdown, which offers one explanation for that sorry display at Chelsea, but that situation has barely improved since 13 March.</p> <p>Jean-Philippe Gbamin, last summer\u2019s \u00a322.5m intended replacement for Idrissa Gueye, had hoped to offer a solution in the restart after recovering from the quadriceps injury that has blighted his campaign. But he is now out until next year after suffering an achilles injury in training. Morgan Schneiderlin is several weeks away from returning from a knee operation he underwent in February while another training-ground thigh injury, this time to Yerry Mina, means Everton have only two central defenders available for the restart. Theo Walcott has also been ruled out for four weeks after abdominal surgery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Fiver\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What needs to be done to have a successful end to the season? </strong>A first Merseyside derby win for almost 10 years would be a good start. There remains an outside chance of Europe, with six points separating Wolves in sixth from Everton in 12th, although it would require major and consistent improvement for Ancelotti\u2019s team to climb that high. It is arguably more important to determine who should be part of next season\u2019s plans, who needs to go and for his tactical vision to take shape. There are high hopes at Goodison for the 19-year-old Anthony Gordon. The restart offers opportunity for the forward to build on his two Premier League substitute appearances. Likewise, given the injury situation in central defence, Lewis Gibson could get a chance to press his claim although Everton would need special dispensation to re-register the 19-year-old after a loan season at Fleetwood. It is also time for Moise Kean to justify Everton\u2019s \u00a324.5m investment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a34d16535dae9faf099ecc4ffb1136bcb0c9f204\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a34d16535dae9faf099ecc4ffb1136bcb0c9f204/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Calvert-Lewin (centre) has his shot saved during the 4-0 defeat at Chelsea in Everton\u2019s final game before lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Calvert-Lewin (centre) has his shot saved during the 4-0 defeat at Chelsea in Everton\u2019s final game before lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony McArdle/Everton FC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Have players and staff behaved during lockdown?</strong> Everton acted immediately to help the local community when the pandemic struck, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/21/merseyside-red-blue-mobilise-fight-save-local-livelihoods-liverpool-everton-coronavirus\">launching a \u00a350,000 \u2018Blue Family\u2019 campaign</a> that involved charity staff delivering emergency food parcels, medical prescriptions and fuel vouchers to those in need. Players and management took part in the thousands of phone calls the club made to elderly and isolated people.

  "<p>Hong Kong\u2019s security chief has announced that a dedicated police unit is being set up and would be ready to enforce controversial new national security laws from day one.</p> <p>There is widespread international and commercial concern about the impact of the laws that are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/china-vote-npc-national-security-laws-hong-kong-us-protest\">being imposed on the semi-autonomous region</a> directly by Beijing, bypassing Hong Kong\u2019s legislature. The move has prompted the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/britain-could-change-immigration-rules-for-hong-kong-citizens\">UK to offer a visa to millions of Hongkongers</a> if they felt uncomfortable staying.</p> <p>State media said on Thursday that legislators were working \u201cday and night\u201d to draft the legislation.</p> <p>Kennedy Wong Ying-ho \u2013 the deputy secretary general of the Hong Kong Coalition, an influential pro-Beijing group led by former chief executives of the region \u2013 told the state-run Global Times the laws would likely take effect within a month. He did not specify whether he was referring to a month from now, or from the time the laws were approved.</p> <p>Attendees at a forum organised by the coalition heard the powerful standing committee of the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC) would \u201cspare no effort\u201d in drafting the laws quickly.</p> <p>The standing committee of the NPC drafts the new security laws and bills are meant to go through three readings before approval but can be adopted sooner.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Hong Kong\u2019s security chief, John Lee Ka-chiu, said police were establishing a separate dedicated unit to enforce the proposed national security laws, led by police commissioner Chris Tang Ping-keung.</p> <p>\u201cThe new body will have intelligence-gathering capability, we\u2019ll have investigation capability, we\u2019ll have an action arm,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3088261/hong-kong-police-unit-dedicated-enforcing-new-national\">Lee told the South China Morning Post</a>. \u201cWe should also have a strategy for the long-term development of this dedicated unit.\u201d</p> <p>Lee would not say how it would work with mainland agencies, but suggested there would be heavy involvement.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that the mainland authorities have a much wider network of intelligence gathering and also a much higher level of analysis,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey have a helicopter view of the whole thing. So they will let us know the whole picture when we, as a city, may not be able to just using our information.\u201d</p> <p>The Global Times reported the new Hong Kong force would work with mainland agencies on joint operations.</p> <p>The laws have fuelled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/china-to-propose-controversial-hong-kong-security-measure\">international</a> and business concern over Beijing\u2019s growing interference with Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and freedoms.</p> <p>The laws are the latest in a string of significant economically destabilising events in Hong Kong, and there is widespread concern of an exodus of international corporations. A year of protests, the US-China trade war, and large-scale shutdowns due to the pandemic have had a significant impact on businesses.</p> <p>\u201cWe just can\u2019t seem to catch a break and things are ratcheting up,\u201d said Tara Joseph, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. \u201cHong Kong is a really valuable place for people both business-wise and personally. Nobody wants to run for the exit or throw the baby out with the bath water.\u201d</p> <p>Joseph said there was little detail coming forward about the laws, or about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/30/hong-kong-officials-lash-out-at-trump-plan-to-strip-city-of-special-status\">the US government\u2019s increasingly provocative plans</a> for its responses to Hong Kong and China.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very fluid situation and lots of unanswered questions and that\u2019s worrying because everyone\u2019s trying to figure out how hard the security laws are going to be, and how difficult the changes that the US may put out there will be,\u201d said Joseph.</p> <p>A survey of its members this month found 82% had held regular headquarter-level discussions on crisis management, on how to help staff cope with social division and distress, and on strategy adjustments. Almost one quarter were considering scaling back operations or moving out of Hong Kong.</p>",

Since her son Amadou Diallo\u2019s death in a hail of 41 bullets from police in 1999, Kadiatou Diallo has watched black mothers grieve. So has Valerie Bell, since police shot her son Sean Bell 50 times hours before his wedding in 2006. As has Constance Malcolm, after police followed her 17-year-old son, Ramarley Graham, into his home in 2012, shooting him in front of his six-year-old brother after alleging they saw a gun on the unarmed teen.</p> <p>The four women spoke to a reporter ahead of a march in New York last week, organized by the families who have lost loved ones to police killings, as part of the ongoing protest movement triggered by Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no change,\u201d Diallo said.

  "<p>Protesters have pulled down a statue of Jefferson Davis, the Civil War-era president of the Confederacy, amid continuing protests triggered by the police killing of George Floyd and the wider issue of racism in the US.</p> <p>The statue of Jefferson, a Mississippi Democrat who served as the president of the Confederate states from 1861 until 1865, was toppled shortly before 11pm in Richmond, Virginia, the place Davis set up as his capital.</p> <p>Police were on the scene in Monument Avenue and videos on social media showed the statue being towed away as a crowd cheered.</p> <p>There are escalating efforts worldwide to remove statues associated with slavery and racial oppression, which have resulted in the toppling of the statue of the prominent slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, UK, and the removal of monuments to Belgium\u2019s King Leopold II.</p> <p>In Barcelona on Thursday afternoon the statue of Christopher Columbus that has stood at the foot of La Rambla since 1888 appeared on Google and Google Maps as the \u201cstatue of Columbus the enslaver and colonizer\u201d after someone&nbsp;tweaked the pages. In 2016 a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/27/call-to-topple-christopher-columbus-statue-from-its-barcelona-perch\">group of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/27/call-to-topple-christopher-columbus-statue-from-its-barcelona-perch\">councillors in the city called for the statue</a>&nbsp;to be removed on the grounds that it glorified the conquest of America and said it should be replaced with a memorial reflecting \u201cAmerican resistance to imperialism, oppression and indigenous and African-American segregation\u201d.</p> <p>The toppling of the Davis statue in Virginia came a day after protesters tore down a Christopher Columbus in Richmond which was set on fire before being dumped in a nearby lake. A second statue of Columbus was torn down in Minnesota, while other Columbus statues in Houston and Miami were splattered with red paint.</p> <p>The statues have been targeted by campaigners, including Black Lives Matter and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in the US, as an offensive reminder of slavery and racial oppression.</p> <p>Other statues on Richmond\u2019s tree-lined mall include monuments to the Confederate military figures JEB Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Matthew Fontaine Maury and Gen Robert E Lee, all of which have been graffitied in recent days, as well as a bronze statue of the black American tennis player Arthur Ashe put up in the 1990s amid resistance from some so-called \u201cheritage\u201d groups.</p> <p>Among graffiti painted on the Davis monument was the question: \u201cHow much more blood?\u201d</p> <p>In a comment piece in Politico reflecting on the removal of Davis\u2019s statue John F Harris who lived in Richmond in the 1990s described the dynamic that saw the statues pushed to the forefront of debate.</p> <p>\u201cWhy did I tolerate, and even, at times, take friends to see the statues?\u201d wrote Harris. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that the legacy of the Confederacy didn\u2019t offend me. It was that the statues depicted a history that seemed functionally dead. They also seemed like a joke\u2014and the joke was on the very racists who had erected them in the first place.</p> <p>\u201cWhat has become steadily more clear over the years\u2014and crystallized dramatically in the national reckoning over the murder of George Floyd\u2014is that the history the statues depict is not dead. The throngs of protesters on Monument Avenue in recent days gathered precisely because they know the symbolism of the statues is very much alive\u2014toxic and radiant.\u201d</p> <p>Calls for the removal of Confederate statues and symbols had become a prominent area of contention even before the protests triggered by Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&nbsp;has urged Congress to take steps to remove from the US Capitol 11 statues representing Confederate leaders and soldiers from the civil war. \u201cTheir statues pay homage to hate, not heritage. They must be removed,\u201d Pelosi said in a letter to leaders of a congressional committee in charge of managing the statues in the Capitol.</p> <p>After Floyd\u2019s killing US military leaders expressed a willingness to rename bases associated with Confederate figures \u2013 such as forts Bragg, Benning, AP Hill and Lee \u2013 a move, however, that was firmly rejected in a tweet by Donald Trump on Tuesday.</p> <p>\u201cMy Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cOur history as the Greatest Nation in the World will not be tampered with. Respect our Military!\u201d</p> <p>Along with Lee and the distinctive rebel flag, Davis has long been one of the most prominent symbols of the pro-slavery Confederacy and the target for removal.</p> <p>The statue was knocked down, and then removed by police, just a week after the mayor of Richmond, Levar Stoney, said he planned to push legislation to remove all four of the prominent Confederate monuments on Monument Avenue.</p> <p>\u201cRichmond is no longer the capital of the Confederacy \u2013 it is filled with diversity and love for all \u2013 and we need to demonstrate that,\u201d Stoney said in a statement at the time.</p> <p>But amid the outrage over the death of Floyd in Minneapolis, which has triggered nationwide and international protests over systemic racism against black people, including against statues seen as symbols of racial oppression, protesters took matters into their own hands.</p> <p>Like many other civil war-era monuments, the Richmond statue of Davis \u2013 regarded as a weak and divisive leader even within the Confederacy he led \u2013 was put up decades after the conclusion of the conflict, in 1907, amid a revisionist romanticisation of the \u201cLost Cause\u201d.</p> <p>Virginia\u2019s governor, Ralph Northam, had already said he planned to order the removal of the Gen Robert E Lee statue from Monument Avenue a move now blocked by a court ruling.</p> <p>The toppling of Davis\u2019s statue, which depicted him at the moment of his resignation speech, is one of 10 controversial statues to have been removed in recent days. Branches of the US military and the Nascar stock car racing association said they would ban Confederate symbols, including flags.</p> <p>In Richmond there has also been pressure from the local branch of the NAACP to rename the city\u2019s Jefferson Davis Highway.</p> <p>Unpopular even among many of his own generals, Davis was arrested and imprisoned at the conclusion of the war before being pardoned by President Andrew Johnson in 1868.</p> <p>Protesters in Portsmouth, about 80 miles from Richmond, beheaded and then pulled down four other statues that were part of a Confederate monument on Wednesday, according to media outlets.</p>",
  "<p>For many people in power,&nbsp;especially corporations, their biggest fear is not whether protesters on the street will break&nbsp;through a line&nbsp;of police. It\u2019s whether the conversation&nbsp;about racism will break&nbsp;through on issues beyond policing and draw attention to issues such as corporations\u2019 role in mass&nbsp;incarceration, the abuse Black workers face, and the racism in our healthcare system that routinely kills Black people.&nbsp;</p> <p>We must win real structural change in our&nbsp;criminal&nbsp;justice system. But not just&nbsp;because its impact is so destructive and its takeover of Black communities is so unjust. We need to win on criminal justice because it will lay the foundation for what activism looks like, and set the standards for what justice looks like, which we can then apply to fighting&nbsp;the&nbsp;corporate&nbsp;takeover of our lives.&nbsp;</p> <p>Every time I see an act of violence against Black people hit the news, or see issues of race come up in public debate, my&nbsp;first reaction is to shake my head, hold my heart and push myself to find a way to fight&nbsp;ever harder and smarter for racial justice. And then I always wonder:&nbsp;<em>after all this time, is it even possible for America to actually learn anything? Black people are doing so much teaching, but is anybody learning?</em></p> <p>The conversation on race rarely picks up where it last left off. It always seems to revert to the conversation we were having 30 years before. And it usually includes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/01/22/irony-flogs-itself-steve-kings-mlk-tweet-was-worst-number-tributes-gone-wrong/\">white conservatives</a>&nbsp;quoting Dr Martin&nbsp;Luther&nbsp;King Jr back to us.&nbsp;</p> <p>As millions of people rise up to fight racism in America right now, however, I am getting a very&nbsp;different feeling. It feels&nbsp;like America <em>is</em> actually learning something about race. Not necessarily about what we need to do to end racism, or&nbsp;even the full extent of its harm. But at least the truth of Black&nbsp;experiences: the attacks on freedom and&nbsp;wellbeing that Black people face every day in this country at the hands of police and prosecutors, and also at the hands of bankers, doctors, employers and so many others. The truth of systemic racism.&nbsp;</p> <p>But that question leads to another, even more important, one:&nbsp;<em>after falling in love&nbsp;with&nbsp;the dream of change, will&nbsp;America fall for&nbsp;false solutions?&nbsp;</em>That\u2019s where corporations come in. They run the&nbsp;factories that manufacture false solutions en masse. They&nbsp;want us to take&nbsp;\u201cwe care for you\u201d for an answer. They want us to take body cameras for an answer. Corporations are one of the biggest threats to the protests taking place, though they are not on the street&nbsp;trying&nbsp;to stop them.&nbsp;</p> <p>We\u2019re seeing a&nbsp;lot of hypocrisy right now.&nbsp;George W Bush said that it&nbsp;\u201cremains shocking\u201d that Black&nbsp;people are \u201charassed and threatened in their own country\u201d even though he himself,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/12/01/the-ignored-legacy-of-george-h-w-bush-war-crimes-racism-and-obstruction-of-justice/\">and his&nbsp;fa</a><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/12/01/the-ignored-legacy-of-george-h-w-bush-war-crimes-racism-and-obstruction-of-justice/\">ther</a>, had appalling records on&nbsp;race and racism, and on Black lives. In a similar manner, corporations are now jumping over one another to message their support for Black people. A cottage industry of advisers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2020/06/u-s-businesses-must-take-meaningful-action-against-racism\">provide guidance</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;how they&nbsp;should best do so, even as the cries of hypocrisy&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90512426/tech-companies-caring-about-black-lives-matter-is-too-little-too-late\">ring loud</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2020/06/amazon-racial-justice-worker-organizing-union/\">ring true</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Both corporations speaking out, and the incredible pushback they've received, are happening for a reason</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For people who want change, this is exactly&nbsp;what we must figure out how to counteract.&nbsp;It\u2019s time to&nbsp;convert protests against police in the streets to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.winningjustice.org/\">fights&nbsp;against prosecutors</a>, including at the&nbsp;ballot box. It\u2019s also time to convert diversity and inclusion programs within corporations into anti-racist taskforces with the authority to make change.

It\u2019s because we built the&nbsp;infrastructure to&nbsp;influence and organize the conversation on race. We\u2019ve given&nbsp;people&nbsp;language to talk about racism and privilege. We\u2019ve given people ideas for&nbsp;thinking about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why\">ending policing as we know it</a>, rather than slightly&nbsp;reforming but mostly accepting the status quo of policing. We\u2019ve given people history lessons, connecting the attacks we\u2019re seeing today to the history of attacks on&nbsp;Black communities, from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/jun/02/in-1919-the-state-failed-to-protect-black-americans-a-century-later-its-still-failing\">Red Summer</a>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/01/us/tulsa-race-massacre-1921-99th-anniversary-trnd/index.html\">Tulsa Massacre</a>:&nbsp;both took place a hundred years ago and both are instances of police serving the agenda of white supremacy rather than protecting&nbsp;people against it.</p> <p>All of these groundbreaking analyses and solutions originated in Black communities.&nbsp;But much like the police themselves, these conversations&nbsp;could easily get out of control and be used against us.&nbsp;That will require calling&nbsp;out&nbsp;corporations for their injustices, and rallying as many people to fight their abuses as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://act.colorofchange.org/sign/justiceforfloyd_george_floyd_minneapolis\">millions we\u2019ve seen rally around George Floyd</a>. It will require more petitions and marches, and more donations and acts of defying complicity at work and&nbsp;among friends \u2013 from everyone, of every identity.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is the moment for racism in America that\u2019s very similar to the recent shift in the fight against climate change: many defenders of the status quo have now conceded climate change is real, but they still fight every move to actually do&nbsp;something real about it. It\u2019s an opportunity but also a challenge.&nbsp;Our biggest mistake&nbsp;would be to be so focused on fighting the&nbsp;denial we have been fighting for decades that we forget to ensure that politicians and corporate executives actually make good on the recognition they\u2019re now so readily offer. We must&nbsp;recognize the protests we see today as just the beginning.</p> <ul> <li><p>Rashad Robinson is the president of Color Of Change and a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>My mum fist-pumped when I told her I had seen a barn owl using a nest box on our farm. She has been trying to coax them in since she moved here 35 years ago.&nbsp;</p> <p>There were signs the owls might be thinking of settling down \u2013 we found a pellet (regurgitated fur and bones from rodents) at the base of a nest box in February and splatters of poo below another box. Then last week the eureka moment came when one flew out of a box.&nbsp;</p> <p>My brother built the first boxes (along with a few dozen broody chicken coops) 17 years ago as a punishment for getting suspended from school. Dad built a few more during a brief attempt at retirement and now we have eight of these bulky boxes nestled in the boughs of oak trees around our Kent farm.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lynne and Peter Flower \u2013 who volunteer for Kent Wildlife Trust and are licensed with the <a href=\"https://www.bto.org/\">British Trust for Ornithology (BTO)</a> to monitor boxes in the local area \u2013 came to look inside ours and found various bit of avian paraphernalia, including sticks brought in by a jackdaw, an egg (probably from a stock dove) and pellets (which barn owls shred to make nests). A kestrel had claimed one of the other boxes as its own.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/14/videos-wildlife-equivalent-match-of-the-day-aoe\">Lockdown on the family farm has turned me into a small-scale Attenborough</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Monitoring nests is crucial because it provides the BTO with information about where the species is doing well. Before climbing the ladder to peer into the nest, the Flowers scraped a stick around the bottom of the tree to let the barn owl know it had visitors. Barn owls are generally gentle, unlike tawny owls which can be aggressive.&nbsp;</p> <p>Our owls are not yet nesting and were not at home when the Flowers visited. They might not have decided about their partners, but the presence of pellets in a number of boxes suggests they are thinking about it. \u201cThey\u2019re as fussy as we are, they won\u2019t take just anybody,\u201d says Lynne.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23b53799c19dc86a08fc9cf66779c3063e0be345\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23b53799c19dc86a08fc9cf66779c3063e0be345/101_665_3931_2359/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lynne and Peter Flower check the boxes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lynne and Peter Flower check the barn owl boxes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chessie Ritchie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Our mini success is one that has been repeated all over the country. In 1987 barn owls were at their lowest ebb with around 4,500 breeding pairs, having <a href=\"https://www.barnowltrust.org.uk/barn-owl-facts/current-uk-barn-owl-population/past-barn-owl-population/\">declined by 70% since 1932</a>. Now there are up to an estimated <a href=\"https://www.thinkwildlife.org/downloads/\">12,000 breeding pairs</a> in the UK. </p> <p>Historically, these distinctive birds with their heart-shaped faces, demonic shriek and silent flight, would have been a farmer\u2019s friend because they gobble up rodents. Special \u201cowl windows\u201d were even created in barns to encourage them to nestle in between beams and loft spaces. But from the mid 1800s, agriculture was intensified and tussocky grasses full of mice and shrews were ironed out.&nbsp;</p> <p>In 1988 their fortunes started to change again thanks to the work of Colin Sawyer, who set up the Barn Owl Conservation Network with the aim of doubling the population by 2020. For the first decade his team focused on recreating habitats but by the mid-1990s he realised it was nesting sites barn owls needed the most \u2013 old barns had been demolished or renovated, and councils had chopped down cavernous old trees where the birds might have lived.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f7344ee9552e12e9e86af74113c5913d54eea88f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7344ee9552e12e9e86af74113c5913d54eea88f/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Flowers check another box.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Looking for signs of life in one of the nesting boxes on the farm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chessie Ritchie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More than 20,000 boxes have been put up nationally, with Sawyer installing 4,000 personally. \u201cIt\u2019s still a great privilege to get up to a box and see it\u2019s being used, with five chicks looking out at you. We are fortunate, as it is a species that has big charisma and appeal,\u201d he says.&nbsp;</p> <p>Every county in the UK has someone putting up barn owl boxes. In 2013, Kent Wildlife Trust decided the barn owl would be its <a href=\"https://www.kentwildlifetrust.org.uk/blog/gordon-miller/barn-owls\">flagship species</a> \u2013 the logic was that promoting habitats for barn owls was good for lots of other wildlife too \u2013 and built aabout 40 boxes around the Sevenoaks area, during which time the population has increased.</p> <p>Lots of barn owls are nesting late this year. Historically, owl numbers rose and fell with field vole populations. Sawyer says: \u201cOnce upon a time I could predict from one year to the next when they\u2019d start breeding and how successful they\u2019d be. In the past six years it\u2019s been all over the show.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s not sure why these changes are happening, but says it could be down to climatic extremes.</p> <p>Lockdown may be good for barn owls \u2013 reduced noise from traffic may allow them to hunt more efficiently and there will probably have been fewer road deaths. \u201cLots of barn owls are killed on the road because they\u2019re not looking \u2013 they\u2019re listening and looking at the ground,\u201d says Lynne.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"334e4c5fe049db42574d57eb74cde75951b10c7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/334e4c5fe049db42574d57eb74cde75951b10c7e/0_367_4518_2710/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A barn owl in flight\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A barn owl in flight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: smharperphotography/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Owls look quite angelic but they live a savage existence, never far from hunger. They incubate eggs as soon as they lay them so the birth of their chicks is staggered; in tough years only the oldest will survive and the rest will starve. In times of plenty the whole brood flourishes. They feed their chicks for 50 days, by which time they need space to stretch their legs and gain strength, which is why some of the more elaborate nest boxes have little balconies attached.&nbsp;</p> <p>Barn owls are modern families. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that a pair might become quite loyal to a box and while they\u2019re pairing up&nbsp;and mating, they\u2019ll be in the box. If a female starts laying, the male will often roost somewhere else,\u201d says Lynne. \u201cOnce they\u2019ve got young he will definitely move somewhere else and he will bring in food. When the young get really big she will also roost somewhere else possibly, so all these roost sites are really important to them.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f4bdd0944ef14f314103b8e6b1d0fc1d4f8ba5cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4bdd0944ef14f314103b8e6b1d0fc1d4f8ba5cb/0_213_4992_2995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barn owl chicks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barn owl chicks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ann and Steve Toon/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like much of the country, Kent has got its barn owls back, and their boxes are an eccentric addition to the countryside. Andrew Lewis, who lives in Sevenoaks, got in touch with the Guardian to share his lockdown picture of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/30/wildlife-through-the-window-what-readers-have-spotted-during-lockdown-aoe\">local barn owl hunting</a> on the fields next to his residential street. The fields have been left fallow and barn owls are now regular visitors.&nbsp;</p> <p>He says: \u201cWe do sometimes feel like frauds when watching wildlife diaries at the end of David Attenborough, as they explain the trials and tribulations of capturing footage. We sit down with a cup of tea until the owl appears and then I change out of my dressing gown, nip down to the back fence and get some photos while it spends up to an hour hunting.\u201d</p> <p>Through an army of dedicated local volunteers, Sawyer\u2019s ambitious targets have been smashed: barn owl numbers have nearly tripled and he doubts they will be able to climb much higher. Up to 80% of barn owls now nest in man-made boxes.&nbsp;\u201cIf all those boxes fell down we\u2019d probably see extinction. I don\u2019t know of any other species that is so reliant on one component of their habitat \u2013 a nest box \u2013 for their survival, and that\u2019s all done by people,\u201d says Sawyer.</p> <p><em>Find more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction\">age of extinction coverage here</a>, and follow biodiversity reporters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phoeb0?lang=en\">Phoebe Weston</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgreenfielduk?lang=en\">Patrick Greenfield</a> on Twitter for all the latest news and features</em></p>",
  "<p>The nurse who told Marija she was still pregnant thought she was giving her patient good news. She chided Marija, who was seven weeks along, for not starting her vitamins sooner and sent her home.&nbsp;</p> <p>But Marija (not her real name) was devastated. Six days earlier, she had tried to terminate the pregnancy with abortion pills she ordered online. But she had experienced terrible morning sickness throughout her pregnancy, and had thrown up after taking the first of the two pills. She was worried the medication had not had time to work before she vomited. After taking the second pill and bleeding for a few days, she went to the hospital to find out if she had miscarried.</p> <p>Marija could not tell the nurse about the pills. Abortion is illegal in all circumstances in Malta, the only EU country that has a total ban on the procedure with no exceptions for rape, incest, foetal abnormality or the health of the mother. It is also highly taboo in the staunchly Catholic island nation. So Marija listened to the advice about the pregnancy the nurse thought was wanted, went home and booked a flight to the UK.</p> <p>In mid-February, Marjia flew to London to have a surgical abortion at a Marie Stopes clinic in Ealing. She travelled alone, staying two nights in a hotel before flying home. The pills had cost \u20ac100. Overall, the trip cost \u20ac1,500, equivalent to a month\u2019s salary for the 34-year-old accountant. She split the fee with her boyfriend.&nbsp;</p> <p>A month later, Marija\u2019s journey would have been all but impossible. Malta officially closed its borders as part of its coronavirus lockdown on 11 March, in effect also shutting any legal route to abortion. Currently, ordering pills online is the only way to terminate a pregnancy on the island, and it is a criminal offence.&nbsp;</p> <p>If Marija had not been able to get out before the borders closed, \u201cI think I would be dead by now\u201d she says \u2013 rendered suicidal by the idea of having to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I saw that positive test, I was so scared and trapped. You don\u2019t think properly, you don\u2019t have anywhere to go. You\u2019re stuck here.\u201d</p> <p>The Abortion Support Network, a charity that helps people travel from Malta, Gibraltar and Poland to access abortions in countries with more liberal laws, saw a dramatic increase in calls to its hotline when borders closed in March. \u201cThe contacts we are getting are a lot more frantic,\u201d says the network\u2019s founder, Mara Clarke.</p> <p>At the moment, the charity is advising women who are under the 12-week cut-off point for a medical abortion to order abortion pills online from Women on Web and Women Help Women, which distribute the medication worldwide, usually for a donated fee.&nbsp;</p> <p>There are indications that a very small number have been able to leave the island for an abortion during the pandemic, but the overwhelming majority are turning to abortion pills. Women Help Women told the Guardian demand from Malta had tripled since the pandemic began.&nbsp;</p> <p>Malta\u2019s abortion law dates to the British colonial period. Under the criminal code, anyone who seeks or assists with a termination can be sentenced to up to three years in prison. But prosecutions are rare.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThis pandemic has cemented how dire the situation is, how desperate women are, how absolutely ugly it is to have a total ban,\u201d says Lara Dimitrijevic, a lawyer and founder of the Women\u2019s Rights Foundation.&nbsp;</p> <p>But Dimitrijevic and many other activists point out that the travel ban has merely accentuated an existing problem, where legal abortion is only available to those who can afford a flight out of the country.</p> <p>\u201cThe women who would generally travel now have to resort to a situation where they have to purchase pills,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have to become criminals.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke puts it more bluntly: \u201cNow almost everybody knows what it\u2019s like to be a poor woman living in a country with a bad abortion law.\u201d</p> <p>The Women\u2019s Rights Foundation is part of the first wave of abortion activism ever to take place in Malta and has been joined by a handful of advocates for change, grouped under the collective Voice for Choice which organised Malta\u2019s first ever demonstration against the abortion ban in September last year.</p> <p>Isabel Stabile, the only openly pro-choice gynaecologist in Malta, and a member of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Drs4ChoiceMalta/videos/1553211164832013/\">Doctors for Choice</a>, says she has seen an increase in patients seeking advice about unwanted pregnancies.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe vast majority of them have had terrible stories, stories on the lines of, \u2018I\u2019ve got a diagnosis of a serious congenital anomaly and the [Maltese] National Health Service won\u2019t do anything about it, because the law is what it is \u2013 can you help me?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The well-travelled route from Valletta to London for those needing abortions mirrors the journeys of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/03/why-irelands-battle-over-abortion-is-far-from-over-anti-abortionists\">thousands who had to leave Ireland</a> and Northern Ireland to end unwanted pregnancies before liberalisation in those countries.&nbsp;</p> <p>Charmaine (not her real name), who travelled to the UK from Malta to end a pregnancy in 2011, describes her country as \u201clike Ireland on steroids\u201d when it comes to abortion \u2013 \u201cin terms of how small we are, how tight-knit we are, how difficult it is to to leave the country\u201d.</p> <p>Many in the Maltese pro-choice movement point to the case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/08/abortion-refusal-death-ireland-hindu-woman\">Savita Halappanavar,</a> who died of septicaemia after doctors in an Irish hospital refused her a termination while she was miscarrying in 2012. There have been close calls in Malta too \u2013&nbsp;in 2014, Canadian holidaymaker <a href=\"https://womenforwomenmalta.com/2019/09/26/welcome-to-womenforwomen/\">Marion Mifsud Mora</a> was refused a termination after her waters broke at 17 weeks\u2019 gestation, and she had to be flown out of the country to end the pregnancy and fight off the ensuing infection.&nbsp;</p> <p>Marija has not told anyone except her boyfriend about her abortion. \u201cHere, even if you say the word that you agree with abortion, they look at you sideways,\u201d she says.&nbsp;</p> <p>No one interviewed for this article who had had an abortion wanted their real name used, mainly because family support would not be available. \u201cIf my father knew I had an abortion \u2026 I\u2019m sure he would disown me,\u201d Charmaine says.</p> <p>Anti-abortion sentiment cuts across Maltese social and economic lines. Even university students are <a href=\"https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/majority-of-university-students-oppose-abortion-study-indicates.705555\">mostly opposed</a> to it. Children are still shown the notorious 1984 anti-abortion film, The Silent Scream, as part of sex education.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d66a00bbe6d3d196e516f2cfb2083453fcbe1d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d66a00bbe6d3d196e516f2cfb2083453fcbe1d5/1352_640_3785_2271/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-abortion demonstrators in Malta\u2019s capital Valletta, protesting at the legalising of over-the-counter emergency contraception\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-abortion demonstrators in Malta\u2019s capital, Valletta, protesting at the legalising of over-the-counter emergency contraception.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darrin Zammit Lupi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dimitrijevic says she has had bullets left at her home for her pro-choice stance, and had her car tyres slashed. Mina Tolu, who ran unsuccessfully on a Green party ticket during the 2019 European parliament elections, was hit with a wave of online vitriol after releasing a video which challenged Maltese politicians to discuss abortion. One of the party\u2019s co-founders quit in protest.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot prepare yourself for those comments. I regret not having had a strong enough support network to help me get over the barrage,\u201d Tolu says.</p> <p>But the fault lines have changed over time. Alfred Sant, who served as Malta\u2019s prime minister in the 1990s and is now an MEP, has seen it firsthand.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the government started stocking contraceptive pills in state clinics in the late 70s or early 80s, all hell broke loose,\u201d the veteran politician recalls. \u201cThen a few years ago, the controversy focused on legalising the morning-after pill.\u201d</p> <p>Sant, 72, describes himself as \u201cleaning towards pro-choice\u201d but qualifies that by saying that the issue is \u201cnot a cut and dried one\u201d. He was the only one of Malta\u2019s six MEPs to vote in favour of a <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/B-9-2020-0148_EN.html\">resolution</a> in March which called on EU member states not to use the pandemic as an excuse to restrict reproductive health services.</p> <p>\u201cIn private, people admit that there\u2019s a hypocrisy to our stance. Politicians, too,\u201d Sant says. \u201cThey know that Maltese are going abroad to get abortions and that there are local doctors who recommend abortions. They admit that there are scenarios when abortion is justified. But they won\u2019t say so publicly.\u201d</p> <p>He believes the public mood is gradually shifting and says it is \u201cinevitable\u201d that abortion will eventually be legalised.</p> <p>But that looks unlikely during this political term. Former prime minister Joseph Muscat, who resigned in January after the scandal surrounding the murder of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, hinted that he would push for a <a href=\"https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/muscat-wants-national-debate-on-abortion.762723\">national debate</a> on abortion in his resignation speech. But his successor, Robert Abela, poured cold water on that notion, <a href=\"https://newsbook.com.mt/en/prime-minister-abela-declares-his-opposition-to-muscat-if-he-intends-working-to-introduce-abortion/\">affirming his anti-abortion</a> stance immediately afterwards. President <a href=\"https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/president-to-speak-at-anti-abortion-manifestation.766645\">George Vella</a>, a former doctor, vehemently opposes legalisation, and has <a href=\"https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/president-to-speak-at-anti-abortion-manifestation.766645\">spoken at anti-abortion rallies</a>.</p> <p>Malta is due to reopen its borders on 1 July. But that does not mean accessing abortion overseas will suddenly be easy. Currently, the list of 17 countries to which travel will be permitted does not include the main destinations for abortions \u2013 the UK, the Netherlands, Spain and Belgium.</p>",

Most others \u2013 including the Coalition, Labor and the Greens \u2013 united against the attempt to suspend standing orders.</p> \n  <p>But it\u2019s worth noting that the conservative Liberal party senator <strong>Jim Molan</strong> stepped out of the chamber immediately before the division on Hanson\u2019s motion and returned straight after the result was read out, 51 votes to 2. It looked very much like he abstained rather than voting with his government colleagues \u2013 but we\u2019re chasing a comment from his office.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T06:44:53.525Z\">at 7.44am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee1d0f68f0875833522a116\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T06:38:47.710Z\">7.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Patricia Karvelas:</strong> Just finally, there\u2019s something significant that\u2019s happened in the Senate. <strong>Pauline Hanson</strong> was trying to get her motion up, the all lives matter motion. The government, the Greens, Labor, minor parties ensured that never did go to a vote. Why did you all work together on that?</p> \n  <p><strong>Concetta Fierravanti-Wells:</strong></p> \n  <p>I have to say I\u2019m on leave at the moment, so I haven\u2019t been in the chamber. So I\u2019m not fully across what\u2019s happened this afternoon in relation to that. <strong>In relation to this, can I just say all lives matter.</strong> And therefore as far as I\u2019m concerned, I have to say that the activities that we\u2019ve seen, particularly of some of the protesters at a time when we are in these very difficult circumstances, I think has demonstrated a degree of irresponsibility.</p> \n  <p><strong>Karvelas:</strong> That\u2019s the language of senator Hanson\u2019s motion that all lives matter. The reason the movement is called Black Lives Matter is black people around the world and in the US are disproportionately represented in these kinds of cases, with the police and the justice system. That\u2019s why the movement exists because there is a different treatment.</p> \n  <p><strong>Fierravanti-Wells</strong></p> \n  <p>Patricia, can I just say I respect the right of people to express their point of view and to protest. The point being at this point in time, given what we are going through, it wasn\u2019t the appropriate thing to do. I appreciate events in the US. Can I also say in relation to the events in the US, I think we do need to distinguish what\u2019s happening in the US and what\u2019s happening in other parts of the world. I do respect this issue but at this particular point in time I would have liked to have seen a lot more responsibility on the part of Australians and I know this is an issue that a lot of Australians are very upset about. There are people who weren\u2019t able to go to weddings and mourn their families.</p> \n  <p><strong>Karvelas: </strong>I\u2019m talking about the substantive issue: black lives matter. That\u2019s because black people are not treated the same in the justice system. Do you agree with that?</p> \n  <p><strong>Fierravanti-Wells</strong></p> \n  <p>Patricia, I think as myself being a lawyer; I think the justice system has served us well in Australia. As I have said, I think in the end what is really important is that all Australians have the opportunity to be their best. And that includes most especially having a job and so therefore the focus of our government has been on ensuring jobs, jobs, jobs. That means jobs for all Australians.</p> \n  <p><strong>Karvelas: </strong>You say the justice system as the served our nation well. Do you think it has served Indigenous Australians well?</p> \n  <p><strong>Fierravanti-Wells</strong></p> \n  <p>I think it has served Australia well. There are concerns and there have been concerns in relation to deaths in custody. But I think in the end when you do look at the reasons why young people go off the rails or things happen, it\u2019s because ultimately there has been a breakdown issue in their family circumstances or their economic circumstances. And as somebody who worked with Father <strong>Chris Riley</strong>, there are many things that contribute to young people or people going off the rails. So ultimately, stability and a very important component of that is work. So it is vitally important for us to have a strong economy and part of that strong economy is to ensure that as many people are in jobs as is possible.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T06:47:13.860Z\">at 7.47am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee1d06b8f08beee219d96ce\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T06:35:52.620Z\">7.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Concetta Fierravanti-Wells </strong>then says \u201cAll lives matter\u201d when asked about Pauline Hanson\u2019s motion.</p> \n  <p>SIGGGGGHHHHH.</p> \n  <p>If I have to explain to anyone, again, why all lives matter is an offensive and completely tone-deaf response to Black Lives matter, please send an email to doyourresearchandthentakealookinthemirror@gmail.com</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T06:37:18.315Z\">at 7.37am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee1cfee8f08beee219d96c9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T06:34:10.802Z\">7.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Liberal senator <strong>Concetta Fierravanti-Wells </strong>who crossed the floor to support a crossbench motion for a Senate inquiry into Australia\u2019s relationship with China, tells the ABC she doesn\u2019t believe it is smart for Australia to have so much trade with one country:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The point is it is not a good business model to put a third of your trade eggs in one basket.

Now the name of this program is the SME rxport hubs and that\u2019s probably an indication of how it operates because it is a hub which means that it services an entire region. </p> \n  <p>\u201cSo the assertion that the member is making clearly just demonstrates a very limited understanding of the program. So the SME export hubs don\u2019t just help those businesses located just next door to them; they actually assist a number of businesses across wide regions. </p> \n  <p>\u201cNow a clear example that I\u2019d like to actually put to the House, and this might also assist the member with his understanding, is that in South Australia we have Food South Australia. They received a grant to establish a hub in round one. They are explicitly offering to assist all businesses across South Australia. Now, let\u2019s be clear, it is based in a location but it provides support right across South Australia. So I would also like to take the opportunity to point out, Mr Speaker, that this is a competitive grant program. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAll applicants provided evidence of how they met the criteria through a two-stage application process. They were independently assessed.

Cancer-suffering grandfather <strong>Raymond Murphy</strong> had to sell his house and move to his shed to afford medical treatment. He said debt collectors ripped him to shreds over a $2,300 robodebt while he was in hospital. Why won\u2019t the government apologise to Mr Murphy and thousands of other Australians ... with their unlawful robodebt scheme?</p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <p>I\u2019ll ask the minister for government services to add to the answer. The business of raising and recovering debts on behalf of taxpayers is a difficult job and it deals with Australians in many very sensitive circumstances. </p> \n  <p>Of course I would deeply regret \u2013deeply regret \u2013 any hardship that has been caused to people in the conduct of that activity. The government has many difficult jobs that it has to do dealing with Australians in very sensitive circumstances and that is true particularly at this time. </p> \n  <p>It is our instruction that we would hope that all agents of the government when pursuing the debt recovery option that they would be sensitive to people\u2019s circumstances. </p> \n  <p>And in relation to the particular gentleman that you referred to, that is a very distressing situation that you have raised. <strong>I would apologise for any hurt or harm in the way that the government has dealt with that issue and to anyone else who has found themselves in those situations.</strong> </p> \n  <p>But the issue is one of ensuring how the government can best do this. Where there are lessons to be learned here they will be learned. That is what the minister for government services is employing now. I will ask the minister for government services to add to the answer.</p> \n  <p><strong>Stuart Robert:</strong></p> \n  <p>I would say to the member, if any member can refer any hardship cases through to me and I will ensure the department looks at it. Mental health and suicide, as we all know, and we all appreciate, are very delicate issues. There are many factors that go into them. Services Australia assess people facing difficult situations every day. We have the largest social services network to support people within federal government departments in times of crisis and vulnerability and we do this everyday. </p> \n  <p>As the prime minister said, the collection of debts is a lawful responsibility of all governments. Right now, just so that colleagues are aware in the House, 939,000 Australians have debts over $5bn that the government lawfully has to collect across a whole range of programs. </p> \n  <p>And governments of all persuasions have done this across the divide. The government has paused all debt collection across all programs as we work our way through the Covid crisis but government will have to restart that debt collection and will do it sensibly and do it engaging all people, do it in a very transparent manner. </p> \n  <p>It is incumbent on us all if we have constituents who are hurting or suffering, bring them through to me. All colleagues know where I am.

It was the same policy that the Labor party used and would account for some or more than 20% of the debts they raised on exactly the same basis.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>(For the millionth time, the difference is the Coalition removed the human element from the process.)</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The hypocrisy that is put forward by the Labor party when the legal issue that is involved here is about income averaging as being the basis of raising the debt. </p> \n   <p>Now, my government is not going to make \u2013 is not going to walk back from the idea that when monies have been overpaid, when benefits have been overpaid, then we owe to it taxpayers to ensure that we reclaim those debts. </p> \n   <p>Of course that is what is necessary.

Prime minister, if you don\u2019t want Black Lives Matters protests to continue, why don\u2019t you do something about institutionalised racism in this country? Will you agree with the Greens proposal to put action on black deaths in custody on the national meeting this Friday and make it a future item for the future national cabinet meetings and come up with a law so we stop locking up Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people at such high rates. </p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <p>I thank the member for the question on what is an extremely important issue and that is Indigenous deaths, whether it be in police custody or it be in custody more generally. </p> \n  <p>As the minister for Indigenous Australians pointed out yesterday this is already a matter of significant attention of not just the government but state and territory governments as well. </p> \n  <p>It previously did feature with more specific goals more broadly under justice headings in this area that related to the previous Closing the Gap objectives but as also featuring in the new reform set of Closing the Gap goals which is now coming to agreement for the first time involving the direct involvement of Indigenous peak groups in agreeing what those goals should be. </p> \n  <p>It is also the case that in NSW, for example, we are pleased that there has been progress that has been made in police custody. In NSW there has been one death in police custody, I\u2019m advised, since 2000 and in particular since 2000 when the new arrangements were put in place to provide for access for Indigenous persons who would find themselves in police custody to make those calls and get access to that legal advice.</p> \n  <p> Now the government is now funding that program over the next three years and that has proven to be a very effective mechanism to prevent deaths in police custody. </p> \n  <p>Every death in custody, and particular Indigenous deaths in custody, is an absolute national shame and tragedy and what the minister for Indigenous Australians has been working to do is also to address the contributing factors which find Indigenous Australians in custody. </p> \n  <p>You asked about the agenda of the national cabinet. When I announced the formation of the national cabinet going forward, I also announced the establishment of the national federation reform council. There are only two national taskforces that report to that council; importantly one deals with these very issues in Indigenous affairs, the other one deals with violence against women. </p> \n  <p>We all agreed, premiers, myself, chief ministers, that they were the issues that needed constant national priority and attention by the national federation reform council which brings all the key decision-makers together and for progress to be tracked against the successes that we hope to achieve in that area. So our government is very committed to action in this area. </p> \n  <p><strong>It is an important issue but when it comes to the issue of gatherings and protests, the health advice says it put other Australians\u2019 lives at risk including, in particular, Indigenous lives. </strong></p> \n  <p><strong>And I, I\u2019m sure the leader of the opposition would agree with me: \u201cDo not go to those rallies.

It is why one of the first things we did was to ensure that jobseeker would be at a sufficient level ...</p> \n  <p>What the government will continue to do is make decisions about the level of supports we provide into the economy based on the best possible advice and the best reading of the economic situation as that becomes increasingly clear.

I hope that anyone who has attended that and indeed, across Victoria, who developed symptoms that are compatible with coronavirus, really need to isolate themselves, get tested, get that result back and become well before they get out and about again.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T00:45:30.801Z\">at 1.45am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee17c7c8f08758335229efe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T00:36:44.047Z\">1.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Mike Bowers </strong>is in the building.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mpbowers/status/1270869742434189314\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Minister for Agriculture David Littleproud races from a press conference to a division in the House <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmyRemeikis?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@amyremeikis</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianAus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@guardianaus</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/politicslive?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#politicslive</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/qQLc6Wwu3c\">https://t.co/qQLc6Wwu3c</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/dRfjsxwZEm\">pic.twitter.com/dRfjsxwZEm</a></p>\u2014 Mikearoo (@mpbowers) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mpbowers/status/1270869742434189314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 11, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T00:42:35.748Z\">at 1.42am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee179be8f08beee219d9486\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T00:35:01.849Z\">1.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And to finish up that 3AW interview came this exchange between <strong>Neil Mitchell</strong> and <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>:<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> What was your attitude personally when you were getting all this [Covid] information in the early days?</p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong> Well, I knew we were in completely uncharted waters.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> Were you frightened by it?</p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison: </strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I don\u2019t know if I put it that way.

But, you know, the way that was done and the suggestion that they might do it again, sort of, I think, risks public support for even the issue they raise.

This is off the back of Black Lives Matter. In London, the mayor is saying that every monument is now up for review and one of the statues in the UK with a question mark now is of Captain <strong>James Cook</strong>.

And while slave ships continued to travel around the world, when Australia was established yes, sure, it was a pretty brutal settlement. </p> \n   <p>My forefathers and foremothers were on the first and second fleets. It was a pretty brutal place, <strong>but there was no slavery in Australia</strong>. </p> \n   <p>And so I think what we\u2019re seeing with some of these protests, they start on a fair point when they\u2019re raising issues about, you know, people\u2019s treatment in custody or things like that. </p> \n   <p>Fair, fair issue. </p> \n   <p><strong>But now it\u2019s being taken over by other much more politically driven leftwing agendas, which are seeking to take advantage of these opportunities to push their political causes.</strong> And, you know, we\u2019ve got to ... <strong>I\u2019ve always said we\u2019ve got to be honest about our history. </strong>We\u2019ve got to acknowledge the positive and the negative. </p> \n   <p>But, you know, <strong>I think we\u2019ve also got to respect our history as well.

Do we need to be upfront, PM, now, about the fact that some other industries will not have jobkeeper until September as first indicated?</p> \n  <p><strong>Scott Morrison:</strong> <strong>Well, I don\u2019t know why people are suggesting that.</strong> Childcare was a fairly special case because we had moved to that free childcare arrangement. What has been done is that the normal fee arrangements have come back but when working with the childcare sector, when there was a choice between going with ongoing jobkeeper or a 25% subsistence payment to the sector \u2013 so we\u2019re talking about the same amount of support which means more employees will be helped in our consultations \u2013 that was seen as the better way forward. So I think this is a very special case. Jobkeeper is there until the end of September. </p> \n  <p><strong>Q:</strong> What about industries other than childcare? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison: </strong>Well, there are no other sort of special arrangements like we had in childcare so we\u2019ve dealt with that one quite specifically.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Will jobkeeper remain until the end of September for everyone else?</p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong> Well, I\u2019ve already said that.

But it later became clear that between 1,500 and 2,000 cases arrived from Italy and Spain in the first two weeks of that month. At the time, the modellers assumed about two-thirds of infected people coming into the UK were not being identified, but Ferguson said a more accurate figure was about 90%.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Sage committee recommended that travellers should be tested when arriving from countries that had been identified as having active transmission, but the scale of the risks from Italy and Spain were not appreciated at the time. \u201cWe frankly underestimated how far into the epidemic the country was,\u201d Ferguson said.</p>",
  "<p>Growing up, we didn\u2019t feel as if the police were there to protect us.&nbsp;We were always fearful of the police; we couldn\u2019t walk around in large groups because that would attract them, and we were often subject to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/sep/21/sus-law-black-youths-london\">\u201csus\u201d (\u201csuspected person\u201d) law</a>. </p> <p>When I joined the force in 1983, it came as a total surprise to my parents. I knew people from my background would see me as a sellout for joining the organisation that made us feel unsafe. A lot of my friends were very hostile towards me, whether they\u2019d had experience with the police or not.</p> <p>At the time, many police officers were very militaristic. The first few months at Hendon training school were a real culture shock and I felt as if I was questioning my sanity. I found it really difficult to comprehend that the police were meant to be a public service. I started street duties as a constable in Islington, in north London, where I had grown up, and I got more of a sense of comfort with the community than working with my colleagues. It was an us-and-them mentality and I found the police to be quite insensitive to the community, especially the black community.</p> <p>Initially, they didn\u2019t really want me, as a black police officer, to express my individuality. You had to be part of the team, you had to assimilate, not integrate. They didn\u2019t want me to use my cultural understanding of the community; they wanted me to put that to one side.</p> <p>When the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/institutional-racism-britain-stephen-lawrence-inquiry-20-years\">Stephen Lawrence inquiry</a> was published in 1999, it was a watershed moment that led to a cultural change and a lot more informed thinking within the police. There was a reduction in casual racism and explicit comments. I remember once going for a job on the crime squad when I was a PC and someone told me my face \u201cdidn\u2019t fit\u201d, for example. If you complained, they would say: \u201cIf you can\u2019t take a joke you shouldn\u2019t join.\u201d Sometimes I feel like we have gone back to that era.</p> <p>When I first saw the video of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/09/george-floyd-buried-black-lives-matter-trump-coronavirus-live\">George Floyd</a> being killed, I was disgusted, especially because it was a police officer who did it. It looked<strong> </strong>like sadistic torture, so slow and deliberate. It is one of the most brutal acts I\u2019ve seen from a police officer. Derek Chauvin let down all the current officers around the world and even the retired ones like me. I felt devastated; it actually made me cry.&nbsp;</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t surprised that Floyd\u2019s death created such an outrage and a sense of social injustice around the world. People want to ensure that their voices are heard \u2013 and it is a diverse group of people too. It reminds me of when I was a youngster, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/gallery/2017/aug/12/flares-and-fury-the-battle-of-lewisham-1977\">in the 1970s, when the National Front was </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/gallery/2017/aug/12/flares-and-fury-the-battle-of-lewisham-1977\">big</a>. On marches, people would sing: \u201cBlack and white unite and fight the National Front.\u201d It brought black and white people together to protest and it\u2019s the same thing now.</p> <p>Most of the people in Bristol who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/the-guardian-view-on-colstons-statue-a-long-time-in-going\">dragged down the Edward Colston statue</a> were white. They want to get rid of those images, sites, buildings and statues that show the inhumanity of the past and the inequalities it has caused. I don\u2019t want to condone creating damage or committing crimes but you have got to understand what\u2019s behind it: people are putting social justice before social distancing.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the UK, we have a different style of containment to that of the US. When I attended the march on Wednesday 3 June, the police stepped back. When we started the march&nbsp;from Hyde Park&nbsp;to Parliament Square, and then up to Trafalgar Square, there didn\u2019t seem to be any officers controlling the junctions or walking alongside \u2013 they held back and left people to their own devices. By Saturday, gathering together to march had been deemed unlawful, but people still turned up. It created more of a siege mentality between the protesting public and the police.</p> <p>In 2017, we had a case in Hackney, where I used to work as a sergeant, that also resonated with me. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/24/rashan-charles-decision-prosecute-police-officer-death-black-man\">young man called Rashan Charles</a>&nbsp;was chased into a shop because an officer felt he was involved with drug supply. He died after the officer restrained him on the floor. The jury ruled his death to be accidental, caused by an obstruction to his airway \u201cby a foreign body during a period of restraint\u201d [a half-swallowed packet of caffeine and paracetamol]. Charles\u2019s great-uncle, also a former police chief inspector, branded the inquest \u201ca farce\u201d.&nbsp;Not all such cases spark an uprising the way <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jun/10/mark-duggan-shooting-can-forensic-tech-cast-doubt-on-official-report\">the shooting of Mark Duggan did in 2011</a>, but we are far from out of the woods.</p> <p>I used to tell officers: \u201cEvery single time you encounter someone and you don\u2019t treat them with respect and dignity, that is another person who resents us. That\u2019s another person who might not work with us to solve a crime, that\u2019s another person who might not want to go to court.\u201d I set up a youth leadership program called <a href=\"https://voyageyouth.com/\">Voyage Youth</a> almost 20 years ago. Every single year, the youngsters taking part would say they felt overpoliced and underprotected. The current protests could be another watershed moment in Britain \u2013 I hope Boris Johnson is paying attention.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was updated on 12 June 2020 to explain the foreign body that blocked Rashan Charles\u2019s airway.</p>",

While Wallace went on to win four races and finish third in the standings a year later, a young Japanese American named Kyle Larson was blazing his own historic trail two notches higher in the Cup series. Even when Wallace drove his first ever race for RPM in 2017, the first Cup start by a black driver in 11 years, he was more than six months behind the groundbreaking debut of Mexico\u2019s Daniel Suarez.</p> <p>And when Wallace signed a multi-year contract to race for RPM ahead of the following season on the way to becoming the first black pilot to race in the Cup series full-time since 1971 \u2013 as the late Wendell Scott, the first ever black pilot, was winding down a career fraught with unstinting verbal abuse, unrelenting physical threats, constant financial hardship and chronic on-track fraud \u2013 Wallace replaced Cuban American pioneer Aric Almirola. At every turn, it seemed, there was always a driver to overshadow the only man on the grid who, even though born to a black mother and a white father, proudly identified as a black man.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a9818fb538e67790918c0dcca74d43ea44a98b55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9818fb538e67790918c0dcca74d43ea44a98b55/0_0_2944_1963/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bubba Wallace\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bubba Wallace drives a Chevy Camaro bathed in matte black paint with the phrase \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d on Wednesday night in Martinsville.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Carr/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But over the last seven years, the thin traffic ahead of Wallace has grown even thinner. Danica, retired since 2018, is a full-on yoga brand now. Larson \u2013 an unwitting racist, ironically \u2013 is on indefinite sabbatical. Suarez and Almirola have struggled to maintain relevance amid mediocre results. All of this would leave Nascar\u2019s narrow progressive lane wide open. Still: If anyone tells you they not only saw Wallace charging into that lane with as much momentum as he did this week, but also Nascar trailing behind closely enough to get sucked into the 21st century at warp speed, quite frankly, they\u2019re lying.</p> <p>Like many of his black peers across sports, Wallace would be moved to speak out against systemic racism as Black Lives Matter demonstrations erupted in all 50 states and spread around the world after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on the neck of an unarmed black motorist named George Floyd for eight minutes and 46 seconds until the 46-year-old father of five lay dead in the street.&nbsp;</p> <p>But instead of distilling his frustrations in a black square or an MLK quote on his social media feeds, Wallace went on white TV and did not hold back. On Monday, Wallace <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_aSKRvZhQ\">appeared on CNN Tonight</a> to discuss the conversations he had with his fellow drivers before they released a video condemning racism before last Sunday\u2019s Cup race in Atlanta. When host Don Lemon asked him what more the sport should do to walk the talk, Wallace did not stutter. \u201cMy next step would be to get rid of all Confederate flags,\u201d he said. \u201cGet them out of here.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The many gearheads who see the flag as an expression of Southern pride are not trying to hear the part about it how it\u2019s actually a vestigial banner of black enslavement</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Make no mistake: these are fightin\u2019 words in Nascar, a sport that\u2019s as tightly wrapped in the rebel banner as the NFL is in the winning one. The many gearheads who see the flag as an expression of Southern pride are not trying to hear the part about it how it\u2019s actually a vestigial banner of black enslavement.

Even if a track\u2019s army of blue-haired volunteers manages to turn back a few of these rebels at the gate, there are still acres of grassy parking space around the track for rebel tailgaters to let their freak flag fly. You\u2019re telling me the local police who are regularly tasked with keeping the peace at races are gonna be the ones hauling off these tailgaters kicking and screaming?</p> <p>More to the point: How long before Wallace\u2019s #BlackLivesMatter car is followed by an #AllLivesMatter car or a #BlueLivesMatter car? Given that how recently the Cup field has featured cars shouting paid endorsements of the Tea Party, Rick Santorum\u2019s 2012 president campaign and, of course, Trump/Pence, Nascar could find its tracks looking as bitter and wounded as its social feeds did immediately after the governing body\u2019s statement announcing the flag ban went viral. Surely, the sport will be poorer without truck driver Ray Ciccarelli, a perennial backmarker who left the job of announcing his Nascar exit to his wife, Sarah. \u201cWe will not participate in the sport after 2020 season is over,\u201d she <a href=\"https://www.al.com/motorsports/2020/06/nascars-ray-ciccarelli-posts-not-all-people-who-care-for-confederate-flag-are-racist-says-hes-quitting-sport.html\">wrote on Facebook</a> under his name. \u201cI could care less about the Confederate Flag but there are ppl that do and it doesn\u2019t make them a racist ... i ain\u2019t spend the money we are to participate in any political BS!! So everything is for SALE!!\u201d</p> <p>Granted, the notion of the Nascar track as a fresh beachhead in the culture wars hardly jibes with the vision Joe Gibbs once hoped for his second sport either. \u201cNascar,\u201d the legendary football coach turned stock car team owner told me, \u201cshould be for everyone.\u201d That was six years ago, when Wallace was driving for Gibbs in the truck series. And while that rosy pairing \u2013 between the coach who won the second of his three Super Bowls with a black quarterback and the kid who was once touted as Nascar\u2019s Charley Pride \u2013 ultimately ran its course, it wasn\u2019t for lack of success. In fact, the first victory they ever celebrated together was at Martinsville \u2013 a circuit that lies just 30 miles west from where Wendell Scott was born and buried, and a town that was once the venue for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martinsville_Seven\">one of this country\u2019s greatest miscarriages of justice</a>. That on-track race win, some six years old now, wasn\u2019t lost on history. This off-track race win shouldn\u2019t be either.</p>",
  "<p>In 1998, Christopher Alder, a former British army paratrooper, was injured during a fight and ended up in hospital. He was then arrested for a breach of the peace and<a href=\"https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/christopher-alder-george-floyd-death-4195831\"> taken to Queens Gardens police station in Hull</a>. CCTV footage shows him lying face down on the floor of the station, motionless, with his trousers around his ankles. Officers stand around laughing while he lies there, dying, for 10 minutes.</p> <p>Three years later, an inquest returned a verdict of unlawful killing \u2013 because the officers did nothing while, for three minutes of that time, Alder was unable to breathe. A year later, five police officers were prosecuted for manslaughter and misconduct in public office. All were acquitted on the direction of the judge. A review by the Independent Police Complaints Commission in 2006 concluded that four of the officers present were guilty of the \u201cmost serious neglect\u201d and \u201cunwitting racism\u201d. To add insult to injury, in 2011, Alder\u2019s family learned that they had buried a woman instead of Christopher.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is a shocking case of a death in police custody \u2013 but of course it is not the only one. In the past weeks, as protesters have taken to the streets, some of the names of those who have died have been on demonstrators\u2019 lips and placards.<strong> </strong>Among them is Sean Rigg, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/01/sean-rigg-five-officers-cleared-of-misconduct-over-death-in-custody\">died at Brixton police station in 2008</a>. An inquest found police had used \u201cunsuitable force\u201d. One officer was prosecuted, for giving false evidence; he was found not guilty. No other officer was prosecuted.</p> <p>In 2011, Kingsley Burrell died while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/may/15/kingsley-burrell-restrained-by-police-died-from-neglect-inquest-finds\">detained by police at a mental health unit in Birmingham</a>. An inquest found that prolonged restraint had been a significant factor. Again, three officers prosecuted for lying under oath were found not guilty. In 2017, Darren Cumberbatch was punched repeatedly, beaten&nbsp;with a baton and Tasered&nbsp;by police.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-48764711\">An inquest found police force was \u201cexcessive\u201d and \u201cprobably avoidable\u201d</a>. His family&nbsp;are still waiting to&nbsp;hear&nbsp;if anybody will be prosecuted. Just over two weeks ago, Simeon Francis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/england-police-watchdog-investigates-death-of-man-in-custody\">was found dead in a cell in Devon</a>. We know little about the circumstances, and I fear that his family won\u2019t be getting answers any time soon.</p> <p>Since 1969, just one police officer has been convicted for their role in the death of someone in their care (and in that case, the officer received a suspended sentence). That is not to say there haven\u2019t been prosecutions \u2013 but the evidence has never been sufficient to persuade a jury that a police officer should be responsible.&nbsp;</p> <p>Why is this?&nbsp;Well, invariably, in such cases the only witnesses are other police officers; there may also be CCTV and some medical or forensic evidence. In the civilian world, friends will give evidence against friends in the most serious of crimes, but after three decades working in criminal law, I cannot recall a death-in-custody case where a police officer has given evidence against another police officer. Juries are loth to convict police officers generally, but the tendency is especially stark in these cases. One successful prosecution of an individual in 50 years tells its own story.</p> <p>Of course, deaths in custody are only a small percentage of deaths following police contact, which include apparent suicides and police shootings, among other categories. Well-known examples include Rashan Charles, who died after being chased and restrained; Edson Da Costa, who died of cardiorespiratory arrest after being stopped by police; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jun/10/mark-duggan-shooting-can-forensic-tech-cast-doubt-on-official-report\">Mark Duggan, whose shooting sparked riots in 2011</a>. Nor will I soon forget how Zahid Mubarek was murdered by his racist cellmate Robert Stewart at Feltham Young Offenders Institution. They were housed together despite the fact that Stewart\u2019s hostility to BAME people was widely known.</p> <p>It is true that many other people die in police custody, but <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/52890363\">black people account for 8% of these deaths</a>, while accounting for only 3% of the population. They are dying disproportionately and the perception remains that race leads to a different outcome, which is often premature death.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Partly this is because this is merely the end point of a system that disproportionately suspects, arrests, charges, remands, convicts and imprisons people from black, Asian and other ethnic minority communities. A David Cameron-commissioned report by David Lammy found in 2017 that the colour of your skin has a measurable impact on how you are treated at every stage in the justice system.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"749fdf6be1d51fd9c6d947f30ff3d63fa033591c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/749fdf6be1d51fd9c6d947f30ff3d63fa033591c/0_0_1942_2425/801.jpg\" alt=\"Zahid Mubarek, who was victim of a brutal racially aggrevated murder in March 2000 while detained at Feltham Young Offenders Institution for shoplifting.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zahid Mubarek, who was victim of a brutal racially aggrevated murder in March 2000 while detained at Feltham Young Offenders Institution for shoplifting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teri Pengilley/Teri Pengilley (commissioned)</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So, for instance, at a time when <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/576554/youth-justice-review-government-response-print.pdf\">the stated determination of the government</a> has been to divert young offenders from the formal criminal justice approach, the proportion of young BAME prisoners has gone up, from 25% in 2006 to 41%. The numbers offending and reoffending also rose. Historically, stop-and-search powers have disproportionately targeted BAME people. In 2015, in response to widespread alarm, the Home Office and police tightened training and guidance of police officers, which instantly reduced the numbers being arrested. However, following a spate of knife crime, the rules were again changed and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/oct/18/more-bame-people-likely-to-be-targeted-under-relaxed-stop-and-search-rules\">the numbers have </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/oct/18/more-bame-people-likely-to-be-targeted-under-relaxed-stop-and-search-rules\">moved back</a> up to historic highs.</p> <p>Between April 2018 and March 2019, there were four stop and searches for every 1,000 white people, and 38 for every for 1,000 black people. Lammy\u2019s analysis of sentencing data showed BAME defendants were more likely to receive prison sentences for drug offences, even when previous convictions were taken into account. This was reinforced by research commissioned by <a href=\"https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/publications/item/investigating-the-association-between-an-offenders-sex-and-ethnicity-and-the-sentence-imposed-at-the-crown-court-for-drug-offences/\">the Sentencing Council published in January</a>, which showed that if you are from a minority you are 1.5 times more likely to go to prison for drugs offences than if you are white.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lammy\u2019s report proved in effect that if you placed a white man and a BAME man in the same predicament with the same previous history, with the same or similar evidence, the BAME man was more likely to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/08/david-lammy-review-bame-children-face-prejudice-flawed-criminal-justice-system\">stopped, arrested, charged, denied bail, convicted and sentenced to prison</a>. Then, while in prison, he was less likely to be supported to rehabilitate, more likely to reoffend and more likely to die in custody \u2013 and his family were less likely to get justice following that death.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lammy recommended urgent reform. However, three years later, there is not one BAME chief constable \u2013 in fact there has only ever been one. Until very recently, there were no BAME commissioners dealing with miscarriages of justice and not one member of the 240-strong parole board was BAME. There has never been a BAME director of public prosecutions and the number of BAME judges and magistrates, while it is increasing from a very low base, is still well below the proportion that will reflect the communities they serve. When I was chief crown prosecutor and then chief executive of the country\u2019s police and crime commissioners, I would often sit in meetings of criminal justice leaders and be the only non-white person in the room apart from the person taking the minutes.</p> <p>I was born in Britain, to a family that has&nbsp;worked with the British army for half a century, one of whom was murdered by the IRA for doing so. I have spent much of my professional career tackling crimes and misbehaviours in all communities regardless of race or religion, yet I too have been subject to racism in the course of my work.</p> <p>One of the last things I did as a prosecutor was to ensure that the district judge Richard Hollingworth could no longer preside over criminal cases. This came about because of his response when one of my team was trying to fix a trial date to accommodate the victim, Miss Patel. \u201cIt won\u2019t be a problem,\u201d said Hollingworth. \u201cShe won\u2019t be working anywhere important where she can\u2019t get the time off. She\u2019ll only be working in a shop or off-licence.\u201d Where she was working was irrelevant. As it happens, she was a law graduate, but his prejudice was there for all to see.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>When I was less senior, I recall asking another judge to bail the defendant because he had no previous convictions. I was wrong, the judge said. I replied that there was nothing on the police national computer. But he was adamant. It was a busy \u201cfirst appearance\u201d list so I hadn\u2019t seen the defendant come up from the cells behind me. I looked and saw he was a young black man. I knew what the judge was saying and I gave him a stare that told him I knew and he should back off. He did.&nbsp;</p> <p>I recall prosecuting a case where I, the defence counsel, the judge, the usher, the court legal adviser, the defence solicitor, the court stenographer and the security were all BAME and the defendant was white. How we all laughed! How we all thought this would never happen again. How right we were.</p> <p>The same systemic racism applies to victims from BAME communities. There is not enough research, but we do know that if you are a white victim of domestic abuse you will suffer, on average, 35 incidents before action is taken by an authority. The equivalent number of incidents for BAME victims is 100. The latter have less confidence in reporting, higher familial and community obstacles to overcome, and fewer properly funded support groups to advise them. And when it\u2019s more difficult for people to ask for help, it\u2019s easier for the system to ignore them.</p> <p>All of this means I am not surprised to see people marching in the streets during lockdown.&nbsp;The trust deficit between those in power and those they lead is greater than at any time in living history. The lies we are told have been amplified and adopted as a strategy by people who should know better.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 June 2020 to make clear that one police officer has been convicted since 1969 over a death in custody (the case of Craig Boyd where in 2007 a duty constable got a suspended sentence for misconduct after Boyd hanged himself in a Derby police cell in 2004). Text and a heading had spoken of no convictions. For the record: two prosecutions for breach of health and safety succeeded against police forces, not individuals: Devon &amp; Cornwall in 2019 over the 2012 death of Thomas Orchard, and the Metropolitan police in 2007 over the 2005 shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>The Greek government is facing growing opposition over a controversial environmental super-law passed when debate and public consultation were curtailed by lockdown measures imposed as a result of the pandemic.&nbsp;</p> <p>Resistance has intensified as part of a grassroots revolt over legislation that critics contend will irrevocably change the face of Greece.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIt was passed in the most undemocratic way with very few MPs and when citizens were forced to stay at home and couldn\u2019t react,\u201d said Yorgos Tsamis, an activist educator on the frontline of a mass protest against the reform in Athens last week. \u201cWhat is at stake is the future of the country, its mountains, valleys, coasts and animal species.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Opponents argue the sweeping legislation allows wind parks to be installed on rocky isles, and protected areas of world-class biodiversity and beauty to be exploited by the oil and gas industry.</p> <p>As the country increasingly adopts renewable energy, international companies are lining up to exploit its natural resources, including by placing industrial-sized turbines on windswept Aegean islands and mainland mountain ridges. For firms behind the proliferation of solar plants, Greece\u2019s plentiful sun can be harnessed year round.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is what worries Tsamis, who for the past month has protested outside the Greek parliament with a handwritten banner around his neck proclaiming: \u201cenvironment is more important than economy\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThey call it a modernising law that will promote green development,\u201d he said referring to the centre-right administration of Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the prime minister.&nbsp;\u201cFor us, though, it is greed in modern form.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>It is a view shared by demonstrators, who, backed by the political opposition, have denounced the policies for favouring investors over an environment made ever more fragile by the challenges of climate change.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWhichever way you slice it or dice it, this law has been drafted to facilitate large-scale investments and not the needs of local communities,\u201d said Iosif Efraimidis, a prominent environmental activist.&nbsp;\u201cWhy should we destroy our natural and historic landscape, our hilltops and rocky isles, to produce energy that is then exported, at great cost, far and wide?\u201d</p> <p>The government, elected on a reform agenda last July, insists that after nearly a decade of debt crisis, the law will accelerate the country\u2019s economic recovery post-coronavirus.</p> <p>By overhauling environmental regulations blighted by bureaucracy and outdated rules, it argues business \u2013 and jobs \u2013 are likely to be boosted at a time when the nation again faces the spectre of deep recession. Environmental licensing, long a hurdle to investment, has been simplified so permits that had required eight years to be granted can be obtained in 150 days. Land use rules have been changed and with them management of protected areas. \u201cWe have applied the best European practices,\u201d said environment minister, Kostis Hatzidakis warning that Greece couldn\u2019t afford to be \u201cthe country that investors think of as never to mess with, especially after coronavirus\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>Mitsotakis, an ardent advocate of renewables, said the legislation will enable Greece to end its addiction to coal while guaranteeing \u201crapid and sustainable development\u201d. The government has vowed to phase out all but one of the country\u2019s 14 lignite-powered stations by 2028 with a view to ensuring that more than a third of its energy production is clean by the end of the decade.&nbsp;</p> <p>Last week Mitsotakis announced tax incentives to boost the use of electric vehicles as part of plans to move to low-carbon mobility in a state that remains far behind the rest of Europe in reducing carbon emissions. Opponents counter that the leader, whose career was in finance before he went into politics, is driven more by a desire to lure investors.&nbsp;</p> <p>From Crete in the south to the Agrafa mountains in central Greece and Macedonia further north, critics fear the fast-tracked law is a fig leaf for \u201cpharaonic infrastructure\u201d projects. The legislation\u2019s abstruse language \u2013 and the abrupt addition of provisions never publicly discussed \u2013 has fuelled concerns.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the most problematic issues is that for the first time drilling for oil and gas is explicitly allowed within protected areas,\u201d said Theodota Nantsou, head of environmental policy at WWF Greece. \u201cAs a result it seriously threatens those areas with housing and touristic development.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Part of the global Natura 2000 network of protected areas, the sites are havens for rare species, both on land and at sea.&nbsp;</p> <p>Over 80 ecological and civil society groups, with the backing of prominent NGOs, are now calling for the legislation to be nullified. Academics, judges and scientists have questioned the efficacy and legality of the law. A tourism bill introducing more lenient penalties for illegal coastal use, also passed last month, has further aggravated an increasingly active environmental lobby.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17e612322e7b778d9d298fa7079d31cbc3d98da2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17e612322e7b778d9d298fa7079d31cbc3d98da2/0_691_4608_2765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Environmental protesters in Athens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Environmental protesters in Athens last Friday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Panagakis/Pacific Press/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Condemnation has been particularly acute on islands where opposition to proposed wind farms has become ever more violent and where people are incensed they were never asked about projects that will directly affect their lives. Clashes erupted on Tinos in the Cyclades recently when riot police attempted to disperse locals demonstrating against turbines being erected in a region known for its natural beauty. Anger has mounted as diggers and bulldozers have moved in to create roads in areas designated for windfarms.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIt reminds me of the 1960s when we scarred our mountains just to export cement,\u201d said Efraimidis, an architectural planner by profession. \u201cThe damage is still visible today.\u201d</p> <p>MEPs have rallied. Petros Kokkalis, who represents the main opposition Syriza party in the European parliament, said greens and leftists are pressuring Frans Timmermans, the EU commissioner for climate action, to intervene and had written to him outlining the law\u2019s flaws.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cUnder guise of the pandemic, with severely limited public consultation, the government has rammed through a piece of legislation that mistakes deregulation for modernisation and goes against the wellbeing of Greek people,\u201d he told the Guardian, emphasising that EU law, ultimately, superseded that of member states. \u201cYou can\u2019t double the capacity of renewables in Greece with riot police. You have to build social alliances and ensure biodiversity protection to achieve a green deal. The government has chosen confrontation over cooperation.\u201d&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>On a dismal late morning at the end of January, I took the train up to Manchester from London to meet Hendrix Lancaster, one of the founding members of the homelessness charity <a href=\"https://www.coffee4craig.com/\">Coffee4Craig</a>. The charity\u2019s work has its roots in a personal tragedy. In September 2013, Hendrix\u2019s brother-in-law Craig White died of a heroin overdose in Cardiff, where he had been living on the streets after a relationship had broken down. He was just 37.&nbsp;</p> <p>My thoughts recently turned to Coffee4Craig when, days before the UK officially went into lockdown, the government pledged <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/3-2-million-emergency-support-for-rough-sleepers-during-coronavirus-outbreak\">\u00a33.2m to local authorities</a> to house people who were either sleeping on the streets or thought to be at high risk of sleeping rough during the pandemic. For the clients of Coffee4Craig, the news of the \u201cEveryone In\u201d scheme would have been a relief in a city where the official number of rough sleepers has jumped from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/25/manchester-records-highest-number-of-rough-sleepers-deaths\">seven to 123 over the past decade</a>. In a stroke the government had taken that number down to zero.</p> <p>After years of prevarication and official apathy towards homelessness, the move, as <a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-52915913\">Crisis put it,</a> was \u201cextraordinary\u201d. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, sounded a triumphant note when he claimed that more than <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobertJenrick/status/1254504256423542786\">90% of the country\u2019s rough sleepers</a> had been housed in accommodation during the coronavirus crisis, even if critics have since highlighted the government\u2019s lack of transparency over the figures. Indeed, the <a href=\"https://publictechnology.net/articles/news/government-warned-over-%E2%80%98lack-transparency%E2%80%99-coronavirus-homeless-response-data\">Office for Statistics Regulation has noted</a> the government\u2019s refusal to publish the numbers behind ministers\u2019 claims.</p> <p>For many formerly homeless people, the sudden transition from instability to comfortable shelter in hotels and hostels after weeks, months or even years on the street must have felt surreal. One woman told the BBC that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-52775496\">\u201cit was like something out of a storybook\u201d</a>. For some, the scheme also offered access to services that set up shop in the same hotels, such as help with benefits applications and medical prescriptions<strong>. </strong>These are the sort of things that can be almost impossible to coordinate when trying to navigate life on the streets. The extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic had led to decisive action on homelessness that would have been almost impossible to envisage just weeks earlier. But obvious questions remained, not least how long this was all really going to last.</p> <p>An answer finally arrived on 4 June, when <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-52637283\">the BBC,</a> following an earlier exclusive by the <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/the-numbers-streets-going-rocket-18254318\">Manchester Evening News</a>, reported that contracts between local councils and hotels were due to end at the beginning of July when central government funding to support the scheme formally ran dry. Officially, the government has admitted to no such thing, instead pointing to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/18/coronavirus-uk-english-councils-welcome-extra-16bn-support\">\u00a33.2bn of funding already given to local authorities </a>to deal with further fallout from the pandemic. But that money was never specifically <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-05-05/coronavirus-care-homes-struggle-to-afford-ppe-due-to-lack-of-funding-and-rising-costs/\">earmarked</a> for alleviating homelessness and, with many councils still reeling from the effects of austerity and swingeing cuts, it\u2019s uncertain how much of this pot will be spent on helping homeless people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/27/covid-19-got-rough-sleepers-off-englands-streets-the-question-is-what-happens-next\">Covid-19 got rough sleepers off England's streets. The question is what happens next | Alan Fraser</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And at the same time that the government has shifted responsibility for helping homeless people back on to local councils, it hasn\u2019t explained what has changed that would mean rough sleepers are no longer at risk from the virus. Coronavirus is still out there, and there\u2019s no sign of a vaccine coming soon. With one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/calls-for-local-lockdowns-as-study-finds-r-value-above-1-in-north-west-england\">study finding the R rate is now </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/calls-for-local-lockdowns-as-study-finds-r-value-above-1-in-north-west-england\">above 1 in north-west England</a>, there seems even less justification infor ending the scheme in these places. Why are some of the most vulnerable citizens about to be deposited back on to the streets during a pandemic, to fend for themselves as best they can?&nbsp;</p> <p>According to Crisis, it would cost around \u00a3282m to permanently rehouse and support people housed in the current emergency hotels and hostels for the next 12 months. The numbers sound daunting until you remember just how much has been magicked into existence for other more politically expedient concerns over the past three months, from the furlough scheme to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/17/billions-in-loans-scrapping-of-rates-the-chancellors-help-for-businesses\">\u00a320bn in tax cuts</a> for small and medium-sized businesses.</p> <p>Although the government has announced a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dame-louise-casey-to-spearhead-government-taskforce-on-rough-sleeping-during-pandemic\">new rough sleeping taskforce</a>, it has not said whether funding will be provided for this beyond the \u00a33.2bn given to local authorities to cope with the fallout of the pandemic and the \u00a33.2m rough sleeping emergency fund. Indeed, there is precious little evidence to suggest successive governments have cared or devoted much thought to the lives of rough sleepers. As potential carriers of disease, they have started to matter to those in power in a way they never did before.&nbsp;</p> <p>After all, the pandemic didn\u2019t cause homelessness or the national housing crisis that has been fuelled by soaring rental and housing prices and a chronic lack of affordable new homes.

Then there are the thousands trying to navigate the world while \u201csofa surfing\u201d (itself made exponentially more difficult by lockdown) or living in already precarious temporary accommodation. The reality is of a world where the government\u2019s own official data on rough sleeping is thought to be so misleading that it shows numbers <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-51398425\">five times lower</a> than the figures collated by local councils.</p> <p>Homelessness shouldn\u2019t be thought of as an unfortunate inevitability of British life, like rain or social embarrassment. It took a deadly pandemic to provide even temporary shelter to the thousands of people living on the streets, a level of serious state support that might already have ended up proving an aberration, rather than paving the way for a new approach. It has been projected that the economic effects of coronavirus could throw another half a million people into homelessness.</p> <p>Clearly the legion of temporarily empty hotels and hostels are not a viable long-term solution. There must be better, more permanent housing options and a vision beyond immediate disaster management: a new approach, rather than a retreat into the status quo ante. There is something profoundly cruel about offering temporary safety, only to wrench it back at the moment it becomes remotely expedient to do so.</p> <p>\u2022 Francisco Garcia is a London-based writer and journalist</p> <p><br><br></p>",

A Greenpeace investigation revealed that the 25 supertrawlers included the four biggest in the world and fished in 39 different marine protected areas (MPAs).</p> <p>The Southern North Sea MPA was one of those fished and was created to safeguard porpoises, which are especially threatened by supertrawlers. More than <a href=\"https://uk.whales.org/2020/06/02/we-need-urgent-action-to-stop-porpoises-dying-in-nets-in-uk-seas/\">1,000 porpoises died in fishing nets</a> around the UK in 2019.

We want the government to commit to an HPMA delivery plan [within 12 months].\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, the environment secretary, George Eustice, said: \u201cWe will carefully consider the recommendations set out in the review.\u201d</p> <p>Separately, more than 50 scientists have signed a letter to the European Commission, European parliament and member states calling for an end to overfishing. Under reforms to the common fisheries policy, fishing quotas in 2020 were supposed to be in line with the maximum sustainable yield, determined by scientific advice. However, overfishing beyond what scientists regard as safe levels has continued and looks set to carry on into future years, as the UK and the EU wrangle over fishing as part of the Brexit negotiations.</p> <p>The scientists warned that further overfishing would harm fish populations and stop them from recovering.</p> <p>Rainer Froese, of the Helmholtz centre for ocean research in Kiel, Germany, said: \u201cOverfishing means taking more fish out the water than can grow back \u2013 that\u2019s pretty stupid. The stocks shrink, and small stocks can only support small catches. It doesn\u2019t help the fishermen, it doesn\u2019t help the fish, it doesn\u2019t help anyone.\u201d</p> <p>Overfishing also harmed the climate, he added: \u201cIf the ecosystem does not function properly, it cannot breathe properly and cannot absorb carbon dioxide properly.\u201d&nbsp; </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 June 2020 because Greenpeace investigators used tracking data from the Lloyd\u2019s List Maritime Intelligence, not \u201cthe Lloyd\u2019s Register\u201d as the campaigning group originally said.

  "<p>Fans are allowing themselves to get excited about a resumption of play after Rugby Australia and Fox Sports announced they had reached an agreement on a \u201crevised\u201d broadcast deal to show the new Super Rugby competition, involving the four franchises plus the Western Force, starting on 3 July.</p> <p>But the financial future of the game remains uncertain and in the apparent absence of a lucrative deal, private equity has emerged as the last great hope for rugby to remain a major sport in Australia. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/10/rugby-australia-and-fox-sports-super-rugby-tv-deal\">Rugby Australia and Fox Sports reach crucial Super Rugby TV deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Significantly, the value of the interim broadcast deal has not been officially released, although it will eventually leak out. It is almost certain it is not anywhere near the $57m a year RA had been receiving under the previous agreement.</p> <p>There is speculation Fox Sports initially wanted RA to pay for the broadcast of the domestic Super Rugby competition themselves, but then relented and offered a much reduced deal, which RA had no choice but to accept.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is understood RA has assured the Super Rugby clubs they will be economically viable for the rest of this year, but what about next year and the year after that?</p> <p>Whatever deal has been done to enable the game to survive 2020 and the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic, it is only the entr\u00e9e before the main course, which is the next broadcast deal from 2021 to 2025.</p> <p>Fox Sports may offer RA a long-term but very low deal, emphasising the new harsh reality that the days of sports over-reliance on blockbuster TV deals are over.</p> <p>Fox Sports indicated some time ago they would focus primarily on the two major football competitions in Australia \u2013 the AFL and the NRL \u2013 and that seems to be the way it is unfolding.</p> <p>Relations between Fox Sports and RA became strained when former RA chief executive Raelene Castle took broadcast rights to the open market earlier in the year.</p> <p>It is understood there is no longer any ill feeling between the parties, but the money that has sustained professional rugby in Australia for the last 25 years is just no longer there, with Fox Sports struggling financially themselves.</p> <p>In this scary scenario, RA will desperately need to secure private equity to make up the shortfall and maintain rugby\u2019s place as a major sport in Australia.</p> <p>Unlike overseas sport, Australian sport in general and rugby in particular does not have a particularly long and deep involvement with private equity or private ownership.</p> <p>Several years ago RA, which has always closely guarded its control of the game, opened the Super Rugby franchises to private equity investment, but there were few, or no, takers.</p> <p>When the Melbourne Rebels were established in 2011 they were meant to create a new model of private ownership of Super Rugby franchises, but the team\u2019s two owners, firstly Harold Mitchell and then Andrew Cox did not last long.</p> <p>The financial problems at the Rebels contributed largely to RA\u2019s economic woes and led indirectly to the axing of the Force in 2017 when RA could no longer be the lender of last resort when teams got into trouble.</p> <p>Ironically, the only Australian team with significant private backing is the Force, who are supported by mining magnate Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is believed Raelene Castle was about to meet with major private equity investor CVC, which has significant investments in European rugby, just before the coronavirus pandemic hit. That was the end of that exercise.</p> <p>Now, American private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) is <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/rugby-union/private-equity-giant-in-talks-with-rugby-australia-20200610-p5519e.html\">reportedly in preliminary discussions</a> with RA \u201cin collaboration\u201d with the Rebels about making an investment in the game worth hundreds of millions of dollars.</p> <p>KKR are certainly a major player in the private equity field and would have the funds to invest in Australian rugby, assuming they were genuinely interested.</p> <p>It is unlikely KKR, or anyone else, would be interested in buying an individual Super Rugby club, which would be seen as a potentially bad bet, but rather buy the commercial rights to a competition such as CVC\u2019s investment in the Six Nations and other European competitions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/09/a-huge-deal-new-zealands-rugby-starved-fans-prepare-to-head-en-masse-to-stadiums\">'A huge deal': New Zealand's rugby-starved fans prepare to head en masse to stadiums</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whatever deal RA \u2013 or even Sanzaar \u2013 can strike with private equity, it needs to be done in a hurry, but it may already be too late.</p> <p>RA\u2019s deal with RUPA for players to take, on average, a 60% pay cut because of the coronavirus pandemic ends at the end of September. RA is currently in discussions with RUPA to amend this deal, which is expected to result in a 10% pay increase, following the signing of the interim broadcast deal and the resumption of play.</p> <p>But players will demand a lot more than that come the end of September. If RA cannot convince Australia\u2019s leading players it will be able to generate sufficient income to restore something close to their previous multi-million dollar salaries, it risks a mass exodus overseas.&nbsp;</p> <p>Without an injection of significant capital from private equity, Australian rugby will revert to relying on dwindling broadcast monies and sponsorship for revenue to keep the best players at home. The next three months is not just about a resumption of play for Australia\u2019s Super Rugby teams, but ensuring rugby remains a major sport in this country.</p>",

The best pieces took a plastic wrapping reminiscent of the hanging bags used to return dry cleaning.

  "<p>The criminal justice system in England and Wales is failing defendants who are disabled or have mental health conditions and needs reform to ensure everyone receives a fair trial, the equalities watchdog has warned.</p> <p>In a report, called Inclusive Justice, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) calls for better treatment for those with learning disabilities, autism and brain injuries who have to go to court.</p> <p>The complexity of the criminal justice system and its specialist language presents a particular problem for disabled defendants and puts them at risk of not being able to participate effectively in the legal process, the report says.</p> <p>There is significant overrepresentation of people with learning disabilities and mental health issues passing through the criminal system, according to the EHRC. Too few legal professionals have adequate training to appropriately assist those with with impairments.</p> <p>Increased digitalisation of the courts system and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/22/court-hearings-via-video-risk-unfairness-for-disabled-people\">remote hearings during the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/22/court-hearings-via-video-risk-unfairness-for-disabled-people\">Covid-19 crisis threatens to make the situation worse</a>, the report notes.</p> <p>It quotes one woman defendant, for example, as saying: \u201cI know I\u2019ve done something wrong, but I\u2019m really not quite sure what that was.\u201d</p> <p>A crown court judge told the EHCR: \u201cIt seems to me that language is the real key, that the way we speak in court has to change \u2026 We do have to speak in a way which is not so far removed from the way that ordinary people speak and that includes people with impairments.</p> <p>David Isaac, the chair of the EHRC, said: \u201cA non-discriminatory criminal justice system, that everyone can participate in, underpins our society. It stands for democracy, equality and the rule of law. It should give us all the chance of a fair trial, no matter who we are.</p> <p>\u201cBut disabled people often face barriers to understanding their situation and making themselves properly understood to others.&nbsp;This can result in them feeling bewildered by the system and treated unfairly, which puts their right to a fair trial at risk.</p> <p>\u201cClearly the system needs a redesign. The UK and Scottish governments need to make it a priority to understand the needs of disabled people in the system, giving serious consideration to our findings and recommendations, and commit to making our criminal justice systems fair for all.\u201d</p> <p>The report concludes that the justice system has not been designed around the needs and abilities of disabled people and that reforms in England and Wales risk further reducing participation.</p> <p>Defendants\u2019 impairments are not always recognised, the report says, adjustments are therefore not made and lawyers need more guidance and training. There should also be better monitoring of data on disabled defendants in the courts.</p> <p>A spokesperson for HM courts and tribunal service said: \u201cWe work closely with disability groups to ensure we have reduced the barriers that disabled people may face throughout justice system.</p> <p>\u201cThis includes identifying people who have mental health, learning disabilities, substance misuse or other vulnerabilities at the earliest opportunity, and providing intermediaries to help with remote hearings.</p> <p>\u201cWe welcome the EHRC\u2019s report and look forward to engaging with them to help improve our provisions further.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>On 19 March, just a few days before he self-isolated with Covid-19, a sunken-eyed Boris Johnson&nbsp;told the daily Downing Street briefing that in 12 weeks \u201cwe can turn the tide\u201d. \u201cI am absolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>On Thursday those 12 weeks are up \u2013 and they have seen the country go through turmoil.</p> <p>The prime minister struggled for his life in intensive care, and more than 40,000 people who tested positive have died alongside thousands of others with suspected cases. Care homes have been ravaged and now the economy stands on the brink of the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/what-caused-the-economic-slump-of-1706-#:~:text=Wars%20were%20expensive%20and%20strained,the%20mercy%20of%20the%20weather.\"> deepest recession since 1706</a>, according to the Bank of England.</p> <p>The lockdown is being loosened, but fears of a second wave are rife.</p> <p>So has the tide really turned?</p> <p>On Wednesday, Downing Street was upbeat. But interviews with experts, and analysis of the government\u2019s own data, paint a grim picture of what the UK has endured \u2013 and a lack of confidence about what the next 12 weeks may hold.</p> <p>First glance at the now-familiar government graphs suggest the curves tracking new infections and deaths are showing significant improvements, at least when viewed from the devastating peak of the outbreak around Easter, when new infections hit 3,918 on 5 April and deaths peaked at 943 a day on 11 April, taking rolling averages.&nbsp;</p> <p>Closer inspection reveals a less comforting picture. When Johnson spoke 12 weeks ago there were 913 new cases of coronavirus recorded each day on average. At the latest count there were 1,543.</p> <p>Twelve weeks ago the seven-day rolling average for daily deaths was just 21; this week it remains 10 times higher. As the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, reminded Johnson in parliament on Wednesday, the UK\u2019s excess deaths during the pandemic have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/09/excess-deaths-in-uk-under-coronavirus-lockdown-pass-63000\">passed 63,000 </a>\u2013 higher than in Italy, Spain and France. As Greece (with a death toll of 183) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/covid-19-greece-quarantines-all-passengers-from-qatar-flight\">welcomes holidaymakers</a>, Britons still cannot stay overnight with extended family in most cases.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/archive-zip/giv-3902WbATpezbPWLb/\" data-alt=\"Death totals chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/archive-zip/giv-3902WbATpezbPWLb/\">Death totals chart</a> </figure>  <p>Scientists are also concerned that as lockdown lifts, the test, trace and isolate system for quelling future outbreaks is not robust enough. The care sector, where at least 15,000 have died from Covid-19 so far, warns that the government\u2019s tactics to protect the most vulnerable in a second wave remain largely unchanged.</p> <p>It is too soon, they say, to talk about the tide having turned. The signs for the economy are dark too. Unemployment benefit claims have surged by 70% to more than two million and job cuts are expected to spiral this summer as the furlough scheme is wound down.</p> <p>It is the sheer numbers of infections and deaths at the peak that have shocked many. Two days before Johnson made his prediction, the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said less than 20,000 deaths would be \u201ca good outcome\u201d.</p> <p>That milestone was passed more than six weeks ago. According to Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser and now chairman of an independent version of the government\u2019s Sage advisory group, that could have been the total death toll.</p> <p>King has calculated that if Johnson had ordered the lockdown on the day he promised to \u201cturn the tide\u201d, rather than four days later, transmission would have been slashed and fatalities halved. Prof Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College epidemiologist and former government adviser, also said on Wednesday that the death toll could have been halved if lockdown had come a week earlier.</p> <p>We have not \u201csent coronavirus packing\u201d, King says, because the R factor \u2013 the rate of reproduction \u2013 is still not low enough. His group is worried we are risking a second wave by lifting lockdown restrictions now.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a series of really dreadful mistakes by this government that has led to a vast number of people dying and they need not have died,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/archive-zip/giv-3902RS71RINc6r4G/\" data-alt=\"Cases chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/archive-zip/giv-3902RS71RINc6r4G/\">Cases chart</a> </figure>  <p>His calculation about an earlier lockdown was supported by Prof Roland Kao, chair of epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh. He found that if Scotland had gone into lockdown two weeks earlier, its death toll could have been cut to a fifth of the country\u2019s 4,000 deaths now linked to the disease.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cCutting the virus off earlier has a huge benefit,\u201d said Kao, who warned the tail of the epidemic is likely to be unpredictable and long.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the R number is around one, you see extreme variability of outcome,\u201d he said. \u201cIf people take [easing of lockdown] too lightly the end result is we head back in the other direction. So in terms of whether we have turned the tide it would seem unwise to think it is job done.\u201d</p> <p>Some modellers predict more grief to come even in this first wave.

  "<p>Why did the tearing down of the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol mean something to me? Why was my heart racing all Sunday afternoon and evening? Why did the scenes that played out around Colston\u2019s plinth and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">at the harbour into which the statue was thrown</a> bring me \u2013 during a phone call to another black Bristolian \u2013 to the verge of tears? I can begin to explain why by describing my experience of first moving to Bristol.</p> <p>In the late 1990s, I got my first paid media job in the city. The contract was short and there was no guarantee of getting another one, so it was too great a financial risk for me to put down a deposit on a flat. If the work ran out, I would be unable to afford the rent. All I had was a few hundred pounds in my bank account. That was it, everything I had scraped together to cover my living costs and accommodation, my entire war chest, with which I hoped to break into the media. Once the money was gone, it would be back home to my mother\u2019s home in the north, back to jobs in bars, shops or wherever, to save up more money and have another go the next year. There was no room for error. An unreturned deposit would have wiped me out financially.</p> <p>So, two weeks before my start date, I began phoning around, trying to find somewhere that rented rooms by the month or, even better, by the week. The first place I called was on St Paul\u2019s Road in the wealthy Bristol suburb of Clifton. The guy I spoke to told me that he did have rooms, they were cheap and could be made available on a short-term let. When he named the price (which was more than I could afford), I hesitated. Sensing my uncertainty, but not knowing its cause, he filled the silence by reassuring me that although the room was in a property on St Paul\u2019s Road, it was nowhere near the St Paul\u2019s district of Bristol. <em>\u201c</em>You know,\u201d<em> </em>he said.<em> \u201cWhere all the blacks live.</em>\u201d</p> <p>My standard English accent had led him to presume that I was white, and that led him to another presumption: that one of my criteria when looking for accommodation was that it was far away from the homes of black people. That was the very first phone call I made to the city I was moving to alone, a place in which I had no friends or contacts. Two years later, I was still in Bristol, surviving from one short contract to the next, as young people in the media are all forced to do, then and now. I was so loaded down with student debt that even though I was working full time I was poorer than I had been when a student, and again I was looking for a cheap room.&nbsp;</p> <p>I answered an advert I found on a noticeboard that had been posted by a group of guys in their 20s who were in search of a new flatmate for a shared house. The first question they asked me when I arrived, after they had rearranged their faces and before I was allowed to ask any questions about the room or the house, was if I would not perhaps find it uncomfortable living in a house in which everyone was a university graduate. I had two degrees in history and one in journalism. They never asked if I had gone to university.</p> <p>It may well be the case that those experiences were no worse or better than those I might have encountered in any British city in the late 90s. But what made them feel more pointed and painful was that Bristol was then a city that, it felt to me, gave off the strong impression that black people were not really wanted. The statue of Edward Colston, and the fact that it was so resolutely and uncompromisingly defended and justified (by sections of the city council and <a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/edward-colston-statue-society-merchant-4203544\">the Bristol Merchant Venturers</a>), played its part in creating that impression. As did the fact that in certain districts of the city I hardly ever saw anyone who wasn\u2019t white. Twenty years later, Bristol remains a disturbingly segregated city.&nbsp;</p> <p>I was told, in hushed tones, by one of the first black people I got to know in Bristol, about the statue of the slave trader down in the city centre. As a historian, I inevitably began to read about Colston\u2019s role in the Royal African Company (RAC), the most prolific slave-trading company in British history. He was an investor and a board member of the RAC, eventually becoming deputy governor, and during his period it is estimated that about 84,000 Africans were shipped to lives of misery and torment in the Americas. Of that 84,000, only about 65,000 reached the plantations. About a quarter, 19,000, perished chained to the slave decks of the RAC\u2019s ships. Slave traders such as Colston called these deaths \u201cwastage\u201d.</p> <p>Knowing all this and seeing Colston every day, there on his pedestal \u2013 combined with the city\u2019s wealth and Georgian pomp, which was intimidating for someone from my background \u2013 made me feel that this was a city I would struggle to ever call home. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80a2bf0f88fdbf73caf89dff1729a597b018c8c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80a2bf0f88fdbf73caf89dff1729a597b018c8c6/77_170_3332_1999/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street art in Stokes Croft, Bristol, this weekend.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Street art in Stokes Croft, Bristol, this weekend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While each of the little snubs and rejections I encountered in Bristol had an impact, once life got a bit easier I discovered the other Bristol. A dynamic, creative, multiracial, politically radical, diverse and in places proudly working-class city. One that is regularly and rightly listed as one of the best places in the UK to live.</p> <p>If you want to see the depth of the division between those two Bristols you need to remember that here is a city <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/10/bristol-mayor-marvin-rees-edward-colston-statue-slavery\">currently run by an elected mayor, Marvin Rees</a>, who is the first mayor in Europe to be descended from enslaved people. At the same time, the Bishopsworth ward of the city council is represented by a councillor, Richard Eddy, who was condemned in 2001 for bringing a golliwog doll into Bristol town hall and placing it on the cabinet, a man who even now, with Colston at the bottom of the River Avon, <a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/edward-colston-a-hero-bristol-4205516\">still </a><a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/edward-colston-a-hero-bristol-4205516\">calls the slave trader </a><a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/edward-colston-a-hero-bristol-4205516\">\u201ca hero\u201d</a>.</p> <p>What happened last Sunday was that a long and deep disagreement about the city\u2019s long and terrible history of slave trading brought those two Bristols into open conflict. And the lightning rod for that clash was the bronze figure of Edward Colston.</p> <p>The story behind what took place at the weekend is linked to another story, that of how, over the past half century, black people in Britain, and their allies, assembled from discarded fragments a new black history of Britain. It is also the story of how this knowledge, about black presence in Britain and the centrality of slavery within much of that story, is now in the hands of a new generation who intend to use it to challenge our squeamish denial of some of the darkest chapters of British history and our unwillingness to confront the realities of British racism.</p> <p>A century ago, the idea that Colston would one day be toppled from his pedestal would have been unthinkable. By then Colston, who died in 1721, had already been the beneficiary of two centuries of reputation-laundering, orchestrated by Bristol\u2019s Colston societies and others. They had nurtured the myths that surrounded him to ensure that he was remembered only as a local philanthropist, a saintly benefactor who had paid for almshouses, a school and much else. But what made it possible in those years for Colston\u2019s reputation to be kept pearly white was that very few people knew or cared much about the trade that had been the key source of his vast wealth.</p> <p>That began to change in the middle decades of the 20th century, when historians in the Caribbean, Britain and the US began to research and write about British slavery and the slave trade. Then, from the 1960s onwards, a new genre of British history emerged: black history. It was pioneered by historians such as James Walvin, Edward Scobie, Folarin Shyllon, Ron Ramdin, Nigel File, Chris Power, Peter Fryer and others, who undertook <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/09/black-history-month-ditch-heroes\">a vast task of archival reclamation and recovery</a>.</p> <p>Before the work of those historians, the history of the black presence in Britain had been erased from the \u201cisland story\u201d. The long and complicated history of slavery was conveniently overshadowed by the more comforting tale of abolition. Despite black faces appearing in the margins of hundreds of British portraits and in the work of artists as famous as Reynolds and Hogarth, the lives of black Georgians and black Victorians had been rendered invisible while remaining in plain sight. Although thousands of entries in thousands of British newspapers and other archival sources detailed the lives of black people in Britain (these include advertisements for the sale of slaves here in Britain), few people were even aware that there had been black Britons and black communities in the country before the second world war. The place of black people in the past had slipped on to history\u2019s equivalent of the cutting-room floor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"645f4f103455789f489f67af5b2b511ed87799fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/645f4f103455789f489f67af5b2b511ed87799fa/0_0_5669_3773/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Empire Windrush on arrival at the Port of Tilbury on 22 June 1948.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Empire Windrush on arrival at the Port of Tilbury on 22 June 1948.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is strange to think today that the 492 people from the Caribbean who disembarked from the Empire Windrush in 1948 were, as far as we can know, unaware that the cities in which they went on to make their homes \u2013 London, Liverpool, Bristol \u2013 had been home to earlier generations of black Britons. Had the books that we have now on black British history been available to them, how might the historical knowledge they contained fascinated, comforted, radicalised and energised them? How, during the difficult years after 1948, when they were subjected to so much prejudice and endured so much disadvantage, might they have used such knowledge to rebuff those who questioned their right to be in Britain and regard themselves as British?</p> <p>As black history was slowly being salvaged, the black historical figures we know today one by one disentombed from the depths of the archives, so were the<strong> </strong>uncomfortable histories of slavery and imperialism \u2013 the backstories required to make sense of these new biographies. These twin processes meant that the veil that had been carefully drawn over one side of Colston\u2019s life began to slip.</p> <p>The remarkable events of the past few weeks were brought about by a confluence of slow-moving forces and immediate events, among them the sickening death of George Floyd. One reason why Colston fell is that in 2020 the people whose lives are still impacted by the racism that had been originally constructed by British slave traders were no longer willing to accept the standing insult that was his statue. Why was Colston such a potent target? Because this generation of young black people and their allies are the beneficiaries and inheritors of more than half a century of scholarship and research into slavery, the slave trade and the role of black people in Britain\u2019s history. They know their enemies when they see them.</p> <p>Another piece of the jigsaw is that the people who are being asked to forget Colston\u2019s crimes were also being asked to ignore their own disadvantage, which in 2020 has been brought into sharp focus by a global pandemic that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/04/genetics-bame-people-die-coronavirus-structural-racism\">impacting their communities more severely than any others</a>. In 2017, the Centre on Dynamics of Ethnicity at my own university, the University of Manchester, published research that showed that black people living in Bristol paid what the authors of the report called an \u201cethnic penalty\u201d \u2013 a catalogue of <a href=\"https://www.runnymedetrust.org/projects-and-publications/parliament/scorecard/ethnic-inequalities-briefings-january-2017.html\">disadvantage that limits their life chances</a>. Dr Nissa Finney from the centre lamented then that in Bristol the \u201cextent of ethnic inequalities is striking and it has not improved in the last 15 years\u201d. The connections between persistent racial inequality today and the racial systems that were first put in place by men such as Colston, who pioneered and then profited from the slave trade and slavery, are perhaps more clearly demarcated in 2020 then they ever have been.</p> <p>Back in the 18th and 19th centuries, the elite that ran Bristol decided that Colston\u2019s philanthropy was to be for ever remembered, but that his role in the Atlantic slave trade was to be for ever forgotten. They used the infrastructure of veneration and disinformation they had constructed to control history, and to append his name to a concert hall and scatter it across the streetscape of their city. What was toppled on Sunday was not just a statue, but also the historical myopia and wilful amnesia that had enabled Colston\u2019s protectors and defenders to turn a man who had done monstrous things into a secular saint.</p>",
  "<p>If I hear one more white person say \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d I think my head will explode. The slogan, powerful when first popularised by black people after the shooting of Trayvon Martin in 2012 in the US, has now become so ubiquitous as to have lost almost all meaning.&nbsp;A way for people to endlessly repeat \u201cI hate racism\u201d while doing nothing to actually stop it.&nbsp;</p> <p>White people, I assume you don\u2019t like the idea of other people being treated as inferior just because of the colour of their skin.

That\u2019s why they\u2019re always looking for ways to excuse what they do. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault \u2013 black people are just a bit more criminal than white people.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not being racist \u2013 it\u2019s just that a lot of Muslims are terrorists.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d love to recruit a black person \u2013 it\u2019s just that they\u2019re not quite the right fit for this role.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that \u2026\u201d You won\u2019t find this chanted in a city square by thousands of protesters, but these are probably the three most powerful words in the history of institutional racism. They\u2019re the words people say in private \u2013 or don\u2019t say \u2013 when they\u2019re making the decisions that really matter. They are the words that determine whether someone gets that job, or that business contract, or that university place, or that rented room.&nbsp;<br></p> <p>Over the past few days I\u2019ve wondered, why&nbsp;now? Why,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>after all we\u2019ve known about police brutality against black people,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>are people only now saying, en masse, that enough is enough? I think there are two core reasons. First, given the lockdown, there\u2019s not a lot else for young people to do.&nbsp;The anger is genuine, but the usual distractions<strong> </strong>that stop people from turning out have gone.&nbsp;It\u2019s the first time in months that young people have been able to be part of a group activity.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the other factor is more fundamental: and that is, white guilt. While black people have raged about the shootings and asphyxiations,&nbsp;for most white people there\u2019s always been a get-out.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that [those words again] \u2026 he was maybe being too aggressive \u2026 maybe the officers thought they were under threat \u2026 it was a spur-of-the-moment pull of the trigger.\u201d It\u2019s allowed white people to believe that, though the outcomes were all horrific, a white suspect in the same situation could have suffered the same fate. The George Floyd video crashed through that delusion. A subdued and incapacitated suspect; a knee pushed down on his neck as he pleaded for breath; passersby screaming for his life as it ebbed away; officer Derek Chauvin blithely ignoring it all, cocksure that he\u2019d face no consequences for his actions; a fellow officer standing guard to prevent anyone coming to Floyd\u2019s rescue. For almost nine minutes, many of them after he had passed out. Nine minutes.</p> <p>No white person&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>could believe this could happen to them. That an officer of the law could be so callous, so unconcerned about the life of a white man.<br></p> <p>That\u2019s why, this time, there have been unprecedented numbers of white people<strong>&nbsp;</strong>declaring their allegiance to the antiracism cause. On the streets, even in the US, most protesters have been white.&nbsp;<br></p> <p>Though &nbsp;many of these new activists will have only a superficial understanding of race issues, it has to be a positive thing that at last they\u2019re starting to notice.&nbsp;This was nowhere more apparent than in Bristol this weekend. If it had been a black-only crowd,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>would the statue of notorious slavemaster Edward Colston really have been allowed to topple, let alone be dragged through the streets and dumped in the River Avon?<br></p> <p>Many British people were upset at what they saw. And I have some sympathy: mob rule is generally a bad thing, and risks getting disastrously out of hand. But&nbsp;what a glorious moment. It\u2019s an image that will last years in the memory, as the moment that people in one English city said the ritual humiliation of black lives was no longer acceptable. You can say \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d a million times but it will change nothing. This action changed things.&nbsp;</p> <p><br>When I saw&nbsp;Floyd\u2019s life drain slowly away, I wondered why so little had changed since the&nbsp;Black Lives Matter&nbsp;movement swept across the US in 2014.&nbsp;Surely all US police officers should know they will be held accountable for any transgressions, especially when caught on camera? Chauvin clearly feared no repercussions.&nbsp;</p> <p>There are 18,000 separate police forces in the US. In the UK there are 43. If we\u2019re going to bring about change we need to find a way to get into them all, change them all, and make those changes stick. It won\u2019t be by simply calling for more black police officers. That\u2019s been tried before, and any change is glacially slow. It won\u2019t be just by rooting out \u201cbad apples\u201d: a system that allows them&nbsp;in unchecked&nbsp;in the first place is already rotten to the core. It won\u2019t simply be by giving all officers \u201cdiversity training\u201d: a couple of weeks on the streets after completing such a course, and they\u2019re back in the old routine, acting on the instincts and stereotypes.&nbsp;</p> <p>On the day&nbsp;of&nbsp;the first major UK Black Lives Matter protest last Wednesday,&nbsp;the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick,&nbsp;was giving evidence to the London assembly.&nbsp;She&nbsp;was talking, coincidentally, about the disproportionate number of fines handed out to black people during the coronavirus lockdown \u2013 double the rate for white people.</p> <p>This, she explained, was partly because more officers have been operating in high-crime areas. To which the response must be, what has the lockdown got to do with high-crime areas? It\u2019s just another way in which black people (more likely to live in poorer areas, which are more likely to have higher crime rates) continue to be disproportionately targeted by the police.&nbsp;And then Dick added, as if trying to defend this: \u201cWe\u2019ve said again and again, be sensitive, be careful. And I think [our officers] have been. But I have to be honest, I haven\u2019t gone back to them to say, think about your unconscious bias.\u201d<br><br>So there it is: we have officers disproportionately targeting black people, and nothing said to them in advance about being aware of the danger of racial stereotyping.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is where leadership really counts: the day-to-day decisions, at the most senior levels,&nbsp;that affect&nbsp;thousands of lives. To make lasting change, we ultimately have to get off the streets and into the rooms where these decision-makers operate.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@BarackObama/how-to-make-this-moment-the-turning-point-for-real-change-9fa209806067\">Barack Obama&nbsp;has&nbsp;set out an intelligent long-term plan</a> \u2013 \u201cHow to make this moment the turning point for real change\u201d \u2013 which involves working locally with US mayors, district attorneys and local police chiefs.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the UK we have to be equally thoughtful \u2013 so that every single officer, every single business chief, every head of every institution thinks every single day about the need to eradicate racism and bias. Black Lives Matter is a catchy slogan. But right now, action is what really matters.</p> <p>\u2022 Joseph Harker is the deputy Opinion editor</p>",

In part because of the way that new officers are inducted into the force. Local official Louis Cappelli says that on their first day, new officers have to go round the neighbourhood they will be patrolling knocking on doors and introducing themselves. </p> \n  <p>You can read the report here - which includes an analysis of why it is an approach that might be much harder to roll out in a larger urban area like Minneapolis: <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/09/us/disband-police-camden-new-jersey-trnd/index.html\"><strong>CNN - This city disbanded its police department 7 years ago.

difficult,\u2019 well, it\u2019s not.</p> \n<p>\u201cAddress the underlying issues \u2013 health, housing, education and employment \u2013 and work with First Nations people through the Coag system.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor too long there have been nice words and good intentions, but the lack of action and commitment has not seen a reduction in deaths in custody; it\u2019s seen an escalation in the social indicators that diminish First Nations people and diminish us as a nation.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt diminishes us as a nation because we are incapable of dealing with Indigenous incarceration rates in the last 10 years.\u201d</p> \n<p>This week has seen renewed calls for the federal government to respond to the most recent in a series of more than a dozen inquiries into justice issues in the past decade.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cbfe8c30-262e-4df5-844a-a36af3ce7c80\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div

  "<p>Amazon is implementing a one-year moratorium on police use of its artificial intelligence software Rekognition amid a growing backlash over the tech company\u2019s ties to law enforcement.</p> <p>The company has recently stated its support for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter movement</a>, which advocates for police reform \u2013&nbsp;using Twitter to call for an end to \u201cthe inequitable and brutal treatment of black people\u201d in the US and has putting a \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d banner at the top of its home page. But the company has been criticized as hypocritical because it sells its facial recognition software to police forces.</p> <p>Amazon has not said how many police forces use the technology, or how it is used, but marketing materials have promoted Rekognition being used in conjunction with police body cameras in real time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/09/amazon-black-lives-matter-police-ring-jeff-bezos\">Amazon says 'Black Lives Matter'. But the company has deep ties to policing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When it was first released, Amazon\u2019s Rekognition software was criticized by human rights groups as \u201ca powerful surveillance system\u201d that is available to \u201cviolate rights and target communities of color\u201d. Advocacy groups also said the technology could have a disproportionately negative effect on non-white people. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez echoed this complaint <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1270848998249771009\">in a tweet on Wednesday</a>, saying the technology \u201cshouldn\u2019t be anywhere near law enforcement\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFacial recognition is a horrifying, inaccurate tool that fuels racial profiling and mass surveillance,\u201d she said. \u201cIt regularly falsely [identifies] Black and Brown people as criminal\u201d.</p> <p>An experiment run by the ACLU in 2018 showed Rekognition incorrectly matched 28 members of Congress to photos of people arrested for a crime. It overwhelmingly misidentified Congress members who are not white. Facial recognition software, like many forms of artificial intelligence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/04/racist-facial-recognition-white-coders-black-people-police\">has a long history</a> of racial bias. The field of artificial intelligence, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/16/artificial-intelligence-lack-diversity-new-york-university-study\">overwhelmingly white and male</a>, is frequently criticized for its lack of diversity.</p> <p>In a statement on its blog Wednesday, Amazon said it will pull the use of its technology from police forces until there is stronger regulation around it. The move follows IBM putting a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/08/ibm-gets-out-of-facial-recognition-business-calls-on-congress-to-advance-policies-tackling-racial-injustice.html\">permanent end</a>&nbsp;to its development of facial recognition technology.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve advocated that governments should put in place stronger regulations to govern the ethical use of facial recognition technology, and in recent days, Congress appears ready to take on this challenge,\u201d Amazon said. \u201cWe hope this one-year moratorium might give Congress enough time to implement appropriate rules, and we stand ready to help if requested.\u201d</p> <p>While some privacy advocates say the move represents a step in the right direction, Evan Greer, of digital rights group Fight for the Future, said this is \u201cnothing more than a public relations stunt from Amazon\u201d.</p> <p>She said Amazon could spend the year moratorium improving the technology and lobbying Congress to make industry-friendly regulation so the technology can be implemented in the future. Amazon spent $16.8m on lobbying in 2019.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is that facial recognition technology is too dangerous to be used at all,\u201d Greer said. \u201cLike nuclear or biological weapons, it poses such a profound threat to the future of humanity that it should be banned outright.\u201d</p> <p>Nicole Ozer, the technology and civil liberties director with the American Civil Liberties Union of northern California, also called on Amazon to make more meaningful commitments. \u201cThis surveillance technology\u2019s threat to our civil rights and civil liberties will not disappear in a year,\u201d Ozer said. \u201cAmazon must fully commit to a blanket moratorium on law enforcement use of face recognition until the dangers can be fully addressed, and it must press Congress and legislatures across the country to do the same. They should also commit to stop selling surveillance systems like Ring that fuel the over-policing of communities of color.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Washington county sheriff\u2019s office in Oregon, the first law enforcement agency in the country to contract with Amazon to use the technology, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BobbyAllyn/status/1270856869536358400\">confirmed on Wednesday</a> it would suspend its use of the product in light of the announcement.</p> <p>Suspension of this particular program does not mean all partnerships with law enforcement will be halted. Amazon noted in its announcement that the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children, as well as technology companies Thorn and Marinus Analytics, will still have access to Rekognition for human trafficking cases.</p> <p>Amazon also has not made changes to Ring, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/29/ring-amazon-police-partnership-social-media-neighbor\">its camera-connected smart doorbell company</a>, which has also been criticized for increasing the policing of non-white Americans. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvyvzd/amazons-home-security-company-is-turning-everyone-into-cops\">report from Motherboard in 2019</a>&nbsp;revealed black and brown people are more likely to be surveilled by the Neighbors app, where Ring users can post videos and photos of \u201csuspicious\u201d people caught on camera.</p> <p>The doorbell app now partners with more than 1,300 police forces across the US \u2013 a 300% increase from just 400 police forces in August 2019. The ACLU has called on Amazon to \u201cstop selling surveillance systems like Ring that fuel the over-policing of communities of color\u201d. It also <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/civil-liberties/microsoft-says-it-supports-racial-justice-will-they-refuse-to-power-discriminatory-police-surveillance/\">called on</a> other companies that power facial recognition, including Microsoft, to halt the technology.</p> <p>\u201cFace recognition technology gives governments the unprecedented power to spy on us wherever we go,\u201d said Ozer. \u201cIt fuels police abuse. This surveillance technology must be stopped.\u201d</p>"
