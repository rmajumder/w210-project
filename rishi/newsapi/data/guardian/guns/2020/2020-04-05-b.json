  "<p>Airbnb was built on the premise of bringing the world closer together. Tourists could travel like locals, while locals could cash in on their desirable neighbourhood properties by letting those visitors in. Last year the company was estimated to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/05/airbnb-homelessness-renting-housing-accommodation-social-policy-cities-travel-leisure\">worth more than US$30bn</a>. It is scheduled to go public in 2020. Then came the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Travel is suspended. Australians are almost entirely confined to their homes. Now the once heralded disruptor is seeing a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c59456f-10d9-4874-821e-d3d979c7cb4f\">collapse in bookings</a>. The hosts who have become reliant on income-generating properties to pay their bills are being bled dry by a lack of business, and already-suspicious neighbours are up in arms over the potential that short-term renters may spread the virus.</p> <p>In the decade before the pandemic, Airbnb became \u201cthis very attractive thing\u201d, says Chris Martin, a senior research fellow at the University of New South Wales\u2019s City Futures Research Centre. The platform, and others like it, fundamentally changed not only the travel industry but <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/features/2017/11/21/16678002/airbnb-nashville\">housing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/garybarker/2020/02/21/the-airbnb-effect-on-housing-and-rent/#6ccdee122226\">rental</a> markets. A home is no longer just a home, Martin says. \u201c[The company] tapped into the idea that a person\u2019s house can also be viewed as an asset that has capacity for generating income.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/coronavirus-world-map-countries-most-cases-and-deaths\">Coronavirus world map: which countries have the most cases and deaths?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This shift \u201cmassively upped the scale of [short-term rental]\u201d, which in turn put pressure on residential rental markets. The changes have resulted in lawsuits in <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-airbnb-ipo-challenges/\">the US</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/20/ten-cities-ask-eu-for-help-to-fight-airbnb-expansion\">petition by 10 cities</a> to the European parliament in 2019. There are more than seven million Airbnb listings spread across 100,000 cities \u2013 with an estimated 346,581 listings between July 2016 and February 2019 in <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/ever-wondered-how-many-airbnbs-australia-has-and-where-they-all-are-we-have-the-answers-129003\">Australia alone</a>.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018The whole industry has fallen through\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Stephen Colman, who was an Airbnb host and ran an Airbnb management business up until last year, says \u201cthe whole industry has fallen through\u201d. Many hosts are either pulling out of Airbnb to find cheaper long-term tenants or have been<strong> </strong>offering \u201c14-day isolation suites\u201d.</p> <p>The former, Colman says, will come with a long wait and big rent cuts, as everyone else rushes to do the same. The latter is even more fraught. This week the Greens state MP for Ballina, Tamara Smith, called on online holiday booking websites such as Airbnb and Stayz in the Byron Bay region to stop marketing regional properties as ideal places for self-isolation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/last-bus-to-byron-service-cancelled-as-towns-urge-backpackers-to-stay-away-amid-coronavirus\">saying it wasn\u2019t fair</a> on regional hospitals and communities.</p> <p>\u201cThere are real concerns around cleaning stuff,\u201d Colman says, \u201cHow many hours between checkout and check-in \u2026 [Hosts] have seen a fightback from body corporates who are just outright cancelling the key fobs for anyone who they believe is doing Airbnb. They\u2019ve just gone \u2018we\u2019re going to take this hard line to protect the safety of our long-term tenants\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Jane Hearn, deputy chair of the Owners Corporation Network, <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/property/residential/airbnb-packages-risk-creating-viral-hot-spots-in-apartments-20200320-p54c8s\">has argued</a> that opening Airbnb properties for quarantine \u201cincreases the viral load on apartment owners and tenants\u201d. Resident advocacy groups such as We Live Here and Neighbours Not Strangers were already lobbying against Airbnb on behalf of local communities who were sick of rowdy travellers in their apartment complexes. In a letter to New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian on 1 April, Neighbours Not Strangers called for an immediate ban on all short-term rentals, due to the risks from Covid-19.</p> <p>Airbnb does not support reservation requests from users who are showing symptoms, or those who are awaiting test results. Last week the company <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com.sg/help/article/2741/content-policy-and-the-coronavirus\">instituted a ban</a> on any listings that \u201creference Covid-19, coronavirus or quarantine\u201d and listings which \u201cincentivise bookings through Covid-19-related discounts, stocks of limited resources, or the highlighting of quarantine-friendly listing attributes\u201d. The company\u2019s updated instructions for <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com.au/resources/hosting-homes/a/cleaning-guidelines-for-preventing-the-spread-of-covid-19-163\">cleaning and hygiene</a> recommend hosts stock their properties with \u201ca few extras\u201d like \u201cantibacterial hand sanitizer, disposable gloves and wipes, hand soap, paper towels, tissues\u201d \u2026 and toilet paper.</p> <p>The government has now mandated that all international arrivals <a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/mandatory-quarantine-of-overseas-arrivals-rolled-out-in-australia-what-is-involved\">must complete their quarantine at designated pre-booked hotels</a>. But, before that, some Australians were happy turning to Airbnb. Comedian Alice Fraser is currently in a \u201cgood value\u201d Bondi Airbnb after returning from London. She saw Airbnb as \u201cthe responsible option\u201d: \u201c[It\u2019s there] for people who don\u2019t have favours to call in, or family who happen to have a massive home that can be segmented into parts.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018We lost everything\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Lisa Porgazian and her husband have listed their three Gold Coast apartments on Airbnb for the past four years. Now the properties are empty, and the mortgage payments will come out of the couple\u2019s superannuation. \u201cWe were relying on this for our income, as well as our retirement plan,\u201d she says, distraught. \u201cNow that\u2019s completely died in the arse.\u201d</p> <p>Porgazian, a 46-year-old former IT contractor, has been managing her property portfolio full-time. She\u2019s unable to work in many other jobs due to rheumatoid arthritis. \u201cI\u2019m earning zero. My husband\u2019s earning zero. And we\u2019ve still got these mortgages to pay.\u201d</p> <p>With the spread of Covid-19, a downturn in business was inevitable. But many Airbnb hosts were shocked at how quickly it came. The company introduced a policy earlier this month allowing all guests who booked prior to 14 March (and were checking in no later than 31 May) to <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com.au/help/article/2701/extenuating-circumstances-policy-for-the-coronavirus-covid19\">cancel existing bookings</a> for free. Porgazian says this left hosts holding the cheque.</p> <p>\u201cWe lost everything straight away \u2026 Everything is cancelled, basically until Christmas.\u201d</p> <p>Susan Wheeldon, Airbnb\u2019s country manager for Australia and New Zealand, said offering these free cancellations \u201cwasn\u2019t an easy decision\u201d, but it was one made with \u201cpublic health considerations\u201d front of mind. \u201cThe primary consideration for us was protecting the wellbeing of the community.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018There\u2019s not enough tenants to fill these places\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6969e69415989dd7c073b6e1563f4ffa1eaf903\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6969e69415989dd7c073b6e1563f4ffa1eaf903/0_0_1169_523/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A screen grab of a \u2018Quarantine rental\u2019 ad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"447\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A screen grab of a \u2018quarantine rental\u2019 advertised on Airbnb taken on 26 March.

He\u2019s getting flooded with properties from Airbnb hosts who now need permanent tenants. But with so many of the town\u2019s hospitality staff and backpackers currently out of work \u201cthere\u2019s not enough tenants to fill these places\u201d.</p> <p>If rents did lower, it would be a massive relief. It\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/wjve7b/the-story-of-how-airbnb-penetrated-byron-bay-made-rental-properties-expensive\">notoriously difficult for locals to find affordable rentals</a> in Byron Bay, as <a href=\"https://www.scu.edu.au/engage/news/latest-news/2019/byron-shire-residents-have-their-say-on-controversial-airbnb-impacts.php\">17.6%</a> of properties are listed as holiday accommodation. \u201cAirbnb should be banned up here,\u201d Lipshus says.<strong> \u201c</strong>The cost of living is insane. I\u2019ve lived in all sorts of places here, and it\u2019s not uncommon to pay at least 50% of your wage in rent.\u201d</p> <p>Martin describes the current regulation around Airbnb as \u201creally quite liberal\u201d. He says at present, it \u201cdidn\u2019t seem to fit well with highly local impacts. Local councils [should] have a strategy and a plan around short-term letting \u2013 especially around limits.\u201d</p> <p>For now, he is not so certain we\u2019ll see a drop in rents. \u201cLandlords may still withhold properties and leave them vacant instead,\u201d he says. \u201cFor whatever reason, that seems to be a surprisingly common scenario in the high-pressure [locations].\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/22/airbnb-model-housing-sharing\">AirBnb hasn\u2019t lived up to its utopian claims | Jay Owens</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wheeldon says that Airbnb \u201chas not seen a material drop in the overall number of listings on our platform.

For many, that may not be enough.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people have over-leveraged themselves with these properties,\u201d Lipshus says. \u201cThe upper-middle class are probably going to be fine. But the middle class \u2013 the ones taking risks, trying to get up that class ladder \u2013 they\u2019re going to be pretty fucked.\u201d</p> <p>Lisa Porgazian knows what people are saying. \u201cThe criticism that we\u2019re getting is \u2018well you shouldn\u2019t have a business if you can\u2019t pay for it\u2019, but who <em>ever </em>predicted something like this?\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Boris Johnson has been admitted to hospital due to coronavirus after suffering 10 days of symptoms including a high fever, bringing doubts about his capability to lead the response to the pandemic despite No 10 insisting it was purely precautionary.</p> \n<p>Johnson was taken to an unnamed London hospital on Sunday after days of persistent symptoms, during which time he has been self-isolating. Last week No 10 had denied the prime minister was more seriously ill than claimed.</p> \n<p>A Downing Street spokesperson said: \u201cOn the advice of his doctor, the prime minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests. This is a precautionary step, as the prime minister continues <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/02/boris-johnson-shows-covid-19-symptoms-still-and-may-stay-in-isolation\">to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus</a> 10 days after testing positive for the virus.\u201d The spokesperson said Johnson would stay in hospital \u201cas long as needed\u201d.</p> \n<p>Officials were keen to stress that this was not an emergency admission, and that Johnson will remain in charge of government, and will be in regular touch with colleagues and civil servants.</p> \n<p>A government source told Reuters on Monday morning that Johnson had spent the night in hospital.</p> \n<p>If his condition worsens Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, is the designated minister to take charge.

Last week ministers were widely criticised for fluctuating claims over the total number of tests that could be conducted each day, with Boris Johnson\u2019s initial claim that 250,000 was possible superseded by Hancock\u2019s promise to scale up to 100,000 a day by the end of April.</p> <p>On Sunday, Hancock appeared to contradict himself over the production of the ventilators crucial to treatment of the most severe coronavirus cases, telling the BBC that there \u201cshould be another 1,500\u201d in a week\u2019s time before telling the Downing Street briefing \u201cwe haven\u2019t got an exact figure\u201d.</p> <p>He had announced the purchase of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/matt-hancock-35m-coronavirus-test-kits-are-on-the-way-to-the-nhs\">3.5m antibody test kits on 24 March</a> but a week later it emerged that they had not been bought, but rather had \u201ccontracts agreed subject to testing\u201d.</p> <p>The big range in immune response seen across the population also raises the troubling prospect that those who have had mild symptoms may not have long-term immunity against Covid-19.</p> <p>Prof Marion Koopmans, head of virology at the Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, whose lab is assessing home testing kits in the Netherlands, said: \u201cSo far, I\u2019m not aware of any home tests that have passed our quality mark. Based on what I\u2019ve seen so far I\u2019d be hesitant to give you an immunity passport based on a rapid test result.\u201d</p> <p>A senior UK scientist who is working on lab-based antibody testing for Covid-19, said that given the current state of knowledge he was \u201camazed the government had sufficient confidence\u201d to go ahead with the purchase of millions of tests. \u201cA lot of us did a double-take,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Another UK scientist said that none of the home test kits currently under evaluation in the UK were performing well enough, but did not give specific performance figures.</p> <p>Last month, Boris Johnson described the kits, which take as little as 20 minutes to use, as a potential \u201cgame changer\u201d and their use is outlined in the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/878121/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-strategy.pdf\">five pillar testing strategy</a>. However, this weekend Hancock played down expectations, telling BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show that there were no immediate plans to roll out antibody testing kits. \u201cWe\u2019re getting the test results through every day, I was looking at some last night,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we still don\u2019t have any that are good enough.\u201d</p> <p>Emerging evidence suggests that there is a wide range of antibody responses to coronavirus across the population, which may make the development of a simple, reliable home test that will work for everyone a considerable challenge. </p> <p>Dr David Ho, a leading infectious disease specialist at Columbia University in New York, said that, based on patient samples analysed by his team, those with severe illness tend to develop a faster and stronger antibody response. In people with milder symptoms, the presence of antibodies in the blood tends to ramp up more slowly, meaning that tests need to performed later.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is after a couple of weeks, the detection rate remains at about 50%-60%, especially in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases,\u201d Ho said. \u201cBut this may not be a fault of the tests, because even using more sensitive methods in the lab we can see the antibody levels are quite low.\u201d</p> <p>It is not yet clear whether this 50%-60% figure will improve much if people are tested three or four weeks after infection. To answer this, recovered patients need to be tracked for a longer period, but Koopmans is not optimistic that the detection rate will reach the levels seen in severe cases.</p> <p>\u201cThe sensitivity of these tests, I expect, will be relatively low,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you end up around 50%-60%. Even if they\u2019re not that costly, why burn all those assays if that\u2019s the information you get?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Some of the commercial home tests claim, in promotional materials, to have sensitivities above 90%. However, these figures are likely to be based on tests in patients recovering in hospital, who represent the most severe end of the spectrum in terms of symptoms. \u201cThere\u2019s this missing piece of how does it work in the 85% of people in the other category,\u201d said Koopmans.</p> <p>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cAntibody tests offer the hope that people who think they have had the disease will know they are immune and get back to life as normal. We are currently working with several companies who are offering these tests and are evaluating their effectiveness.</p> <p>\u201cThe Covid[-19] scientific advisory panel, led by Prof Sir John Bell, is currently undertaking a rapid evaluation process to establish their reliability. We will publish the results of this evaluation once it is completed.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Now we know just how serious things are. The UK has just wheeled out its biggest gun. The Queen has only ever given an unscheduled TV address to the nation on four previous occasions, either when the nation or the royal family itself was under threat. And as sure as hell Her Majesty wasn\u2019t about to update us on Prince Andrew handing himself over to the FBI or Harry and Meghan\u2019s ongoing flat hunting nightmare; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/queen-urges-britons-stay-strong-coronavirus-covid-lockdown\">this could only mean the country was in a coronavirus crisis</a>.</p> \n<p>Keeping one hand firmly clasped around her wrist and her body a safe distance from a lone BBC cameraman dressed in a hazmat suit \u2013 there\u2019s no shortage of personal protective equipment in Windsor Castle \u2013 the Queen, interspersed with footage of NHS workers and the wider general public, spoke to the country from her study. Wisely, she kept it short and sweet. This wasn\u2019t a Christmas message when half the country would be pissed and the other half wouldn\u2019t be listening. Now every sentence would be picked over and every word would count.</p> \n<p>The Queen began by acknowledging the challenges everyone was facing: death; financial hardship (some more than others, when it comes to the royal family); and separation, before going on to praise the selflessness of those in the NHS and other frontline emergency services. She then said how much she hoped people would maintain the self-sacrifice, self-discipline, compassion and sense of humour needed to defeat the illness.</p> \n<p>On the hottest weekend of the year so far, this rang a little hollow as most of the country appeared to have gone outdoors with the sole purpose of snitching on any people they came across who weren\u2019t keeping the appropriate safe distance from one another. B&amp;Q have had a massive run on tape measures in the past week. It won\u2019t be long before there\u2019s also a black market in tasers to take out sweaty joggers.</p> \n<p>After a nod to the Commonwealth and the global nature of the pandemic \u2013 this wasn\u2019t the plucky Brits taking on the might of Nazi Germany singlehandedly in 1940 \u2013 the Queen mentioned a previous address she and Princess Margaret had made to the nation in 1940. Still, she could be forgiven the solipsism as she had done her bit during the second world war, having spent the latter years of the war driving military trucks. As yet there were no promises to turn any of the royal palaces into field hospitals or emergency supply depots, though she might be holding that in reserve for another day.</p> \n<p>The Queen ended with a promise that better days would one day return and that in the meantime we should hold our nerve and do our best to be the generation of which future ones would be proud. We can but hope. She even came over a bit Vera Lynn, promising us \u201cwe\u2019ll meet again\u201d. Only without the singing. Small mercies. Maybe next time. Given the circumstances, it had been more or less a pitch perfect speech. After all there\u2019s only a certain amount a head of state can say at times like these.</p> \n<p>But one thing was notable by its absence. Although it\u2019s her job to be apolitical, there was no mention of the government\u2019s efforts or requests to follow official advice. Her Maj still hasn\u2019t forgotten how she was used, and made a fool of, by Boris Johnson over the prorogation and pointless Queen\u2019s speech. In Boris, she doesn\u2019t trust. But then who does?</p> \n<p>The subtext was unmistakeable. If the country was to survive, it would do so through the collective resolve of its people, not through a government that had been slow to react and was still making promises it did not know it would be able to keep. And with that she faded out after little less than four minutes.</p> \n<p>Throughout, her face remained more or less expressionless \u2013 inscrutability to hide the pain \u2013 but she had done what was required. Simply by being there, she had shown she cared. She had provided the clear moral leadership that many politicians have failed to provide. For some people nothing she could have said would have been enough, while others would have taken comfort. Most people probably wouldn\u2019t have cared much either way. But it was a necessary rite of passage. And a tough gig when underneath you\u2019re just as scared \u2013 if not more so, given her age \u2013 as everyone else. There\u2019s no disguising it: the Queen\u2019s a class act.</p>",
  "<p>I had hoped to interview the plant neurobiologist <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/speakers/stefano_mancuso\">Stefano Mancuso</a> at his laboratory at the University of Florence. I picture it as a botanical utopia: a place where flora is respected for its awareness and intelligence; where sensitive mimosa plants can demonstrate <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/phenomena/2015/12/15/can-a-plant-remember-this-one-seems-to-heres-the-evidence/\">their long memories</a>; and where humans are invited to learn how to be a better species by observing the behaviour of our verdant fellow organisms.</p> <p>But because we are both on lockdown, we Skype from our homes. Instead of meeting his clever plants, I make do with admiring a pile of cannonball-like pods from an aquatic species, on the bookshelves behind him. \u201cThey\u2019re used for propagation,\u201d he says. \u201cI am always collecting seeds.\u201d</p> <p>Before Mancuso\u2019s lab started work in 2005, plant neurobiology was largely seen as a laughable concept. \u201cWe were interested in problems that were, until that moment, just related to animals, like intelligence and even behaviour,\u201d he says. At the time, it was \u201calmost forbidden\u201d to talk about behaviour in plants. But \u201cwe study how plants are able to solve problems, how they memorise, how they communicate, how they have their social life and things like that\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b407655007c5374e751be2026c823bec4cb94c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b407655007c5374e751be2026c823bec4cb94c8/0_0_4200_2811/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Flowers of Mimosa pudica\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flower power ...

If you let a drop of water fall on a <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/08/do-plants-think-james-wong\">Mimosa pudica</a></em>, its kneejerk response is to recoil its leaves, but, if you continue doing so, the plant will quickly cotton on that the water is harmless and stop reacting. The plants can hold on to this knowledge for weeks, even when their living conditions, such as lighting, are changed. \u201cThat was unexpected because we were thinking about very short memories, in the range of one or two days \u2013 the average memory of insects,\u201d says Mancuso. \u201cTo find that plants were able to memorise for two months was a surprise.\u201d Not least because they don\u2019t have brains.</p> <p>In a plant, a single brain would be a fatal flaw because they have evolved to be lunch. \u201cPlants use a very different strategy,\u201d says Mancuso. \u201cThey are very good at diffusing the same function all over the body.\u201d You can remove 90% of a plant without killing it. \u201cYou need to imagine a plant as a huge brain. Maybe not as efficient as in the case of animals, but diffused everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most controversial aspects of Mancuso\u2019s work is the idea of plant consciousness. As we learn more about animal and plant intelligence, not to mention human intelligence, the always-contentious term consciousness has become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/21/-sp-why-cant-worlds-greatest-minds-solve-mystery-consciousness\">the subject of ever more heated scientific and philosophical debate</a>.<strong> </strong>\u201cLet\u2019s use another term,\u201d Mancuso suggests. \u201cConsciousness is a little bit tricky in both our languages. Let\u2019s talk about awareness. Plants are perfectly aware of themselves.\u201d A simple example is when one plant overshadows another \u2013 the shaded plant will grow faster to reach the light. But when you look into the crown of a tree, all the shoots are heavily shaded. They do not grow fast because they know that they are shaded by part of themselves. \u201cSo they have a perfect image of themselves and of the outside,\u201d says Mancuso.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When corn is nibbled by caterpillars, the plant emits a distress signal that lures parasitic wasps to exterminate them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Science struggles to view plants as active and motivated because its outlook is so humancentric, he argues. One test for self-awareness in animals is whether they can look in a mirror and understand that they are looking at themselves. \u201cVery few animals are able to do this,\u201d says Mancuso. \u201cHumans, dolphins, a few apes and probably elephants. This has been taken in recent years as a kind of evidence that just these few groups of animals have self-awareness.\u201d Mancuso believes this is wrong. \u201cMy personal opinion is that there is no life that is not aware of itself. For me, it\u2019s impossible to imagine any form of life that is not able to be intelligent, to solve problems.\u201d</p> <p>Another misconception is that plants are the definition of a vegetative state \u2013 incommunicative and insensitive to what is around them. But Mancuso says plants are far more sensitive than animals. \u201cAnd this is not an opinion. This is based on thousands of pieces of evidence. We know that a single root apex is able to detect at least 20 different chemical and physical parameters, many of which we are blind to.\u201d There could be a tonne of cobalt or nickel under our feet, and we would have no idea, whereas \u201cplants can sense a few milligrams in a huge amount of soil\u201d, he says.</p> <p>Far from being silent and passive, plants are social and communicative, above ground and beneath, through their roots and fungal networks. They are adept at detecting subtle electromagnetic fields generated by other life forms. They use chemicals and scents to warn each other of danger, deter predators and attract pollinating insects. When corn is nibbled by caterpillars, for example, the plant emits a chemical distress signal that lures parasitic wasps to exterminate the caterpillars.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ef054ca6030930e7faefec8e44f0a039ca969b9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef054ca6030930e7faefec8e44f0a039ca969b9e/0_0_3600_2400/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Old Tjikko\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A slower pace of life ... Old Tjikko in Sweden is almost 10,000 years old.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lars Johansson/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Plants respond to sound, too, \u201cfeeling\u201d vibrations all over. \u201cPlants are extremely good at detecting specific kinds of sounds, for example at 200hz or 300hz \u2026 because they are seeking the sound of running water.\u201d If you put a source of 200hz sound close to the roots of a plant, he says, they will follow it. There is no evidence that the human voice benefits plants, although talking to plants may soothe the humans doing it.</p> <p>Another reason we overlook plants\u2019 intelligence is their vastly slower pace of life. In Mancuso\u2019s new book, The Incredible Journey of Plants, we meet the world\u2019s oldest plant \u2013 Old Tjikko \u2013 a red fir tree whose roots have writhed in the Swedish earth for about 9,560 years. We are also introduced to the ingenious seeds of crimson fountain grass, which choose not to germinate until the conditions are perfect \u2013 and can survive for six years while waiting.</p> <p>The main thrust of the book is that plants were the original pioneers and have been forever exploring the planet. Mancuso eschews the notion of \u201cnative species\u201d and prizes so-called invasive species above all else. \u201cThe more invasive they are, the more I like them, because they are the most brilliant example of the ability to solve problems,\u201d he says. \u201cInvasive species are the most beautiful plants that I can imagine.\u201d For Mancuso, \u201cmigration is one of the most important forces of nature. All living organisms migrate. We are the only species that is not allowed to, and this is completely unnatural.\u201d<strong> </strong></p> <p>Although new generations of botanists are increasingly embracing plant neurobiology, Mancuso still has his detractors. Last summer, a group of eight plant scientists wrote in the journal <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/trends/plant-science/fulltext/S1360-1385(19)30126-8\">Trends in Plant Science</a> that Mancuso and his colleagues \u201chave consistently glossed over the unique and remarkable degree of structural, organisational and functional complexity that the animal brain had to evolve before consciousness could emerge\u201d. Mancuso says that almost all of these botanists are retired. \u201cIt\u2019s an older generation of plant scientists that is completely against any notion of a plant as intelligent or behaving. For them, plants are kind of a semi-living organic machine.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All living organisms migrate. We are the only species that is not allowed to, and this is completely unnatural</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The notion that humans are the apex of life on Earth is one of the most dangerous ideas around, says Mancuso: \u201cWhen you feel yourself better than all the other humans or other living organisms, you start to use them. This is exactly what we\u2019ve been doing. We felt ourselves as outside nature.\u201d The average lifespan of a species on Earth is between 2m and 5m years. \u201cHomo sapiens have lived just 300,000 years,\u201d he says \u2013 and already \u201cwe have been able to almost destroy our environment. From this point of view, how can we say that we are better organisms?\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps we should try \u2013 ahem \u2013 taking a leaf out of the plant kingdom\u2019s book. Human societies and organisations are structured like our bodies \u2013 with a brain, or a top-level control centre, and various different organs governing specific functions. \u201cWe use this in our universities, our companies, even our class divisions,\u201d says Mancuso. This structure enables us to move fast, physically and organisationally, but it also leaves us vulnerable. If a major organ fails, it could scupper everything, and top-down leadership rarely serves the whole.</p> <p>Plants, by contrast, \u201care kind of horizontal, diffusive, decentralised organisations that are much more in line with modernity\u201d. Take the internet, the ultimate decentralised root system. \u201cLook at the ability of Wikipedia to produce a wonderful amount of good-quality information by using a decentralised, diffused organisation. I\u2019m claiming that, by studying plant networks, we can find wonderful solutions for us,\u201d Or take the ethos of cooperation. Plants, say Mancuso, \u201care masters of starting symbiotic relationships with other organisms: bacteria, mushrooms, insects, even us. Just look at the way they use us to be transported all around the world.\u201d We may think we have the upper hand, but plants may beg to differ.</p> <p><em>The Incredible Journey of Plants by Stefano Mancuso</em><em> is published by </em><em>Other Press</em></p>",

  "<p>Isn\u2019t it funny, in a lovely sort of way, how rewatching certain films and TV shows feels like reacquainting yourself with old friends?

  "<p>The population of Queensland\u2019s youth detention centres has ballooned to near capacity amid a government-sponsored crime crackdown, prompting concern from human rights activists that vulnerable children are being placed at risk during the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>The state\u2019s human rights commissioner, Scott McDougall, said without urgent attention, he thought it \u201cinevitable\u201d that children would again be \u201cwarehoused for prolonged periods\u201d in police watch houses \u2013 a situation that provoked outcry about their treatment and prompted reforms of the youth justice system.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-is-a-ticking-time-bomb-for-the-australian-prison-system\">Coronavirus is a ticking time bomb for the Australian prison system | Thalia Anthony</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cLast year we saw children held in adult watch houses in some cases for weeks on end,\u201d McDougall told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>\u201cOn the present trajectory we are rapidly approaching the same situation and the Covid-19 pandemic brings another layer of complexity to this crisis.\u201d</p> <p>In 2018, Guardian Australia reported concerns about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/15/boy-held-at-remote-queensland-police-station-for-11-days-as-amnesty-warns-of-crisis\">children being held in watch houses for extended periods</a> due to overcrowded detention centres.</p> <p>The ABC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/4corners/inside-the-watch-house/11108448\">Four Corners program</a> last year revealed that children as young as 10 had been housed in police custody alongside maximum security offenders.</p> <p>The program prompted significant reform by the Queensland government and its approach was praised by human rights groups. It established a separate department for youth justice and announced initiatives to keep children out of detention and watch houses.</p> <p>Last month the government made an about-face policy pivot: it <a href=\"http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2020/3/10/hard-line-on-youth-crime\">announced a new \u201chard line on youth crime\u201d approach</a> that aimed to place more children in detention. This was partly a response to vocal campaigning by local media in Townsville, where Labor seats are considered vulnerable at this year\u2019s state election.</p> <p>In its announcement, the government said it would take \u201ctougher action on bail\u201d including seeking to keep more children on remand, and a \u201cpolice blitz on bail\u201d to appeal court decisions.</p> <p>\u201cThese are changes our MPs in Cairns, Townsville, Rockhampton and the Gold Coast have advocated and the government has acted,\u201d the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said.</p> <p>This week, there are 223 children in youth detention centres; significantly up from late last year, when the initial youth justice reforms were starting to take effect.</p> <p>There are 258 youth detention beds in Queensland, but it is unclear whether these are all available, as ongoing expansion works at the Brisbane Youth Detention Centre had temporarily reduced its capacity, and these works are ongoing.</p> <p>Human rights advocates with knowledge of Queensland\u2019s youth detention system say the \u201csafe\u201d capacity of these centres is below the total bed numbers, as crowded facilities limit the ability of authorities to separate detainees of different ages and risk profiles.</p> <p>Crowding is often also considered a contributing factor to incidents in youth detention centres. On 18 March, a disturbance occurred at the Townsville centre that involved three boys climbing on to the roof.</p> <p>McDougall said the overwhelming majority of children in youth detention were from Aboriginal families, and many were accused of offences while living in unstable residential care arrangements.</p> <p>\u201cThe situation calls for intensive resources to be made available to Aboriginal controlled organisations to assist the safe return of children to Aboriginal families and kinship carers. Aboriginal voices need to be heard in the process of finding creative solutions to this pressing crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Concerns about \u201chard line\u201d policies disproportionately affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are heightened by the Covid-19 pandemic, and broad powers given to police to enforce public health regulations.</p> <p>Amnesty International Indigenous rights campaigner Lidia Thorpe said detention often took children out of safe environments with family.</p> <p>\u201cLocking them up is putting them at more risk, given we\u2019ve seen already this virus has got into prisons. Because of the overcrowding it puts kids or anyone at more risk of getting the virus.</p> <p>\u201cThe safest place for these kids is at home.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/14/nsw-police-put-children-as-young-as-nine-many-of-them-indigenous-under-surveillance\">NSW police put children as young as nine, many of them Indigenous under surveillance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thorpe was critical of the government\u2019s youth crime shift, which she said fed into a narrative that promotes racist attitudes towards Aboriginal people.</p> <p>\u201cI think we have to keep in mind the Queensland election is coming up and unfortunately when we do have progressive governments in power, it becomes a race to the bottom on law and order. We\u2019ve seen this around the country where we\u2019ve had Labor governments in power.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s wrong to suggest that when we see a child misbehaving that the best thing for that is to lock them up and isolate them. If this was happening to non-Aboriginal kids we would see an outrage in this nation, but [because] it\u2019s happening to Aboriginal people it\u2019s like it\u2019s expected.\u201d</p> <p>The office of the state minister for child safety, youth and women, Di Farmer, said in March there were an average of seven young people a day held in police watch houses \u2013 down from 34 in March 2019 \u2013 and that the vast majority of those were waiting for a court hearing or processing.</p> <p>\u201cThe average number of days spent in a Queensland police watch house since January 2020 was two days, which reflects the significant transport arrangements required for transfer from remote and regional communities,\u201d a spokesman for the minister said.</p> <p>\u201cThe government is investing $177m in new youth detention centres beds, which includes the expansion of Brisbane Youth Detention centre with 16 new beds due to come online in May, and construction of a new 32-bed youth detention centre at Wacol.</p> <p>\u201cThis investment means state-wide capacity will increase from 258 beds to 306 beds by the end of this year.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Perhaps your flatmate has polished off the last beer in the fridge, diverging tastes in Netflix series have led to simmering tensions, or parental negotiations over home-schooling have descended into hostility.</p> <p>Life in lockdown can fuel family tensions, sour friendships and drive a wedge between new romantic partners who have opted to self-isolate together. Help is on hand, however.</p> <p>A former Nasa astronaut, Jay Buckey, has launched an online self-help toolkit aimed at replicating the kind of training designed to help astronauts cope with confinement in small spaces for extended periods.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s challenging to be isolated with a small group of people and to not be able to get away,\u201d said Buckey, who flew on a 16-day <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia\" title=\"Space Shuttle Columbia\">Space Shuttle Columbia</a> mission that orbited the Earth 256 times. \u201cOuter space and your own living room might be drastically different physically, but emotionally the stressors can be the same.\u201d</p> <p>The online training, called <a href=\"https://path.dartmouth.edu/\">the Dartmouth Path Program</a>, was developed to determine how the space programme can manage pressures brought on by long-duration spaceflight. It is already being tested in extreme environments such as research stations in Antarctica, but since social distancing restrictions came into force it has been made freely available to the public online.</p> <p>It includes training on conflict resolution, mood management and self-assessment tools to be able to monitor signs of anxiety and stress.</p> <p>For stress, the programme prompts the participant to consider whether they could be over-reacting, catastrophising or making judgments that don\u2019t fit the evidence. Focused breathing and muscle relaxation techniques are outlined for when you are feeling anxious or angry.</p> <p>The training also covers depression, which can set in when you feel restricted and unable to do the things that normally boost your mood, according to Buckey, who is now a professor of medicine at Dartmouth College.</p> <p>The programme encourages people to select problems and find aspects they can improve or solve and to brainstorm positive steps they can take. It encourages people to think about a single enjoyable activity that is possible to do each day. \u201cIf you focus constantly on what you can\u2019t do or things you want to do or that you\u2019re isolated, that\u2019s not good for mood,\u201d said Buckey.</p> <p>Keeping a balance between group time and private time is crucial, he said. \u201cYou need to allow people their privacy but not to allow them to become isolated and separated from a group,\u201d he said. \u201cIf someone\u2019s spending all their time in their room with their door closed, that\u2019s not great. Forcing people to take part in group activities that they\u2019re just not into \u2013 that\u2019s not good either.\u201d</p> <p>According to Buckey, Nasa and other agencies now give psychological training to avoid conflict between crew members, but the problem blighted some missions in the past. The Russian cosmonaut Valentin Lebvedev, who documented his 211-day stay onboard the Space Station Salyut 7 with Anatoly Berezovoy, wrote: \u201cWe don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on with us. We silently walk by each other, feeling offended. We have to find some way to make things better.\u201d</p> <p>Scientists on Antarctic missions have also struggled with isolation, Buckey said, pointing to the notes of Jean Rivolier, a French psychologist and chief doctor on several Antarctic expeditions, describing the dismal morale of one party in the 1990s.</p> <p>\u201cOne subject returned early to Sydney on psychological grounds, because he was homesick for his family and he became progressively more depressed,\u201d Rivolier wrote. \u201cWhen the others returned they were humourless, tired, despondent and resentful. None had found the Antarctic experience to be enjoyable, not so much from any rigours of the climate, terrain or personal hardships as from inconsiderate and selfish behaviour.\u201d</p> <p>Pete Davis, an oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey, said the uncertain length of missions to the south pole, due to weather considerations, was challenging. The \u201cworst thing to do\u201d, he said, was to focus on when isolation would end. \u201cThe best thing to avoid is what\u2019s going to happen in three months time when you\u2019ve only just started,\u201d he said. \u201cAll you can control is what\u2019s going to happen today or tomorrow.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Davis, who returned from a three-month Antarctic mission in February only to be plunged back into confinement at home, advised that simple, considerate gestures could help ensure harmony.</p> <p>\u201cIn Antarctica, full-blown conflict doesn\u2019t tend to happen, but the small niggle of \u2018that\u2019s so annoying\u2019 does,\u201d he said. \u201cJust things like if you\u2019re going to make a cup of tea, make sure you ask everyone as well. It\u2019s such a minor thing but it can get under people\u2019s skin.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>The career of Bill Withers, who has died aged 81 of heart complications, followed an unusual trajectory. He did not try to enter the music industry until after he had spent nine years in the US Navy, leaving the service in 1965 and moving to Los Angeles two years later. By the time he released his debut album, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbbwiE2GgkE&amp;list=PL94gOvpr5yt0ZTCb-BSB9yffdRgosvzat\" title=\"\">Just As I Am</a>, in 1971 he was 33, an age at which many pop careers have already been and gone.</p> <p>But Withers made up for lost time. His album was packed with memorable songs, including Harlem and Grandma\u2019s Hands, and entered the US Top 40. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CICIOJqEb5c\" title=\"\">Ain\u2019t No Sunshine</a>, his first single, reached No 3 and became one of the landmark songs in his career, despite lasting a scant two minutes. Inspired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/dec/16/blake-edwards-obituary\" title=\"\">Blake Edwards</a>\u2019 gruelling 1962 film about alcoholism, Days of Wine and Roses, it has become an enduring anthem of loneliness and heartbreak.</p> <p>His second album, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpwHeCLAO3M&amp;list=PL94gOvpr5yt0yjw5N1_g8hfmp-BxacIDz\" title=\"\">Still Bill</a> (1972), was another formidable collection (Rolling Stone called it \u201ca stone-soul masterpiece\u201d). It reached No 4 on the US album chart and gave Withers a No 2 hit with Use Me, as well as his sole chart-topping single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOZ-MySzAac\" title=\"\">Lean on Me</a>. This was an ode to the power of friendship conceived with the simplicity of a gospel classic, apparently the work of an artist in complete control of his music and his destiny. In October 1974 he performed in Zaire with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/dec/26/guardianobituaries.usa\" title=\"\">James Brown</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jan/20/etta-james\" title=\"\">Etta James</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/15/bb-king-obituary-mississippi-farmhand-blues-legend\" title=\"\">BB King</a>, in the run-up to the fabled Rumble in the Jungle world heavyweight fight between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/04/muhammad-ali-obituary\" title=\"\">Muhammad Ali</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/george-foreman\" title=\"\">George Foreman</a>.</p> <p>However, what looked like incipient megastardom never came to fruition. After the demise of his original record label, Sussex, Withers was signed to Columbia, where he was never comfortable and felt nothing but contempt for what he considered to be the company\u2019s narrow-minded executives. Though he notched up two more definitive hit singles, the serene and mantra-like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEeaS6fuUoA\" title=\"\">Lovely Day</a> (1977) and the hook-up with the saxophonist Grover Washington Jr on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ccik3Fz_Lw\" title=\"\">Just the Two of Us</a> (1981), his sales tailed off.</p> <p>However, it was to Withers\u2019 advantage that he had never considered music his sole purpose in life. \u201cThe business came to me in my 30s,\u201d he later reflected. \u201cI was socialised as a regular guy. I never felt like I owned it or it owned me.\u201d</p> <p>His naval experience had given him self-confidence as well as the skills required of an aircraft mechanic. Before he signed a recording deal he supported himself by working at a variety of aircraft factories in California, paying to make his own demo recordings at night. Emerging from the other end of his music career, he never looked back. He focused on building a property portfolio in partnership with his second wife, Marcia, whom he married in 1976, while raising their children, Todd and Kori. Marcia also supervised the running of his music publishing company \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m lucky I married a woman with an MBA,\u201d he pointed out.</p> <p>Born in Slab Fork, West Virginia, Bill was the youngest of six children of William Harrison Withers Sr, a coal miner, and his wife, Mattie. They divorced when Bill was three, and William Sr died when he was 13. Growing up in poverty, Withers heard whatever music happened to catch his attention. \u201cMostly country music,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd there was music in church, and whatever they taught you at school. And then there was the old Frank Sinatra \u2013 Nat King Cole genre type music. So whatever I could stand to listen to, I listened to.\u201d He remembered singing a capella gospel music, \u201cbecause that\u2019s something we could do without owning any instruments.\u201dHe had been born with a severe stutter: \u201cPeople laughed right in my face when I was trying to say something.\u201d At 17 he joined the navy and a speech therapy course organised by one of his commanding officers helped him to overcome it. The training perhaps also helped to give his singing voice its strength and emotional authority.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/16/letter-bill-withers-obituary\">Letter: Bill Withers obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He had no involvement in music while in the navy, but back in the US he visited nightclubs \u2013 \u201cI was only trying to meet girls, I wasn\u2019t looking for any music\u201d \u2013 and saw artists such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jan/10/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1\" title=\"\">Lou Rawls</a>. It occurred to Withers that music might be something he could do. \u201cI probably had some kind of hidden poet buried in my soul somewhere,\u201d he reflected. \u201cSort of a casual interest turned into a pursuit.\u201d</p> <p>He took some of his demo recordings to Ray Jackson, a member of the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band, which led to them being heard by Clarence Avant, the head of the Sussex label. He liked what he heard, commenting that \u201cBill Withers is a genius storyteller.\u201d He recruited Booker T Jones, of Booker T &amp; the MGs, to produce an album, and with the aid of musicians including members of the MGs and Stephen Stills on lead guitar, Just As I Am was recorded. \u201cHis voice and guitar was all he had, and that was almost all that was necessary,\u201d said Jones. \u201cSo I just tried to be minimalistic.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the huge attention brought by his first two albums, Withers was not happy. He did not enjoy touring, and his marriage to the TV star Denise Nicholas in 1973 brought mostly conflict. They divorced after barely a year and his album <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMKBINhQZO0&amp;list=PLFT8hHMDoMC_wLwIj0h6TTivkck-IaZfg\" title=\"\">+\u2019Justments</a> (1974) was released in the aftermath. In 1975 Sussex went bankrupt, and Withers signed his ill-fated deal with Columbia. His final album for them, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwCBGuv5wM\" title=\"\">Watching You Watching Me</a>, only reached 143 on the US chart. Withers launched a lawsuit to get out of his Columbia contract.</p> <p>He did not release any new recordings after 1985, but Lovely Day, which reached No 7 in the UK in 1977, hit No 4 when it was reissued in 1988. The tune has been sampled by numerous artists including Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince, R Kelly and Maroon 5. Withers won Grammy Awards for Ain\u2019t No Sunshine, Just The Two of Us and Lean on Me, and his songs have been used in major films including Looking for Mr Goodbar, Jerry Maguire, Jackie Brown, Notting Hill, The Bodyguard and American Beauty. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005 and in 2006 received ASCAP\u2019s Rhythm and Soul Heritage award. In 2015 he was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame by Stevie Wonder. In 2017 he was given an honorary degree from West Virginia University.</p> <p>In 2009 Withers was profiled in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0thRH4qucU\" title=\"\">the documentary Still Bill</a>, which depicted a satisfied man experiencing no regrets about walking away from the music business. \u201cWhen somebody asks \u2018what have you been doing?\u2019 the answer is \u2018living\u2019,\u201d he said in 2003. \u201cI have no bitterness.

  "<p>Joe Biden will wear a mask if he goes out in public, the former vice-president and probable Democratic presidential nominee said on Sunday.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> said on Friday he would not wear a mask, despite new guidelines issued by the White House that day \u2013 and announced from the Briefing Room podium by the president \u2013 for people to wear face coverings in public places.</p> <p>In an interview with ABC\u2019s This Week, Biden also defended his work as vice-president in the Obama administration in terms of preparing for such a pandemic.</p> <p>Trump has repeatedly sought to blame his predecessor for the federal government\u2019s slow and disjointed response to the arrival on US soil of Covid-19, the virus which by Sunday had infected more than 312,000 Americans and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/05/coronavirus-map-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">killed nearly 8,500</a>.</p> <p>At the White House on Friday, Trump told reporters \u201cthe [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure\u201d.</p> <p>But he added: \u201cThis is voluntary. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be doing it.\u201d</p> <p>In an interview on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday, Biden, 77, sequestered at home in Wilmington, Delaware, was asked if he would wear a mask.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, I think it\u2019s important to follow the science, listen to the experts do what they tell you.\u201d</p> <p>Trump, 73, said \u201cI just don\u2019t want to wear one myself\u201d and added that he was \u201cfeeling good\u201d.</p> <p>The wearing of masks is recommended as a way to stop people who have the virus but may not be showing symptoms from infecting others.</p> <p>Trump ploughed on: \u201cSomehow, sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk, the great Resolute Desk, I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don\u2019t know, somehow I don\u2019t see it for myself. Maybe I\u2019ll change my mind, but this will pass, and hopefully it will pass very quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Biden responded: \u201c[Trump] may not like how he looks in a mask but the truth of the matter is \u2026 follow the science. That\u2019s what they\u2019re telling us. So if I go out in public, and I have not gone to commercial places of late, I haven\u2019t gone to my local church \u2026 but my generic point is that you should follow the science.\u201d</p> <p>Biden also described preparations the Obama administration took to handle any pandemic, moves he said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a> had dismantled.</p> <p>\u201cWe did a lot to prepare,\u201d he said. \u201cAs you know \u2026 we set up a pandemic office within the White House, we expanded CDC in other countries so we could in fact, observe, see when things were coming, how things were moving.</p> <p>\u201cWe put people in China. I mean we did a whole lot of things, and they got a very detailed breakdown on this by a briefing, the Trump administration, when we transitioned out of office, but the president dismantled almost all of that and he drastically cut the budget for the CDC \u2026 so he didn\u2019t follow through on any of what we suggested was going to be a real problem.</p> <p>\u201cWe can do much better than [what is] being done now.\u201d</p> <p>Appearing on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Jay Inslee, governor of Washington state where the virus first took hold on US soil, slammed Trump over the White House response.</p> <p>\u201cThis is ludicrous that we do not have a national effort in this,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cTo say [the federal government is] a backup\u201d \u2013 as Trump has repeatedly said this week \u201c\u2026Can you imagine if Franklin Roosevelt said: \u2018I\u2019ll be right behind you Connecticut, good luck building those battleships\u2019?</p> <p>\u201cIf he wants to be a wartime president, be a wartime president. Show some leadership.

Capt Crozier was cheered from the ship but on Saturday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a> criticized him for writing the letter.</p> <p>\u201cI thought it was terrible what he did, to write a letter,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a class on literature. This is a captain of a massive ship that\u2019s nuclear-powered.\u201d</p> <p>The defense secretary, Mark Esper, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday \u201cthere is an investigation ongoing\u201d but repeated that he supported the decision to fire Crozier because Thomas Modly, the acting navy secretary, had lost confidence in him.</p> <p>\u201cWhen all those facts come to bear we\u2019ll have a chance to understand\u201d why the decision was taken, Esper said.</p> <p>Esper also dismissed <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/04/trump-wants-him-fired-inside-ouster-capt-brett-crozier/\">reports</a><strong> </strong>that, as the Washington Post put it, Modly \u201ctold one colleague [on] Wednesday, the day before he announced the move: \u2018Breaking news: Trump wants him fired\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Biden said it was \u201cclose to criminal the way they\u2019re dealing with this guy. The idea that this man stood up and said what had to be said, got it out that his troops, his navy personnel were in danger \u2026 Look how many have the virus.</p> <p>\u201cI think he should have a commendation rather than be fired.\u201d</p> <p>Esper also appeared on ABC, where he said US military personnel would soon be required to wear masks on duty.</p>",

  "<p>Covid-19 is a chaotic disease which has upended the world\u2019s health systems, mobility and economy. And yet its patterns have become wearyingly predictable for those in the US and the UK, which seem bound together not just by a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d but by a worrying inadequacy in government response.</p> <p>In the face of rising public fear and frustration, even the loyalist press on both sides of the Atlantic are toppling like treacherous dominos, pushed over by the not-so-slight touch of facts and existential threat.<br><br>The bodies piling up in the makeshift morgues, the families and friends in hospital or worse, the sirens that sound all day and all night, are pieces of physical evidence ignored by only the most debased Twitter conspiracy theorist. <br> <br>It was startling to see the Daily Telegraph, the house journal of the Boris Johnson government, deliver the banner headline \u201cQuestions without answers\u201d last week as the government fumbled to give any clear responses on the lack of testing and the projections for lockdown.</p> <p>\u201cThis testing shambles is unforgivable: when will ministers act?\u201d asked the Daily Mail. Telling the public what they want to hear is suddenly out of fashion in partisan journalism. Instead, they are telling them what they need to hear. In public health, communication is everything. Policy and behavioural change is the target with Covid-19 and government accountability is the key.<br><br>In the US, the unthinkable happened as Fox News, which rallied behind Donald Trump in the earliest days of his coronavirus denial, sharply changed its tune. It fired Trish Regan, a host on Fox Business, after a histrionic opening monologue to her show where she blamed \u201cliberal media\u201d for spreading \u201cmass hysteria\u201d and using the coronavirus as a tool for impeachment.</p> <p>Sean Hannity, the most high profile and Trump-aligned Fox personality, dropped the \u201cCoronavirus hysteria\u201d graphic from 9 March and replaced it with a more sombre \u201cFacts over fear\u201d tone a week later. It might be too late. A survey from the Pew Research Center\u2019s Journalism and Media Project last week showed a stark division in beliefs about the spread of the virus, according to which cable outlet viewers watched.</p> <p>In a world where facts have been treated as optional, particularly by Fox News\u2019s main channel, the need for a shared belief in evidence-based coverage has now become a matter of life and death. An open letter from journalists and academics was sent to Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch, and his son and Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch, detailing the ways in which the deliberate spread of misinformation on the channel was endangering lives: \u201cInexcusably, Fox News has violated elementary canons of journalism. In so doing, it has contributed to the spread of a grave pandemic.\u201d<br><br>Some of the more comfortable practices of government press relations, on both sides of the Atlantic, have also been put under the microscope. In the UK, the briefing of lobby correspondents on complex health issues is clearly not working. While it is important to know how the government is thinking and forming its strategy, it is also important that subject experts can ask the harder follow-up questions. Off-the-record briefings to favoured journalists, particularly those with a large broadcast presence, have long been standard practice. But there is something shockingly irresponsible about ideas such as the disastrous \u201cherd immunity\u201d strategy being laundered through a journalist, even one as well respected as ITV\u2019s Robert Peston.</p> <p>Those with long memories will remember what a tour de force Peston was as a BBC journalist, breaking story after story on the financial collapse in 2008. As a highly skilled and experienced financial journalist, he was in the perfect position to understand and interrogate the information.<br><br>Ten days ago, the US press was debating why it sends political journalists to the White House daily press briefings, rather than health correspondents. Now a number of high-profile outlets, including the Washington Post and the New York Times, are simply not sending correspondents to the briefings at all, as editors judge the news-free pantomime of a miniature Trump rally not worth the risk to reporters\u2019 health.</p> <p>Cable and broadcast networks no longer, as a matter of course, carry the full two-hour rambling promotions. On a good day the medical expertise of Dr Anthony Fauci or Dr Deborah Birx comes to the fore, obscuring the boastful rambling of the president. On a bad day, you might get the Trump cheerleader and chief executive of MyPillow, Michael J Lindell, or Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s ineffectual son-in-law.<br><br>Not everything is worse than expected. If you had told New Yorkers, before the wave of a deadly pandemic broke over them, that the national hero of the catastrophe would be their governor, Andrew Cuomo, and his somewhat notorious powerpoint presentations, few would have believed it. Cuomo\u2019s peacetime reputation as a political blunt instrument, whose policies have neither addressed inequality or fixed the subway, has been blown away by a wartime leader of gravity and directness, warmth and steel.</p> <p>Cuomo is Churchillian, in that his decidedly poor record on many peacetime political matters has been largely erased by getting the wartime calls right. Cuomo\u2019s daily walk through the unvarnished numbers of New York City deaths, hospitalisations, availability of beds and ventilators, the expansion of emergency facilities, is nationally required viewing. The clarity of now, is reassuring in the grip of future uncertainty.</p> <p>Reliable clear information, presented in a clear understandable way, peppered with human empathy, goes a long way to papering over the yawning chasms of unpreparedness.<br><br>We are by now used to thinking ahead about what might change after the pandemic is tamed. For politicians and the media, the change ought to be that we replace the current pantomime of government press relations with a more serious piece of policy theatre, or even a dose of reality.<br></p>",

Larger trials of this and other treatments are under way, but won\u2019t report even preliminary findings for another week.</p> <p>In 1918, in the midst of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/closed-borders-and-black-weddings-what-the-1918-flu-teaches-us-about-coronavirus\">worst flu pandemic in history</a>, doctors all over the world prescribed quinine, another anti-malarial drug, even though there was no evidence that it worked for flu. At that time there was less understanding of how a drug interacted with the body, and they often over-prescribed it, causing side effects such as vertigo, tinnitus and vomiting. In his book about the British experience of the 1918 flu, <a href=\"https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9780230217744\">Living with Enza</a>, Mark Honigsbaum reports that Londoners refused to be fobbed off with advice to gargle with saltwater, and besieged chemists and doctors\u2019 surgeries demanding quinine.</p> <p>Plus \u00e7a change. But the deeper truth revealed by these examples is that in a crisis, it\u2019s not only politicians who are forced to make ethically loaded decisions; doctors and scientists are, too. In an ideal world, the scientists would furnish the facts and the politicians would weigh them against other facts and make decisions. The politicians would shoulder the ethical burden. But we don\u2019t live in an ideal world, and that division of labour is an illusion.</p> <p>As the philosopher David Kinney of the Santa Fe Institute <a href=\"https://sfi-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/sfi-edu/production/uploads/ckeditor/2020/03/30/t-001-kinney.pdf\">pointed out this week</a>, scientists rarely have all the facts in a crisis. The best they can offer is a range of possible outcomes with probabilities attached, and sometimes that range is so broad it\u2019s next to useless for a policymaker \u2013 so the scientist is forced to step out of her comfort zone and narrow that range based on criteria other than evidence. She makes ethical choices of her own, in other words. That\u2019s why now, as in 1918, you see scientists castigating each other in the media. \u201cThis is insane!\u201d <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/insane-many-scientists-lament-trump-s-embrace-risky-malaria-drugs-coronavirus\">one scientist tweeted recently</a>, about the Marseille study.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d5b6629f71eb2f34547381b12003da20f5f0611\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d5b6629f71eb2f34547381b12003da20f5f0611/0_199_5971_3583/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Professor of microbiology Didier Raoult.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Professor of microbiology Didier Raoult.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: G\u00e9rard Julien/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In that study, which is ongoing, <a href=\"https://time.com/5808894/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus/\">Covid-19 patients are treated</a> with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and an antibiotic, azithromycin. Hydroxychloroquine is a less toxic form of chloroquine, one of the most widely prescribed drugs in the world. Azithromycin is commonly prescribed for bacterial pneumonia, a potential complication of Covid-19.</p> <p>The combination \u2013 and, just as importantly, the doses being used in Marseille \u2013 have been reported to be safe in other patient groups. It is not yet known how safe they are in this one. There are hints the combination could have a cardiotoxic effect in some patients, so the doctors in Marseille screen all patients with an electrocardiogram before they treat them.</p> <p>To date, they have published results on 80 patients. They report reductions in viral load \u2013 meaning the patients are infectious for a shorter time \u2013 and improvement in symptoms, compared with Covid-19 patients hospitalised elsewhere. Their reports were initially <a href=\"https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/pre-prints-ihu/\">posted on the hospital\u2019s website</a>, in English, before being <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32205204\">peer reviewed</a>. The numbers are far too small, by normal clinical trial standards, and some have highlighted inconsistencies in those reports. Most egregiously of all, critics say, there is no proper control group \u2013 no group of age- and sex-matched patients who do not receive the treatment and who are monitored under the same conditions. Didier Raoult, the doctor leading the study, says it would be unethical to have one in a situation where people are fighting for their lives, his staff are risking theirs to save them, and there are no other really effective drug options.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/05/uk-coronavirus-covid-19-live-news-hancock-starmer\">UK coronavirus live news: Hancock says follow the rules or we'll ban all exercise outside</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Raoult directs France\u2019s leading centre of excellence in infectious diseases and is among the most highly cited scientists in the world in his domain.

He believes, simply, that time will prove him right.</p> <p>It may do. But when Sir Arthur Newsholme, the chief medical officer of the UK\u2019s local government board, made an ethical decision in August 1918, it turned out to be the wrong one. The first, mild wave of that pandemic had receded, and the first world war was entering its final phases. He decided to shelve plans for fighting a predicted second wave on the grounds that the war effort took precedence. Within a few weeks, Honigsbaum recounts, the flu had returned with a vengeance.</p> <p>\u201cPoliticians are judged by history,\u201d Raoult told me. \u201cI will be judged by my patients.\u201d That may be his mistake. Ours would be to think that our governments and the scientists advising them aren\u2019t making ethical decisions all the time, in this crisis. The decision to restrict testing to hospitals \u2013 like the one to advise elderly people to stay at home before declaring a general lockdown \u2013 were partly ethical. They couldn\u2019t have been anything else. If the scientists had all the answers, we wouldn\u2019t be where we are.</p> <p>\u2022 Laura Spinney is a science journalist, novelist and author.

One third of Stockholm\u2019s nursing homes are affected.</p> \n<p>Although Sweden has closed senior high schools and banned gatherings of more than 50 people, the prime minister, Stefan L\u00f6fven, has preferred to rely on Swedes\u2019 sense of civic responsibility, asking rather than ordering them to avoid non-essential travel, to work from home and to stay indoors if they are over 70 or are feeling ill.</p> \n<p>\u201cEveryone is responsible for their own wellbeing, for their neighbours\u2019 and for their own local community,\u201d the foreign minister, Ann Linde, said last week. \u201cThis applies in a normal situation and it applies in a crisis situation.\u201d</p> \n<p>The approach has so far proved popular among voters, with 44% of respondents in a survey published last week saying they trusted L\u00f6fven, compared with 26% in February. But while Stockholm is estimated to be 70% less busy than usual, an analysis of smartphone location data showed that while visits to public places had fallen steeply in most European countries, Sweden was bucking the trend.</p> \n<p>The strategy has come under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/swedish-pm-warned-russian-roulette-covid-19-strategy-herd-immunity\">increasingly heavy fire</a> from some of the country\u2019s health experts. Stefan Hanson, a Swedish infectious diseases expert, said the situation was not lost in the whole country, with large parts of the south and north so far displaying low infections rates.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut in Stockholm it is fast becoming critical,\u201d Hanson said. \u201cThere is a real risk now that cases will rise so high that the hospitals cannot cope. Treatment choices are already having to be made by biological age.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said this was due to a \u201cvery confused and unclear policy, with no clear objectives beyond trying to protect the over-70s and imposing some rather mild physical distancing measures.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cecilia S\u00f6derberg-Naucl\u00e9r, a professor of microbial pathogenesis and one of about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-live-news-updates-us-trump-uk-lockdown-global-deaths-cases-covid19-latest-update?page=with:block-5e7a441a8f081e5eda235f16#block-5e7a441a8f081e5eda235f16\">2,300 academics to sign an open letter to the government</a> at the end of last month calling for tougher measures to protect the healthcare system, said the government had \u201cno choice\u201d and should now lock down Stockholm.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe must establish control over the situation; we cannot head into a situation where we get complete chaos,\u201d S\u00f6derberg-Naucl\u00e9r said. \u201cNo one has tried this route, so why should we test it first in Sweden, without informed consent?\u201d</p> \n<p>Sten Linnarsson, a professor at Sweden\u2019s Karolinska Institute, said the concern was that \u201cthere is really a lack of scientific evidence being put forward for these policies\u201d. He compared the approach to letting a kitchen fire burn but intending to put it out later: \u201cThe danger, of course, is that it burns the whole house down.\u201d</p> \n<p>A letter to the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter from 14 scientists last week asked why Sweden had stuck with its policy when others, such as the UK, had followed the rest of Europe with tough measures. \u201cDifferent countries have different conditions but we struggle to see why the Swedish context is so different from the British,\u201d they wrote.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>In an interview published <a href=\"https://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/stefan-lofven-tusentals-kommer-att-do/\">by Dagens Nyheter on Saturday</a>, L\u00f6fven said the country could be facing thousands of coronavirus deaths and the crisis was likely to drag on for months rather than weeks.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have chosen a strategy of trying to flatten the curve and not get too dramatic a process, because then the healthcare system probably will not cope,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it also means that we will have more seriously ill people who need intensive care, we will have significantly more deaths.

  "<p>Robert Armstrong, Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, who has died aged 93, was the supreme Whitehall mandarin \u2013 discreet, a staunch defender of official secrecy, a loyal servant of his political masters. He held all the key posts as he passed through the Whitehall corridors of power.</p> <p>He was private secretary first to the liberal, reforming Labour home secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jan/06/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Roy Jenkins</a>, and subsequently, between 1970 and 1975, to a Conservative prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jul/18/guardianobituaries.conservatives\" title=\"\">Edward Heath</a>, and a Labour one, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1995/may/25/obituaries\" title=\"\">Harold Wilson</a>. He was appointed permanent secretary at the Home Office between 1977 and 1979, before reaching Whitehall\u2019s summit, the post of cabinet secretary, a position he occupied between 1979 and 1987, most of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\" title=\"\">Margaret Thatcher</a>\u2019s premiership.</p> <p>It was during the Thatcher period that Armstrong\u2019s name became known around the world when, in 1986, he appeared as a key witness in the so-called Spycatcher trial, as the British government attempted to prevent publication in Australia of the memoirs of Peter Wright, a former MI5 officer.</p> <p>In the witness box in the Sydney court, Armstrong came out with a phrase that captured headlines around the world. The phrase was \u201ceconomical with the truth\u201d.</p> <p>He had been asked by Malcolm Turnbull, Wright\u2019s lawyer, why he had written to the publishers Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, saying Thatcher wanted a copy of a book on MI5 by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/06/chapman-pincher\" title=\"\">Chapman Pincher</a>, when he was already in possession of the manuscript. The letter, Turnbull suggested, \u201ccontains a lie\u201d. Armstrong replied: \u201cIt was a misleading impression, it does not contain a lie. I don\u2019t think.\u201d</p> <p>Turnbull: \u201cWhat is the difference between a misleading impression and a lie?\u201d</p> <p>Armstrong: \u201cA lie is a straight untruth.\u201d</p> <p>Turnbull: \u201cWhat\u2019s a misleading impression, a kind of bent untruth?\u201d</p> <p>Armstrong: \u201cAs one person said, it is perhaps being economical with the truth.\u201d He pointed out that the phrase was not his own \u2013 it was first used by the philosopher Edmund Burke, he told the court. But it was too late.</p> <p>Armstrong\u2019s response in the Sydney courtroom betrayed a lack of understanding, or at least experience, of the outside world. Comments that may well have earned plaudits in Pall Mall clubs might not necessarily be appreciated on the street.</p> <p>Armstrong strongly believed that civil servants should remain silent to the grave. A duty of lifelong confidentiality was even more necessary, he believed, when it came to members of the security and intelligence agencies. In his affidavit to the Sydney court, he insisted that the publication of Spycatcher was likely to cause \u201cunquantifiable damage\u201d. But the government lost its case.</p> <p>Of all his political masters, Armstrong developed a particularly close personal relationship with Heath. They shared a deep love and knowledge of music. Both were accomplished pianists. Armstrong was fond of recalling the evening of 28 October 1971, when Heath secured a healthy Commons majority of 356 to 244 votes in favour of entry into the European Community, or the Common Market as it was more widely called, a success Heath regarded as his greatest political achievement.</p> <p>Returning to No 10 Heath walked past his staff, briefly acknowledging them but without saying a word went upstairs to his clavichord to play the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8rwMklcGvk\" title=\"\">First Prelude from Book 1 of Bach\u2019s Well Tempered Clavier</a>.</p> <p>After Heath died, in 2005, Armstrong became the first chair of the Sir Edward Heath Charitable Foundation, a post he retained until 2013. He strongly defended Heath when, more than a decade after his death, the former prime minister was accused of sexually abusing children. Armstrong described the decision by the Wiltshire police to discuss their investigations at a press conference as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. He added: \u201cYou usually detect some sexuality. I never heard a whiff of sexuality about Heath, whether women or children. He was completely asexual. He had a girlfriend, a copy of his girlfriend\u2019s photo by his bedside. She went off with someone else.\u201d</p> <p>Born in Headington, Oxford, Robert was the son of the organist and eventual principal of the Royal Academy of Music <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-sir-thomas-armstrong-1411509.html\" title=\"\">Thomas Armstrong</a>, and his wife, Hester (nee Draper). He was educated at the Dragon school, Oxford, at Eton, where he was a King\u2019s scholar, and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he studied classics and philosophy. It was an elitist, privileged education.</p> <p>It was also then a traditional route to the foothills of Whitehall\u2019s corridors of power via the Treasury \u2013 the fact that he had studied classics, rather than economics, was no obstacle to a career there. Far from it, and it was at the Treasury, the most influential of government departments, where Armstrong first made his mark, starting as an assistant principal in 1950.</p> <p>Yet Armstrong will always be identified most with the Thatcher years, as an eminence grise who was happiest remaining in the shadows, advising the prime minister on the need for secrecy and urging his fellow Whitehall mandarins to take a tough line against leaks.</p> <p>However, he was thrust into the limelight as he was caught up in a series of spectacular Whitehall crises. Asked to conduct an inquiry into the 1986 Westland helicopter affair, he concluded that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/22/lord-brittan-of-spennithorne\" title=\"\">Leon Brittan</a>, the trade and industry secretary, had leaked a letter damaging to the defence secretary, Michael Heseltine, without saying that Thatcher knew about the stratagem all along.</p> <p>He was subsequently asked by a member of the Commons defence committee whether Thatcher\u2019s remark to MPs that she had given her consent to get \u201caccurate information to the public domain\u201d, as she put it, conflicted with the official version of events. Armstrong admitted her remark \u201cdid not coincide\u201d with an earlier statement in which she said that her agreement was \u201cneither sought nor given\u201d. He explained: \u201cMy understanding is it would be a slip of the tongue.\u201d</p> <p>Armstrong\u2019s defence of official secrecy led him to assert an absolute constitutional doctrine to prevent government officials from whistleblowing, or in any way publicly questioning government policy. Stung by the acquittal of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/may/04/official-secrets-act-gavin-williamson-prosecution\" title=\"\">Clive Ponting</a>, charged with breaking the Official Secrets Act for sending details of the movements of the Belgrano, the Argentinian cruiser torpedoed by a British submarine during the Falklands war, he rejected the argument by defence lawyers that civil servants could appeal above the heads of ministers to the \u201cpublic interest\u201d.</p> <p>He issued new guidelines on the duties and responsibilities of government officials. Civil servants may be \u201cservants of the Crown\u201d, he said, but added: \u201cFor all practical purposes the Crown in this context means, and is represented by, the government of the day.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe civil service as such has no constitutional personality or responsibility separate from the duly elected government of the day.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, civil servants had no direct constitutional links with parliament and could never appeal to an overriding \u201cpublic interest\u201d.</p> <p>Thatcher did not always accept his advice. He told her that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/18/jimmy-savile-abused-1000-victims-bbc\" title=\"\">Jimmy Savile</a> should not be given a knight- hood on the grounds, he felt, that \u201cthings were not quite what they should be\u201d. He noted that Savile had made no attempt to deny the accounts in the press about his private life. Armstrong\u2019s instincts turned out to be correct.</p> <p>He was a warmer, more sensitive man than he allowed the public \u2013 or many of his professional colleagues \u2013 to appreciate. He also possessed a dry humour. One encyclical he sent to senior Whitehall officials deploring leaks was itself leaked. When the journalist, now film-maker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/paulgreengrass\" title=\"\">Paul Greengrass</a>, raised this during a Granada TV World in Action interview, Armstrong replied: \u201cI was very sad that it took so long as six weeks to leak. I hoped it would leak much sooner than that.\u201d</p> <p>He was knighted in 1978 and made a life peer 10 years later, after he retired, sitting in the Lords as a crossbencher. Also in 1988, he was appointed chair of the Victoria and Albert Museum trustees, where the deputy was his Oxford contemporary Sir Michael Butler, former ambassador to the European Community. He was appointed non-executive director to many companies, including BAT Industries, the bankers NM Rothschild and Sons, Rio Tinto, Shell, Lucas Industries, Carlton Television and the Bank of Ireland.</p> <p>But it was music that mattered most to him outside Whitehall. He was secretary and then a board member of the Royal Opera House from 1968 to 1993. He once said he tried to write his cabinet minutes in sonata form, with an exposition, development section, recapitulation and coda. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009mfx7\" title=\"\">As a guest on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Desert Island Discs</a>, he chose as a luxury some music manuscript paper, a pencil and paper.</p> <p>In 1985 he married Patricia Carlow, and she survives him along with his two daughters, Jane and Teresa, from his first marriage, to Serena (nee Chance), which ended in divorce.</p> <p>\u2022 Robert Temple Armstrong, Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, civil servant, born 30 March 1927; died 3 April 2020</p>",
  "<p>The lights shone more brightly than anything I\u2019d ever seen. One million blinding watts strafed across the leaves of countless cannabis plants that peeled off in neat rows in every direction. The warehouse was as pristine as a pharmaceutical facility, and as we strode around in crisp white nylon overalls and box-fresh wellies, the atmosphere was surreal \u2013 interstellar, almost: \u2013 it felt as if we were on a mission to Mars. It was definitely a glimpse of the future.</p> <p>It was 2017 and I had been invited to visit this legal medical cannabis \u201cgrow\u201d in the town of Gatineau, near Ottawa. I was in Canada after writing a paper for the drug-law reform thinktank <a href=\"https://volteface.me/\" title=\"\">Volteface</a>, proposing an online-only, legal cannabis market in the UK as a way to break the logjam between the UK\u2019s two million cannabis smokers and those who fear legalisation. I was meeting with Canadian police and politicians to hear more about that country\u2019s plans to completely legalise cannabis the following year.</p> <p>Back in the UK, a million-watt grow like Gatineau\u2019s would put you in jail for a decade. Here, it was likely to make its owners a very cool, very legal few million in mere months. Added to that, the state would benefit, too, as taxes from sales of the crop would be collected for the common good rather than enriching criminals. It felt utopian.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Were cannabis activists\u2019 hopes of a regulated cannabis market just a pipe dream?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For the three decades I have campaigned to reform drug laws, I never expected to see change happen so quickly, or at such scale, as it did in Canada. But, two years on, the Canadian experiment hasn\u2019t quite turned out as we reformers had hoped.</p> <p>The Gatineau greenhouse through which I strode on that day in 2017 was owned by a firm called <a href=\"https://www.thehydropothecary.com/\" title=\"\">the Hydropothecary</a>. Now named Hexo, in October 2019 it shed 200 of its 800 staff. On 4 March one of Canada\u2019s biggest growers, Canopy Growth, announced the <a href=\"https://mjbizdaily.com/cannabis-greenhouse-retreat-continues-with-canopy-closing-two-facilities/\" title=\"\">closure</a> of two mega-greenhouses in the towns of Delta and Aldegrove \u2013 with 500 job losses. The firm also cancelled the opening of a new site in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the black market is still vibrant while cannabis stocks have crashed, medical patients say they can\u2019t get hold of essential medicines, and thousands of jobs have been lost. So what went wrong \u2013 and what went right? Were cannabis activists\u2019 hopes of a regulated cannabis market just a pipe dream?</p> <p>Canada had permitted cannabis for medical use since 2001. Medical patients were allowed to grow four plants, and licensed producers cultivated larger crops for sale online to those with valid prescriptions. But most Canadian cities had illegal \u2013 but tolerated \u2013 dispensaries where the drug was sold completely indiscriminately. These stores made Amsterdam\u2019s coffee shops look as prim as a WI cake stand. The quality and variety of cannabis on sale at these illegal outlets was outstanding, bewildering. Business was not just booming, but blazing.And it was all completely illegal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd209487d720b7d62775e673c0d05952afecd06c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd209487d720b7d62775e673c0d05952afecd06c/0_361_4572_2742/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Canada made cannabis boring\u2019: plants being tended at Aurora.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Canada made cannabis boring\u2019: plants being tended at Aurora.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Canada\u2019s Cannabis Act of 2018 was a bold attempt to impose some order on this anarchic retail scene. It legalised the sale to adults of 30g of cannabis in austere packaging from government-licensed shops. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau said: \u201cThe old approach to cannabis didn\u2019t work. It was too easy for our kids to get it and gangs and drug dealers were reaping the profits. That changes from now on.\u201d</p> <p>Bill Blair, a former Toronto police chief, became an unlikely cheerleader for legalisation, arguing that to do so would \u201ckeep cannabis out of the hands of youth, and profits out of the hands of criminals\u201d. Two other key goals of regulation were the protection of public health and the reduction in criminality associated with the illegal market. After 50 years of the unending, senseless drug war, peace had broken out.</p> <p>Or so it seemed. Because while Canada may have lit the fuse on an ambitious experiment, every high has a low. Within a year the industry was experiencing mass layoffs, multi-billion-dollar stock-market losses, executive firings and corporate scandals as the overhyped new sector experienced a dramatic and humbling public correction.</p> <p><em><strong>What went wrong? </strong></em>Alastair Moore, co-founder of Hanway Associates, a London-based cannabis consultancy, says the Canadian industry has been driven by vulture capitalism and wishful thinking. \u201cA mix of greed and naivety led this industry to great heights \u2013 and has left it on its knees. While some made lots of money, others lost their investments and now many others have lost their jobs.\u201d</p> <p>According to Moore\u2019s fellow founder, George McBride: \u201cThe key thing is that Canada did actually get the reforms through. In and of itself, that is a huge feat. It\u2019s the first time any major developed country has done so. And so, kudos. However, getting it through has involved a lot of politicians who didn\u2019t understand what they\u2019re talking about designing a really complicated system.\u201d</p> <p>So just how does a state create and regulate an entirely new business of intoxication that has always existed, essentially, in a countercultural, outlaw space? Canada, it turns out, did so cautiously, with every decision deliberated over by a centralised government <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-medication/cannabis/laws-regulations/task-force-cannabis-legalization-regulation.html\" title=\"\">Task Force</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e422947c68368c78d7f47c098eb9ec75107cdfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e422947c68368c78d7f47c098eb9ec75107cdfd/0_158_4775_2866/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Green green grass of home: plants at Strathroy, Ontario, Canada.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green green grass of home: plants at Strathroy, Ontario, Canada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Added to the complexity of the policy and its implementation, the needle of international capital\u2019s wonky moral compass swung straight at these lucrative new markets. Hundreds of millions of dollars were raised on global capital markets and the Canadian landscape was quickly dotted with massive new grow sites.</p> <p>The so-called \u201cgreen rush\u201d had started and production went into overdrive. Stock prices soared and fortunes were staked, made, doubled and tripled in an atmosphere reminiscent of the 90s dotcom boom, or the Yukon gold rush of the 19th century, when 100,000 prospectors headed into the Canadian hinterlands in search of riches. Many firms hoped to corner the Canadian market by throwing millions of dollars of shareholders\u2019 money into massive grow sites. This time, the gold was green. But soon, things started to fall apart.</p> <p>The main problem Canada\u2019s smokers and growers faced was access: too few retail shops were able to open to serve the eager new market. Canada is a country of 38 million people, divided into 10 provinces that are similar to US states, with provincial governments producing a patchwork of varying regulations. Over a third \u2013 13.5 million \u2013 of all Canadians live in the state of Ontario. But as of 2 March this year, Ontario had just 41 retail cannabis stores. The province of Alberta, home to 4.4 million, has 423 stores.</p> <p>And where there was product available, the price was almost double that of the illegal market. C$5.59 to C$10.23 per gram (or over \u00a340 a quarter ounce). That was caused by tax burdens and overheads: the legal market has to comply with regulations on fungicide and pesticide residue levels, and draconian security requirements for grow sites, such as huge vaults in which to store the cannabis and record-keeping for every person who enters these vaults.</p> <p>The illegal market, meanwhile, is completely unregulated \u2013 and thriving because of this. <a href=\"https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/start\" title=\"\">Statistics Canada</a>, a state agency, reports that just 29% of cannabis users buy all of their product from a legal source. Four in 10 Canadians told the organisation that they bought at least some cannabis from illegal sources in 2019.</p> <p>The next problem was that many stores sold poor-quality grass, with smokers complaining that it had been poorly dried and cured, and tasted bad. Modern cannabis users are accustomed to a range of flavours, from lemon to mango, pineapple, strawberry and pine. These flavours are derived from the plant\u2019s natural aroma profile, which skilled growers preserve by careful breeding, correct harvesting and slow, cautious curing of the fragrant flowers.</p> <p>Many players in the new mass market often skipped these steps in the pursuit of profit, says David Brown, a British Columbia-based cannabis industry analyst. \u201cMany consumers have had complaints about high prices and what is perceived as lower quality, especially the tendency of many of the legal dried flower products to be overly dried, often from a rushed or improper curing and drying process.\u201d</p> <p>Why would anyone drive a few miles up the road to score bad weed from many of the government shops when your regular black-market dealer lives nearby, has better product and brings it to your door for half the price?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d421768027b42e683280b719964ab3f625de4ede\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d421768027b42e683280b719964ab3f625de4ede/0_338_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The nose knows: a customer sniffs display samples at Evergreen Cannabis in Vancouver.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The nose knows: a customer sniffs display samples at Evergreen Cannabis in Vancouver.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elaine Thompson/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s worth reflecting, also, on the psychology of some of these users. \u201cFor a long time, cannabis has been the mark of the rebel, the outsider, the outlaw,\u201d says Brown. \u201cA lot of the people who complain about \u2018bad weed\u2019 and so-called \u2018fake legalisation\u2019 are doing so because parts of their countercultural identity have been altered forever by this law change. Canada has made cannabis boring \u2013 and that was kind of the point.\u201d</p> <p>With few shops to sell to and customers clinging to their traditional dealers, the new cannabis corporations found themselves holding a glut of product. There is a stockpile of grass weighing in at 400 tonnes, at last count, according to official government inventory figures.</p> <p>The rollout of retail shops was left, in many cases, to inexperienced officials in provincial government departments, says McBride. \u201cOntario authorities said, \u2018We don\u2019t trust private organisations to run cannabis shops. We\u2019re going to do it all ourselves.\u2019 Then they tried to do it, but they squandered about $80 million trying to figure out how to do it, and got absolutely nowhere. They had to cancel it and invite private tenders. All these big, shiny grow facilities that cost C$10m, C$20m or C$30m to build, and which all grew loads of cannabis \u2013 there was nowhere to sell it, because there weren\u2019t any shops,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In a stinging irony, medical patients \u2013 the very people whose decades of activism had driven the wider reforms, faced cannabis shortages and a steep increase in price after legalisation as suppliers diverted their medical product in bulk to the new recreational market rather than in hundreds of smaller deals to medical patients.</p> <p><em><strong>Dan Sutton of</strong></em> Tantalus Labs, a British Columbia-based grower that uses natural sunlight and greenhouses, says legalisation has been \u201clargely negative\u201d for medical cannabis users because of this new sales dynamic: \u201cPhysicians have been telling medical users they should buy from the recreational marketplace, which is completely inappropriate \u2013 and it loads them up with extra taxes and tariffs.\u201d </p> <p>Sutton originally built his low-impact, sunlit grow to service medical users, and still focuses on this original customer base \u2013 though they make up just 10% of his sales. \u201cMany licensed producers now don\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cSome have just pulled their financial resources on their medical platforms. If a medical user can\u2019t get their medicine \u2013 for people, with, say, multiple sclerosis \u2013 that can lead to severe impairment, traffic accidents and potentially death. That blood is on those licensed producers\u2019 hands that stopped serving those users\u2019 needs,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Paul North, director of communications at Volteface, which commissioned me to write the paper, says Canadian customers\u2019 response to the malfunctioning new markets is understandable: \u201cYou have to provide a superior experience to the illicit market. When it comes to cannabis, this is not easy. Dealers have no marketing restrictions, and can offer a sweet deal and deliver a product to your door. For most people, cannabis use is a relaxing, problem-free and enjoyable experience. Buying the drug needs to match that experience, and; until it does, the illicit market will continue.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42bd231f5ec36a40c9b77633f7f63323ae42b06e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42bd231f5ec36a40c9b77633f7f63323ae42b06e/15_47_4090_2453/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Product placement: cannabis pills ready for sale in Quebec.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Product placement: cannabis pills ready for sale in Quebec.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hype talks, but money walks. The early euphoria in the cannabis stock market has been replaced by a major dose of paranoia. All cannabis stocks have tanked, with an average 50% wipeout in value right across Canada and the US in the last year. Major players such as <a href=\"https://www.auroramj.com/\" title=\"\">Aurora Cannabis</a> took the biggest hit, with its shares falling from US$12.83 in March 2019 to US$2 today. Another bud behemoth, <a href=\"https://www.tilray.com/\" title=\"\">Tilray</a>, has also had its share price slashed by 80%, from over US$81 to US$16 within a year. Other cannabis giants including <a href=\"https://aphria.ca/\" title=\"\">Aphria</a> lost 60% of their paper value in 2019, while <a href=\"https://www.canopygrowth.com/\" title=\"\">Canopy Growth</a> sank by 54%. Financing has dried up for the new industry, and small-scale retail investors \u2013 often young professionals investing via smartphone apps \u2013 have lost large sums of money. None of this is to assert that Canada\u2019s policy has been a failure. If we compare it to the UK cannabis industry, where illegally trafficked children have been found enslaved in abandoned buildings growing cannabis for gangsters, it is better by several orders of magnitude.</p> <p>Steve Rolles of UK-based drug law reform group <a href=\"https://transformdrugs.org/about-us/\" title=\"\">Transform</a> agrees that it is harsh to judge the project\u2019s success so soon. \u201cWe are still in the rollout phase. They are still in a transition from an illegal economy to a legally regulated one. It will take some time for new market equilibrium to be established, and for new social norms to emerge, and for teething problems to be addressed.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Big, shiny grow facilities cost C$20m or C$30m to build and grew loads of cannabis \u2013 but there was nowhere to sell it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>How best to create a legal cannabis industry is a question with a particular urgency in the UK today as we build a market for medicinal use \u2013 albeit agonisingly slowly. I strongly believe that cannabis will be legalised for adult use in the UK within five years. And it all goes back to that Gatineau greenhouse I visited in 2017.</p> <p>On that trip, I was accompanied by two Tory party insiders, Blair Gibbs, ex-adviser on police matters to Boris Johnson when he was mayor, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/danny-kruger\" title=\"\">Danny Kruger</a>, son of TV chef Prue Leith, who wrote the \u201chug a hoodie\u201d speech for David Cameron. Both men experienced something of a Damascene conversion in their views on cannabis law during that trip. Days after his return, Kruger wrote in the <em>Spectator</em>: \u201cWe do not need to ban everything bad. After all, the Victorians never prohibited alcohol. They regulated it, taxed it and hedged it about with a culture of disapproval. Instead of the prohibition of cannabis we need an old Victorian virtue: temperance.\u201d</p> <p>Blair Gibbs moved to Canada in 2017 to work as a cannabis consultant, but in August 2019 he took a job in the PM\u2019s office. Both men are now at the very heart of the British government: in 2019 Kruger was parachuted into the safe Tory seat of Devizes to stand as MP in the last election and is also an adviser to Johnson.</p> <p>Whether their weed-friendly outlook survives the cold glare of Whitehall orthodoxy remains to be seen. But it is undeniable that the economic libertarians of the Tory party in 2020 are much more pro-cannabis than their newly nationalising Labour party counterparts. There are, after all, many billions of pounds to be made by the kind of people who fund the Tories: land and property owners and the banks that will finance the new industry.</p> <p><em><strong>What happens if</strong></em> you just legalise this drug? It\u2019s a question no one other than Canada has ever really asked. My view is that we have long known that all drug laws are unworkable, illogical, unjustifiable, unscientific, counterproductive and generate countless unintended consequences \u2013 in fact, drugs laws often create the exact opposite outcomes to those desired. But ironically, and with a beautifully stoned logic, it turns out that legalising cannabis in Canada has generated just as many challenges as it solved.</p> <p>What Canada\u2019s experience demonstrates is that cannabis legalisation does not instantly deliver some great social panacea. There is no promised land. But we should never lose sight of this essential truth: Canadians can no longer be jailed for growing and eating and smoking certain flowers. That is a huge, fundamental step forward, no matter what the stock market indices say.</p> <p>Notwithstanding the market vagaries and the slow shrinking of the illegal market, analyst Andrew Brown is still proud of his country\u2019s bold step into the unknown. \u201cLegalisation in Canada is hardly perfect. After all, we\u2019re less than two years into legalising a product that has been illegal for nearly a century,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a process, not a destination, and the slow, deliberate approach to a well-regulated industry is allowing Canada to set a responsible path forward that other countries can feel safe in following, even refining and improving upon.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Spain records smallest percentage rise in infections since start of crisis</h2> <p>Spain\u2019s death toll has risen by 674 to 12,418 in the past 24 hours, according to figures that recorded the lowest number of victims in nine days. It is also the first time since 28 March that daily deaths have dropped below 800. The number of registered cases rose to 130,759 from 124,736, Spain\u2019s ministry said. The 5% rise in infections was the smallest increase since the start of the health crisis. Germany\u2019s confirmed coronavirus infections meanwhile rose by 5,936 in the past 24 hours to 91,714 on Sunday, the third straight drop in the daily rate of new cases.</p> <h2>Global cases pass 1.2 million</h2> <p>The number of confirmed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/coronavirus-global-cases-pass-12m-as-trump-warns-us-of-worse-to-come\">cases globally has passed 1.2m</a>, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. Just over one in four of these are in the US, which has<strong> </strong>311,544 cases. There have been 64,753 coronavirus-related deaths worldwide. The five countries with the highest numbers of confirmed cases were the US, Spain, Italy, Germany and France. China, which is now at number six, reported 30 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, up from 19 a day earlier as the number of cases involving travellers from abroad as well as local transmissions increased.</p> <h2>Trump talks up unproven malaria drug</h2> <p>Donald Trump has directly urged Americans worried about Covid-19 to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/coronavirus-us-ventilators-new-york-trump-touts-unproven-cure-malaria-drug\">take a little-studied anti-malaria drug for the disease</a>, despite potentially serious side effects and a lack of data on safety and efficacy in treatment of the pandemic virus. The president also warned the US that the worst was yet to come, and that Americans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/05/there-will-be-a-lot-of-death-trump-warning-as-covid-19-cases-in-us-pass-300000-video\">would see \u201ca lot of death\u201d</a>. At a lengthy, rambling and combative briefing on Saturday afternoon, the president sought to discredit media reports of his administration\u2019s failures and called some outlets in the White House press corps \u201cfake news\u201d. Scientists around the world are looking for potential treatments but so far have not found a success.</p> <h2>Lombardy enacts law obliging citizens to wear face masks</h2> <p>Authorities in Lombardy, the Italian region worst-affected by coronavirus, have enacted a law obliging citizens to wear face masks when they go outside. In the absence of a mask, people should \u201ccover their mouths and noses with a simple foulard or scarf\u201d, said Attilio Fontana, the president of Lombardy. <br>The law came as <a href=\"https://video.corriere.it/cronaca/coronavirus-napoli-tanta-gente-strada-la-spesa-ma-questa-quarantena/733d255c-7599-11ea-856e-f9aa62c97d7a\">images from major cities </a>including Rome, Naples, Milan and Turin showed an increase in the number of people venturing out in recent days amid good weather.</p> <h2>Pandemic threatens survival of European Union, Spanish PM warns</h2> <p>The European Union\u2019s very survival is at stake and a new \u201cMarshall plan for Europe is needed\u201d to rebuild the continent\u2019s economies, Spain\u2019s prime minister has warned in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/europes-future-is-at-stake-in-this-war-against-coronavirus\">article published by the Guardian</a>. Europe must build a wartime economy and promote European resistance, reconstruction and recovery, Pedro S\u00e1nchez said. A critical juncture had been reached at which even the most fervently pro-European countries and governments, as is Spain\u2019s case, needed real proof of commitment in the form of \u201cunwavering solidarity\u201d.</p> <h2>African economics face \u201ccomplete collapse\u201d if virus not controlled</h2> <p>Economies in some parts of Africa face a \u201ccomplete collapse\u201d unless the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic is controlled, a senior UN official with responsibility for operations on the continent has said. Up to 50% of all projected job growth in Africa will be lost as aviation, services, exports, mining, agriculture and the informal sector all take a hit, according to Ahunna Eziakonwa, the United Nations Development Program regional director for Africa. She told Associated Press: \u201cWe will see a complete collapse of economies and livelihoods. Livelihoods will be wiped out in a way we have never seen before.\u201d</p> <h2>First case recorded in South Sudan as Iran puts death toll at 3,603</h2> <p>South Sudan, one of the world\u2019s poorest states where decades of war and hunger have already devastated infrastructure, has become one of the latest states to record a confirmed case of Covid-19. The case was a 29-year-old woman who arrived in February from the Netherlands, via Ethiopia. Elsewhere, Iran said Covid-19 infections stood at 58,226 while the death toll from the outbreak was 3,603.</p> <h2>Outdoor exercise could be banned if rules flouted, Britons warned</h2> <p>Outdoor exercise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/matt-hancock-warns-tougher-uk-lockdown-too-many-break-rules\">could be banned in Britain</a> if people flout the social distancing rules, the UK\u2019s health minister has warned. Matt Hancock said sunbathing in public spaces was against the government guidance, and told those who dared to disobey that they were putting their own and others\u2019 lives at risk. His warning came ahead of a televised address <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/queen-to-make-personal-tv-address-to-the-nation-on-sunday\">by the Queen</a>, who was expected to praise Britain for its \u201cself-discipline\u201d and \u201cresolve\u201d during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <h2>Australian authorities cautiously optimistic</h2> <p>Health authorities in Australia have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/health-officials-hopeful-australia-is-flattening-coronavirus-curve-but-warn-against-complacency\">expressed cautious optimism</a> that the country may be able to limit its domestic outbreak, as the nation\u2019s death toll reached 34. However, senior officials have warned against complacency or relaxing social distancing rules too early, saying that could lead to a resurgence in cases. The government has also warned its citizens that imported \u201chome\u201d Covid-19 test kits pose a serious risk to public health. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said the kits were not reliable and could lead to people failing to isolate themselves or seek the medical help they need.</p> <h2>Criminal investigation launched into handling of cruise ship</h2> <p>A criminal investigation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/criminal-investigation-launched-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-disaster\">is to be launched</a> into the disastrous handling of the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which has become the single largest source of Covid-19 cases in Australia, the NSW police commissioner said on Sunday. Mike Fuller announced the move as it was revealed four more passengers from the ill-fated ship have died \u2013 bringing the total to 11, and accounting for more than 30% of all Australian Covid-19 deaths. The Ruby Princess has been the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/04/nsw-health-minister-defends-experts-who-handled-ruby-princess-coronavirus-outbreak\">focus of intense criticism</a> since its 2,700 passengers were allowed to freely disembark in Sydney on 19 March, despite passengers onboard showing signs of respiratory illnesses.</p>",

Trump and DeSantis spoke again by phone later on Wednesday morning, and by mid-afternoon, with the state\u2019s coronavirus death toll ticking above 100 for the first time, <a href=\"https://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/orders/2020/EO_20-91.pdf\">Florida executive order 20-91</a> was published.

He has put us in a dangerous situation. Numerous people will die because our governor hesitated,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The question now is what consequence the order will have, and whether it has come too late to significantly alter experts\u2019 predictions of a spike in deaths in Florida. On Thursday the University of Washington\u2019s institute for health was still predicting cases in the state would <a href=\"https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections\">crest in early May</a>, but increased its projected peak daily death toll from 136 to 175, a rate that would lead to about 7,000 deaths by mid-June.</p> <p>\u201cWe are trying to plan for a tsunami on the horizon that everybody is hoping is going to miss our island but is bearing straight down on us,\u201d said Dr Kayser Enneking, professor of anesthesiology at the University of Florida\u2019s department of medicine.</p> <p>\u201cThe response we\u2019ve seen from the state and federal governments has been based not on science but the gut of our leaders. The number of cases in Florida is on the exponential rise, but the lack of testing has impacted our ability to predict where we are in this crisis.\u201d</p> <h2>State was \u2018woefully underprepared\u2019</h2> <p>The picture is also muddled over the medical supplies and equipment Florida says it will need. Last Sunday, Trump insisted that the state\u2019s wishlist, including 5,000 ventilators, half a million each of gloves and gowns, and 2m N95 face masks, had been met from federal supplies. \u201cFlorida has been taken care of,\u201d the president promised. \u201cI looked, they\u2019re very aggressive in trying to get things done and they\u2019re doing a very good job.\u201d</p> <p>But by the following afternoon Jared Moskowitz, appointed by DeSantis as Florida\u2019s director of emergency management last year, had resorted to Twitter, frustrated by failed efforts to bring more masks to the state and lamenting a lack of a federal allocation system.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like a Ponzi scheme,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JaredEMoskowitz/status/1244808519465029632\">he wrote</a>, referring to the third-party distribution scheme for equipment <a href=\"https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/all-3m-products/~/All-3M-Products/Consumer/Personal-Safety/Masks-Respirators/?N=5002385+8709316+8710670+8710839+8711017+8735361+3294857497&amp;rt=r3\">manufactured by 3M</a>. \u201cDifferent distributors represented by brokers selling the same lot of masks bidding against each other.

We went through those in two days. We just received another thousand, and we\u2019ll get through those in two days as well,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She was, however, reluctant to place the blame solely on DeSantis: \u201cIt\u2019s the first time this governor\u2019s been through it. What a hell of a test this is.\u201d</p> <p>George Moraitis, chair of Broward county\u2019s Republican party, was even more generous. \u201cGovernor DeSantis is under the microscope but he\u2019s excelling,\u201d he wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/commentary/fl-op-com-moraitis-desantis-leadership-coronavirus-20200331-sohazgf4zzcljcknwnfyll27qe-story.html\">Sun-Sentinel op-ed</a>. \u201cHe is leading Florida through the Covid-19 outbreak with measured, informed and effective actions to protect both the health and the fundamental rights of all Floridians.\u201d</p> <p>Evan Jenne, co-leader elect of Florida\u2019s House Democrats, told the Guardian<em> </em>that further down the line he would call for a legislative select committee to evaluate the actions of DeSantis and his administration throughout the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to know what went right and what went wrong. I have a feeling that both of those will be long lists,\u201d he said. DeSantis\u2019s decree, however, will appear firmly in the second category, in Jenne\u2019s view, not least because it exempts churches and places of worship.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an executive order with holes big enough you could drive an 18-wheeler through it. Mass meetings of worshipping folks are perfectly fine, and that\u2019s not going to help,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAt no point in our nation\u2019s history has human sacrifice ever been an acceptable form of worship and you\u2019re potentially going to kill someone, if not put them through respiratory hell. It\u2019s not strict enough in any way, shape or form.\u201d</p>",

A representative post in one channel made in recent days read, \u201cI have said it before and I will say it again, America is Dead.\u201d</p> <p>Such posturing \u2013 which often combines nihilism, exhortations to violence and conspiracy-addled racism \u2013 is shared by groups like the <a href=\"https://www.counterextremism.com/blog/atomwaffen-division-claims-have-disbanded\">ostensibly</a><a href=\"https://www.counterextremism.com/blog/atomwaffen-division-claims-have-disbanded\"> disbanded</a> Atomwaffen Division, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/revealed-the-true-identity-of-the-leader-of-americas-neo-nazi-terror-group\">The Base</a> and Fueuerkrieg Division.</p> <p>This subculture, whose members openly advocate terrorism, has been subject to multiple arrests and prosecutions in recent months, on charges ranging from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/04/fbi-colorado-synagogue-bomb-plot\">synagogue vandalism</a> to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2020/01/18/the-base-white-supremacist-arrests/\">conspiracy to murder</a>.</p> <p>An SPLC researcher, Cassie Miller, said these groups have always talked about ways that western democracies might be destabilized, but \u201cthis time the political opportunity has come to them. They haven\u2019t had to do anything to sow chaos at this point.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018see, this is what we told you. Modern society is unsustainable. It is eventually headed towards collapse\u2019,\u201d Miller added. \u201cAnd they think that they\u2019re going to be the revolutionary vanguard that is going to be in place to handle the situation when it eventually breaks down.\u201d</p> <p>Similar sentiments appear to have motivated a <a href=\"https://www.informant.news/p/heartland-terror\">Missouri man</a> who planned a car bomb attack on a hospital which was treating coronavirus patients.

  "<p>As her mom tells it, Sesame Street is Aubrey\u2019s first and only love. Her affection for the program\u2019s cast of puppets, for Elmo in particular, is so aggressive and pure that her parents have to restrict her access to it because she gets so wired after watching it she can\u2019t function for days.</p> <p>Aubrey, whose real name her parents asked be withheld to protect her privacy, is a 16-year-old student in Los Angeles. As a teenager living with autism, routine is the bedrock of her day. </p> <p>But in the days of a spiraling coronavirus crisis, predicting what comes next is all but impossible. \u201cThink about how we are with uncertainty and multiply it by a million. For her not knowing is almost unbearable,\u201d said her father, Pirouz Kavehpour.</p> <p>Today, with <a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/map-coronavirus-and-school-closures.html\">124,000 of the nation\u2019s schools</a> closed due to coronavirus, Kavehpour has joined the ranks of millions of parents turned into homeschool teachers overnight \u2013 no easy feat for any working parent, but especially challenging for parents whose children have disabilities.</p> <p>It remains unclear when schools across the country will reopen; California officials already indicated <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2020/04/01/newsom-california-school-year-closure-the-right-thing-to-do-1270260\">they won\u2019t restart</a> this academic year and a handful of other states have closed doors until fall. And as classrooms pivot to online learning, many of the services guaranteed to the nation\u2019s roughly 7 million children with disabilities have been effectively put on hold.</p> <p>Federal law promises to give students educational services that address individual needs. But it\u2019s unclear when children with disabilities will get the kind of face-to-face help they had been getting at school before.</p> <h2>Struggling for support</h2> <p>At school, a personal aid redirects Aubrey when she gets distracted and helps her manage emotions. A speech therapist works to improve her<strong> </strong>speech and draws her out of quiet isolation. An occupational therapist helps her<strong> </strong>keep her body calm so she doesn\u2019t regress to rocking back and forth.</p> <p>But in recent weeks, those tasks have fallen on Kavehpour, a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at UCLA.</p> <p>Aubrey\u2019s mother Faranak, who lives separately, has been quarantined at home after contracting coronavirus. She hasn\u2019t been able to help, or even see her daughter, except through video calls. Under quarantine, she\u2019s noticed Aubrey has seemed increasingly concerned about her mother\u2019s<strong> </strong>health.</p> <p>\u201cShe keeps saying, \u2018Mommy, go to doctor.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>As schools closed and officials turned out the schoolhouse lights, educators from New York to Washington were forced to overhaul education plans, with many leaning into technology such as Google Classroom to share assignments, or Zoom as a way to hold virtual office hours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94c2f5ecde9a00d19f1135bc88fcbf89ccaef9c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94c2f5ecde9a00d19f1135bc88fcbf89ccaef9c2/0_21_3500_2101/1000..jpg\" alt=\"As schools have closed, many have turned to online technology.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As schools have closed, many have turned to online technology.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Redmond/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those online classes may be broadly helpful for a traditional student, but Aubrey doesn\u2019t work well independently, and Kavehpour said it\u2019s become a herculean task to keep her on top of her homework \u2013 which, even under normal circumstances, might take a whole afternoon to coax her to do.</p> <p>Owing to mixed signals from the federal government on how to proceed, in addition to concerns over liability for not being able to provide mandatory services, many school districts struggle to provide the support students like Aubrey will need in the months to come. The extent to which children and students with disabilities receive help may, for the moment, rely on the creativity of school district officials, teachers and parents.</p> <p>As districts pivoted to online learning, education leaders turned to the US department of education, headed by the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, to know how to proceed on serving schools\u2019 most vulnerable students.</p> <p>That guidance was slow to arrive. And when it came, educators and advocates found the direction vague and contradictory.</p> <p>As late as 16 March, guidance issued by federal education officials indicated that school districts don\u2019t have to provide specialized services to students with disabilities if schools are closed for everyone \u2013 the idea being that all students are served equally if nobody is served at all.</p> <p>\u201cIf a school district closes its schools and does not provide any educational services to the general student population, then a school would not be required to provide services to students with disabilities during that same period of time,\u201d <a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/ocr-coronavirus-fact-sheet.pdf\">read a fact sheet</a> from the education department\u2019s office of civil rights.</p> <p>Special education advocates fired back, arguing that the directives contradicted the <a href=\"https://sites.ed.gov/idea/about-idea/\">Individuals with Disabilities Education Act</a> (Idea), which promises that students with disabilities will have access to free education tailored to their needs.</p> <p>\u201cIt is our view that this guidance was wrong,\u201d said Miriam Rollin, an attorney and director of the <a href=\"https://edrights.org/\">Education Civil Rights Alliance</a>. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in Idea that says you\u2019re absolved of responsibility for serving students with [disabilities] when schools close.\u201d</p> <p>Amid the backlash, the department shifted course, telling school districts they cannot keep schools closed to sidestep the mandate to serve all students.</p> <p>\u201cWe remind schools they should not opt to close or decline to provide distance instruction, at the expense of students, to address matters pertaining to services for students with disabilities,\u201d read <a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/frontpage/faq/rr/policyguidance/Supple%20Fact%20Sheet%203.21.20%20FINAL.pdf\">the newer fact sheet</a> issued on 21 March.</p> <p>The new guidance clarified schools\u2019 responsibilities, Rollin said, but the wait came with a cost. \u201cHad the department just released guidance to begin with, it would have been easier. Unfortunately, schools lost precious time to plan and prepare,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Neither did the advice clear all uncertainties, including the question of how and when school districts make up the hours of help they owe children.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe8a6ed3db65156d0250e7887264d28fbaa06a05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe8a6ed3db65156d0250e7887264d28fbaa06a05/0_47_6612_3967/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The US Department of Education, led by education secretary Betsy DeVos, has been slow to respond to educators\u2019 requests for guidance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The US Department of Education, led by the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, has been slow to respond to educators\u2019 requests for guidance.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yuri Gripas/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The US Department of Education did not immediately return requests for comment.</p> <p>In California, officials <a href=\"https://edsource.org/2020/despite-assurances-of-flexibility-educators-fear-liability-in-online-instruction-of-special-ed-students/626898\">wanted more assurance</a> from the federal government they would be protected from <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-06/legal-fights-families-special-education-services\">lawsuits filed by parents</a> whose children don\u2019t get mandated special education services, something that\u2019s happened after wildfires shut down schools in the past.</p> <p>Meghann Hughes, a special education teacher in San Diego, said teachers in her network have been scrambling to share resources on how to best help students with disabilities in the absence of clear directives from officials.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re just being very creative, jumping into the fire and calling for help from our colleagues,\u201d she said. She added that much of the chatter among the 10,000 members of a Facebook group for the California Teachers Association, one of the largest teachers unions in the country, has consisted of educators\u2019 pinging each other frantic questions on how to move forward.</p> <p>San Diego Unified, where Hughes teaches, is currently on spring break, but plans to resume online classes on 6 April, with special education services to resume on 27 April.</p> <p>But Hughes said teachers were still unclear about what will happen to the face-to-face services students with disabilities typically received.</p> <p>\u201cThis is crisis teaching. This is incredibly traumatic. A lot of parents have been laid off, so those families are insecure, if they weren\u2019t already. And I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to provide a lot of these services through the internet,\u201d said Hughes.</p> <p>For the moment, the official guidance for school districts boils down to making a good-faith effort to provide the education services students need.</p> <p>\u201cNobody thinks that education in the realm of coronavirus is going to look the same as it did. Nobody thinks that. But you have to try, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing now,\u201d Rollin said.</p> <p>\u201cThe bottom line is: do everything that you can, be creative, use all the tools in your toolbox.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://aasa.org/DanDomenech.aspx\">Dan Domenech</a>, executive<em><strong> </strong></em>director of the American Association of School Administrators, whose members include school superintendents from around the nation, said he had received the same message in phone calls with DeVos and Vice-President Mike Pence.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say 100% of kids will be served through online instruction, because it\u2019s not possible,\u201d Domenech said, adding that the nature of a contagious virus complicates matters. \u201cObviously, we\u2019ve got a pandemic that we\u2019re dealing with that prevents teachers going to students\u2019 homes,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He has advised school officials to document efforts to serve all students, taking note of whatever circumstances prevent them from doing so, and to make up the time owed students as soon as possible.</p> <p>\u201cIt may result in lawsuits. It may result in not being in compliance. But the alternative is to do nothing. And that\u2019s not an acceptable outcome,\u201d Domenech said.</p> <h2>\u2018Flexibility is key\u2019</h2> <p>In Los Angeles, Aubrey and her parents are adjusting to the new normal, finding ways to carve out structure while staying flexible enough to account for an unpredictable moment.</p> <p>As it happens, the creators of Aubrey\u2019s TV show have been huddling to create programming that helps children and parents strike the same balance.</p> <p>\u201cFlexibility is the key word,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.sesameworkshop.org/press-room/press-kits/sesame-street-season-50/people-your-neighborhood-ss50#rosemarie%20t.%20truglio\">Rosemarie Truglio</a>, vice-president of curriculum and content for Sesame Street. \u201cAll children do best with structure, but we also need to be flexible if plans go awry. Building resiliency is key. And that\u2019s what this is all about. We don\u2019t know how long this is going to last. We all have to be resilient.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6c51580ce21dc049ba0ff8defc3cf8fbabd7a25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6c51580ce21dc049ba0ff8defc3cf8fbabd7a25/0_122_2335_1401/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Sesame Street has introduced a new character, Julia, who has autism.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sesame Street has introduced a new character, Julia, who has autism.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zach Hyman/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In that way, the advice isn\u2019t much different than official education guidance for parents, teachers and children.</p> <p>As for Aubrey, she would be thrilled to know she appeared in an article alongside leaders from Sesame Street, her father said. Since she last watched, Sesame Street has gotten a new character, <a href=\"https://autism.sesamestreet.org/video/meet-julia/\">Julia, who has autism</a>, too.</p> <p>But the jury is out on when Aubrey will be able to see Julia on screen for the first time. Her love for the show is simply too powerful for her own good.</p> <p>\u201cIt may sound funny, but for her Sesame Street is like a narcotic,\u201d said her mom. \u201cIt\u2019s a compliment to the show, but for her, it\u2019s best to stay away completely.\u201d</p>",

[To] the people watching this: if you have symptoms or <strong>if you think you may have symptoms and you meet these testing criteria, you need to get tested quickly because what we do know about the virus, that people are infectious very early on and that is why we need to make the diagnosis early</strong> and then they can go into isolation and we can immediately get those contact traces made.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T06:40:39.625Z\">at 7.40am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8979558f080bdb9f5346bd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T06:25:55.147Z\">7.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Michael Cusack</strong> said a drop-off in cases was expected, because SA had put in place domestic border restrictions on top of the requirements for international travellers to quarantine. </p> \n  <p>That means that the number of people coming to the state, both domestic and international travellers, has dropped. </p> \n  <p>Cusack:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Obviously once that kind of tap is switched off you would expect there would be a decline in imported disease. </p> \n   <p>What the real anxiety has been and why social distancing is so important is that where the virus is in the community, there is a risk that we start to see some community spread, and that is why it has been so vitally important that we get the public to understand why they should distance themselves.</p> \n   <p>And I would have to say in South Australia the public have been fantastic at actually buying into this and doing the social distancing, and I think it is very early days but that is perhaps starting to bleed through into the numbers.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T06:36:52.894Z\">at 7.36am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e89789d8f08c35a1d11a2f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T06:22:47.126Z\">7.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Like every other public health officer to speak today, <strong>Michael Cusack</strong> is cautiously optimistic about the ability of his team to get ahead of the spread in their jurisdiction.</p> \n  <p>Cusack said they are \u201cobviously\u201d pleased with just two new cases recorded overnight, but added that they often see a \u201cslackening off\u201d of new cases recorded over the weekend, which suggested there could be fewer checks conducted. </p> \n  <p>He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>So I wouldn\u2019t want to read too much into this, but we have seen a gradual decline in recent days. </p> \n   <p>That leads to a question of if we should change our restrictions, and so forth.

  "<p>I\u2019m going to tell you the single worst story I\u2019ve heard in these past few horrid months, a story that combines naked greed, political influence peddling, a willingness to endanger innocent human beings, utter blindness to one of the greatest calamities in human history and a complete disregard for the next crisis aiming for our planet. I\u2019m going to try to stay calm enough to tell it properly, but I confess it\u2019s hard.</p> <p>The background: a decade ago, beginning with indigenous activists in Canada and farmers and ranchers in the American west and midwest, opposition began to something called the Keystone XL pipeline, designed to carry filthy tar sands oil from the Canadian province of Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico. It quickly became a flashpoint for the fast-growing climate movement, especially after Nasa scientist James Hansen explained that draining those tar sands deposits would be \u201cgame over\u201d for the climate system. And so thousands went to jail and millions rallied and eventually Barack Obama bent to that pressure and blocked the pipeline. Donald Trump, days after taking office, reversed that decision, but the pipeline has never been built, both because its builder, TC Energy, has had trouble arranging the <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/TC-Energy-sells-assets-to-help-fund-Keystone-XL-14069033.php\">financing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-keystone-pipeline-spill-permit/rare-permit-for-keystone-oil-pipeline-in-spotlight-after-spills-idUSKBN1XI0L0\">permits</a>, and because 30,000 people have trained to do nonviolent civil disobedience to block construction. It\u2019s been widely assumed that, should a Democrat win the White House in November, the project would finally be gone for good.</p> <p>And then came the coronavirus epidemic \u2013 and the oil industry saw its opening. It moved with breathtaking speed to take advantage of the moment.</p> <p>In Alberta, premier Jason Kenney, a pliant servant of the oil companies who had already set up a <a href=\"https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/what-is-jason-kenneys-energy-war-room-good-for/\">\u201cwar room\u201d</a> to fight environmentalists, <a href=\"https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/tc-energy-to-proceed-with-keystone-xl-pipeline-after-1-5b-investment-from-alberta-government\">invested</a> $1.1bn of taxpayers\u2019 money to TC Energy to fund construction through the year, and set aside another $6bn in a <a href=\"https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/tc-energy-to-proceed-with-keystone-xl-pipeline-after-1-5b-investment-from-alberta-government\">loan guarantee</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the southern side of the border, a series of states quickly adopted laws making it a felony to protest \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d like pipelines. (Last week South Dakota, a crucial link on the KXL route, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/489960-three-states-push-criminal-penalties-for-fossil-fuel-protests-amid\">made it a felony</a> even to \u201cincite\u201d such protest.) And the Department of Health and Human Services issued a <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_Guidance_on_the_Essential_Critical_Infrastructure_Workforce_Version_2.0_Updated.pdf\">memorandum</a> exempting pipeline construction from stay-at-home orders because such work was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.glasgowcourier.com/story/2020/03/25/news/kxl-to-go-forward-in-midst-of-pandemic/8657.html?fbclid=IwAR3XkPugyurel_uSz86nG7Zt6eexJ_HLZNBufOWTNas8kDmJyby5UpQpe5I\">critical</a>\u201d \u2013 that is, the department is asserting it is essential to build oil pipelines at the precise moment that the world is swimming in oil and that the Trump administration is boasting about getting Saudi and Russian autocrats to <em>cut</em> supply.</p> <p>On Tuesday, TC Energy announced it was <a href=\"https://www.glasgowcourier.com/story/2020/04/01/news/kxl-to-go-forward-amid-pandemic/8663.html\">moving workers</a> from across America into place in states along the pipeline route \u2013 although local reporters in Montana discovered they\u2019d <a href=\"https://www.glasgowcourier.com/story/2020/03/25/news/kxl-to-go-forward-in-midst-of-pandemic/8657.html\">actually begun arriving</a> 48 hours earlier, narrowly beating the state imposition of a quarantine.</p> <p>On Thursday, JP Morgan Chase announced that it was leading a <a href=\"https://www.ran.org/press-releases/reckless-keystone-xl-decision-backed-by-chase-citi-and-banks/\">$1.25b</a><a href=\"https://www.ran.org/press-releases/reckless-keystone-xl-decision-backed-by-chase-citi-and-banks/\">n bond issue</a> for TC Energy.</p> <p>So here\u2019s how it shakes out:</p> <p>1) The oil industry is flying in workers from across America to rural states with already strained health care systems, at a moment when all Americans have been asked to shelter in place, and pretending that they are \u201cessential\u201d employees in order to build a pipeline that would carry oil no one wants or needs, and which would go a long way toward wrecking the planet\u2019s climate system.</p> <p>2) The work is being done on the <a href=\"https://www.narf.org/cases/keystone/\">edges of many Indian reservations</a> \u2013 endangering a group of people who, over the centuries, have <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html\">endured</a> 90% population losses from introduced epidemics, and who are suffering horrible losses already from this one. As Faith Spotted Eagle of the Yankton Sioux <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/in-the-midst-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic-construction-is-set-to-resume-on-the-keystone-pipeline\">put it</a> on Wednesday, \u201cthis causes eerie memories for us [of] the infected smallpox blankets that were distributed to tribes intentionally\u201d.</p> <p>3) It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the oil industry is acting decisively now because it knows this is the one moment when protesters can\u2019t make themselves heard. Those 30,000 trained volunteers represent one of the great nonviolent armies in American history, willing to suffer to protect the planet \u2013 but they are moral human beings who will not risk taking microbes into prisons with them, and endanger prisoners crowded together in impossible conditions.</p> <p>There are plenty of targets for anger \u2013 timid Democrats like Montana governor Steve Bullock, who could delay the construction, or like Joe Biden, who could have made it clear that the pipeline would be shut if he won, but who instead issued a statement to NPR which should be eligible for the mealy-mouthed hall of fame:</p> <p><em>\u201cVice-</em><em>president Biden supports establishing a process requiring that for any significant infrastructure project \u2013 including all pipelines \u2013 there must be a full review and accounting of the impact on climate, local environmental health</em><em> and climate justice before any project can proceed. Vice-</em><em>president Biden believes that the approach Secretary Kerry applied in analyzing the costs and benefits of the Keystone XL pipeline and other cross-border pipelines \u2013 including to national security and diplomacy \u2013 is a model to build from in establishing this process.\u201d</em></p> <p>But let\u2019s be clear: the villains here are the oil industry and the big banks. And let\u2019s further be clear: their villainy is not new. The oil industry knew about and lied about climate change for 30 years: they\u2019ve prevented us from flattening the carbon curve, and set up a tragedy far greater even than coronavirus and one which will play out for decades to come. And the banks are their invaluable allies: Chase Bank has <a href=\"https://www.ran.org/bankingonclimatechange2020/\">lent $268b</a><a href=\"https://www.ran.org/bankingonclimatechange2020/\">n</a> to the industry since the Paris climate accords \u2013 what\u2019s another billion to build a useless pipeline and perhaps spread a fatal disease?</p> <p>Literally nothing matters to these people except money. Even in a moment when the rest of us are changing our every habit to try and protect each other, they are willing to sacrifice nothing. No \u2013 let\u2019s be clear again. In this moment they are using the cover of the pandemic to make yet more money, to do things they could not get away with at any other time. These aren\u2019t penny-ante price gougers trying to corner the local market in hand sanitizer so they can make a buck \u2013 these are cold-blooded and calculating members of the one percent. It\u2019s so over-the-top evil that it\u2019s like the comic book version of Naomi Klein\u2019s Shock Doctrine, written in blood.</p> <p>I am a Methodist, sometimes a Sunday School teacher. I don\u2019t actually believe in hell \u2013 I think God is capable of forgiving people for the worst things. But I don\u2019t think I am.</p> <p>Though the hour is late, there may still be ways to fight this blitzkrieg. The coalitions that have battled it for a decade are, even forced apart by the microbe, now coming together to try. We will do it with real and unabating rage in our hearts.</p> <p>How could anyone be this low?</p> <ul> <li><p>Bill McKibben is an author and Schumann distinguished scholar in environmental studies at Middlebury College, Vermont.

  "<p>Balmy days are coming, with temperatures forecast to reach 20C in some regions. The warm weather will bring welcome respite to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/what-are-your-rights-in-lockdown-britain-coronavirus\"> lockdown Britain </a>- and put pressure on authorities trying to control crowds and gatherings.</p> <p>However, scientists also believe warm weather could bring new insights into the virus by showing whether it reacts to the onset of spring. Flu epidemics tend to die out as winter ends; could sunshine, similarly, affect the behaviour of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-update-live-news-usa-uk-spain-italy-china-who-middle-east-spike-world-global-cases-latest-updates\">coronavirus and its spread</a>? It is a key question, and epidemiologists will be watching for changes very closely.</p> <p>Initial studies of other coronaviruses - the common varieties that cause colds in the UK - do suggest a seasonal pattern, with peaks occurring during winter and disappearing in spring. Intriguingly, these peaks tend to coincide with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/spanish-flu-pandemic-centenary-first-world-war\">flu outbreaks</a>. By contrast, only small amounts of coronavirus appear to be transmitted in the summer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is no deus ex machina to reach out of the clouds and put this right. We have to beat the virus ourselves.</p> <footer> <cite>Ben Neuman, Reading University</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A key study of the common coronaviruses - HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E - was published last week by scientists at University College London. By analysing samples collected several years ago they found high rates of coronavirus infections in February, while in summer they were very low. Other studies have also shown coronaviruses are seasonal in behaviour in temperate climates.</p> <p>The study\u2019s lead author, Rob Aldridge, sounded a note of caution, however. \u201cWe could see continued but lower levels of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/is-coronavirus-seasonal-summer\">coronavirus transmission in summer</a> but this may reverse in the winter if there is still a large susceptible population at that point,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd given this is a novel virus, we don\u2019t know if a seasonal pattern will hold over the summer given high levels of susceptibility in the population. For this reason, it is crucial that we all act now to follow current health advice.\u201d</p> <p>This point is backed stressed by other scientists, who warn that the Covid-19 virus is a completely new infectious agent and so there has been no chance for populations to build up any immunity. As a result, it is likely to continue to spread at current rates despite the onset of summer.</p> <p>\u201cI am sure seasonal variations in the virus\u2019s behaviour will play a role in its spread,\u201d said virologist Michael Skinner at Imperial College London. \u201cBut compared with the effect we are having with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/social-distancing-could-needed-uk-autumn-report-shows-coronavirus\">social distancing</a>, it will be a very minor influence. It may produce some marginal effects but these will not be a substitute for self-isolation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4336a536af92d9160e182c9291e482131d5901bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4336a536af92d9160e182c9291e482131d5901bd/0_0_3550_2367/1000..jpg\" alt=\"poster warning stay home to save lives\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Even in warmer weather, social distancing will remain the most effective way of containing the virus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isabel Infantes/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ben Neuman of Reading University was more emphatic. \u201cThis virus started in near-freezing conditions in China, and is rapidly growing both in Iceland and on the equator in Brazil and Ecuador. As winter turned to spring, the virus growth has accelerated worldwide. This is not <em>War of the Worlds</em>, and there is no <em>deus ex machina</em> to reach out of the clouds and put this right. We have to beat the virus ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>The arrival of spring does not only affect the behaviour of a virus, however. It also produces changes in the human immune system, other researchers point out. \u201cOur immune system displays a daily rhythm, but what is less known is how this varies from season to season,\u201d said immunologist Natalie Riddell at Surrey University.</p> <p>To find out, Riddell and other researchers at Surrey and Columbia Universities have been studying immune changes in humans at different seasons and different times of day. Biological samples were taken from volunteers at the winter and summer solstices and the spring and autumn equinoxes. Initial findings suggest a subset of white blood cells that play a key role in the immune system appear to be elevated at certain times of day, indicating that the system responds differently at varying times. For example, B cells that produce antibodies were found to be elevated at night.</p> <p>However, the impact of seasons on cell rhythms is still under investigation, added the study\u2019s leader, Micaela Martinez of Columbia University. Results would be of considerable importance, she added. \u201cKnowing the vulnerabilities of our body to diseases and viruses across the year could inform the timing of vaccination campaigns that will help us eradicate infections.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

Their precarious life and their wedding were documented in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/18/life-after-syria-the-migrants-tale-a-photo-essay\">a Guardian photo essay</a> last year.</p> <p>But the couple were unable to make ends meet and Hanin, by now pregnant, made the journey by dinghy to Lesbos six months ago, with Ahmed promising to follow. She arrived safely and gave birth to their daughter, who is now two months old. Ahmed has yet to meet his child.</p> <p>His first week on Lesbos was spent camping in a fenced-off area of the port city of Mytilene before he was shipped off, along with 450 other new arrivals, on a Greek navy vessel.</p> <p>Amelia Cooper, a case worker at the Lesbos Legal Centre who spoke to some of those detained at the port, said: \u201cThe suspension of the right to seek asylum was followed by deliberate attempts to isolate new arrivals and prevent their access to lawyers, journalists and members of the European parliament.\u201d</p> <p>In the middle of last month, Greek authorities began work on two sites, one in Malakasa, where 1,340 people have been sent, and another near the border with Bulgaria in Serres, which is housing 600 people.

  "<p>Arguments between parents and children about screen time and online gaming are set to escalate with UK schools closed for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Concern was already growing among parents and children\u2019s charities about the increasing monetisation of popular computer, console and video games. Almost half of parents of children aged 12 to 15 who play online games, such as <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Fifa</em> and <em>Minecraft</em>, are worried about the pressure on children to make in-game purchases (up from four in 10 parents a year ago). This is according to Ofcom\u2019s adults\u2019 media use and attitudes report last month.</p> <p>There has been an explosion of in-game purchasing over the past few years. The online gaming market, which is worth around \u00a36bn in the UK, centres on games that players download, meaning the software can be updated at any time \u2013 and new content added during gameplay \u2013 at extra cost (known as \u201cmicro-transactions\u201d). The games and apps are linked to the customer\u2019s (parent\u2019s) bank account. Even supposedly \u201cfree\u201d apps and downloaded games have incentives for players to make in-game purchases.</p> <p>But the danger is that children can easily notch up a big bill on a parent\u2019s debit or credit card \u2013 in some cases without their knowledge. It can be difficult, if not impossible, to claim back the cash and there is no arbitrator or regulator for complaints.</p> <p>But who is at fault? Gaming companies point to the fact there are a wide range of parental and technological controls to block unauthorised transactions. Yet an NSPCC survey last year found just one in five parents use them.</p> <p>The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment (Ukie), which represents the industry, launched its Get Smart About Play campaign in January this year after concerns were raised about the number of parents failing to use parental controls on internet-connected devices.</p> <p>\u201cGames companies do not want children racking up bills \u2013 especially without parental permission,\u201d Ukie says. \u2018The aim of our campaign is to inform parents of the parental controls available and give guidance on how to use them, and also help them have the common-sense conversations with their children about games.\u201d</p> <p>But Justine Roberts, founder of the parenting website Mumsnet, says many parents will continue to fall foul of micro-transactions. She says: \u201cParents know game and app developers are not altruistic; it is often made very easy for children to get sucked into games and then spend a fortune on in-game currencies, such as \u2018coins\u2019, \u2018berries\u2019 or \u2018doughnuts.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The social enterprise ParentZone, which provides support and information to parents, children and schools about safe internet use, has called for clearer signposting.</p> <p>It found three-quarters of children felt online video games tried to make them pay out as much as possible and about half said games were only fun when they spent money.</p> <p>Its \u201cRip-Off Games\u201d report highlighted so-called \u201cloot boxes\u201d as an area of big concern. Sometimes known as crates, bundles, packs or cartons) they are offered for players to buy during an online game but often the player does not know what they contain before they buy them \u2013 fuelling concerns that they are akin to gambling. There is peer pressure, too, says ParentZone, when several players are in the same game, and children feel the need to purchase the loot to \u201cfit in\u201d and \u201cmeasure up\u201d. It wants the government to commission further research into the overlap between gaming and gambling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5be41172d44a9b7ebbf0bc44a9c29cf4e18a26c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5be41172d44a9b7ebbf0bc44a9c29cf4e18a26c/810_185_3614_2168/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A loot box from the game Overwatch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A loot box from the game Overwatch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Blizzard Entertainment</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Google, Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony have agreed to provide the odds of receiving in-game items from \u201cloot boxes\u201d in all future releases, and Apple has done so since 2017, they remain a lucrative area for the industry \u2013 worth about \u00a3700m in the UK each year.</p> <p>Research by the Children\u2019s Commissioner, the public body to protect children, echoes the concerns raised by ParentZone. While it found some positives to gaming, including socialising with friends online and learning new skills, it also found bullying was a problem as well as the pressure to spend.</p> <p>Simone Vibert, senior public affairs and policy analyst at the Children\u2019s Commissioner, says: \u201cWe would like to see a cap placed on in-game spending. We are also calling on the government to look at \u2018loot boxes\u2019 as we feel they should fall under the definition of \u2018gambling.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Juliet Jackson,* 48, a charity worker, had a shock three years ago when her son Noah* (then aged 11) ran up a \u00a31,200 bill on her debit card on the family\u2019s iPad. It was only when Juliet had her card declined in a restaurant and she checked thatshe realised the money had been emptied over a two-week period.</p> <p>\u201cI felt sick,\u201d says Juliet, who lives with her husband and two teenage sons in south-east London. \u201cNoah had been playing the Harry Potter game and <em>Boom Beach</em> on our iPad, which he was allowed to do. But the iPad account is linked to my bank account. It was password protected so I thought it was safe, but Noah had watched me, without me realising, and worked out the password. He had been buying coin and \u2018power bundles\u2019 at \u00a379.99 a time, over and over again.\u201d</p> <p>Juliet says she accepted it was her fault and was resigned to taking the financial hit. But she contacted Apple, which was sympathetic. </p> <p>\u201cIt could see it was unusual spending for my account and agreed to refund in full. But I was not expecting it,\u201d says Juliet. \u201cNoah was mortifiedand very remorseful. It has been a good learning process for the family and we expect the boys to be open with us. We have a PlayStation and the boys have their own phones, but I have alerts set up so I get a message if they try to spend on the account. In any case, Noah always asks me now!\u201d</p> <p>Ukie says it encourages game developers and platforms to give a refund where it is clear a purchase was made without parental permission. But many parents will not so it pays to discuss boundaries and rules from the outset and use parental tech controls (see below).</p> <p>Pete Lewin, a lawyer with Purewal &amp; Partners, which offers legal advice to the tech and gaming industry, says: \u201cResponsibility lies on all sides to ensure children are gaming safely. Developers have worked hard to put strong parental controls and tools in place but there is an element on parents to engage, get the right information and use the necessary controls.\u201d</p> <p><em>*names have been changed.</em></p> <h2><strong>How to stay safe</strong></h2> <p><strong>\u2022</strong> Talk to your children about safe and sensible gaming and internet use. </p> <p>\u2022 Check the age rating of a game, research how it works, the content and the potential for in-game spending before downloading. </p> <p>\u2022 Set clear boundaries on screen time and explain the reasons. Help children learn how to protect themselves. Remind them not to share personal information and keep \u201cgaming friends\u201d in the game only and not add to social networks.</p> <p>\u2022 Do not disclose passcodes or passwords to children if they are using your devices, such as your phone or tablet. </p> <p>\u2022 Set up the maximum parental controls on your phone, tablets and games consoles. Information should be available online and from your phone, tablet or console provider. For example, Apple offers its \u201cFamily Sharing\u201d and \u201cAsk to Buy\u201d tools \u2013 which mean parents get an alert if a child asks to make a purchase. Turn on \u201cScreen Time\u201d in settings to disable in-app purchases. To set up family settings on an Xbox you will need to open a child account and link it to the parent\u2019s Microsoft account. They will then have features to control purchases (Ask a Parent), screen time limits and content filters.</p>",
  "<p><br>\u201cI\u2019m Ethan. I\u2019m 17. Apparently, girls love me.\u201d Ethan stares dead-eyed at the camera, daring us to contradict him. Love that \u201capparently\u201d. Mind you, I would like to hear the girls\u2019 side of the story.</p> <p>But there is a more pressing problem. If Ethan, a willowy Mancunian with frizzy ginger hair, matching freckles and an unexpectedly beguiling smile, is going to break into the modelling business, he will have to have a word with himself. \u201cWe can\u2019t represent anybody that\u2019s involved in criminality,\u201d says Nigel, the head of a model agency that calls itself, presumably ironically, Nemesis.</p> <p>Ethan has a rap sheet as long as the East Lancs Road. Bored, he lists his crimes: \u201cPossession of class A drugs with intent to supply, possession of class B drugs with intent to supply, possession of a bladed article in a public place, two robberies, perverting the course of justice, two affrays \u2026\u201d Hold on, Ethan, mate. \u201cBladed article\u201d? Isn\u2019t the word \u201cknife\u201d?</p> <p>Model: From Street to Catwalk (BBC Three) profiles two buff young Manc geezers trying to escape their humble lives to become paid clothes hangers for athleisurewear. While Ethan is trying to escape a life of crime, <a href=\"http://nemesismodels.com/model/jordan-backhouse/\">Jordan is hoping to get out of his life of grime</a>. His nine-to-five as a labourer involved shovelling rubble and gutting soon-to-be gentrified properties that the likes of him would never be able affordon their current wages.</p> <p>Jordan shows his mother pictures that Nemesis\u2019s photographers have taken of him to establish his credentials for potential clients. \u201cManchester look, chavvy, know what I mean?\u201d he explains. \u201cYou can be called worse things, can\u2019t ya?\u201d she tells him as she scrolls.</p> <p>Jordan was scouted one night while walking around town. \u201cHe typifies everything we\u2019re looking for right now,\u201d says Nigel. \u201cWe want you to look like that, to be a lad, a scally, but we actually want you to be professional about it.\u201d Jordan\u2019s problem is that, in trial photo shoots, he didn\u2019t project himself with the verve he had displayed in his natural habitat. \u201cHe\u2019s a Manchester lad. He\u2019s got that gritty northern look, if you like.\u201d</p> <p>Ethan and Jordan are the success stories, the pair who are selected from a waiting room of 20 possibles. Some of the 18 rejects, though, were more handsome. But that is not the point. What Nemesis wants is not looks. It is a look. An attitude. If you are to be persuaded to purchase trackie bottoms and a no-less-flammable top, you won\u2019t want to buy them just because the model is gorgeous. You will want to buy into the lifestyle inscribed on the model\u2019s body and clobber. You must be made to believe that their badass strut, thousand-yard stare and ostensibly antinomian persona can be yours for the price of a hoodie.</p> <p>The day before Jordan\u2019s first assignment, his mum texts him: \u201cBed at 9pm for you gotta look after that face get your bum hole waxed.\u201d Some mothers hope their sons will be doctors, others that they will be cosmetically enhanced where the sun don\u2019t shine. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be getting many shots of my bum hole, Mum.\u201d Well, probably not for his first client, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/jd-sports\">JD Sports</a>. But you never know, Jordan, what future clients may require. Best be, like the Scouts, prepared.</p> <p>I would have liked more on what it is like to be a man and to be objectified by photographers for a living, but neither Ethan nor Jordan reflect on that aspect of their chosen profession. But both nail what it means to them. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit easier staying still taking pictures than robbing people and selling their stuff \u2013 and at least it\u2019s legit,\u201d says Ethan.</p> <p>Jordan\u2019s first day as a model pays more than a week\u2019s labouring. Like boxing or football for previous Ethans and Jordans of this world, modelling could be an escape from the streets. Fingers crossed they will emulate another success story, 23-year-old Ruby, who has been modelling for less than a year and already earns more than \u00a310,000 a month. If she cracks the US, she could triple that. \u201cShe\u2019s got the badass look,\u201d explains a Nemesis functionary. \u201cWe know she will sell for us.\u201d We see her shooting in a Welsh quarry, the grey slate rhyming with her tough-girl check strides and black quilted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/apr/02/how-the-puffer-jacket-took-over-the-world\">puffer jacket</a>. If I wanted to look like a badass young woman, I would definitely buy what Ruby is modelling.</p>",
  "<p>I suspect this is not going to be popular, but I have a suggestion for a way to manage our reactions to the current situation and it is this: focus on minor irritants. It\u2019s not very Blitz spirit, I know. But, actually, it is a way of keeping calm and carrying on: it\u2019s just that carrying on in my world involves a relatively high level of irritation most of the time.</p> <p>We are usually exhorted to think of happier things when times are tough \u2013 and there are plenty of those, even for naturally peevish types like me. I love the gradual unfurling of the natural world at this time of year: the sun is absurdly welcome, before hayfever and heat rash kick in, and every few hours there\u2019s a new bud or shoot. I enjoy watching the blue tits in the yard, chattering and squabbling over seeds and my dog\u2019s tender pink belly exposed as he lies, limbs akimbo and face saggy with deep relaxation. But thinking of these things now takes on an elegiac quality that intensifies my anxiety: life is full of beauty and joy \u2013 and it feels fragile.</p> <p>In contrast, if I focus on the trivial things that still annoy me \u2013 because despite the existential threat, I have inexplicably failed to enter a state of total saintly forbearance \u2013 I find it obscurely calming.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have inexplicably failed to enter a state of total saintly forbearance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My friend F and I have been doing this intermittently for months, after she suggested I read <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Madwoman-Volvo-Year-Raging-Hormones/dp/0393351092\" title=\"\">The Madwoman in the Volvo</a></em>, US writer Sandra Tsing Loh\u2019s darkly hilarious account of her perimenopausal semi-madness. In it she discusses those \u201cquotidian irritants that can cause the elevator to drop\u201d, which she calls \u201cgloomlets\u201d. Loh\u2019s include the colour yellow, muffins and \u201cthe food samples at Trader Joe\u2019s \u2013 so limited, so always disappointing\u201d.</p> <p>Even before things became terrible, I found sharing sources of irritation took their sting away. Once I had written them down, I could laugh at their \u2013 my \u2013 essential ridiculousness. Now, faced with genuinely unmanageable problems, there\u2019s an odd \u201clife goes on\u201d reassurance to trotting them out. Exercising my pettiness muscles, weakened by pervasive dread, seems to help, somehow. Maybe give it a try? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re no longer annoyed by little things, cheek by jowl with your nearest and dearest for prolonged periods. I\u2019ll get you started: I have both gloomlets and ragelets, which are equally effective.</p> <p><strong>1.</strong> My neighbour keeps putting his rubbish in my recycling box: single-use plastic, aerosols, a coffee jar full of fag butts. This is enraging on two levels: first, the absolute cheek of it, get your own box, you chancer. Second, and more subtly infuriating, he has ruined my unblemished record with the recycling people, for which I was hoping to win an award one day. Most Diligent Recycler, perhaps. No longer.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Who is hoarding nail clippers and why won\u2019t they admit it? Often in the evenings I hear the phantom sound of nails being cut and follow it like a woman possessed, throwing open doors and making accusations, but no, everyone says they were \u201cjust playing with the remote control\u201d or \u201cwhy are you here, please go away\u201d. I\u2019m not fooled.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> The kidnap of the Good Towel \u2013 99% of our towels were pensioned out of a holiday cottage business in the 1990s as being too threadbare for paying customers. We do, however, have one huge, fluffy one, acquired in a fit of uncharacteristic extravagance. I do not remember the last time I got a turn of the Good Towel: whenever I launder and put it away, it vanishes, instantly, turning up weeks later, damp and smelly. It\u2019s not on.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> The area under the salad drawer in the fridge is permanently flooded. Just when I had finally reclaimed it from four hibernating tortoises (don\u2019t ask), I now have to deal with a tide of fetid water whenever I try to make lunch.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> Limescale. Something happened when I turned 40: now limescale genuinely upsets me. I wish to return to a more innocent time when the state of the kettle didn\u2019t ruin my morning.</p> <p><strong>6.</strong> I don\u2019t want to admit this, but in the spirit of togetherness in the face of adversity I will: it turns out the strange irritation on my scalp is ringworm. Ringworm! How the hell did I get ringworm? It\u2019s the kind of thing a Victorian reformer would deplore in a pamphlet about afflicted street urchins. I blame my habit of patting every passing dog, but given the current intensive scrutiny of hygiene, everyone thinks I\u2019m just a bit gross. Even the pharmacist recoiled when I told him and it\u2019s his job not to look disgusted.</p> <p>I could go on. I will go on, muttering away, self-soothing with a litany of minor complaints. How bad can it really be, I suppose I\u2019m thinking, if I\u2019m still annoyed by ringworm and limescale? Perhaps soon I\u2019ll find my husband\u2019s incessant foot tapping a welcome distraction, but thankfully we\u2019re not quite there yet.</p> <p><em>Follow Emma on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BelgianWaffling?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@BelgianWaffling</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. These are the main stories on Sunday 5 April.</p> <h2>NSW police launch criminal investigation into Ruby Princess fiasco</h2> <p>The NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, confirmed on Sunday that there will be a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess debacle that will look at the actions of every agency involved as well as the cruise ship operator.</p> <p>\u201cThere is clear evidence that [Covid-19] has been brought off that ship,\u201d Fuller says. There\u2019s clear evidence now when it stopped in New Zealand Covid-19 has come off that ship and at least 10 people have died in Australia from Covid-19. The only way I can get to the bottom of whether our national biosecurity laws and our state laws were broken is through a criminal investigation.\u201d</p> <p>Three of the four latest deaths in NSW were passengers on the Ruby Princess.</p> <h2>Health officials \u2018hopeful\u2019 curve is flattening</h2> <p>Health authorities in Australia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/health-officials-hopeful-australia-is-flattening-coronavirus-curve-but-warn-against-complacency\">have expressed cautious optimism</a> that Australia may be able to limit the domestic coronavirus outbreak but have warned against complacency or relaxing social distancing rules too early.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, said the number of cases in Australia rose by 139 on Sunday, to a total of 5,687 cases. About 2,000 of those cases are of people who have completely recovered. Australia\u2019s death toll now stands at 34.</p> <p>\u201cThat is probably the lowest rise we\u2019ve had for a few days and it does tend to continue the trend we\u2019ve seen of flattening of the curve,\u201d Murphy said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian Australia's coronavirus email signup button\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a></figcaption> </figure>  <h2>More casuals could receive jobkeeper payment</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/more-casual-workers-may-be-included-in-130bn-jobkeeper-coronavirus-scheme\">The government has opened the door</a> to allowing more of the casual workforce to access wage subsidies, as it vowed to press ahead with legislating the $130bn jobkeeper scheme this week.</p> <p>Christian Porter, the attorney general, said the government was aiming to be \u201cas inclusive and reasonable as possible\u201d on the issue of casuals and he hoped to have draft legislation ready on Monday. Parliament is due to return on Wednesday \u2013 with limited numbers of MPs attending \u2013 to consider legislation to enable as many as 6m workers to access wage subsidies of $1,500 per fortnight. The secretary of the ACTU, Sally McManus, said the union movement had been raising concerns publicly and privately with the government.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/more-casual-workers-may-be-included-in-130bn-jobkeeper-coronavirus-scheme\">More casual workers may be included in $130bn jobkeeper coronavirus scheme</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Western Australia border to close at midnight</h2> <p>The WA premier, Mark McGowan, has told people outside the state to \u201ccome home by midnight tonight\u201d before strict new entry rules come into effect.</p> <p>\u201cNo one from over east will be allowed entry into Western Australia unless you\u2019re an approved exempt traveller \u2026 People can go to the government website to get the latest information and download the necessary forms. Checks will be occurring. If you\u2019ve lied on an exemption form to get into our state, there\u2019s every chance you\u2019ll get caught and be forced to face the consequences.\u201d</p> <h2>Free hotel rooms for Victorian frontline workers</h2> <p>Victoria\u2019s frontline health workers will have free hotel stays if they need to self-isolate during the coronavirus crisis, as the state recorded 20 new cases overnight.</p> <p>The state government will provide $20m to buy hotel rooms, enabling up to 8,000 frontline workers who may test positive for Covid-19 or have unexpected and unprotected contact with a suspected patient, to self-isolate, away from family and flatmates, at no cost. The service will be available to healthcare professionals and other workers such as cooks and cleaners who directly engage with patients.</p> <h2>People warned against travelling over Easter holidays</h2> <p>Authorities in several states have warned people against travelling over the coming Easter holiday period, urging them to adhere to social distancing rules. The NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, was asked if police will be doing random checks on IDs to see that people have not gone on holidays and responded, \u201cwe will be stopping people and if you don\u2019t have a good reason to be where you are, you could face a $1,000 fine.\u201d Tasmania will toughen restrictions to stop people heading to their holiday homes or taking boating trips over the Easter break, the state\u2019s premier said on Sunday. Peter Gutwein said many elderly people lived in these areas, and they needed to be protected, as the state\u2019s confirmed cases rose to 82.</p> <h2>Police issue scores of fines at Queensland car rally</h2> <p>Police issued 58 infringement notices at a car rally in the Brisbane suburb of Rochedale last night where people were flouting social distancing directives. Deputy Queensland police commissioner Steve Gollschewski, who is also the state disaster coordinator, has professed himself disappointed and frustrated and said the behaviour of people at the rally was \u201cinexcusable\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is all about safety. About saving lives. About stopping the spread of Covid-19,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is inexcusable what happened at Rochedale last night and such blatant disregard for the lives of Queenslanders will not be tolerated.\u201d</p> <p>A man was also charged in Tasmania for allegedly disobeying isolation requirements after returning to the state from Victoria, police said. The man had been staying at a government facility for his period of isolation but had breached conditions, police say.</p> <h2><strong>What you need to know: get the most important information from some of our key explainers</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/australias-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-explained-can-i-still-visit-my-partner-and-other-questions\">Australia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/mar/26/how-many-cases-of-coronavirus-are-there-in-australia-live-covid-19-numbers-and-statistics\">Coronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statistics</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/03/social-distancing-rules-australia-coronavirus-strict-new-laws-legal-illegal-state-physical-restrictions-guidelines-explained-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa-two-person-rule\">Australia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare: what do the Australian government\u2019s coronavirus changes mean for my family?</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/01/jobkeeper-payment-am-i-eligible-for-the-wage-subsidy-how-do-i-register-ato-jobseeker-supplement-support-package-eligibility\">Am I eligible for the jobkeeper payment?

  "<p>In uncertain times, gardening can be a powerful therapeutic tool. When distracted by fresh air and new growth \u2013 and with your hands and mind busy \u2013 it is so much easier to live in the here and now, focussing less on the things beyond your control. Yet, like many industries, the current situation is hitting small, independent growers hard. Coinciding with the crucial spring season, this period could really mean make or break for the many tiny, family-run nurseries that underpin UK horticulture. However, British mail-order plant suppliers will be able to reward your support now with plants to boost your spirits. All without you having to pass your front door.</p> <p><a href=\"https://darcyeverest.co.uk/\" title=\"\">D\u2019Arcy and Everest</a> has been producing some of the finest alpine plants in the world from their Cambridgeshire nursery since 1992, including some species I\u2019ve never seen anywhere else. These are perfect if you have a bright spot with well-drained soil. This doesn\u2019t have to be a traditional rock garden or alpine bed, as their tolerance for searing sun, poor soil and drought also makes these plants perfect for windswept roof terraces, or brightening up gravel driveways.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"12426f6a80ef65a27da2e6635d61dbcc60fdfdd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12426f6a80ef65a27da2e6635d61dbcc60fdfdd4/444_447_2152_3516/612.jpg\" alt=\"Fruiting chilli plant in a pot against white background\" width=\"612\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hot buy: purchase chillies from a plant shopping \u2018nirvana\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Griffin/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For those with opposite conditions, <a href=\"https://www.plantsforshade.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Long Acre </a><a href=\"https://www.plantsforshade.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Plants</a> stock the most comprehensive range of plants for shade anywhere. Their website has a useful tool to help you select perfect contenders for specific requirements and locations, from native woodland plants to those that will thrive in that most tricky of situations \u2013 dry shade. Plant quality and packaging is top notch, too.</p> <p>In a market dominated by the big boys, it\u2019s crucial to support the work of our amazing, independent vegetable seed nurseries. My favourite start-up is <a href=\"https://www.realseeds.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Real Seeds</a>, based in North Wales. They grow all their own stock, including rare vegetables that even I, an ethnobotanist, had never heard of. Their \u201cFat Baby\u201d Achocha is a cucumber relative that tastes almost identical to green peppers, but is far easier to grow and at least 10 times as productive. A total winner.</p> <p>If you love chillies, <a href=\"https://www.seaspringseeds.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Sea Spring Seeds,</a> run by world-renowned experts Joy and Michael Michaud, is a plant-shopping nirvana. It\u2019s a tad late to sow these from seed, so it\u2019s just as well they stock a bewildering array of plug plants, too.</p> <p>If you are after unusual ornamentals, we Brits are lucky to have one of the best nurseries on the planet in <a href=\"https://www.crug-farm.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Cr\u00fbg Farm Plants</a>. They have introduced dozens of species from their plant-hunting trips around the world.

For more flowery indoor specimens, the massive range of African violets and Cape primroses at <a href=\"http://www.dibleys.com/\" title=\"\">Dibleys</a> is hard to beat.

This compares with just 19% of children in households with income of more than \u00a370,000 a year.</p> \n  <p>The findings come after the tutoring industry reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/27/school-closures-prompt-boom-in-private-tuition-online-isolation\">a boom in demand due to the Covid-19 outbreak</a>, and a number of agencies said they were offering lower cost or <a href=\"https://coronavirustutoring.co.uk/\">free tutoring</a> to less-affluent schoolchildren. </p> \n  <p>Milburn, a former Labour cabinet minister, said the findings showed lower-income families were less able to offset the detrimental impact of the pandemic on their children\u2019s education. He said:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Access to a private tutor, even at a reduced rate, is well beyond the means of most families and will be impossible for families who do not have internet access and who live in crowded accommodation. </p> \n   <p>Tutors offer parents a break and children the opportunity to learn from an experienced adult, their appeal is clear. But not all children will have access to this resource, indeed, they are a pipe dream for families living on low income. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Milburn called on universities to recognise that the school shutdown could magnify the huge educational disparity between children from richer and poorer backgrounds, and to take that into account when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/03/gcse-a-level-grades-coronavirus-crisis-teacher-assessment-ofqual\">deciding who would get a university place</a>.<br></p> \n  <p>The Institute for Public Policy Research has said the shift to school lessons being delivered online during the pandemic made it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/children-must-not-become-unseen-victims-of-coronavirus-says-thinktank\">difficult for those children without suitable technology to keep up with their studies</a>.

  "<p>What makes a hero? According to a popular meme going around at the moment, intentions matter more than actions. \u201cYour grandparents were called to war,\u201d it says. \u201cYou\u2019re being called to sit on the couch.\u201d In a way, sitting around and doing nothing is a new type of heroism, because going out and living life as normal makes you a passive bystander to a global threat. But in ordinary times, the difference between a hero and a bystander is far more clear-cut. What makes some of us the former, and some of us the latter?</p> <p>As she was boarding the tube in London on an otherwise ordinary Friday morning last November, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/23/man-arrested-after-jewish-children-were-targeted-on-the-tube\" title=\"\">Asma Shuweikh</a> felt a man rush past her. He made a beeline for an orthodox Jewish family sitting by the doors\u2013 a father and two sons in kippah. Brandishing a bible, the man began to hurl antisemitic abuse at the family; as Shuweikh stood in shocked silence, she noticed he had highlighted passages in his book. When the man turned his attention to the children, she decided she could not remain silent any longer: it was time to speak up. In a video that subsequently went viral on social media, the 36-year-old can be seen calmly telling the aggressor: \u201cCome on, man, there\u2019s children here\u2026 You\u2019re on public transport.\u201d</p> <p>What made Shuweikh speak out and put herself in the firing line? The abuser later began berating her for being a Muslim woman wearing trousers. She says that faith and motherhood helped inform her actions. \u201cWhen I see something wrong,\u201d she says, \u201cI have to say it.\u201d</p> <p>According to Catherine A Sanderson, a psychology professor at Amherst College in Massachusetts and the author of <em>The Bystander Effect</em>, myriad complex factors make some of us bystanders and some of us heroes. These range from our self-identity to the pressure of social norms.</p> <p>Sanderson says she was inspired to write the book by both \u201cpersonal and global\u201d events: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/harvey-weinstein-sentencing-rape-conviction\" title=\"\">Harvey Weinstein\u2019s sex offences</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/09/usa-gymnastics-larry-nassar-scandal\" title=\"\">USA Gymnastics</a> sex abuse scandal, and the fact that a student at her son\u2019s college died just two weeks into his very first semester. The student had been drinking heavily and had fallen and hit his head. Although fellow students watched over him, they didn\u2019t call emergency services for nearly 20 hours. By which time it was too late to save him. Her book answers the question at the heart of this incident: why?</p> <p>You may already know about the \u201cbystander effect\u201d. For more than 50 years, newspaper articles and textbooks have recounted the story of Kitty Genovese \u2013 a young woman who was murdered outside her apartment in New York in 1964. It was claimed almost 40 people heard or saw Genovese\u2019s murder, yet none of them spoke out. The term bystander effect was coined to explain the fact that individuals are less likely to help people in need when other people are present.</p> <p>The Genovese story is largely apocryphal \u2013 later research revealed that no witnesses actually saw the attack in its entirety and two people did in fact call the police. Yet this doesn\u2019t mean the bystander effect isn\u2019t without some truth. In her book, Sanderson shares a number of scientific and real-life case studies that prove the presence of others makes it more difficult for us to speak out.</p> <p>In one New York University study carried out shortly after the Genovese case, 85% of participants sought help for a man who was slurring his words when they believed only they could hear him. When they thought others could hear him, too, only 31% went to get help.</p> <p>Sanderson isn\u2019t interested in easy explanations about fearless heroes and callous bystanders. \u201cThe question of why some people act badly and others don\u2019t is not really about good and bad,\u201d she says. She notes that many of the participants in the New York study were physically distressed and argues they didn\u2019t choose not to act but were rather paralysed by a \u201cstate of indecision\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fbb2eeebf95b3db1725feff7896d292833f9df6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fbb2eeebf95b3db1725feff7896d292833f9df6/0_5187_5792_3473/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An illustration of a group of around 35-40 people standing in a rough semi-circle, each going their own way\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Bystanders aren\u2019t just people who fail to run at terrorists. They\u2019re people who let sexist or racist jokes pass, too.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Franck Allais/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Throughout her book, Sanderson references a number of neurological studies that explain our inaction. She shows that working with others reduces our feeling of control and that as the number of observers to an incident increases, the parts of our brains that prepare us to take action actually become less active. \u201cMany of the processes that drive inaction occur not through a careful deliberative process, but at an automatic level in the brain.\u201d </p> <p>Sanderson is a psychologist not a neuroscientist, so I ask why she chose to focus so much on brain activity in the book. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for people to understand that what they\u2019re doing is natural and probably even adaptive from an evolutionary point,\u201d she says. \u201cBut neuroscience lets us be aware of our pre-existing unconscious biases. It gives us the power to say: \u2018This is normal and it\u2019s natural, but I still have some agency and I can act.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The third section of Sanderson\u2019s book is more of a guide to how we can all change our behaviour to ensure we speak out, whether that be about discrimination on public transport, workplace fraud, sexual harassment or school bullies. Sanderson\u2019s research shows many of us often believe we would act in certain scenarios. Who among us hasn\u2019t had a casual fantasy about heroically saving the day by whistleblowing at work, saving an infant and/or granny from traffic, or karate chopping a pervert in the park? But in that fantasy, we\u2019re thinking about ourselves alone. In the real world, Sanderson says, we are often bystanders as part of a group and because of that we experience \u201cdeindividuation\u201d.</p> <p>Can we be \u201cre-individualised\u201d to ensure that we act as we hope we might? A study Sanderson references seems to suggest we can. In 2012, academics from Harvard asked people to take a maths test and offered them $1 for every correct answer. The twist? Participants scored themselves. The study\u2019s participants were divided into groups that included those who signed an honesty declaration at the end of the test after they\u2019d written down their score; and those who signed a declaration at the top of the sheet before scoring themselves.</p> <p>In the end, 79% of people who signed their name at the bottom of the page cheated by inflating their score, compared to only 37% of those who signed their name before scoring themselves. \u201cWhen we are reminded of who we are \u2013 which signing our name surely does \u2013 we are also reminded of our intentions to be a good person who does the right thing,\u201d Sanderson writes.</p> <p>By remarkable coincidence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/21/man-tells-of-using-narwhal-tusk-during-london-bridge-attack\" title=\"\">Darryn Frost</a> was reminded of who he was shortly before he ran at a terrorist with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/30/narwhal-tusk-and-fire-extinguisher-used-to-tackle-london-bridge-attacker\" title=\"\">narwhal tusk</a> during the London Bridge attack of November 2019. \u201cI was at a conference directly before the attack and an American woman was talking about where we learn our behaviours,\u201d he explains. \u201cShe started our session asking us for three positive and negative traits about ourselves.\u201d After this, Frost says, she prompted the audience to think about their earliest memory where they learned these traits. \u201cIt was literally just after that that everything kicked off, so my emotions at the time were really raw and on the surface.\u201d</p> <p>In general, Frost\u2019s experiences tally with Sanderson\u2019s optimism that we can overcome our inaction. Frost says he taught himself to speak out and conquer fear \u2013 he assists those in need and confronts people who are disrespectful to others when he is out in public. \u201cIt mostly comes from my schooling\u2026 My school motto was: \u2018For the brave, nothing is too difficult\u2019. They teach you to be a good citizen and to look out for your fellow man.\u201d Of his response to the attack, he says: \u201cIt did feel instinctive to an extent, but that instinct has been taught and nurtured and built over years.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In some cases you can diffuse a situation by making a simple joke</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One thing Sanderson says we all must nurture, and build in ourselves is the ability to overcome social awkwardness. Time and time again, she notes how social pressures facilitate inaction. Put simply: if we are around others, we base how we act on how they\u2019re acting. Many of us might avoid speaking out for fear that we\u2019ve misjudged a situation \u2013 after all, if it really was that bad, wouldn\u2019t others be speaking up, too? Psychologists call these worries \u201cevaluation apprehension\u201d. We\u2019re concerned we\u2019ll look stupid or sensitive or strange if we speak out. Sanderson notes that people find it easier to intervene if they are less concerned about fitting in, yet also notes those who are worried about fitting in feel social ostracisation more strongly. The neuroscience shows that for these people, rejection feels like physical pain \u2013 \u201cas if you\u2019ve twisted your ankle or burned yourself with coffee\u201d.</p> <p>Sanderson also argues it\u2019s more difficult to act when situations are ambiguous and less dramatic, noting that empirical evidence shows that in obvious emergencies such as terror attacks, people are just as likely to help whether alone or in a crowd. While Shuweikh had little doubt what was happening when she saw that man brandishing a highlighted bible, I spoke to someone who failed to act when they saw harassment on another train. Carla, 30, says she was travelling in west London when she heard some Muslim teenagers chatting. Suddenly, a trans woman stood up and shouted at the teens. Carla realised later that they had insulted the woman in a language they both spoke, but which Carla couldn\u2019t understand.</p> <p>\u201cIt took a long time to even realise that something bad had happened, so I only started weighing up whether to say something when the trans woman began telling the carriage what had happened,\u201d Carla explains. She says she felt stressed, ashamed and conflicted as she weighed up what to do \u2013 she felt as though her face went red. \u201cI felt awful for this woman, because I know how much discrimination trans people face\u2026 but I was afraid, I didn\u2019t want to be seen shouting at a group of young, visibly Muslim people in case it appeared racist.\u201d Carla also says it was late and she was in a part of town she didn\u2019t know, which fed her inhibitions. In the end, she didn\u2019t speak out except to shout \u201cgood for you!\u201d to the woman as she stood up for herself. Describing the story now, Carla apologises for being \u201ccowardly\u201d.</p> <p>Sanderson emphasises that Carla isn\u2019t cowardly \u2013 the difference between a hero and a bystander is heavily situational. In another incident, Carla was the only person to call an ambulance when someone was run over by a bus, while Frost says he was uncomfortable at being labelled a \u201chero\u201d after the London Bridge attack. He says he is \u201chaunted\u201d by the times in his adult life when he didn\u2019t speak out or take action. \u201cPeople seem to glorify my actions and yes I\u2019m proud of them, but there\u2019s a lot of times in life I regret not being a better person.\u201d</p> <p>Despite her insistence that we can\u2019t divide the world into neat dichotomies, Sanderson would be remiss not to document what makes it easier for certain people to speak out. She explains the concept of \u201cmoral rebels\u201d \u2013 people who show courage in speaking out and overcoming social pressure. These people tend to have higher self-esteem and also believe their actions will make a difference (though there are no official figures, Sanderson estimates between five and 10% of the population can be categorised this way). She is at pains, however, to make it clear that anyone can speak out. \u201cIt\u2019s not one-size-fits all,\u201d Sanderson says. She argues that not everyone has to be a knight in shining armour. \u201cYou can find a friend if you don\u2019t have the ability to do it alone\u201d or \u201cin some cases you might diffuse the situation by creating a joke\u201d. As well as social skills, learning more traditional skills also helps \u2013 early in the book, Sanderson notes that people trained in first aid are more likely to intervene in dangerous situations. \u201cThey weren\u2019t different in personality, but they were equipped with different skills.\u201d</p> <p>Yet it isn\u2019t just dangerous situations that concern Sanderson \u2013 much of her work is dedicated to how you can speak out about sexual harassment or workplace fraud. According to Sanderson, bystanders aren\u2019t just people who fail to run at terrorists with narwhal tusks, they\u2019re people who let sexist or racist jokes pass, too. She documents how silence perpetuates poor behaviour, citing a report that found men who have committed sexual assault believe other men accept their behaviour. Or as Martin Luther King Jr said: \u201cHistory will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamour of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy hope is that reading this book will help people understand that they have a choice and they can act,\u201d Sanderson says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a courageous act, it doesn\u2019t have to be confronting the person shouting slurs on public transport, it can be going over and sitting with the victim and pretending that you know them to interrupt the situation.\u201d</p> <p>There is no doubt that Asma Shuweikh chose the courageous path. She recalls being bullied at 12 because she wore a hijab. One girl threw Shuweikh\u2019s lunch on the ground while others laughed \u2013 later that night, she went home and cried. \u201cMy mum and my brother said to me: \u2018Never, ever, ever be quiet when someone does something wrong to you.\u2019\u201d In the past, she has been targeted by Islamophobic abuse in public and felt hurt when no one spoke up on her behalf. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in that situation, you just don\u2019t think about yourself,\u201d she says of witnessing the antisemitic abuse on the tube. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the discrimination, don\u2019t like the injustice, you have to say something.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780008361648/the-bystander-effect-understanding-the-psychology-of-courage-and-inaction/\" title=\"\">The Bystander Effect</a> by Catherine A Sanderson (</em><em>Harper Collins, \u00a320) is published 16 April.

  "<p>Reviewing Andrew K\u00f6tting\u2019s <em>Lek and the Dogs</em> in this paper in 2018, I compared his work (which straddles installations, performances, books, films and music) to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/10/lek-and-the-dogs-review-andrew-kotting\">a steamy midden of ideas</a>\u201d, an earthy concoction into which we are invited to dig deep. His latest offering is more like a dream \u2013 or rather a conjunction of dreams, occupying that liminal space between waking and sleep (\u201chalf one thing, half the other\u201d) where the land meets the sea, past meets present, and lo-fi home-made cinema brushes against something sublime. As with so many of K\u00f6tting\u2019s films, the central conceit involves a journey \u2013 a quest apparently undertaken to restore the titular artefact to the place of its making in the Outer Hebrides, and thereby cure an amorphous \u201cunwellness\u201d. I have no idea how much of what is documented here is \u201ctrue\u201d; suffice to say that it all feels profoundly truthful.</p> <p>We\u2019re told that the whalebone box was made over 30 years ago (\u201cit belonged to another time, another place\u201d) by sculptor Steve Dilworth, who fashioned it from the skeleton of a whale that washed up on the Isle of Harris. Tied with the twine from a herring net, lined with the lead of melted weights, and filled with \u201ccalm water\u201d, the box came into the possession of Iain Sinclair, the author and \u201cpsychogeographer\u201d (\u201ca walker and talker\u201d), who has become a regular K\u00f6tting collaborator. Sinclair called the box his \u201canimal battery\u201d, and for years it sat by his desk while he wrote. But at some point he decided that it should be returned to its home and buried in the sand where the whale was beached. And so, aided by pinhole photographer Anonymous Bosch, Sinclair and K\u00f6tting embarked upon a \u201creversed pilgrimage\u201d to do just that.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You can feel the ghost of Derek Jarman in K\u00f6tting\u2019s work</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Part of <em>The Whalebone Box</em> is a typically fragmented account of that journey, venturing in a chronological fashion from the psychic aerial of Sway Tower in the New Forest to the standing stones of Lewis (via diversions through the Pyrenees), all recorded in a variety of DIY formats, both physical and digital, and interspersed with archive footage, still photography and animation. The other part is a journey into the dreams of Eden K\u00f6tting, the remarkable artist who has long been the muse and inspiration of her father, Andrew. In these sections we find Eden seated like a regal seer in a forest, a gun across her lap, holding a pair of binoculars to search for whales. In her dreams, Eden has fashioned an imitation of the whalebone box, a papery contraption that lacks the physical heft of its namesake. Yet somehow, this dream-box has found its way into the \u201creal\u201d world. Or maybe it\u2019s the other way round?</p> <p>Borrowing intertitles from <em>Leviathan</em> by Philip Hoare (the author who also informs and structures this odyssey), <em>The Whalebone Box </em>muses on familiar themes of folklore, history, mysticism and \u201chappenstance\u201d, as it meanders across disparate landscapes, several journeys becoming one. En route we encounter the graves of Basil Bunting (\u201cPoet of Northern England\u201d) and Sorley MacLean (\u201cPoet of Northern Scotland\u201d), and hear the poet-artist MacGillivray perform her spine-tingling murdered mermaid song in a church, sounding for all the world like a whale out of water, crying plaintively into the abyss. At each stage, the box (in both its incarnations) seems to become heavier, charged with \u201cinsane energy\u201d, carrying the accumulated psychic weight of its journey.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lrefpvpunQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-lrefpvpunQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch a trailer for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=-lrefpvpunQ\">The Whalebone Box</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Thrown into the mix are discussions of other boxes: Pandora\u2019s box; the flight recorders from doomed aeroplanes; the mysterious container from <em>Kiss Me Deadly </em>(\u201cwhat\u2019s in the box?\u201d); the conceptual box in which Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat is simultaneously alive and dead \u2013 a subject that also haunted Carol Morley\u2019s tangentially comparable <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/31/out-of-blue-review-carol-morley-patricia-clarkson-martin-amis\">Out of Blue</a></em>. Beneath it all, an ambient soundtrack ebbs and flows, from low pulsing throbs to rhythmic beats and floating melodies, interspersed with whispered words (\u201cI love you inside out\u201d) and fragments of other movies \u2013 the voiceover from <em>Sunset Boulevard</em>; the trailer for John Carpenter\u2019s <em>The Thing</em>.</p> <p>You can feel the ghost of Derek Jarman in K\u00f6tting\u2019s work: the use of collage; the investigation of memory; the allusions to Shakespeare\u2019s <em>The Tempest</em>; the deconstruction of cinema itself. Yet, <em>The Whalebone Box</em> has something even more personal in its subtle exploration of the bond between father and daughter, an expression of love that had me laughing one moment and crying the next. With such a tender, beating heart, this is in some ways K\u00f6tting\u2019s most unexpectedly accessible work. And, as Eden says more than once in her subtitled voiceover: \u201cIt\u2019s true!\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/the-whalebone-box\">The Whalebone Box is available on Mubi</a></p></li> </ul>",

  "<p><strong>Domaine de Rablais Touraine Sauvignon Blanc, Loire, France 2018 (from \u00a39.76, <a href=\"https://www.woodwinters.com/\">woodwinters.com</a>; <a href=\"https://www.slurp.co.uk/\">slurp.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"https://www.cambridgewine.com/Index.asp\">cambridgewine.com</a>)</strong> It is, of course, somewhere down the list of present anxieties. But there have been times, in these intensely difficult weeks, with our social lives narrowed down to the dimensions of our computer and mobile screens, when it has felt like nature has been taunting us with the gorgeousness of this year\u2019s spring. It\u2019s there just outside the window: the air is thick with it. But we can\u2019t get out and enjoy it. Even under the influence of intense cabin fever, I\u2019m not quite daft enough to think we can recreate the missing joys of spring with a glass of wine. But some wines do at least seem to offer a sense, however fleeting, of spring\u2019s scents and energy. The sauvignon blancs of France\u2019s Central Loire Valley certainly have this effect on me: that combination of sappy grassy greenness, with notes of blossomy white flowers, and an intense freshness and silvery liveliness all very much present in Domaine de la Rablais\u2019 example.</p> <p><strong>Andr\u00e9 Dezat Sancerre Blanc 2018 (from \u00a316.95, <a href=\"https://www.tanners-wines.co.uk/\">tanners-wines.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"https://www.bbr.com/\">bbr.com</a>; <a href=\"https://www.uncorked.co.uk/\">uncorked.co.uk</a>) </strong>Touraine sauvignon, drawn from a wide area of vineyards across the central Loire, is undoubtedly among the best value white wines around right now, with tonic-bringing, bright, zesty own-label expressions available from <a href=\"https://www.aldi.co.uk/\">Aldi</a> (\u00a35.79), <a href=\"https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/\">Sainsbury\u2019s</a> (\u00a37) and <a href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/\">Waitrose</a> (\u00a37.99) all hitting the Loire\u2019s spring source. For extra-levels of graceful, evocative charm, it\u2019s worth seeking out the individual villages, of which Sancerre is the most celebrated. You have to be careful with Sancerre: the vineyards that fan out from the town on its lofty perch are beautiful but the quality is not always as good as the elevated price tag suggests. Like chateauneuf-du-pape down in the Rh\u00f4ne Valley, this is an appellation with rather too many producers trading on the famous name. At their best, however, the wines have a quintessential Loire sauvignon mix of verdant verve and delicate raciness, and the wines produced by Andr\u00e9 Dezat and sons are undoubtedly, consistently in that category.</p> <p><strong>Ch\u00e2teau de Tracy Pouilly-Fum\u00e9 2018 (from \u00a321, <a href=\"https://www.mrwheelerwine.com/\">mrwheelerwine.com</a>; <a href=\"https://www.tanners-wines.co.uk/\">tanners-wines.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"https://www.leaandsandeman.co.uk/\">leaandsandeman.co.uk</a>) </strong>Sancerre\u2019s rival for the greatest producer of Loire sauvignon blanc is Pouilly-Fum\u00e9. Beginner\u2019s in wine are often told that the way to distinguish Pouilly from Sancerre is to look for the distinctive whiff of gun flint \u2013 a smoky smell like someone\u2019s just let off a cap gun. I\u2019ve never been entirely convinced by this: from time to time I do pick up smoky notes in Pouilly-Fum\u00e9, but no more often than I do in other Loire (or indeed, global) sauvignon blancs. Mostly the big differences between the wines of Sancerre and Pouilly-Fum\u00e9 seem to come down more to winemaking style and the precise patch of vineyard the producer is working with. I\u2019ve never reliably been able to tell them apart. What I do know, however, is that the sauvignon blanc of Ch\u00e2teau de Tracy is among my favourites in Pouilly-Fum\u00e9, the Loire, the world \u2026 a wine of evanescent, verdant, spirit-lifting charm.</p> <p><em>Follow David on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveydaibach?lang=en\">@Daveydaibach</a></em></p>",

This one is haunted by the idea that, unless we change our ways, or even if we change our ways, our species does not have much of a future at all. For O\u2019Connell, those fears had been sharpened by recent fatherhood.</p> <p>There are competing voices in his head. One insists, \u201cwe are alive in a time of worst-case scenarios\u2026 Attune your ear to the general discord and you will hear the cracking of the ice caps, the rising of the waters\u2026 Is it not a terrible time to be having children, and therefore in the end, to be alive?\u201d Another voice counters, \u201c[but] when in the scheme of things was it ever a good one?\u201d A third \u2013 generally prompted by his wife \u2013 argues for a bit of perspective: \u201cI was not John of Patmos\u2026 this was a house and people were trying to live in it.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Connell has a gift for channelling the \u201csense of looming crisis\u201d that characterises our times, but is able to step outside it, to bring it into focus. This project began for him toward the end of 2016, that disabling year, when his therapist suggested to him that \u201cit might be helpful not to spend quite so much time following the news\u201d. His response to that suggestion was a kind of personal aversion therapy: he would not shut himself off from the portents of end times that buzz-alerted his phone, but follow them to the ends of the Earth.</p> <p>To this end, he tracked down \u201cpreppers\u201d for apocalypse purchasing bunkers in South Dakota; he listened in to those disciples of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/11/elon-musk-colonise-mars-third-world-war\">Elon Musk</a> who believe our best hope is colonising Mars; he self-isolated in Alladale, the re-wilded retreat in the Highlands of Scotland; and he journeyed to New Zealand, the promised land of doom-harbingers everywhere.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Like Louis Theroux cast in Heart of Darkness, he swims in the pure survivalist waters of Thiel's private lake</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If there is a thread running through these travels, it is that knotted relationship between Silicon Valley plutocrats and our collective unconscious. As O\u2019Connell shows, the billionaires of digital media seem particularly in thrall to a coming apocalypse, and to lavishly self-indulgent strategies to survive it. Perhaps it is because outrageous fortunes give them control-freak dreams of immortality. Perhaps it is because they understand the darker implications of the monsters they have created.</p> <p>O\u2019Connell exposes their schemes with a likable zeal. His journey to the post-apocalypse hideaway of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/15/peter-thiel-silicon-valley-europe-regulation\">Pay</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/15/peter-thiel-silicon-valley-europe-regulation\">Pal founder Peter Thiel</a> is in itself a wonderful piece of journalism, in which he traces Thiel\u2019s obsessions \u2013 with disaster capitalism, cryogenics, surveillance technology, <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> \u2013 to a piece of real estate on New Zealand\u2019s south island. Like Louis Theroux cast in <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, he swims in the pure survivalist waters of Thiel\u2019s private lake. \u201cI was drinking apocalypse water, symbolically reclaiming it for the 99%,\u201d he writes. \u201cIf in that moment I could have drained Lake Wanaka just to fuck up Thiel\u2019s end of the world contingency plan, I might well have done so.\u201d</p> <p>The disaster scenarios the quest is concerned with are mostly the terrors of climate change. Pestilence hardly gets a look-in, although you are occasionally given pause by prophetic allusions to our current circumstance. One surprising voice co-opted into Musk\u2019s belief that we need to colonise Mars as a \u201cbackup planet\u201d is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/18/space-travel-stephen-hawking-plutocrats-branson-bezos-musk\">Stephen Hawking</a>, who argued that \u201cto stay [on Earth] risks annihilation. It could be an asteroid hitting Earth. It could be a new virus\u2026 For humans to survive, I believe we must have the preparations in place within 100 years.\u201d</p> <p>As a premonition of that post-human planet, O\u2019Connell visits the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/apr/10/nuclear-wasteland-inside-chernobyl-exclusion-zone-in-pictures-pripyat-david-mcmillan\">Chernobyl </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/apr/10/nuclear-wasteland-inside-chernobyl-exclusion-zone-in-pictures-pripyat-david-mcmillan\">exclusion </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/apr/10/nuclear-wasteland-inside-chernobyl-exclusion-zone-in-pictures-pripyat-david-mcmillan\">zone</a>. He joins an annual 36,000 tourists on a guided tour of unimaginable catastrophe. What he sees there is less \u201ca barely conceivable tragedy of the very recent past, than a vast diorama of an imagined future, a world in which humans had ceased entirely to exist\u201d. They wander the abandoned town of Pripyat as if it were Pompeii, unearthing children\u2019s drawings in crumbling schoolrooms. Inside a vast unfinished cooling tower next to the Chernobyl plant, he watches a pair of kestrels looping high above and reaches for biblical reference, the \u201cblood-fevered edict of Isaiah\u201d, of the land lying desolate for eternity, \u201ca haunt for jackals, a home for owls\u201d.</p> <p>In some ways, experiencing this abyss, this holy of holies for catastrophists, acts as something of a catharsis for O\u2019Connell. Having looked on these human ruins, he finds himself, counterintuitively, resisting <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46565/ozymandias\">Ozymandias-like despair</a>. What brings him back to life is the birth of his second child, a daughter, who arrives with their home in Dublin in the midst of a \u201cstatus red weather warning\u201d. Her presence, that \u201ctiny engine of joy\u201d she represents, is beautifully evoked by O\u2019Connell, in passages that capture exactly that mixture of impossible vulnerability and responsibility, the enforced mindfulness of new parenthood.</p> <p>The prophet that has provided the most comfort to him in his journey has been Dr Seuss, his son\u2019s hero, and in particular those words from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/23/dr-seuss-lorax-inspired-by-orange-kenyan-monkeys\">The Lorax</a></em>, that indelible primer in apocalypse and its unlikely flipside, hope: \u201cUnless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It\u2019s not.\u201d He picks those words up again here, not in any mawkish way, but as a clear-eyed rejoinder to the implications of what he has witnessed in his three-year odyssey. Among other things, O\u2019Connell is good at dramatising the way we turn things over in our minds.</p> <p>Tentatively, sporadically, he finds he is losing his taste for nihilism, that insistent thrum of doom that shadows social media habits. \u201cLately, I have been glad to be alive in this time, if only because there is no other time in which it is possible to be alive,\u201d he says. O\u2019Connell\u2019s journey to this realisation \u2013 though hugely engaging - does not always make comfortable reading with the world grinding to a halt outside, but he leaves the reader with that word, which offers the gift of making any future possible: \u201cunless\u201d. </p> <p>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://granta.com/products/notes-from-an-apocalypse/\">Notes from an Apocalypse: A Personal Journey to the End of the World and Back</a></em> by Mark O\u2019Connell is published by Granta (\u00a314.99)</p>",

Instead, the machines will be assembled largely by hand at Ford\u2019s Rawsonville Plant in Ypsilanti Township, Michigan, and GM\u2019s Kokomo, Indiana, facility.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98e5dd6d09f841ac1d548ac405d9d60c41ec8728\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98e5dd6d09f841ac1d548ac405d9d60c41ec8728/0_0_3471_2083/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A General Motors assembly worker works on assembling a V6 engine last year.

Similarly, when it isn\u2019t idled, Ford\u2019s 1.7m-sq-ft Rawsonville plant produces components such as transmission oil pumps, battery packs, and air induction systems.</p> <p>The companies are utilizing those facilities because they are where \u201ca bunch of smaller parts arrive, then are assembled into larger parts\u201d, said Mark Schirmer, public relations director with Cox Automotive. \u201cThey\u2019re then shipped to the assembly plants to be installed in vehicles on the large assembly lines.\u201d</p> <p>The process for manufacturing ventilators is similar, he added.</p> <p>\u201cImagine someone at a desk putting together a complex puzzle or model by hand \u2013 lots of small-part assembly,\u201d Schirmer said, adding that the real challenge was \u201cgetting all the necessary parts together in one place for workers to assemble them\u201d.</p> <p>More than 700 parts compose the VOCSN critical care ventilators that GM is partnering with Seattle-based Ventec Life Systems to produce in Kokomo, and the automaker has tapped more than 100 suppliers to feed components. The ventilators are sought after by hospitals because they are five-in-one, portable machines with critical care ventilators, oxygen concentrators, cough assistance, suction and nebulizers.</p> <p>By contrast, Ford is producing a simple ventilator design, which will be licensed by GE Healthcare from Florida-based Airon and operate on air pressure instead of electricity. Ford and GE designers have essentially stripped down a machine used for anesthesia that functions as a ventilator.</p> <p>Aside from sourcing components from suppliers, Ford is repurposing parts that are \u201cuseful in production of other items\u201d, its chief executive, Jim Hackett, recently told CBS This Morning.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going into our parts bins to see what can be done,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Concurrently, the automakers are helping boost production at their partners\u2019 facilities \u2013 Ventec currently produces about 200 ventilators monthly, and GM is using its suppliers and logistical team to help the company push out about 10 times that figure. Meanwhile, Ford said it was helping ramp up GE\u2019s capacity.</p> <p>Labor is perhaps the easiest challenge for the companies to solve, partly because ventilator production is not a labor-intensive job. Cox said it had found one of the nation\u2019s largest ventilator manufacturers only had about 10,000 employees worldwide.</p> <p>Automakers are asking United Auto Workers employees to volunteer to work in three shifts. Ford said it would need about 500 employees, while GM is staffing Kokomo with about 1,000.</p> <p>\u201cIf this does move forward as promoted, it won\u2019t be like world war two when automotive plants were changed over to produce tanks, planes and plane engines,\u201d Schirmer said.</p> <p>The effort got a boost when Donald Trump invoked the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/trump-defense-production-act-coronavirus-gm\">Defense Production Act</a> \u2013 wartime legislation that will allow automakers to avoid certain patent issues and provides the president with the ability to compel companies to prioritize government orders over those of other clients.</p> <p>As he announced the measure, Trump also criticized GM over the ventilators\u2019 price. However, both automakers have said they won\u2019t profit off of the project. Ventec\u2019s ventilators can cost about $18,000 each, far cheaper than the more sophisticated models, which can run up to $50,000.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/global-battle-coronavirus-equipment-masks-tests\">Spies, hijacks and export bans: the global battle for coronavirus equipment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The federal government is also accommodating automakers by waiving Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rules to allow non-medical manufacturers to quickly produce the devices.

  "<p>As a classical scholar, our prime minister will be all too aware of some uncanny parallels between the onset of coronavirus and the plague that beset Athens in 430BC.</p> <p>The immortal historian Thucydides wrote: \u201cAt the beginning the doctors were quite incapable of treating the disease because of their ignorance of the right methods \u2026 In fact, mortality among the doctors was the highest of all since they came more frequently in contact with the sick.\u201d</p> <p>Again: \u201cAmong the symptoms were sneezing and hoarseness of voice, and before long the pain settled on the chest and was accompanied by coughing.\u201d</p> <p>Sound familiar? The plague struck just after the Athenians\u2019 leader, Pericles, delivered his great funeral oration over the dead from the war against Sparta. Alas, Pericles himself died of the plague, and not long after Athens\u2019s glory was in decline.</p> <p>Most historians would no doubt say that Britain\u2019s glory days began their decline after the second world war. But one of the lessons from that war was that, well before it ended, the coalition government under Conservative prime minister Winston Churchill and Labour deputy prime minister Clement Attlee was planning for the aftermath.</p> <p>One of the main things on Attlee\u2019s mind was that the poor social conditions of the interwar years should not be experienced again. Central to postwar planning was the formation of the NHS under the first Attlee administration of 1945-50, which was set up, amid fierce resistance from the medical profession, by Aneurin Bevan in 1948.</p> <p>There was no NHS in ancient Athens, and there is no NHS in the United States. To put it another way: we have a health service, they have a health sector. That is an important reason why, for all the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/absolutely-wrong-how-uk-coronavirus-test-strategy-unravelled?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\" title=\"\">well-publicised mishandling of this crisis in the UK</a>, the US, still the mightiest economy in the world, seems to be in for an even bigger shock from the virus than we are experiencing.</p> <p>At this point \u2013 as one who was born a year before the outbreak of the 1939-45 war \u2013 I hope readers will forgive me if I point to an important difference in the dangers to the general public between then and now. Thus I confess that my initial inclination when asked what I felt personally about the virus \u2013 as opposed to thoughts about the disturbing political and economic implications \u2013 was to say something like: \u201cThis is nothing like watching flying bombs overhead, listening as their engines switched off, and hoping they didn\u2019t land on you.\u201d In fact one did land on the church at the end of our road and shattered our windows while we were safe in the Anderson shelter in the garden.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The end of capitalism? I doubt it. The Tories suddenly becoming fully paid-up Keynesians? For how long, I wonder</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The awful thing about this plague is that it is more like the Athenian one 2,500 years ago or the Spanish flu of 1918. It doesn\u2019t fly in or explode, it just hits people unawares \u2013 that is to say, we are aware of the danger, but don\u2019t know if or when it will hit. A timely reminder of the horrors of germ warfare.</p> <p>In common with most of the population, I feel as if I am under house arrest. But when I hear and read so many comments about \u201cdraconian\u201d conditions, my classical background comes back to me. There is a breed of historians who say that the common understanding of the epithet \u201cdraconian\u201d is a misrepresentation, and that Draco wasn\u2019t that bad: he merely codified existing civic practices.</p> <p>On the other hand, let\u2019s face it: in ancient Athens, Draco prescribed the death penalty for petty theft \u2013 even of cabbages, if you please. According to Plutarch, this produced the memorable comment that \u201chis laws were written not in ink but in blood\u201d.</p> <p>So frankly, in the circumstances, I do not regard being asked to take precautions about the threat to my own and other people\u2019s health \u2013 indeed, lives \u2013 as draconian. </p> <p>But back to the economy. The unemployment and bankruptcy news is horrendous, and likely to get worse before it gets better.</p> <p>There will be plenty of time in the coming months to examine the implications. But at this stage I should just issue a health warning (sorry) against taking some of the instant conclusions too seriously. The end of capitalism? I doubt it. The Conservative and Brexit party suddenly repenting of 10 years of austerity and becoming fully paid-up Keynesians? For how long, I wonder.</p> <p>Finally, why are we in this mess? Could it possibly be anything to do with the fact that during 10 years of austerity, public spending on health was budgeted to rise by 1% a year at most (in real terms \u2013 that is, after inflation) whereas all the professionals knew that it needed to rise by 4% a year merely to cope with the pressures of an ageing population and, especially, the cost of technological advance?</p> <p>And could it also possibly be because this government\u2019s crazed obsession with Brexit means that it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/uk-discussed-joint-eu-plan-to-buy-covid-19-medical-supplies-say-officials\" title=\"\">shut itself out of the joint ordering of vital medical supplies</a> with the 27 members of the European Union?

I get this impression that he thinks he has been driven by fate.\u201d</p> <p>This quiet sense of destiny and \u201cinnate hunger\u201d, Trickett said, seemed to affect much that Starmer did, and how he behaved. \u201cOne of the things I have noticed about Keir is that you can be walking through the Commons, or wherever it is, with him in a reasonably comradely way and then, suddenly, he would end up two strides ahead. It is just how he is.\u201d</p> <p>Yesterday the Surrey-raised 57-year-old son of a toolmaker and a nurse, who named their son after the party\u2019s first parliamentary leader, Keir Hardie, emerged not just strides<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/04/labour-gives-keir-starmer-strong-mandate-to-face-battles-ahead\"> but miles in front of his two rivals</a>, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy, from the long contest to succeed Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/the-corbyn-project-is-over-but-keir-starmer-still-needs-the-left\">The Corbyn project is over, but Keir Starmer still needs the left</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The brilliant human rights lawyer who rose to become director of public prosecutions aged 45 in 2008 has only been an MP since 2015. But in a deeply divided party he managed to sweep up 56.2% of the vote, leaving Long-Bailey and Nandy way behind, on 27.6% and 16.2% respectively. Importantly, Starmer won a mandate across the board, winning the biggest share of the vote among MPs, members and affiliates.</p> <p>Many among Starmer\u2019s own supporters and within his campaign team, who tied him ruthlessly and repetitively to messages about unity during more than 40 hustings, had thought early on that it would be a much closer fight.</p> <p>Some believed he would appear too \u201clawyerly\u201d and wooden, while others feared that the left\u2019s candidate Long-Bailey, MP for Salford and Eccles, would be propelled to victory by the pro-Corbyn organisation Momentum, which had the vital data on many of the 500,000 party members from the last two contests in 2015 and 2016. Another danger, his backers believed, was that Starmer, a London MP and star barrister with a square jaw and smart suits, would be seen in the Labour heartlands as another Blairite in left-wing clothing.</p> <p>But as it turned out, the left who had wanted Long-Bailey to win, including her union backers, fell out among themselves about how to carry Corbynism forward amid the post-general election acrimony, and her campaign never really took off. It was also not entirely clear how much she wanted the job and whether she felt forced against her better instincts to carry the torch for the Corbynistas.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People wanted someone who could win,  someone professional \u2013 this came up a lot \u2013 and capable of governing</p> <footer> <cite>Starmer supporter</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cShe went missing for the first four weeks of the campaign, which made everyone think she was wobbling, and when it started it was pretty much a disaster. By that time Starmer was miles ahead,\u201d said one of her early backers. While Nandy impressed and won admirers, the MP for Wigan started too far behind, and was viewed as less tried and tested than Starmer.</p> <p>With the party shattered by its worst defeat since 1935, when the rebuilding process began, it was not ideological purity, flamboyance, or someone young and new that members across the Labour divide wanted \u2013 but someone reassuring and competent who they could see taking on and outshining Boris Johnson. And Starmer fitted the bill.</p> <p>Prominent names on the left such as Laura Parker, a former senior official in Corbyn\u2019s office and a former national organiser of Momentum, chose Starmer and was followed by many other Momentumites.</p> <p>Parker, who had seen him operate in Labour\u2019s Brexit sub-committee, said Starmer was \u201ctenacious, forensic, diligent, intelligent\u201d. His focus, determination and mastery of detail is something everyone who knows him observes. Importantly for Parker he had also, since the election, put forward a left-wing programme that for her was entirely credible, allowing her to feel it was a natural switch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/from-attlee-to-blair-what-starmer-can-learn-from-four-labour-leaders\">From Attlee to Blair: what Starmer can learn from four Labour leaders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe can seem cautious but the other side of that is that you feel you can believe the words that come out of his mouth,\u201d Parker said. \u201cHe has said there will be no rolling back from a radical programme \u2013 and I, like others who supported Corbyn, backed him on the basis of the policy commitments he had in his 10 pledges.\u201d</p> <p>One of Starmer\u2019s supporters who manned phone banks for him said Momentum members came over in droves. \u201cYou could just hear them peeling off on the phone. They wanted someone who could win, people wanted someone professional \u2013 this came up a lot \u2013 and capable of governing as well as leading an effective opposition. They trusted him to do both. There is only a relatively small hardcore of the membership who think that ideological purity is more important than winning.\u201d</p> <p>Starmer\u2019s supporters deny that his campaign had been long in the planning. But he has been very careful in his five years in parliament not to make political enemies either at Westminster or in his Holborn and St Pancras constituency party \u2013 and to shore up support against potential challenges from the local left.</p> <p>Trickett, shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, suggests Starmer deliberately avoided being associated with trouble-making factions in the parliamentary party, even when it was riven by disagreements over Brexit policy, which he was in charge of from 2016 until the election. \u201cI am not aware that he had allegiances really, other than ones for temporary convenience.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"13d4e5b85c6604ee57c069f4a737b8bbe51b28dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13d4e5b85c6604ee57c069f4a737b8bbe51b28dd/0_0_3955_2644/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Starmer with leadership rivals Rebecca Long-Bailey, left, and Lisa Nandy, centre, at SEC in Glasgow in February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Starmer with leadership rivals Rebecca Long-Bailey, left, and Lisa Nandy, centre, at SEC in Glasgow in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Perry/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In fact his energy seems to have been spent on avoiding factionalism at every turn. In local Labour politics it was the same. Sally Gimson, an activist in Holborn and St Pancras, says that even when he was handling the Brexit brief in the shadow cabinet, Starmer had \u201cnever been too grand to come to the smallest fundraiser or support a tiny community group\u201d.</p> <p>Lawyer Patrick Stevens, who was international director at the Crown Prosecution Service when Starmer was there, noticed the same approach when working with him before he entered politics: \u201cHe made sure he knew every person in my team from me to the most junior official and they all felt able to call him Keir. It was how he worked. In his first year at the DPP he went to every single one of its offices around the country and made sure he talked to everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Starmer\u2019s upbringing in Oxted no doubt shaped his views from a very early age. His mother was disabled and had to give up work because of a rare auto-immune disorder. He remembers spending many long nights with her at the local hospital.</p> <p>The young Keir was the only one of the four Starmer siblings to pass the 11-plus, which meant he could go on to Reigate grammar school. One of his contemporaries was Andrew Cooper, founder of the Populus polling organisation, who has memories of him as a popular and clubbable boy. \u201cHe was not brilliant in class, but near the top. What I remember of him does not quite fit with his public image now as slightly dull. He was very popular. He was often the one at the centre of the crowd telling the jokes.\u201d</p> <p>Starmer\u2019s more recent friends support Cooper\u2019s view, insisting he can be the life and soul of a party. \u201cHe has got lots of friends. He is a huge Arsenal fan,\u201d says Patrick Stevens. \u201cHe goes with the same group of his mates to a pub off the Holloway Road before every match. Keir also organises five-a-side games every Sunday and Monday. He sends out the texts and collects the subs.\u201d Asked about his playing abilities Stevens added: \u201cHe is a midfield general ... with a silky left foot.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/party-factions-antisemitism-and-a-global-pandemic-keir-starmers-in-tray\">Party factions, antisemitism \u2026 and a global pandemic: Keir Starmer's in-tray</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Starmer studied law at Leeds University, where he took a first before graduating from St Edmund Hall, Oxford, as a bachelor of law. He was called to the bar in 1987.</p> <p>As a barrister at Doughty Street chambers, he took on a string of high-profile human rights cases, including the defendants in the \u201cMcLibel\u201d case in 1997, which he worked on \u201cpro bono\u201d for 11 years.</p> <p>Mark Stephens, a lawyer who instructed him on many such cases before Starmer was appointed DPP, said: \u201cHe had a Rolls-Royce mind and a way to apply that mind that was wonderful to watch. There was never anything showy about him. He quietly got on with cases because he believed in what he was doing. If he had gone to the commercial bar, he would I think already be on the court of appeal and knocking at the door of the supreme court, if not already a shoo-in.\u201d</p> <p>After becoming an MP in 2015 Starmer was appointed to the front bench by Corbyn to be in charge of immigration before resigning over Corbyn\u2019s leadership in 2016. Despite this he was reappointed to the front bench as shadow Brexit secretary in 2016. While the eventual Brexit position which the party put to voters in December last year was a messy compromise, it was not for lack of effort on Starmer\u2019s part. He had wanted a clearer commitment to Remain and a second referendum but had been unable to win the day with those around Corbyn.</p> <p>As he embarks on his leadership and begins to appoint his shadow cabinet today, it will not be Brexit that will preoccupy Starmer but rather Labour\u2019s approach to the coronavirus pandemic. The new leader has won a handsome mandate from a party that has placed its trust in his forensic, tenacious approach to politics and the crises it throws up. The current crisis could hardly be bigger.</p> <p>In his statement yesterday, Starmer said: \u201cWhether we voted for this government or not, we all rely on it to get this right. That\u2019s why in the national interest the Labour party will play its full part.\u201d The coming weeks will be a test like no other in his hitherto glittering career.</p>",
  "<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/keir-starmer-won-over-shell-shocked-labour-party\">How \u2018tenacious, diligent\u2019 Keir Starmer won over a shell-shocked party</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Covid-19</h2> <p>The coronavirus crisis is all all-consuming and will be Starmer\u2019s immediate focus. When to criticise the government, and how hard, will be a delicate political judgment \u2013 calls for a change of course, or an inquiry, will need to be carefully timed. The Brexit debate showed Starmer was at his lawyerly best when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/20/brexit-boris-johnson-eu-deal-delay-live-news\">putting ministers under pressure </a>over the fine detail of their plans \u2013 a quality now greatly needed. Yet there are competing pressures. Elsewhere in the world, opposition figures have struggled to make any impact as the outbreak has developed, which will create pressure for bolder interventions. A balancing act.</p> <h2>The economy</h2> <p>After years of disagreements since 2010, most in Labour had become united on a broad rejection of austerity and a demand on the rich to pay more tax. Starmer had accepted key Corbyn tax pledges from the 2019 manifesto. However, the costs of the coronavirus will shake up the debate and force Starmer into difficult decisions. How to pay for the fallout is not a topic of great discussion now, but it will cause problems for both main parties. The degree and speed with which Starmer proposes to repair the public finances will be highly contentious and risks opening up tensions with Labour\u2019s left.</p> <h2>Party machinery</h2> <p>During the current leader\u2019s reign, the party\u2019s left has been successful in occupying key posts and winning a majority on its powerful national executive committee. Control of the party machinery has always been critical in Labour\u2019s internal politics, and many Labour MPs are keen to see Starmer clear out the party\u2019s HQ, including the current general secretary Jennie Formby, a close ally of Corbyn and Unite union boss, Len McCluskey. However, any immediate clearout would be seen as an act of war by the left and undermine Starmer\u2019s plea for unity.</p> <h2>Antisemitism inquiry</h2> <p>Starmer will need to work out a response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/equality-body-launches-investigation-of-labour-antisemitism-claims\">antisemitism inquiry</a> undertaken by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The issue has seriously damaged Labour\u2019s reputation among Jewish voters and beyond. While it will be a difficult moment for the party, Starmer\u2019s initial response will be quite simple \u2013 accept the report and its recommendations. He has already pledged to toughen party rules on antisemitism. The more difficult issue will be to what extent he reprimands anyone singled out in the inquiry and still employed by Labour.</p> <h2>Shadow cabinet</h2> <p>Starmer\u2019s first shadow cabinet will be a key early decision and reveal the extent to which he wants to change course or carry on with Corbyn\u2019s team. John McDonnell and Diana Abbott are both<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/john-mcdonnell-will-not-return-to-shadow-cabinet-labour\"> stepping down</a>, but what of other Corbyn allies such as Ian Lavery and Richard Burgon? And will Starmer opt to bring back big hitters like Yvette Cooper and Rachel Reeves, or leave them overseeing select committees? Will Corbyn be offered a new post, perhaps party president?

We do not believe that this is necessary. We\u2019ve demonstrated that it is not necessary.\u201d</p> <p>McManus pointed to recent changes to modern awards that had been put through the Fair Work Commission over the last couple of weeks, and covered millions of workers, as an example of how measures could be reached through cooperation rather than legislation.</p> <p>She noted that not every award or enterprise agreement needed to change because some industries were doing well at the current time because of increased demand.</p> <p>McManus raised concern that in some sectors, employers might \u201cabuse\u201d or \u201ctake advantage\u201d of changes to the Fair Work Act and called on Labor, the Greens and crossbenchers to oppose such provisions.</p> <p>Unions are worried that some employers may take advantage of provisions allowing them to direct workers to run down their existing leave entitlements.</p> <p>Labor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/jobkeeper-loophole-could-leave-millions-of-employees-without-leave-entitlements-labor-warns\">raised similar concerns last week</a>, saying if employees were forced to exhaust their leave entitlements, the new $1,500 fortnightly payment may be transformed from a \u201cwage subsidy\u201d for employees into a \u201cbalance sheet subsidy\u201d that benefits employers.</p> <p>Porter said he would share drafts of the legislation with the ACTU and work through the details \u201cin a cooperative, open, frank and honest way\u201d.</p> <p>But he argued that failing to provide certainty through changes to the Fair Work Act could lead to additional job losses.</p> <p>\u201cWe will not be waiting or hoping that this change can be effected over the coming weeks or months by changing 121 awards and thousands of individual enterprise agreements,\u201d Porter said.</p> <p>\u201cNo matter how late we have to sit, the change will be happening next Wednesday: 6m Australian jobs depend on it. Next Wednesday, we are pushing a $130bn lifeboat out into the roughest economic seas Australia has ever seen and people will need to decide whether or not they\u2019re going to help us push the boat out.\u201d</p> <p>The government also confirmed the special measures to be put in place to allow parliament to sit on Wednesday amid the current health crisis.</p> <p>There are expected to be 47 \u201cpair\u201d arrangements in the House of Representatives, which would allow many MPs to be absent. Just 30 government MPs and 21 opposition MPs are likely to attend the lower house. Most of the crossbench MPs are likely to attend. Question time will be at 2pm as usual.</p> <p>Porter, who is also leader of the house, said special purpose aircraft from the Royal Australian Air Force would assist in transporting MPs to and from Canberra, because of the lack of commercial flights. He indicated parliamentarians would comply with travel and border rules imposed by their states.</p> <p>The manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, called on the government to schedule regular sittings of parliament - in this limited attendance form - to provide ongoing scrutiny and fix inevitable errors in drafting.</p> <p>\u201cAt a time of crisis, when the Australian people need us to get this right, the parliament meeting is more important than ever, and to think that after Wednesday we will not have to come back until August 11 is absurd,\u201d Burke said.</p>",

In another life, 36-year-old Azam is a full-time barrister practising in family law, a married father of two and a school governor.

In his day job, heading up the staff kitchen at the Dorchester, he prepares an average of 900 meals for the lunch and dinner service.

Over half the school is entitled to free school meals, and 72 pupils are on the child protection register. At the moment, anywhere between 12 and 20 children are coming in every day, with Manorfield operating as a hub for neighbouring schools.</p> <p>With help from the Dorchester and the local authority, Jackson is now working on a scheme to get hot meals and food parcels delivered to vulnerable local families throughout the Easter holidays: \u201cIt\u2019s a way for us to feel useful \u2013 you don\u2019t notice the stress of everything until you\u2019re out of here. One thing is certain: even when things change, school meals here will never be the same again. The standards have been changed for ever.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Glasgow<br></strong>It began, as lockdown ideas now often do, over Whatsapp. Disheartened by the gloom shrouding Glasgow, jewellery maker Freya Alder got chatting to her friends \u2013 illustrator Isabella Burnell and textile designer Ruth Mitchell \u2013 about ways to lift the collective mood. The three launched the <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/makers-raffle\">Maker\u2019s Raffle</a> two weeks ago with pieces donated by a dozen Scottish ceramicists, potters, textile designers and printmakers, hoping to match the \u00a31,500 Alder had raised in December for Glasgow South East Foodbank.</p> <p>\u201cAfter the general election, I felt a huge sense of doom and powerlessness. Going to the Co-op the morning after and putting some stuff in the food bank made me feel infinitely better, which is where the idea was born,\u201d says Alder. The response this time round, however, has floored her.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Makers are uncomfortable trying to sell their wares when they know people are stretched thin, but this is a gesture anyone can join in.</p> <footer> <cite>Freya Alder, fundraiser</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI did a little callout but people have been amazing.

The trio have raised just over \u00a37,000 so far to help the most needy, with two more weeks left to go before the raffle is drawn. \u201cIt would be fun to hand over a big cheque at the end,\u201d says Alder, \u201cbut in practical terms, the food bank needs the money now so it\u2019s being sent over in weekly payments.\u201d</p> <p>Despite a significant loss of income for many of the one-person businesses trying to weather the current crisis, Alder reports that \u201cit\u2019s made us all feel better, I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s been so successful. Makers are uncomfortable trying to sell their wares when they know people are stretched thin, but this is a tiny little gesture anyone can join in.\u201d</p> <p>Tickets are \u00a32. Alder\u2019s hope is that communities in other cities will copy the model to support food banks, which are desperate for donations nationwide. \u201cEvery city has a creative scene, and if every city did one of these it could make so much money for people who need it most,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",
  "<p>It is a terrible thing to see a disaster in the making and be unable to prevent it. Yet this is the prospect confronting us if we dare to look beyond the walls and parapets of a Britain besieged by the coronavirus invader. Tens of millions of people in poorer, less developed countries across the world face a looming catastrophe that appears as unstoppable as it is potentially lethal.</p> <p>The moment has not quite arrived. But an axe is poised to <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-31/coronavirus-countries-infection-rates-most-vulnerable/12085816\">fall on untold numbers</a> of largely defenceless heads, a massacre almost too appalling to contemplate. As the relatively wealthy countries of the northern hemisphere engage in a noisy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-the-week-explained\">struggle to repulse</a> Covid-19, alarm bells are ringing from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/india-coronavirus-cases-rise-amid-fears-true-figure-much-higher\">south Asia</a> to the Middle East and <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/02/africa-coronavirus-pandemic-violence-confusion/\">Africa</a>. Mostly they have not yet been heard.</p> <p>Anybody who has experienced the densely populated slums of Mumbai, Dhaka or Port-au-Prince knows how impossible are the concepts of social distancing and self-isolation for many of their inhabitants. Those who have seen the conditions in refugee camps in and around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/fears-over-hidden-covid-19-outbreak-in-lebanon-iraq-and-syria\">Syria</a> or Somalia know how limited are the health facilities there, even at the best of times.</p> <p>The World Health Organization has reported that at least half of the world\u2019s population did not have access to essential medical care even before the pandemic struck. As the global equality charity Plan International Australia has ominously warned, many in these communities, particularly children, suffer from serious underlying conditions such as malaria, tuberculosis and malnutrition.</p> <p>People living in conflict zones are doubly vulnerable. If you are an inhabitant of Idlib, for example, there is a good chance that any attempt to follow advice, stay at home and stay safe will be disrupted by a Russian or Syrian regime bombing raid. That\u2019s one reason why Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, has called for a <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1059972\">global ceasefire</a> in the face of \u201cour common enemy\u201d. There is scant evidence that his plea is being heeded.</p> <p>The UN has also warned that people in countries whose wellbeing has been damaged by unilateral sanctions, such as Venezuela, Zimbabwe and Cuba, could suffer disproportionately from the spread of coronavirus. This is already the case in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-52118809\">Iran</a>. All such sanctions should be <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-un-sanctions/lift-sanctions-on-iran-north-korea-venezuela-in-coronavirus-crisis-un-rights-expert-idUSKBN21I2N7\">lifted immediately</a>, said the UN\u2019s Hilal Elver, to help avoid virus-related food shortages. If the Trump administration heard her call, it has done little about it.</p> <p>Food insecurity is a growing worry in sub-Saharan Africa, notably the Sahel region. If the disease takes hold there, the <a href=\"https://www.wfp.org/news/number-hungry-people-spikes-central-sahel-covid-19-looms\">World Food Programme</a> says, vital humanitarian supply chains in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger could be further disrupted at a time when millions already face summer food shortages caused by drought and jihadist violence.</p> <p>From war-scarred Afghanistan to the impoverished Central African Republic, where the <a href=\"https://www.nrc.no/news/2020/march/just-three-ventilators-to-cope-with-covid-19-in-central-african-republic/\">Norwegian Refugee Council says</a> there are three ventilators for five million people, fear of imminent disaster is compounded by a chronic lack of resources. And any responses to Covid-19 will be further hampered by unresolved political and security issues left to fester for years.</p> <p>Gaza is a case in point. Two million Palestinians are crammed into an area of 365 sq km. According to the International Crisis Group, cases of coronavirus have been identified. Now <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/26/paleastinians-brace-coronavirus-outbreak-gaza-strip-covid/\">Gaza is preparing</a> for the worst. \u201cA major outbreak would swiftly overwhelm Gaza\u2019s healthcare system, which has been devastated by years of war and Israeli blockade. The death toll could be horrific,\u201d the ICG said last week.</p> <p>The potential economic impact on the developing world is also a matter of huge concern. Low- and middle-income countries have already been hurt by falling export demand, lower oil prices and a collapse in tourism. Nearly <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/03/23/pr2098-imf-managing-director-statement-following-a-g20-ministerial-call-on-the-coronavirus-emergency\">80 governments have asked</a> for emergency IMF funding, with one estimate suggesting a total bailout of at least \u00a32tn may be necessary.</p> <p>The resilience of vulnerable states suffering anticipated shocks of such unprecedented social and economic severity is greatly limited when compared, for example, with wealthier nations such as Britain that can call on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-rishi-sunak-announces-330bn-bailout-package-for-businesses-video\">unlimited borrowing</a>. Lasting, possibly permanent pandemic-related damage increases the risk of social disorder and state violence, as seen in South Africa.</p> <p>The incidence of Covid-19 in large swaths of Africa, south Asia and Latin America remains limited for now. But there is every reason to believe a virus that has ravaged and humbled the world\u2019s two biggest economies - the US and China - will eventually spread infection to all corners of the globe.</p> <p>It is not entirely true to say there is nothing we can do but watch. Governments and individuals should support the UN and its agencies; boost foreign aid budgets; donate to international charities; share expertise; offer refuge and succour; and, wherever possible, provide vital medical equipment \u2013 all this and more can and must be done. Covid-19 is a universal nightmare, a truly global crisis. All its victims without exception deserve help, wherever they live. If efforts to control the virus in the developing world fail, the human toll could be indescribable. And the disease could become endemic, repeatedly rebounding and recycling through migration, human contacts and second- or third-wave pandemics. It does not bear thinking about.</p>",

But with the race for the nomination effectively in a state of suspended animation amid the coronavirus pandemic, the 78-year-old Vermont senator has resisted.</p> <p>Covid-19 has ravaged the US economy and strained the healthcare system, claiming more than<a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\"> 7,000 </a>lives and nearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economy\">10m</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economy\"> jobs</a>. The twin economic and public health crises give what Sanders and allies have described as a new imperative to his calls for universal healthcare and a wide expansion of the social safety net.</p> <p>\u201cIn many ways, this pandemic has made the case for a lot of the policies that the senator has spent 35 years fighting for,\u201d said Anna Bahr, a spokeswoman for the Sanders campaign. \u201cReality has endorsed Bernie Sanders.\u201d</p> <p>Since stepping off the physical campaign trail, Sanders has turned his focus almost entirely to the coronavirus pandemic, a crisis he said is on the \u201cscale of a major war\u201d. In glitchy media interviews from his home in Vermont, the senator has argued that the US would be better prepared \u2013 and more resilient \u2013 in the face of a future pandemic if his policy agenda were already in place.</p> <p>But his continued presence in the race has alarmed many Democrats, haunted by the fallout from a divisive primary four years ago they believe contributed to Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat by Donald Trump. Sanders, they contend, had a year to make the case for his political revolution and should now bow out and help unify the party.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fantasy to say there is some path for Bernie Sanders to win this nomination,\u201d Jay Jacobs, chairman of the New York party. \u201cIf he stays in this race, Bernie Sanders is doing it for one reason and one reason alone and unfortunately it\u2019s for Bernie Sanders.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb3da29e6533e4e60d572c288fecc605af69fb70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb3da29e6533e4e60d572c288fecc605af69fb70/0_86_1603_961/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders greet each other with a safe elbow bump before the start of the 11th Democratic presidential debate on 15 March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders greet each other with a safe elbow bump before the start of the 11th Democratic presidential debate on 15 March 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Enough debates\u2019</h2> <p>Sanders has sent conflicting signals.</p> <p>On the one hand, he has acknowledged Biden\u2019s daunting lead. Yet he insists there is a path to the nomination, albeit a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/late-night-with-seth-meyers/video/bernie-sanders/4140672\">narrow\u201d</a> one.</p> <p>After a dismal showing last month, the campaign <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/bernie-sanders-weighs-future-after-losses-to-joe-biden-11584544419\">deactivated</a> its digital ads while pausing spending on TV ads. Days later, the campaign announced it was <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/03/24/bernie-sanders-will-stay-in-2020-race-until-new-york-primary/\">ramping up</a> digital organizing ahead of the New York primary, the most delegate-rich contest left. New York has since postponed from 28 April to 23 June.</p> <p>Sanders recently said he would welcome a debate in April, an idea Biden dismissed.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had enough debates,\u201d the former vice-president said.</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 allies are split. Some have said it\u2019s time to exit while others believe he should continue to compete. On Saturday, the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/some-top-sanders-advisers-urge-him-to-consider-withdrawing/2020/04/04/224d8164-767f-11ea-85cb-8670579b863d_story.html\">reported</a> that a group of top aides, including his campaign manager, had encouraged Sanders to withdraw. But many supporters believe the senator should continue collecting delegates, which will serve as leverage to shape the party platform at the national convention.</p> <p>\u201cCampaigns are an important way to maintain that fight and raise public consciousness on those issues,\u201d Sanders <a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/late-night-with-seth-meyers/video/sen-bernie-sanders-talks-about-the-2020-race-and-vice-president-joe-biden/4141900\">said</a> on NBC\u2019s Late Night with Seth Meyers on Tuesday. \u201cSo that\u2019s, I think, one of the arguments for going forward.\u201d</p> <p>Biden has largely avoided pressuring Sanders, well aware he will need support in the fall if he is the nominee. But he\u2019s not waiting for Sanders either. In recent weeks, Biden has begun making overtures to progressives and young voters. In a fundraising call on Friday night, Biden revealed that he had spoken to Sanders about his search for a running mate.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a friend,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m being presumptuous but you have to start now deciding who you\u2019re going to have background checks done on as potential vice-presidential candidates and it takes time.\u201d</p> <p>Like Biden, Sanders has been sharply critical of Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. But they diverge on how they would harness the federal government to respond to a future pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cOur healthcare is without equal in the developed world in being dysfunctional and unfair and expensive,\u201d said Wendell Potter, former head of communications at Cigna who is now president of Business for Medicare for All. \u201cAnd I think this experience is going to bring into sharp focus how bad we are in terms of providing healthcare.\u201d</p> <p>As the crisis deepens, support for a single-payer system has climbed. In a <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2020/04/01/medicare-for-all-coronavirus-pandemic/\">survey</a> this month by Morning Consult, support for Medicare for All rose to 55%, its highest point since June 2019. From February to March, net support for Sanders\u2019 sweeping healthcare proposal nearly doubled from 11 points to 20 points.</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 advocacy has not moved his rival. Biden was recently pressed on MSNBC to explain why universal healthcare isn\u2019t a better option as millions of Americans stand to lose coverage in the coming months, a shift in the way questions about the sweeping proposal are typically framed.</p> <p>\u201cSingle-payer will not solve that at all,\u201d Biden replied. He said overhauling the US healthcare system would take too long and advocated instead for expanding the Affordable Care Act.</p> <p>In recent weeks, the Sanders campaign has stopped actively fundraising and instead leveraged its extensive donor list to raise money for charities helping Americans suffering from the outbreak. His team has surveyed supporters for ideas on how Congress can provide economic relief, circulated petitions demanding protective equipment and safety protections for Amazon and Walmart workers, and even adapted its digital organizing app, Bern, to help connect users with resources and aid.</p> <p>Sanders frequently hosts roundtable discussions. On one occasion he sought to channel a wartime president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, hosting a fireside chat.</p> <p>The campaign says it raised more than $4.5m for the charities and more than 14 million people have viewed its livestreams.</p> <p>Sander has also used his perch in the Senate to influence the debate over the response to the crisis. When three Republican senators objected to a provision in the $2tn rescue package that expanded unemployment insurance, Sanders threatened to block the bill unless they dropped their opposition.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God, the universe is collapsing!\u201d he said, mocking their concern that the bill might give some struggling Americans extra financial support in a time of crisis. \u201cOh my word, will the universe survive?\u201d</p> <p>The recovery package, the largest ever in American history, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\">passed</a> unanimously.</p> <p>On Friday, Sanders released a slate of priorities for the next stimulus package that his campaign touted as \u201cthe boldest legislation ever written in modern history\u201d.</p> <p>They include monthly cash payments of $2,000 monthly to all individuals, including undocumented immigrants, a freeze on rent and mortgage payments, hazard pay for essential workers and using Medicare to pay all medical costs incurred during the pandemic.</p> <p>The plan is almost certainly a nonstarter in a Republican-controlled Senate wary of expanding federal relief beyond what was included in the last package.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3282a51b2d0b82c0ead7bc34bb98a8038d2d9971\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3282a51b2d0b82c0ead7bc34bb98a8038d2d9971/0_73_4416_2650/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders outside the Senate chamber in Washington DC on 25 March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders outside the Senate chamber in Washington DC on 25 March 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Unprecedented moment\u2019</h2> <p>It remains unlikely that Sanders can dramatically reshape the Democratic primary. He is almost hopelessly behind Biden in the delegate count and many of the biggest contests left are in states that appear more favorable to the former VP, like <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/georgia/\">Georgia</a>, <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/ohio/\">Ohio</a> and <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/pennsylvania/\">Pennsylvania</a>.</p> <p>The next test comes on Tuesday, when Wisconsin is scheduled to hold its primary despite calls from Sanders and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/03/wisconsin-election-coronavirus-pandemic\">several legal challenges</a> to postpone it. Sanders will likely need a strong performance in the state to keep alive the already dim prospect of a comeback. A new <a href=\"https://law.marquette.edu/poll/2020/04/01/new-marquette-law-school-poll-finds-strong-support-for-coronavirus-closings-even-as-it-shows-substantial-economic-impact/\">poll</a> from Marquette Law School found Sanders trailing Biden by nearly 30 points in the battleground state.</p> <p>Sanders knows he has a decision to make. He is, as he tells every interviewer, \u201cassessing\u201d his options. Fundamentally, he believes the pandemic has changed the calculus.</p> <p>Is it possible to fall short of his presidential ambitions but succeed in his decades-long battle to remake US society?</p> <p>\u201cRight now in this unprecedented moment in American history,\u201d Sanders told <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/whoopi-goldberg-spars-with-bernie-sanders-on-the-view-why-are-you-still-in-the-race?ref=scroll\">The View</a>. \u201cI think we need to have a very serious look at how we need to go forward.\u201d</p>"
