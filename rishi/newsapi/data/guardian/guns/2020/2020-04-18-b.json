But it\u2019s gradually evolved and you realise: \u2018This can work now.\u2019</p> \n   <p>When we turned up here for the first time we said: \u2018Wow, this is a big empty space, it\u2019s got water, it\u2019s got electricity, it\u2019s got a roof, and nobody\u2019s shooting at you.</p> \n   <p>So actually this is achievable \u2013 that\u2019s not necessarily the case in other theatres we\u2019ve been working in.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The 52-year-old said it was \u201cincredibly impressive\u201d that a high-quality intensive care unit had been set up in what was, in effect, a warehouse.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Somebody said you\u2019re on the train and laying the tracks ahead of you as you are going along \u2013 and that\u2019s absolutely right, you just have to make sure the train doesn\u2019t go too quickly and run away with you.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Part of the success, he says, has been through dedication to the welfare of staff, many of whom are working \u201cpretty exhausting\u201d 12-hour shifts. Nightingale workers had borrowed a technique deployed on military operations where staff are paired with a buddy at the start of their shift, encouraging them to look out for one another throughout. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIf you have eyes with each other when you first go on a shift, you introduce yourselves, and speak to each other after the shift. If they get upset, have a difficult time with a patient or a death, they sit down and have a cup of tea. It worked very well in the past in the military and it\u2019s working very well here,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"780c85dc-9ed5-46a3-83d5-1027c68f2804\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H6pDcV2Lnno?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T13:02:24.066Z\">at 2.02pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9aa8498f08b7689b030bc6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T07:14:15.598Z\">8.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning from the UK, folks. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/simon-murphy\">Simon Murphy</a> </strong>here, taking over the global live blog now to take you through today\u2019s coronavirus coverage as the world continues to battle the pandemic. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T07:56:37.700Z\">at 8.56am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9a98918f08bade1f2957e8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T06:14:07.698Z\">7.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Teachers, nurses and other workers who are regularly exposed to the public must now take a coronavirus test if they want to leave Wuhan, China has ruled.<br><br>The order comes after the central city, where the coronavirus emerged late last year, lifted a 70-day lockdown that all but ended the epidemic there. <br><br>People in Wuhan working in nursing, education, security and other sectors with high exposure to the public must take a nucleic acid test before leaving, the National Health Commission said. <br><br>Since the city relaxed its lockdown restrictions people who arrived in there before Chinese New Year, when the virus was peaking in China, are allowed to go back to their homes. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95d57265faf4481a7f3f1445960b65d8b106eefd\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95d57265faf4481a7f3f1445960b65d8b106eefd/52_149_2913_1748/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The junction of the Han River and the Yangtze River on April 17, 2020 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

In Brisbane\u2019s metro south public health unit, which serves a population of about 1.2 million south of the Brisbane river, the team doing this work has grown to 100 people, triple its size before the pandemic.</p> \n<h2>How it begins</h2> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get them to tell us a story,\u201d says Dr Shopna Bag. \u201cWhere did it all start?\u201d</p> \n<p>Bag is the director of the public health unit for the western Sydney local health district, which covers areas including Cumberland, Parramatta and Blacktown.</p> \n<p>The unit is based on the Cumberland hospital campus but works with all hospitals in the district, including neighbouring Westmead, as well as local health centres and pharmacies.</p> \n<p>The team includes a communicable diseases manager, surveillance nurses, public health nurses and public health officers. Since the arrival of Covid-19, it has had responsibility for joining the dots in cases such as an outbreak at the Rose of Sharon childcare centre in Blacktown.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We\u2019re trying to get them to tell us a story. Where did it all start?</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Dr Shopna Bag</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Case investigation and contact tracing work begins at the point of diagnosis. The unit receives a notification from a laboratory or the health department of a newly confirmed case. That case is assigned to a team member, often a nurse, who then calls the patient.</p> \n<p>In many cases, this phone call is the moment the patient learns they have coronavirus. For the clinician on the other side of the call, their first priority is the patient\u2019s mental welfare and physical health.</p> \n<p>\u201cSometimes people are expecting the result, other times it\u2019s a surprise,\u201d says Dr Bhakti Vasant, a public health physician in Brisbane\u2019s metro south public health unit.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really important we gauge what people are feeling over the phone and try to build rapport.\u201d</p> \n<p>The clinician will run through a questionnaire to correctly identify the patient. That is followed by a symptom check. How is the patient feeling today? Are they experiencing any respiratory difficulties? Are they in a hospital or at home in isolation? Do they have any chronic illnesses that place them in a higher risk category of Covid-19 patients?</p> \n<p>Vasant says there have been some cases where staff have had to immediately call an ambulance based on that first phone call.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf they\u2019re short of breath or reporting chest pain we do not muck around,\u201d she says.</p> \n<h2>The interview</h2> \n<p>Once the caller establishes the patient is in isolation and well enough to speak, more detailed questioning can begin.</p> \n<p>While its purpose is interrogatory, the interview is kept as relaxed as possible, Bag says. For this reason, clinicians doing this type of work need multiple qualities: an eye for detail, emotional intelligence, and the ability to listen and make people feel comfortable. Unsurprisingly, they are often natural conversationalists, but with the ability to tease out information and follow threads.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying not to bombard them with questions, even though we need to tick a box,\u201d Bag says.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do it in a way that says \u2018just tell us the story\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The caller asks the patient questions about when they first started to feel unwell. For some Covid-19 patients, the initial symptoms can be so mild they are mistaken for something else, such as hayfever.</p> \n<p>The caller talks to the patient about every cough, fever, ache, anything that felt a little off and together they identify the date the patient first began to show symptoms.</p> \n<p>This is done for two reasons. The first is to build a timeline back to the original source of the infection.</p> \n<p>The second is that the date of symptom onset determines the period in which the patient is considered contagious.</p> \n<p>Patients with Covid-19 are considered contagious 24 hours before they become symptomatic and this date is used as the starting point to identify close contacts who may have been exposed.</p> \n<h2>The timeline</h2> \n<p>The case investigator then works with the patient to build a timeline.</p> \n<p>This line of questioning can be a long process says Reid, who is the team investigations manager in the ACT\u2019s health protection service.</p> \n<p>It is about retracing the patient\u2019s steps, \u201cday-by day, minute-by-minute\u201d, covering every moment of the 14 days up to the first day of symptoms.</p> \n<p>They\u2019ll use a range of tools, including the calendar on the patient\u2019s mobile phone, if they have one, to try to reconstruct those two weeks. Sometimes, they\u2019ll have the patient try to write a timeline for those 14 days.</p> \n<p>There are specific questions, such as has the patient travelled internationally or interstate? Where did they go, what mode of transport did they use? If they took a flight somewhere, did they then catch a taxi or Uber? Had they been at work, the gym, a wedding or birthday party?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Sometimes it will take multiple calls as the patient starts to recall their movements.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t stop until we find a source,\u201d Reid says.</p> \n<p>In some instances, a public health unit might receive several cases at once for which there appears to be a common source, such as a cruise ship with a known outbreak or an institution such as a school or church with other confirmed cases.</p> \n<p>But Bag says it is important not to make assumptions even if the source might seem obvious.

This is anyone who has had 15 minutes of face-to-face contact with the patient in their infectious period, or who has spent two hours in an enclosed space with them.</p> \n<p>Case investigators will seek information such as flight numbers and seat rows for patients who have travelled. They can then request a flight manifest from the airline to begin the work of identifying people sitting nearby.</p> \n<p>In the interview, the patient will be asked to remember who they\u2019ve spent time with, at work, at the gym, any parties, religious services or nights out. Who do they live with? The greatest risks of exposure are in the household setting, so identifying household members is a priority in contact tracing.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-five-months-on-what-scientists-now-know-about-covid-19\">Coronavirus: five months on, what scientists now know about Covid-19</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A list is put together and then contact tracers get to work tracking down and notifying those people.</p> \n<p>In some cases, the patient will be able to supply names and numbers and those individuals might already be expecting a call.

It makes you reflect on your whole life and it really has ... it\u2019s mentally very difficult, it\u2019s emotionally difficult, economically it\u2019s disastrous. The market goes down, your retirement funds go down, you\u2019re not getting a paycheck. It is as tumultuous a time as we have ever seen. But in the midst of this, there is no time for politics.

Stay tuned for up-to-the-minute news on US politics and the pandemic.</p> <p>There are widespread concerns about the growing occurrence of sporadic protests around the nation. These flared up earlier in the week in several states, most notably Michigan and Minnesota, against the continuance of stay-at-home orders by governors (which follow federal guidelines) as they try to contain the disease. Most US public helath experts believe the number of coronavirus cases has not yet peaked in the US, though the may peak soon.</p> <p>The protests appear to have had a partisan bent, with a preponderance of \u201cTrump 2020\u201d flags, Trump baseball hats and signs criticizing Democratic party state governors, and some demonstrators toting assault rifles.</p> <p>Now Texas, with a Republican governor, Greg Abbott, is expecting protesters to gather today at the state capitol in Austin to call for the reopening of the state\u2019s economy \u2013 and the country\u2019s \u2013 and an end to social distancing orders and business closures.</p> <p>The rally is being called \u201cYou Can\u2019t Close America\u201d. </p> <p>Last night at the White House coronavirus task force briefing, Donald Trump and his vice-president, Mike Pence, both delivered messages saying that there are enough tests available across the nation to track and control the spread of coronavirus and move to \u201cphase one\u201d reopening of the economy, which non-essential businesses starting up again.</p> <p>This goes against what many governors are saying, some Republicans as well as Democrats, that they do not have enough resources yet to begin safely opening up towards normal life again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/17/white-house-testing-criticism-coronavirus-reopen-economy\">White House insists US has 'sufficient' testing capacity to reopen amid widespread criticism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And the Guardian is reporting today on some of the right-wing forces, both political and financial, that appear to be driving protesters, whom Trump on Friday called \u201cresponsible people\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/18/coronavirus-americans-protest-stay-at-home\">Thousands of Americans backed by rightwing donors gear up for protests</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T13:29:41.336Z\">at 2.29pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

But with an estimated 6,000 people having already died in care homes from Covid-19 \u2013 a figure not included in Saturday\u2019s official tally \u2013 the 20,000 figure is likely already to have been exceeded.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/how-did-britain-get-its-response-to-coronavirus-so-wrong\">In an interview with The Observer</a> Nabarro said the public should not assume that a vaccine would definitely be developed soon \u2013 and would have to adapt to the ongoing threat.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily develop a vaccine that is safe and effective against every virus. Some viruses are very, very difficult when it comes to vaccine development - so for the foreseeable future, we are going to have to find ways to go about our lives with this virus as a constant threat.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat means isolating those who show signs of the disease and also their contacts. Older people will have to be protected. In addition hospital capacity for dealing with cases will have to be ensured.

On Friday, Maria Van Kerkhove, head of WHO\u2019s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, warned that there was no evidence that antibody tests now being developed would show if a person has immunity or is no longer at risk of becoming reinfected by the Covid-19 virus.</p> \n<p>On Saturday it emerged that doctors and nurses treating Covid-19 face <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/nhs-frontline-staff-may-refuse-to-work-over-lack-of-coronavirus-ppe-says-union-unison\">shortages of protective full-length gowns</a> for weeks to come, as anger mounts over failures to stockpile them.

  "<p>In the Victorian high country town of Bright, hope for a strong recovery after a summer of devastating bushfires was given human form in the shape of the US singer Katy Perry.</p> <p>The pop star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/gallery/2020/mar/11/racehorses-dog-sledges-and-a-jewish-feast-wednesdays-top-photos\">performed to a crowd of thousands at Bright on 11 March</a>, the first of a series of major events intended to bring tourists, and their wallets, back to fire-ravaged communities and put struggling businesses back on their feet.</p> <p>\u201cThe press coverage for Katy Perry we could not have purchased \u2013 it was just enormous,\u201d says the Alpine shire mayor, Peter Roper. \u201cIt was a really good, healing thing for the community to be able to take part in. I now know why she has got so many Instagram followers, she is really empathetic, a lovely person.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then, well, you know what happened next.\u201d</p> <p>Within hours of Perry\u2019s performance, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/who-declares-coronavirus-pandemic\">World Health Organization declared a pandemic.</a> Two days later, the Australian government announced a ban on all mass gatherings of more than 500 people. The events that bushfire-affected communities throughout Victoria had planned were suddenly cancelled. Then came the ban on attending restaurants or cafes, and the ban on non-essential travel. The Easter school holidays, second only to the summer holidays in the number of tourists they bring to the coastal and highlands communities worst hit by the bushfires, were nixed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a1318d68a0e1279c9d9adbcd6b6fee148e0b65e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a1318d68a0e1279c9d9adbcd6b6fee148e0b65e/0_335_5057_3036/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katy Perry meets locals before the Fight On concert for bushfire-affected communities at Pioneer Park Recreation Reserve in Bright\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katy Perry meets locals before the Fight On concert for bushfire-affected communities in Bright.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Ross/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe bushfires cost us $90m,\u201d Roper says. \u201cI have not even bothered to work out what the Covid-19 is going to cost us because every day something new happens.\u201d</p> <p>When Guardian Australia spoke to tourism operators in bushfire-affected towns in January, their hope rested on a strong Easter.

And yet not all is good.</p> <p>While it expects the economy to grow almost as fast in 2021 as it did in 1984, unlike then, it expects the unemployment rate to rise \u2013 from 7.6% this year to 8.9% by the end of next year.</p> <p>This is where the IMF is both optimistic and pessimistic.</p> <p>There is a pretty solid relationship between GDP growth and unemployment (known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okun%27s_law\">Okun\u2019s Law</a>) whereby the faster GDP grows the more the unemployment rate falls.</p> <p>Over the past 50 years, we have needed the economy to grow by around 3.2% to keep the unemployment rate steady. In the past 20 years or so this has come down a bit, so now around 3% is good enough.</p> <p>As a general rule, for every 1% that the economy grows above or below 3%, the unemployment rate will fall or rise 0.5%pts.</p> <p>So, for example, given the current unemployment rate is 5.2%, if the economy was to grow by only 2% in a year, you would expect the unemployment rate to rise 0.5%pts to 5.7%.</p> <p>Using the past 50 years as a guide, if the economy was to shrink by 6.7% in a year, as the IMF predicts, then the unemployment rate would be expected to rise by around 4.5%pts \u2013 which would take us up to 9.7%. And yet the IMF predicts unemployment this year to rise only to 7.6%.</p> <p>That is optimistic and takes into account the government\u2019s jobkeeper policy, which will see some people who would normally be classified as unemployed notionally still working.</p> <p>But there the optimism ends.</p> <p>While the IMF expects the economy to grow by 6.1% in 2021 \u2013 which would normally mean the unemployment rate should fall by around 1.5%pts \u2013 it predicts the unemployment rate to rise another 1.3%pts to 8.9%.</p> <p>What this means is that while production might \u201csnap back\u201d (to use the prime minister\u2019s phrase) we are likely in for a much tougher recovery on the employment front. Mining production may again ramp up, but labour-heavy sectors like tourism, hospitality and retail will be much slower to return to where we were just three months ago.</p> <p>It means reducing government stimulus will also need to be done with care because while a \u201cV\u201d shape recession is hoped for, rushing the recovery and abruptly cutting stimulus can very easily see the \u201cL\u201d shape become a reality.</p> <ul> <li><p>Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>",

A key part of this will be encouraging Australians to download to their phones a tracing app, currently in production, modelled on Singapore\u2019s TraceTogether App, which uses bluetooth to alert users when they come into contact with a confirmed case. </p></li> <li><p>Strengthened \u201clocal response capabilities\u201d \u2013 essentially the ability to lock down hotspots where outbreaks occur, such as the one in north-west Tasmania this week. This will include multiple layers of government agencies, including, potentially, the military.</p></li> </ul> <p>For countries that have weathered the Covid-19 storm well so far, the pressure on governments to reopen their societies and economies is intense: from business groups seeing entire industries laid barren; from political commentators reading the economic data and seeing a sea of red; from families anxious to see children back in school; from citizenry desperate to get back to work and reestablish some normality in their lives.</p> <p>But the risks of relaxing too much, too soon, are very real, and medical experts have warned against rushing to lift restrictions prematurely, potentially sparking a more deadly second wave and undermining the hard-won gains so far.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_sfl\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email newsletter\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s an invidious choice for governments all over the world, weighing lives against livelihoods. \u201cEvery time you relax a restriction, more people will get sick, more people will die,\u201d the New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has said.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s medical response to Covid-19, while not without flaws, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/10/ruby-princess-battle-begins-to-hold-someone-accountable-for-cruise-ship-coronavirus-debacle\">Ruby Princess debacle</a>, has been dramatically successful by international standards: just over 6,400 infections resulting in 65 deaths (as of Friday evening).</p> <p>The Czech Republic, with a similar number of infections (6,433), has had 169 people die.

It closed schools, and all shops save for essential services such as supermarkets, pharmacies, service stations, hospitals and banks. Non-essential movement was prohibited, travel between islands and gatherings stopped, and all indoor and outdoor events cancelled indefinitely. Even partners who lived apart were stopped from seeing each other.</p> <p>On Monday, Ardern\u2019s cabinet will meet to discuss winding back its lockdown measures, from \u201clevel four\u201d to \u201clevel three\u201d.

Germany currently has a Covid-19 reproduction rate of 0.7 (meaning, on average, one infected person goes on to infect less than one other person). If that reproduction rate rose fractionally to 1.1, Germany\u2019s health system could be overwhelmed by October. At 1.2, it could reach crisis point by July.</p> <p>The chancellor announced this week that schools across the country would reopen on 4 May, initially for students in their final years of primary or secondary school.

Like Australia, Germany has a federalised system of governance. Many of the decisions about relaxing restrictions \u2013 including reopening schools \u2013 are the domain of the states, which have at times fiercely disagreed on the best way forward and which measures to relax.</p> <h2><strong>Czech Republic</strong></h2> <p>The Czech Republic was one of the first European countries to shut its borders, enforcing one of the most comprehensive lockdowns on the continent. Only the Republic and neighbouring Slovakia have mandated the wearing of face masks in public.</p> <p>The measures have been broadly successful. The country of 10 million people has recorded 6,433 infections and 169 deaths, and already some restrictions have been eased.</p> <p>A limited range of shops have been opened, citizens can run and cycle without a mask, and those who have \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to travel overseas can leave the country (but must quarantine for a fortnight on return).</p> <p>Now the government has announced a tentative five-step process to reopen society.

Forestry workers and IT manufacturers have been allowed back to work. The country\u2019s full lockdown is set to end on 4 May.</p> <p>In <strong>Spain</strong>, which has endured 185,000 infections and nearly 20,000 deaths, some factory and construction workers have been allowed back to work but most shops and services remain closed and office staff are still working from home. Spain\u2019s lockdown is set to end on 27 April but will almost certainly be extended.</p> <p><strong>Austria</strong> has allowed small shops, hardware and gardening shops to reopen, along with public parks (with strict distancing rules and masks). If the virus remains under control \u2013 new rates of infection have been dropping \u2013 all shops will reopen on 2 May, and restaurants from mid-May.</p> <p><strong>Denmark</strong> reopened daycare centres and primary schools this week. With just over 7,000 infections, Denmark has mapped out a longer-term road to recovery: restaurants and cafes will remain closed and gatherings of more than 10 people banned until 10 May. Larger public gatherings will be prohibited until August.</p>",

It\u2019s about trying to bring the top teams down to a level where the midfield teams feel they can compete.

The big three argue their operations and development costs could not be compared with those of smaller teams and Horner insists his team cannot go below $140m. He is in favour of a two-tier cap, but also believes F1 should be more adventurous in considering how to deal with the short-term fiscal threat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/16/f1-teams-fail-to-agree-budget-cap-reduction-as-race-cancellations-bite\">F1 fails to agree budget reduction as smaller teams at risk of being lost</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf we were really serious about reducing the cost, particularly for the small teams, I would be in full favour of supplying for the next two years a full customer car,\u201d he said. \u201cThe smaller teams wouldn\u2019t need any R&amp;D.

This has not always been the case, however, and Horner argued that the sport had to think more radically. \u201cWith the modern 3D photographic technology all teams utilise they are all trying to copy each other\u2019s cars anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cTimes change, things move.

  "<p>President Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-trump-halts-funding-to-world-health-organization\">recent comments</a> against the World Health Organization are, unfortunately, unsurprising. Healthcare workers and public health bodies have often become the subject of people\u2019s misplaced anger during pandemics. It is deeply concerning, however, to see this playing out again today on a global political scale.</p> <p>Divided, we will fail. No part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-world-map-which-countries-have-the-most-cases-and-deaths\">the world</a> is unaffected by Covid-19 and it demands coordinated action to solve it. The US cannot keep coronavirus out unless the virus is also under control in the rest of the world. Thinking in terms of single nations or narrow political allegiances prolongs the crisis and deepens the impact on every country and community.</p> <p>No one wants restrictions on movement to last longer than necessary. But while we\u2019re dependent on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-the-week-explained\">lockdowns and social distancing</a> to slow the virus and buy us time, they are not enough to stop this pandemic. There will be second and third waves; this may become a threat we have to live with all our lives. Without any solutions, this will devastate our health and our economies. The UK, where Covid-19 is on course to have the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/uk-could-have-europes-worst-coronavirus-death-rate-says-pandemic-expert\">biggest impact</a> in Europe, might be looking at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/rishi-sunak-deeply-troubled-by-obr-warning-of-35-fall-in-uk-gdp\">35% drop</a> in GDP.</p> <p>Today\u2019s <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-g20/g20-health-ministers-to-speak-next-week-about-coronavirus-statement-idUKKCN21V1WU\">meeting</a> of G20 health ministers is a welcome opportunity to present a united front and make positive commitments. There must be no question of casting health and economic security against each other \u2013 each is essential to the other.</p> <p>The only way to end a pandemic and have confidence in easing lockdowns is with three vital tools: tests, treatments and vaccines. Rapid diagnostic tests so that we can track the virus, isolate those infected and shield the vulnerable. Effective medicines to save lives and reduce the severity and impact of the disease on our health systems. And vaccines to protect people and prevent transmission.</p> <p>Without these tools, we risk a rolling cycle of lockdowns and distancing measures as outbreaks ebb and flow around the world for months, if not years, to come.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"534cfdb58639fe3e71acf1213b491b0cbec02e96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/534cfdb58639fe3e71acf1213b491b0cbec02e96/0_15_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump has withdrawn US funding for the World Health Organization.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leah Millis/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These tools will only come from scientific research and innovation. Only 100 days since the virus\u2019s genome was sequenced, clinical trials are already testing well over 100 potential vaccines and drugs. But even as researchers around the world are pooling resources and ideas to progress the science as quickly as possible, huge international investments will be needed to turn their discoveries into practical global solutions.</p> <p>Right now, there is an urgent and immediate <a href=\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/press-release/global-covid-zero-initiative-launched-fill-8bn-shortfall-coronavirus-response\">$8bn (\u00a36.4bn) funding gap</a>. If secured from governments and private sector donations in the next few weeks, this money can help achieve the scale of research and development we need. Processes that usually take years will be able to get underway in a coordinated way, rapidly generating global solutions to the pandemic. Any delay means opportunities missed, time and money wasted, more lives lost.</p> <p>Many people have spoken about the unprecedented nature of this global emergency. Our response must be unprecedented, too. Backed by the international community, the World Health Organization led the <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/65304-smallpox.html\">eradication of smallpox</a>, the internationally coordinated use of <a href=\"https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/6/06-037457/en/\">polio vaccines</a> and many more \u2013 but these achievements all took decades of effort.</p> <p>Now, we must pull together and implement a global solution to Covid-19. More will be needed to ensure that no matter where they are developed, all tests, treatments and vaccines are available to everyone in the world who needs them and at an affordable price. For as long as Covid-19 is out of control somewhere, it is a threat to us all.</p> <p>Science is the exit strategy, but as the European commission has recognised with its planned pledging conference, it will take a monumental global effort to tackle this virus. Governments, businesses and organisations across the whole of society, many not usually involved in public health, have to play essential roles.</p> <p>We cannot afford to pay any more attention to our geographic, social and political borders than the virus does. Every nation in the world has a duty to back our international coordinating bodies, such as the WHO, and find the way out of this crisis together.</p> <p>\u2022 Jeremy Farrar is director of the Wellcome Trust</p>",
  "<p>Football can give you completely the wrong idea about people. One incident in one match can skew the perception. For years I thought I hated Carlos, the Brazil goalkeeper who pulled back Bruno Bellone after the France forward had gone round him <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B5C2U4UmO0\">in the 1986 World Cup quarter-final</a> and somehow went unpunished.</p> <p>How, four years after Harald Schumacher\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/may/27/world-cup-25-stunning-moments-patrick-battiston\">horrendous assault on Patrick Battiston</a>, could that glorious France \u2013 Platini! Tigana! Giresse! \u2013 be cheated once again by a goalkeeper? Carlos\u2019s offence had nothing like the raw violence of Schumacher\u2019s, but it was cynical. And so, for compounding the injustice of Seville 1982, he went on the blacklist.</p> <p>Then I met him. I was in Brazil researching <a href=\"https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Jonathan-Wilson/The-Outsider--A-History-of-the-Goalkeeper/15116364\">my book on goalkeepers</a> and sent out a load of interview requests. I spoke to Emerson Le\u00e3o, Waldir Peres and Nielsen, but Carlos was elusive. He didn\u2019t say no, but he kept making excuses. On my final day in S\u00e3o Paulo, he said he had been called out of state unexpectedly. But when I went to the goalkeeping school run by Zetti, S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s keeper when they won the Copa Libertadores in 1992, there was Carlos, having a coffee, his mass of frizzy curls, albeit thinner and greyer now, making him instantly recognisable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/13/world-cup-questions-why-didnt-the-great-dutch-teams-of-the-1990s-win-it\">World Cup questions: Why didn\u2019t the great Dutch teams of the 1990s win it? | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He was clearly still reluctant, but Zetti guilted him into doing the interview. In truth, I was largely unprepared and, given his discomfort, I was expecting an awkward 15 minutes that were unlikely to yield more than a couple of sentences. But once he got over his initial shyness, it all came rushing out.</p> <p>Carlos was intelligent, sensitive and, for all that he had won 37 caps and twice come second in the Brazilian league\u2019s player of the year award, had a deeply ambivalent relationship with football. He wanted to be an architect but instead became a goalkeeper, almost by mistake. Carlos started out as a defender. \u201cI didn\u2019t have skills,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I had a good reading of the game. I had a good sense of position, but I was afraid of heading the ball.\u201d</p> <p>But he had already been attracted to goalkeeping because of the radio. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have matches on television, so you listened to games,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe most spectacular play would be around the goal: you either had a goal or you had a save from the goalkeeper. So when I played I tried to imitate what I heard and imagined. At the time there was a thought that the goalkeeper was just a player who couldn\u2019t play outfield so nobody wanted to do it. But I liked it. I already liked it.\u201d</p> <p>And he was tall. \u201cAt school I did high jump and I played basketball. I was 12 or 13 when I decided goalkeeper was my position. I started out playing against teams my age but because nobody wanted to be a goalkeeper I started playing with older people. When I was 14 I would play with people 20 years older than me. Sometimes they would get mad at me because I couldn\u2019t save everything.\u201d The fear of letting people down would become a familiar theme.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=Sport&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=My%20Favourite%20Game&amp;description=In%20our%20new%20series%2C%20Guardian%20writers%20recall%20the%20great%20sporting%20contests%20they%20will%20never%20forget&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsport%2Fseries%2Fmy-favourite-game&amp;links=false\" data-alt=\"Check out our Favourite Game series\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=Sport&opinion-tint=false&title=My%20Favourite%20Game&description=In%20our%20new%20series%2C%20Guardian%20writers%20recall%20the%20great%20sporting%20contests%20they%20will%20never%20forget&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsport%2Fseries%2Fmy-favourite-game&links=false\">Check out our Favourite Game series</a> </figure>  <p>The local professional club, Ponte Preta, would play friendlies against local sides and after coming up against Carlos, they invited him to train with them. \u201cI liked football,\u201d he said, \u201cbut to be a professional goalkeeper \u2026 I didn\u2019t enjoy it because of the pressure.

  "<p><br><br>In forthcoming journals of this plague year, I hope whoever gets to write the canonical version will make a particular note of 15 April.

But the sudden tolerance for rhapsodies about Boris Johnson\u2019s nation-binding, lie-obliterating invincibility, even from writers whose analysis does not usually recall Unity Mitford\u2019s, appears to be just one aspect of a widespread longing for comfort from on high, or wherever a significant royal is currently embedded, along with any necessary suspension of critical faculties.</p> <p>If it was likely and welcome that the Queen, as a revered survivor of earlier crises, would be a calming national presence in this one, the Prince of Wales possibly had less reason to hope, like his dependent son and daughter-in-law, that their contributions \u2013 from spiritual input to <a href=\"https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/duchess-cornwall-shares-reading-list\">book lists</a> to a throwback photograph of Prince Charles <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClarenceHouse/status/1250788523634053120\">as Macbeth</a> \u2013 would be equally gratefully received.

But now a man who always wanted to be a symbol actually is a symbol.</p> <p>\u201cMy entire life has been so far motivated by a desire to heal,\u201d Charles said in 2002. \u201cTo heal the divisions between intuitive and rational thought, between mind and body and soul, so that the temple of our humanity can once again be lit by a sacred flame.\u201d And it appears the cynics were wrong: he can indeed light humanity\u2019s temple and, what\u2019s more, light it remotely, from <a href=\"https://www.womanandhome.com/life/homes/birkhall-prince-charles-camilla-scottish-home-354045/\">Birkhall</a>. Certainly, nobody seems now to be asking who\u2019s living in the prince\u2019s other seven or so homes. Or who was squeezing his toothpaste when he had Covid-19. Or where his already considerable contagion travel savings are going. In the current climate, it could sound all too much like siding with the virus.</p> <p>The Cambridges, meanwhile, are earning their share of the Queen\u2019s sovereign grant \u2013 and, incidentally, triumphing over the Sussexes, whose departure could scarcely have been worse timed \u2013 by way of encouragement and hints from their laptops in Anmer Hall and various Instagram offerings.

  "<p>Covid-19 is a human disaster. However, for one group of animals, there may be a silver lining. Pangolins are one of the most heavily trafficked animals in the world, and as a result they are endangered. But in the past few weeks they have been linked to the initial outbreak of the Covid-19 disease in China. The evidence is inconclusive, but it has already prompted the Chinese government to take action. If more actions against the wildlife trade follow, the incident could prove to be a turning point for pangolin conservation.</p> <p>A key question is where Covid-19 came from. Many animals carry coronaviruses and are potential sources of infection. That is important to know, if only because it should help us prevent future outbreaks. Several ideas have been proposed, but arguably the most dramatic is that pangolins were the source.</p> <h2><strong>World\u2019s most trafficked mammal</strong></h2> <p>Pangolins look like scaly anteaters. Uniquely among mammals, their bodies are covered in hard protective scales made of keratin: the same material as our nails. They feed on insects such as ants and termites, and are often nocturnal and shy. While they look like anteaters, they are not closely related to them, and their closest living relatives are actually carnivorans: the group that includes wolves and cats.</p> <p>There are eight species of <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/pangolin\">pangolin</a>. Four live in Africa and four in Asia. All are at risk of extinction, according to the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/\">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN). Two of the African species are <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12766/123586126\">considered</a> <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12765/123585768\">vulnerable</a> and two <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12767/123586469\">are</a> <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12762/123584478\">endangered</a>. Of the Asian species, one is <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12761/123583998\">endangered</a> while the other three <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12764/123585318\">are</a> <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12763/123584856\">critically</a> <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/136497/123586862\">endangered</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>If animals are in closely packed, unsanitary conditions with many people nearby it is easier for a virus to jump species</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Pangolins are <a href=\"https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/11855-Podcast-Why-are-pangolins-so-prized-in-China-\">illegally hunted and traded</a> for <a href=\"https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/11538-Pangolins-The-multimillion-dollar-mammal\">two main reasons</a>. First, their meat is considered a delicacy in several south-east Asian countries, especially China and Vietnam. And second, their scales are used in Chinese traditional medicine.

Two scientists there, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/2004160486_Yongyi_Shen\">Yongyi Shen</a> and <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_0mQSasAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Lihua Xiao</a>, were said to have compared coronaviruses from pangolins and from humans infected in the outbreak. The viruses\u2019 genetic sequences were said to be 99% similar. One co-author, Wu Chen of Guangzhou Zoo, had previously helped show that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11110979\">Sunda pangolins carry coronaviruses</a>.</p> <p>However, the results had not been published at that stage, so other scientists could not examine them in detail. Meanwhile, there were many other possibilities. The virus could have come from <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-00166-6\">an animal and seafood market in Wuhan</a>, where many species were held. Animals in such markets are often kept in closely packed, unsanitary conditions, with many people nearby: a perfect opportunity for a virus to jump species. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7\">Many pointed the finger at bats</a>: the virus is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30251-8\">genetically similar</a> to those in bats, and it would not be the first time a disease passed from bats to humans. There was also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25682\">a study linking the virus to one found in snakes</a>, but this is now considered unlikely.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d0b5e5d4cdfef0bf5dad1e81dc0a4fcc7baf502\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d0b5e5d4cdfef0bf5dad1e81dc0a4fcc7baf502/0_116_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seized frozen pangolins are seen at a wild animal rescue center in Hanoi, Vietnam September 9, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seized frozen pangolins are seen at a wild animal rescue center in Hanoi, Vietnam September 9, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KHAM/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then there was a twist in the story. On 20 February the researchers posted <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.17.951335\">a preliminary version of the study</a> on the preprint site bioRxiv. The conclusions were radically different to what was described at the press conference. While the pangolin virus was \u201cgenetically related\u201d to the one infecting humans, it was \u201cunlikely to be directly linked to the outbreak because of the substantial sequence differences\u201d. The 99% similarity was only in one region of the genome. Across the entire genome, the similarity was only 90.3%. There had been an \u201c<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-00548-w\">embarrassing miscommunication between the bioinformatics group and the lab group of the study</a>\u201d. When contacted by the <em>Observer</em>, Xiao declined to comment.</p> <h2><strong>A halt to the wildlife trade?</strong></h2> <p>However, the Chinese government was already lurching into action. On 24 February, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/coronavirus-china-animals-wild-eat-ban-wildlife-market-pangolin-dogs-cats-a9358496.html\">China announced an immediate ban on trading and eating many wild animals, including pangolins</a>. Officials began <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24532723-900-china-has-shut-all-of-its-wild-animal-markets-it-was-long-overdue/\">shutting down wild animal markets</a> across the country.</p> <p>This was the latest in a series of steps that ought to reduce the pangolin trade. Back in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/28/pangolins-thrown-a-lifeline-at-global-wildlife-summit-with-total-trade-ban\">the international trade in pangolins was entirely banned</a> by the 183 nations that signed up to the <a href=\"https://cites.org/eng\">Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species</a> (Cites). All eight pangolin species were placed in Appendix I of the Convention, giving them the strictest protection currently possible.</p> <p>However, so far this does not seem to have resulted in a drop in the number of pangolins traded, says <a href=\"https://www.traffic.org/about-us/our-organisation/our-staff/\">Xu Ling</a>, China director at wildlife trade monitoring group Traffic. <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/wwf-response-to-cites-agenda-items-on-pangolins\">The trade continues</a> but the nature of the shipments has changed. \u201cBefore 2016 we could find frozen pangolin bodies, the meat smuggled in from other parts of south-east Asia to China,\u201d says Ling. Nowadays most shipments are purely pangolin scales. Often they come from Africa, after being <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-pangolins-idUSKBN1W40S5\">illicitly shipped out via Nigeria</a>.</p> <p>More recently, in August 2019, China\u2019s state insurance providers announced that they would <a href=\"https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/asia/news/breaking-news/chinese-insurers-to-stop-covering-pangolinbased-medicines-176735.aspx\">stop covering medicines made from pangolin scales</a>. <a href=\"https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/11880-China-s-state-insurers-have-stopped-covering-pangolin-medicines\">The move took effect in January 2020</a>.</p> <p>Against this background, it is unclear what impact China\u2019s new ban on eating wild meat will have on pangolins. \u201cEven without this ban, pangolin meat consumption was forbidden in China,\u201d says Ling, as pangolins had protected status. This was reflected in the shift to importing scales. These are only legal if they come from certified sources but, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/science-environment-51726617\">as so often happens</a>, the traders find ways around that. In the longer term, the loss of insurance funding may undercut the scale market.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b953afa8156989e2e58c299ddf030de6aaddb55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b953afa8156989e2e58c299ddf030de6aaddb55/0_324_4928_2956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A banner reading \u201cWe are all pangolins\u201d hangs on a blacony in Bordeaux, southwestern France, on March 19\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A banner reading \u201cWe are all pangolins\u201d hangs on a blacony in Bordeaux, southwestern France, on March 19</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicolas Tucat/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The truth about pangolins and Covid-19</strong></h2> <p>Meanwhile, the idea that pangolins played a role in the emergence of Covid-19 has not gone away.</p> <p>On 17 March, a team led by <a href=\"https://andersen-lab.com/people/\">Kristian Andersen</a> at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, published <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-0820-9\">a detailed analysis of the virus\u2019s possible origin</a> in <em>Nature Medicine</em>. They say the ultimate source is likely to be bats, just as it was for the two other coronavirus outbreaks of recent years: Sars and Mers. Bats are a known reservoir of coronaviruses. Furthermore, intermediate horseshoe bats are known to carry <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7\">a virus called RaTG13, whose genome is 96% identical to that of Sars</a><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7\">-CoV-2</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear the bat serves as the reservoir for this,\u201d says Andersen. The question is how the virus travelled from bats to humans. \u201cWe are entertaining two different scenarios.\u201d</p> <p>The key question is how the virus acquired certain sequences of its genome, which allow it to bind strongly to human cells and thus infect them. The bat virus does not have these sequences.</p> <p>One possibility is that the bat virus made the jump to humans several months before the outbreak was detected. These early viruses would not have been especially infectious or dangerous, but they could have mutated and evolved to acquire the key genetic sequences that made them infectious.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>While the pangolin virus is less similar to Sars-CoV-2 than the bat virus, its genome has the crucial binding sequences.</p> <footer> <cite>Kristian Andersen, researcher</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The alternative possibility is that there was an intermediate host. \u201cThat\u2019s where the pangolins come in,\u201d says Andersen. While the pangolin virus as a whole is less similar to Sars-CoV-2 than the bat virus, the pangolin virus genome does have the crucial binding sequences. This is what Shen, Xiao and their colleagues found \u2013 and it has now been supported by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.03.022\">a further study</a> from another Chinese group.</p> <p>Furthermore, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2169-0\">a study published on 26 March in </a><em><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2169-0\">Nature</a></em> discovered viruses closely related to Sars-CoV-2 in pangolins that had been smuggled into China. These viruses had binding sequences similar to those in the human viruses.</p> <p>\u201cWhere it\u2019s really important is where they\u2019re identical,\u201d says Andersen. \u201cWhile the bat virus overall is more similar, in the regions where it really matters it\u2019s actually quite different.\u201d</p> <p>This suggests that the bat and pangolin viruses met, perhaps in the same host, and exchanged genes. Some of the bat viruses ended up with the key binding sequences from the pangolin viruses, enabling them to infect humans and unleash a pandemic. \u201cRecombination is frequent in these types of viruses,\u201d says Andersen. \u201cIt\u2019s speculative, but it\u2019s highly likely that that\u2019s how we ended up with this new virus.\u201d</p> <p>A similar story played out before the Sars outbreak of 2002-2004. The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0506735102\">original source</a> of the virus was <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1118391\">wild bats</a>, and in 2017 researchers managed to identify <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006698\">a cave in China where the bats carry viruses that are virtually identical to Sars</a>. However, the virus was probably passed to humans via <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/may/24/china.sars\">civets</a>, which are cat-like animals, leading to China imposing <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.301.5636.1031a\">a temporary ban on selling civets</a>. The more recent Mers outbreak probably moved from bats to humans via camels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"95a635223e482f58b2444eca6c3f1246f9d4f6af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95a635223e482f58b2444eca6c3f1246f9d4f6af/0_294_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A seizure by the Singaporean authorities of over 12 tonnes of pangolin scales, April 9, 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A seizure by the Singaporean authorities of over 12 tonnes of pangolin scales, April 9, 2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Parks Board/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, says Andersen, we cannot yet be sure which scenario is correct. Even if there was an intermediate host, it may not have been pangolins.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot conclude if pangolins are indeed [the] intermediate species,\u201d agrees virologist <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arinjay_Banerjee\">Arinjay Banerjee</a> of McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.</p> <h2><strong>Ending demand</strong></h2> <p>The question of whether pangolins contributed to the Covid-19 outbreak will not be settled any time soon. \u201cIt\u2019s probably going to be a long, drawn-out question,\u201d says Andersen. Resolving the origin of Sars took years.</p> <p>But it may be crucial to ending the pangolin trade, because doing so requires two things. The first is strict enforcement of the rules, which China seems to want to do \u2013 it was stepping up enforcement even before the outbreak. The second is for people to stop buying pangolin products. If there is no demand, the illegal trade will become unprofitable, and suppliers will abandon it.</p> <p>\u201cJust the fact there\u2019s been all this publicity about the potential link to pangolins will probably lead to plummeting demand for them,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.traffic.org/about-us/our-organisation/our-staff/\">Richard Thomas</a>, head of communications at Traffic in Cambridge.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>More than 90% of Chinese say they would support a total ban on the trade in wild animals, no matter what the purpose</p> <footer> <cite>Chinese conservation survey</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is evidence that he is right. According to <a href=\"https://www.iccs.org.uk/person/yuhan-li\">Yuhan Li</a> of the University of Oxford, Chinese conservation organisations have been circulating a questionnaire on social media to see how people\u2019s attitudes have shifted. More than 100,000 people have responded, and <a href=\"https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/blog/chinas-announcement-on-wildlife-trade-whats-new-and-what-does-it-mean/\">more than 90% say they would support a total ban on the trade in wild animals</a>, no matter what the intended purpose. It is unclear if people will stick to this once the Covid-19 crisis has passed, but Ling is planning a campaign to strengthen opposition.</p> <p>The realisation that <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/coronavirus-has-finally-made-us-recognise-the-illegal-wildlife-trade-is-a-public-health-issue-133673\">wildlife markets allow diseases to spread to people</a> may spur action. When China announced the ban, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) called it \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wwfchina.org/?5881/WWF-Statement-on-revision-of-Wild-Animals-Protection-Law-in-China\">a timely, necessary and critical step</a>\u201d \u2013 not just for safeguarding the wild animals, but for human health. \u201cThis public health crisis must serve as a wake-up call to end the unsustainable use of endangered animals and their parts, whether as exotic pets, for food consumption or for their perceived medicinal value.\u201d</p> <p>In the best-case scenario, it will not just be pangolins that benefit. Reducing the demand for illegally traded wildlife will help many species \u2013 and protect us all from future pandemics into the bargain.</p>",

That would cause a damaging breakdown of trust at a time when staff are working under intense pressure.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCS) has also advised surgeons not to risk their health by working without adequate personal protective equipment, and said it was deeply disturbed by changes to official guidance.<br><br>He echoed advice from the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) that nurses should refuse to treat patients as a last resort if they are not provided with adequate equipment. \u201cIf fluid repellent gowns or coveralls are not available, then surgeons should not risk their health,\u201d he said in a statement.</p> \n<p>Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary, Gail Cartmail, said the union had advised healthcare staff to refuse to work if they felt they were not being protected from the virus.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cUnite has already advised its 100,000 members that reluctantly NHS and social care staff could legitimately and lawfully decline to put themselves in further danger and risk of injury at work,\u201d she said. \u201cThe continued lack of PPE is a national scandal and the government\u2019s litany of broken promises over the last month is shameful.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cartmail said the health secretary, Matt Hancock, may have to consider his position if he was not able to secure the necessary PPE. She said the situation could not continue, and that health professionals would be quite right to decline to put themselves in danger.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are not just talking about NHS staff in hospitals, but those working in the community, such as health visitors and community nurses, and those employed in social care settings, such as care homes,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>The Royal College of Nursing published <a href=\"https://www.rcn.org.uk/professional-development/publications/rcn-refusal-to-treat-covid-19-uk-pub-009231\">guidance</a> for its members last week, assuring them that if they \u201crefuse to treat for lack of PPE, and are criticised subsequently, the RCN will provide you with legal representation and other support in any proceedings that ensue, without judgment\u201d.</p> \n<p>It acknowledges that criticism could have legal consequences, including dismissal. The guidance says that under employment law, if there are \u201ccircumstances of danger which the employee reasonably believed to be serious and imminent and which they could not reasonably have been expected to avert\u201d, they cannot be fairly dismissed.</p> \n<p>An RCN spokesperson said: \u201cFor nursing staff, this will go against every instinct. But their safety must not be compromised.\u201d</p> \n<p>The GMB union refused to be drawn on whether its members would walk out if they felt unprotected, but the national secretary, Rehana Azam, said it was \u201cadvising all members to contact us if they feel as though their health and safety is being put at risk due to lack of PPE\u201d.</p> \n<p>The union said it had written to the government \u201cstating in the strongest possible terms\u201d the need to protect frontline workers.</p> \n<p>The GMB national officer, Rachel Harrison, accused the government of being too slow to release a PPE plan and of hastily redrawing guidance, describing the process as a \u201clitany of failure\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cNHS and ambulance staff will now face unacceptable risks as a result of gross ministerial incompetence. We won\u2019t let this go unchallenged and will now review the steps we need to take to protect our members,\u201d she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The new guidelines mark a U-turn on original guidance that full-length waterproof surgical gowns should be worn during high-risk procedures.</p> \n<p>More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/doctors-nurses-porters-volunteers-the-uk-health-workers-who-have-died-from-covid-19\">50 frontline healthcare workers have </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/doctors-nurses-porters-volunteers-the-uk-health-workers-who-have-died-from-covid-19\">died</a> of coronavirus, as concerns mount that they are not being adequately protected while working with Covid-19 patients.</p> \n<p>Hancock admitted to MPs on the Commons health and social care select committee on Friday that the NHS was \u201ctight on gowns\u201d, describing it as a \u201cpressure point\u201d.</p> \n<p>About 55,000 gowns were due to be delivered on Friday.</p>",

I\u2019m sure most women agree that we can think of far better things to get \u201cemotionally ambitious\u201d or even \u201ccontrolling\u201d about.</p> <p>This is the central insult embedded in most discussions about housework: that women give a hot damn, that feminine identity is entwined in something as dreary as dragging around a vacuum cleaner. It requires discussion only because, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/29/chore-wars-couples-women-housework\">even today, it remains a gendered tinderbox </a>of unfairness and grievance. Not just that (it can also be about class and society), but which gender is lumbered with most housework (take a wild guess) remains a useful barometer of true equality in the home.</p> <p>It\u2019s surely clearer than ever right now (with us all jammed in together) that mythologising housework is a mug\u2019s game. It is essentially about practicality, not emotions or power-plays. In my experience, most women don\u2019t orgasm while cleaning loos, process emotional pain as they polish taps or feel omnipotent as they change duvet covers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/12/want-to-be-a-male-ally-start-by-helping-clean-the-house\">Just like a man</a>, they\u2019ll think a job needs doing, so they do it.</p> <p>The biggest lie ever told to women \u2013 and about women \u2013 is that they find domestic chores any more interesting, fulfilling or defining than men do. As Trollope must herself have noticed (having her own oeuvre summed up by a domestic appliance), women are only diminished by such a false and reductive view. No one in their right mind would scheme and manipulate to do more housework. Women are generally happy for men to control and dominate in this boring and repetitive \u201cdomain\u201d.</p> <p>Knock yourselves out, guys, we\u2019ll be lying on the sofa, surfing Netflix, chucking down chocolate biscuits, feeling all sad and disenfranchised.</p> <h2>Let them eat cake?

Daniel was responding to the challenge of making a cake without flour, depicting a New Zealand icon, and posting it on Instagram. At first glance, the cake resembles the creature that climbed out of the well in <em><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/scariest-scene-in-the-ring/\">The Ring</a></em>, but closer inspection reveals it to be so much more than that, while simultaneously managing to be so much less.</p> <p>Based on Ardern\u2019s cover shot for the biography, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48526969-jacinda-ardern\">An Extraordinary Leader</a>, the cake is anything but ordinary. The ghostly pale icing is smeared on as if in some confused baking-themed \u201cdirty protest\u201d. There are blackly dribbling eyebrows and lank liquorice strands of hair. The nose is a slightly bigger dollop of icing. Blue eyes stare out horribly. The representation of Ardern\u2019s red top makes it appear as if the cake has had its throat slit. The daubed lips say \u201cJoaquin Phoenix\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/06/joker-review-joaquin-phoenix-ace-turn\">Joker</a> just found your lipstick\u201d. And what Daniel\u2019s cake lacks in flour it makes up for in realistic teeth.</p> <p>Never mind apologising, Daniel should be congratulated \u2013 this must be the first cake to say: \u201cEat me\u2026 before I eat <em>you.</em>\u201d While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/jacinda-ardern-signals-modest-loosening-of-new-zealands-coronavirus-lockdown-rules\">Ardern has been applauded</a> for her leadership during the coronavirus outbreak, Daniel has also provided a valuable public service. With people in the UK and across the world taking up lockdown baking, her cake is a masterclass in what not to do. People can take comfort in the fact that, however dodgy their baking, it will never be as bad as Daniel\u2019s.</p> <h2>Some people have taken a little too well to snitching on others</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39373aaa8c0b00407f72e988c9ac1536be521411\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39373aaa8c0b00407f72e988c9ac1536be521411/0_194_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man sitting on a bench in Regent's Park, London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Man sitting on a park bench?

Occasionally, it\u2019s necessary to report someone to the police, or have a word in public, and sometimes it <em>really</em> isn\u2019t.

  "<p>Hunkered down in our homes for weeks on end, we long to be free. We nostalgically imagine our lives before the pandemic \u2013 recalling what it was like to live in a social world: to dine with friends at a neighborhood restaurant, to visit our elderly parents. Those of us lucky enough \u2013 so far \u2013 to be personally untouched by death and suffering are inevitably wondering: when can we stop living in fear? What can we do to end this physical isolation?</p> <p>To this end, technology companies have put on their \u201ckind capitalism\u201d hats and launched into fix-it mode.

Data-gathering and for-profit tracing technologies are becoming the pre-eminent solution to save lives and to liberate us from the confinement of physical isolation. The only catch, the techno-capitalists tell us, is that <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/10/coronavirus-pandemic-surveillance-privacy-big-data/\">we have to trust them and change our privacy expectations</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/tech-coronavirus-surveilance-state-digital-disrupt\">The tech \u2018solutions\u2019 for coronavirus take the surveillance state to the next level | Evgeny Morozov</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Globally, governments and their private sector partners have already turned to physical- and <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/2020/03/rise-bio-surveillance-state\">bio-surveillance</a> to contain the pandemic. The Russian government is reportedly using facial surveillance technology to <a href=\"https://news.trust.org/item/20200319132732-2c3av\">\u201ccatch\u201d those who may have violated quarantine orders</a>. Various European countries have embraced the use of tech tools including AI-powered \u201clie-detector tests\u201d and drones for \u201cmigration management\u201d and \u201cpopulation control\u201d; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/opinion/coronavirus-surveillance-privacy-rights.html\">alarmed</a> human rights specialists worry about a discriminatory impact on already vulnerable refugees.</p> <p>In the US, Google and Apple have joined forces to create their own panoptic solution. Together, these tech rivals promise to leverage their existing control over <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-10/apple-google-bring-covid-19-contact-tracing-to-3-billion-people\">3 billion</a> people\u2019s operating systems and phones to \u201ccontact trace\u201d, enabling third parties (governments and private entities) to know if users have crossed paths with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19.</p> <p>While some of this may sound hopeful, the intertwining of our existing massive surveillance infrastructure with public health goals should sound many alarms. The developing notion that biometric and location data are now health data is itself misleading. The dangerous conflation glosses over the real problems and differential outcomes that arise when our public health infrastructure becomes linked to profit-based data gathering.</p> <p>By re-packaging their surveillance systems as public health services, technology companies and state authorities are softening opposition to surveillance capitalism, even re-purposing it as a social good, and undermining existing critique. A Customs and Border Protection commissioner, for example, recently <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/04/02/coronavirus-covid-19-surveillance-privacy/\">re-framed the much criticized use of face surveillance at the border as a \u201chygienic\u201d technology</a> that can protect travelers from Covid-19.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We can use this moment to contain the virus while critically interrogating the totalitarian possibilities embedded in unbridled data collection</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The false dichotomy between health and privacy also masks the critical role that contact tracing and other forms of surveillance and data collection have already played in exacerbating the very real disparate impacts of this pandemic on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/coronavirus-race.html\">particular minority communities</a>. In the pre-pandemic world, the personal data that enables contact tracing was used by <a href=\"https://www.cognizant.com/InsightsWhitepapers/US-Consumer-Banks-and-the-Potential-of-Location-Based-Offers-codex1279.pdf\">banks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90395905/experian-just-invested-in-a-location-data-company\">credit score agencies</a> to help tag, measure and rank us. This scoring in turn <a href=\"https://kieranhealy.org/files/papers/classification-situations.pdf\">classified us, entrenching existing socio-economic inequalities</a> by controlling access to housing, loans and even health insurance.</p> <p>So, while surveillance has some potential to mitigate the pandemic, it also has the very real potential to produce anti-democratic, discriminatory practices and structures at a broad, global scale. Once a technology is built and data gathered, it can be used for many purposes beyond that for which it was originally intended. NSO Group, a corporate spyware firm infamous for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/opinion/whatsapp-nso-group-spy.html\">enabling the surveillance of journalists and activists</a>, is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/surveillance-company-nso-supplying-data-analysis-to-stop-virus\">reportedly re-purposing its technology to contract trace</a>. How will the data they collect be stored? When will it be discarded? How else might it be used?</p> <p>There are two paths before us. We can blindly accept that technology capitalism will liberate us from this pandemic and the physical isolation that has come with it. Or we can use this moment to responsibly contain the virus while critically interrogating the totalitarian possibilities embedded in unbridled data collection. If we choose to remain critical, then we must demand massive restrictions on collection, the construction of data walls, and the maintenance of existing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/30/san-francisco-ban-facial-recognition-surveillance\">biometric surveillance bans</a>. We must also ensure that any data collected be used only to combat the spread of the virus and be deleted in a timely manner.</p> <p>Even in a pandemic \u2013 perhaps especially in a pandemic \u2013 data collection, classification, management and use are inherently political. No matter how much we long to return to \u201cnormal,\u201d we must be weary of becoming further imprisoned by the for-profit use of our data. In both controlling the pandemic and rebuilding our worlds, we must remember not to trade our physical isolation for the cages of surveillance capitalism.</p> <ul> <li><p>Veena Dubal is an associate professor of law at the University of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california\">California</a>, Hastings</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>The real hero of Mrs America, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/15/mrs-america-cate-blanchett-fx-hulu\">new FX miniseries</a> chronicling the early 1970s political battle over the Equal Rights Amendment, is Phyllis Schlafly. Schlafly, the conservative movement leader who led the antifeminist backlash against the amendment, styled herself a housewife and mother of six, but really she was an educated, driven and ambitious professional political operator, skilled in forging alliances among unlikely counterparts and manipulating the motivations of others toward her own ends.</p> <p>In the miniseries, a slick, beautifully shot portrait of 1970s America, she is played by Cate Blanchett, who masterfully shows Schlafly finding an outlet for her own frustrated political ambitions in the anti-ERA fight, and rising from a minor conservative commentator on the lunatic fringe to the primary voice of social conservatism on the national stage. As the ERA is defeated \u2013 going from a bipartisan shoo-in that sailed through the Senate to an embattled, controversial document that meets resistance in every statehouse \u2013 the show encourages us to see the downfall of the major political effort of the second wave feminist movement as the result, paradoxically, of one woman\u2019s phenomenal personal determination.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/15/mrs-america-cate-blanchett-fx-hulu\">Mrs America review: Cate Blanchett shines in 70s feminism drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The realities of history were a bit more complicated than that. Though Schlafly was the face of the conservative opposition to the ERA, the show depicts her as that movement\u2019s instigator and sole intellectual origin, with male politicians and movement conservatives shruggingly falling into line behind her. The show depicts her, too, as having resentments about male arrogance and entitlement in her own life, a strain of her character that is meant to draw parallels between Schlafly and the feminist leaders she opposes, such as Gloria Steinem, Bella Abzug, Betty Friedan and Shirley Chisholm. We see the women on either side of the ideological divide smarting at the pains of their own thwarted ambitions, and enduring sexual aggression from men for the sake of achieving their goals: Schlafly wanted to be a congresswoman; Chisholm wanted to be president; Steinem wanted to pass a law through Congress legalizing abortion rights.</p> <p>None of them got what they wanted. In one scene, Schlafly, contemplating a second run for Congress, lets a slimy Washington insider squeeze her waist and make a lewd comment about her dress; later, rage flashes across her face when men in a meeting ask her to take notes for them. She steps out of the office and snaps at the young secretary instead. In the offices of Ms Magazine, Steinem lets the publisher make a gross remark about her legs, because she needs his money to keep it in print.</p> <p>These moments are meant to endear Schlafly to viewers, and at the same time to make sure that the show\u2019s politics are clear: despite who the protagonist is, Mrs America is ultimately on the feminists\u2019 side. But these attempts to draw parallels between Schlafly\u2019s ambitions and anger and that of the feminists risks reducing the differences between them to the temperamental or circumstantial, rather than the ideological and political.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The show is a bit too generous to Schlafly, and one can\u2019t help but think that it is trying to make its subject worthy of its casting</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In real life, Schlafly was not so conflicted. Though her public life and fierce style conflicted tellingly with her prescriptions for women\u2019s behavior, such as modesty, domesticity and obedience, she was a fierce misogynist who wrote and testified passionately that women who experienced sexual harassment brought men\u2019s aggression on themselves. The show is a bit too generous to Schlafly here, and one can\u2019t help but think that it is trying to make its subject worthy of its casting: Blanchett, in a stunning performance, is too skilled and nuanced an actor to play a figure of such uncomplicated contempt as Schlafly herself really was. Mrs America gives Schlafly a depth in fiction that was not there in history.</p> <p>Though Schlafly remains the central figure, the show attempts to treat its other women with interest and generosity as the fight around the ERA progresses through the politically hectic summer of 1972. Gloria Steinem, played willowy and glamorous by Rose Byrne, has become the face of the feminist movement, but she is torn between the cantankerous, uncompromising idealism of Betty Friedan (Tracey Ullman) and the appeasing, results-focused pragmatism of Bella Azbug (Margo Martindale).</p> <p>In the early scenes with Steinem, as she launches Ms Magazine and attempts to harness her considerable media appeal in the service of Shirley Chisholm\u2019s presidential bid, the show veers towards portraying Steinem as a victim of her own celebrity and good looks \u2013 another historical mistake, as in reality Steinem was a savvy and deliberate manipulator of these. But as the show progresses, the script veers from underestimating Steinem to seeing her more clearly, as she attempts, in vain but with the best of intentions, to manipulate a corrupt political system to admirable political ends.</p> <p>But the show\u2019s real triumph is the actor Uzo Aduba, criminally underrated and radiant as Shirley Chisholm. Fraught, frustrated, paranoid and betrayed at the end of her presidential bid, Chisholm is portrayed not as the one-dimensional martyr that feminist history so often makes her, but as an earnest, principled advocate who suffers deep pain at the racist and sexist determination of those around her to underestimate and overlook her talents. Her presidential bid, and her unwillingness to end it as the 1972 Democratic national convention in Miami nears, causes a conflict among the feminists between pragmatism and potential, the dream of a free world with rights and dignity for all women and the need to get results to alleviate the ongoing suffering of sexism. The choices they make, and the way Chisholm herself responds, reveal that this is a false choice, and a trap. Still, when her friends abandon her and her presidential campaign is forced to fold, we can see her pain and disappointment. Her principle and idealism is not depicted in simplistic terms as pure or morally aspirational, but also as tragic, and very lonely. The show gives Chisholm and its viewers a great deal of respect here, by taking her suffering seriously.</p> <p>Mrs America sets out to show history as made by human beings, complete with insecurities, hopes, relatable fears and bad motivations. In this sense, it is not unlike other political dramas that have attempted to depict the agents of power and politics as relatable, familiar and human. In some of its scenes, where women in colorful 70s garments and elaborate hairdos exchange banter while walking briskly through the halls of power, the show can feel a bit like Aaron Sorkin\u2019s The West Wing, though it is a great deal worldlier and more skeptical. Mrs America is not the first show to explore history as a mosaic of human egotism, hopefulness and frailty. But it is one of the first where history is made by the egotism, hopefulness and frailties of women.</p> <ul> <li><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

David wanders up to the stricken player, ostensibly to apologise, and gives him a playful cuff round the left ear with just a little bit of menace, but not so much that Sanchez can be sure it was a deliberate attack.

It\u2019s nothing short of amazing how that failed to end up in a large comic-book cloud of dust with boots and fists sticking out of it.

Why he\u2019s bothering to stop them is anyone\u2019s guess, because there\u2019s no danger of this situation escalating ... as it\u2019s simply not possible to escalate it any further! The pitch is flooded with photographers, officials, and assorted geezers from both benches, all of whom have something to say. This is unreal! Several stramashes are taking place in different areas of the pitch, each starring a few wildly flailing players, officials, and irate folk in suits. It\u2019s like a Breugel painting brought to life by Cecil B DeMille, with the entire cast ripped to the tits on PCP.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e9b09be8f08b7689b030e0b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T14:08:22.798Z\">3.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>8 min:</strong> But he\u2019s not going off.

BRAWL TIME!!!</strong> We\u2019ve not been going long, and yet this has been coming. And what a beautifully choreographed piece of thuggery this is! Leonel Sanchez is meandering near the centre circle. Ferrini, malevolence on his mind, shoves Toro out of the way so he can reach the back of Sanchez\u2019s legs. Wheech! He hacks away with such excitable glee that he falls to the floor before Sanchez does. Sanchez untangles himself and, while still prone, takes a wild swipe at his assailant\u2019s legs. Meantime Toro comes in and blooters the loose ball off Ferrini\u2019s back, then stumbles over the Italian clumsily. This gives Ferrini, still prone, the chance to sweep his studs across Toro\u2019s ankles. They spring up. Toro turns with a view to belting Ferrini in the mushki. He can\u2019t get within arm\u2019s reach, though, as Ferrini sticks up a knee to protect his personal space and his teeth. The referee steps in, boxing style, to usher Ferrini away. Sanchez, one of several players rushing in to see what\u2019s occurring, falls to the floor after being shoved in the chest by the Italian captain Mora. It all calms down soon enough - give or take a pitch invasion of photographers - but for a second that looked like breaking into a 22-man brawl. The initial tangle between Ferrini, Sanchez and Toro also briefly threatened to break into an interpretive dance piece, but let\u2019s not confuse the issue. The referee takes no action whatsoever!!! Let\u2019s hope the players don\u2019t take advantage of that largesse.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e9b08ea8f08bade1f295a4f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T14:05:33.736Z\">3.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>4 min and a bit:</strong> Eyzaguirre cuts in from a deep position on the right and makes ground.

All the while, Fouilloux is standing statue still, piercing eyes fixed upfield, staring out whichever Italian\u2019s attention he can grab. Doesn\u2019t matter who. Rojas takes a preposterous 20-yard run-up and whacks the ball towards the penalty area. He\u2019s surely not trying to score, the free kick\u2019s nearly 40 yards out.

Reporter, producer and presenter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/annabeldeas\">Annabel Deas</a> usually works as a news producer for 5 Live but, \u201cfrustrated by the endless news reports about a child carrying a knife \u2018being in a gang\u2019 \u2013 as if that was an explanation\u201d \u2013 she spent a year in West Yorkshire, talking to children who carry knives and those who care for them.</p> <p>In the first episode she goes into the school that some of the teenagers attend: North Huddersfield Trust. It\u2019s clearly a brilliant school that goes the extra mile: the head spends hours on the phone to social services, trying to get help for her pupils. Soon we meet the grandmother of one of the boys, Aaron, who is in such peril that he had to be taken to Jamaica for a while to get out of danger. Now he\u2019s back, he can\u2019t stay at his mum\u2019s, for fear of gang repercussions. He goes into care. Social services say that he and his family could move to Manchester, for their own safety, but don\u2019t help them to do so.</p> <p>We meet other children: Josh, Daniel, Steven. All around them there is violence. Knifings on their street. Gunshots, but the shooting isn\u2019t reported. Dangerous people move into their homes. We don\u2019t often hear the children talk, which could make <em>Hope High</em> a little frustrating, but Deas\u2019s hard work and skilled storytelling brings their tales to life. She is direct, visceral \u2013 I loved her vivid description of one of the boys eating a McDonald\u2019s \u2013 and she makes you understand. The authorities, according to all the parents, don\u2019t get involved enough. The police don\u2019t prosecute children for having a knife, or carrying a small amount of cocaine, or trying to beat up their mum, because they don\u2019t want to criminalise young people. The result? Teenagers think they can get away with it. And social services seem\u2026 well, let\u2019s call it distracted, to be charitable.</p> <p>One 14-year-old got involved in county lines dealing. He went missing for three weeks. \u201cSocial services were onboard,\u201d says his mum. \u201cI were updating them with any information they needed... they were saying they had a plan, for when he\u2019s caught. But when he came back, they did nothing. Diddly squat.\u201d There was a pattern to her son\u2019s behaviour: she informed the police, reported him as a missing person. She wanted him to be arrested, moved, taken away from her, anything to change his behaviour. But the authorities sat on their hands. Eventually, her son was arrested for a violent assault and sentenced to five years. When he comes out, his childhood will be over.</p> <p>Somewhat frustratingly, <em>Hope High</em> appears to have dropped off BBC Sounds\u2019 podcast recommendations. Perhaps this sort of story seems irrelevant when nobody is going out. But police have said that even now, many young people are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/13/gangs-still-forcing-children-into-county-lines-drug-trafficking-police-covid-19-lockdown\">still being made to cross county lines</a> to deliver drugs. This grooming is not stopping.</p> <p>Just room to mention Radio 3\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006x3hl/episodes/player\">The Essay</a></strong>. Last week it was on the brilliantly interesting topic of single women \u2013 written and presented by my fellow <em>Observer</em> writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rachelcooke\">Rachel Cooke</a>. Cooke is wonderfully well read, but wears her knowledge lightly and with style. In her first essay, she explains that the word \u201cspinster\u201d comes from \u201cspinner\u201d: an unwed woman, orphan or widow who worked with cotton and wool in the family home. Cooke makes the case for replacing \u201cspinster\u201d with \u201cthe odd woman\u201d, which I love. She also covers career girls, the divorcee, widows and aunts \u2013 all fabulous categories of woman, and Cooke clearly enjoys celebrating each one. They are single, but involved in the world. Alone, but far from lonely. Sounds delightful.</p> <h2><strong>Three nice things to have come out of lockdown</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Locked-Together-Audiobook/B086XCP151\">Locked Together</a></strong><br>Audible UK <br>Audible makes great audio (podcasts and audio books), which you usually have to pay for. But earlier this month it launched Audible Stories, making hundreds of audiobooks available for free, to help keep kids and young adults entertained during these quiet times. And now it\u2019s given us these: a set of eight warm and funny podcasts made in lockdown by comedy duos (and one collective, the hilarious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/27/the-joke-is-always-on-us-how-people-just-do-nothing-struck-comedy-gold\">Kurupt FM</a> boys).

On the evening of bank holiday Monday, on the main Absolute station, it staged a resourceful and lovely Front Room festival, with various bands playing tracks live from their homes (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/absoluteradio/status/1249783912261390339\">here\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/absoluteradio/status/1249783912261390339\">Kodaline</a>).

  "<p>Isolation draws us into a closer relationship with the telly but food TV offers more than just a chance to catch up on recipes and techniques. Over recent years, programmes have moved away from \u201cstand and stir\u201d and are now an excellent excuse for all manner of science, cultural history, humour, escapism and pure entertainment.</p> <h2>1 Anthony Bourdain</h2> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=anthony+bourdain&amp;i=instant-video&amp;crid=2Y3D0VKSXGDVC&amp;sprefix=anthony+%2Cinstant-video%2C154&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_i_4_8\">Amazon Prime</a>, 2002-2018</em></p> <p>I love a tight 27 minutes on thrifty ways with mince as much as the next food nerd but, with everyone else gone to bed and everything else going to hell, it\u2019s always going to be me and Anthony Bourdain. I love the early stuff such as <em>A Cook\u2019s Tour </em>(2002-3, Food Network/<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/video/detail/B074HVRJNT/ref=atv_dp_cnc_1_11\">Amazon Prime</a>) which see him reeling around Ho Chi Minh City, dressed like Joe Strummer and jabbering into a lo-fi, hand-held video camera. But there is so much more to choose from. <em>No Reservations</em><em> </em>(2005-12,Travel Channel/<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Penang/dp/B07R3D818R/ref=sr_1_1?crid=197N7ORV9N6XD\">Amazon Prime</a>) allowed Bourdain nine seasons to develop his compelling combination of chill and total engagement with his subject. By around season four, any idea of \u201ccelebrity chef\u201d is subsumed in a search for challenging locations, fascinating and underrepresented people and increasingly honest examinations of his own flawed past.<em> Parts Unknown</em> (2013-18, CNN/<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/video/detail/B07T1RCR4Z/ref=atv_dp_cnc_1_4\">Amazon Prime</a>) contains my two favourite episodes. New Jersey (season 5, episode 6) is an elegiac film that sees him visiting his childhood home with his brother, and in Rome (season 8, episode 9) he is guided around the city by Asia Argento, with whom he later formed a relationship.</p> <h2>2 Chef\u2019s Table</h2> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80007945\">Netflix</a>, 2015-present</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76fc6891708e22224173ea68de6f8d8da6af094b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76fc6891708e22224173ea68de6f8d8da6af094b/0_1217_1867_1120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Asma Kahn in series 6 of Chef\u2019s Table.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Asma Kahn in series 6 of Chef\u2019s Table.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NETFLIX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Did you enjoy <em>This Is Spinal Tap </em>or the <em>The Life of Rock with Brian Pern</em>? The comedy of spoof \u201crockumentary\u201d lies in the uncalibrated self-regard of the subjects and the breathless complicity of the film-maker, so you\u2019re going to love <em>Chef\u2019s Table</em>. From the bombastic Vivaldi over the titles to the shots of Dan Barber, running while philosophising, or Francis Mallmann on his private island, hewing logs and talking about the creative power of sex, it\u2019s difficult to imagine that the first series wasn\u2019t all an expensively executed troll. But that was back in 2015, when we wanted our chefs to be artist/gods/rockstars of their generation and American documentary-makers still had little enough irony to support the idea.</p> <p>As the series progressed they began to profile more female chefs and some of the resulting shows are outstanding. Jeong Kwan, cooking at the Chunjinam Hermitage in South Korea is therapeutic to watch, Cristina Martinez at the South Philly Barbacoa and Mashama Bailey at The Grey in Savannah, Georgia are inspiring, and our own Asma Khan is given space to properly expand on Indian food in the UK. Someone, somewhere turned down the ego dial.</p> <h2>3 The Mind of a Chef</h2> <p><em>PBS, 2012-2017</em><em> \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/mindofachefseries/631307120709693/\">season 6 on Facebook</a></em></p> <p>Takes a similarly hagiographic approach as <em>Chef\u2019s Table</em> but allows each featured chef more space to cook. Gabrielle Hamilton \u2013 troubled, driven, phenomenally talented \u2013 comes across particularly well. It\u2019s probably to her credit that our own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/13/april-bloomfield-chef-new-york\">April Bloomfield</a> actually looks uncomfortable throughout her episodes, awkwardly attempting Delia-esque presentation while the directors try to extract some sort of life philosophy or grandiose soundbite out of her. It\u2019s actually charming and should make us proud.</p> <h2>4 The Taco Chronicles</h2> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81040704\">Netflix</a>, 2019</em></p> <p>Carlos Perez Osorio\u2019s show will make you believe that there might actually be a future for intelligent food programmes on TV. Each of the six half-hour episodes covers a different type of taco in obsessive depth. The show is in Spanish and subtitled, a serious deep dive into the subject, but delivered with a brilliant tone \u2013 fantastically, poetically hyperbolic about street food, enthusiastic but self-aware.</p> <h2>5 Madhur Jaffrey\u2019s Flavours of India</h2> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p05rtvrt/madhur-jaffreys-flavours-of-india\">BBC iPlayer</a>, 1995</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f7e271072adf0010ef81b3342c04fa29b5ad4cca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7e271072adf0010ef81b3342c04fa29b5ad4cca/0_34_1712_2138/801.jpg\" alt=\"Madhur Jaffrey on the BBC\u2019s Flavours of India: \u2018Calm, dignified and utterly no-nonsense.\u2019\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Madhur Jaffrey on the BBC\u2019s Flavours of India: \u2018Calm, dignified and utterly no-nonsense.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC PHOTOLIBRARY</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>BBC iPlayer is a positive treasure vault of old favourites, offering a great deal of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b03j86yd/floyd-on-france\">Keith Floyd\u2019s </a>unhinged, plonk-fuelled pan-rattling and Ken Hom\u2019s masterful <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p05rsy31/ken-homs-chinese-cookery-rice\">Chinese Cooking</a></em>. They are welcome old friends but favourite must be Jaffrey\u2019s six-part series on regional Indian cooking. Her on-camera persona is calm, dignified and utterly no-nonsense, presenting challengingly authentic recipes in the most authoritative manner. If you think this sounds a bit too worthily BBC2 \u2026 check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQVsVNPkPmE\">her debut as a rapper</a> in a YouTube video by Brooklyn MC, Mr Cardamom.</p> <h2>6 The Chef Show</h2> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81028317\">Netflix</a>, 2019 to present</em></p> <p>Jon Favreau is a producer and actor who starred in the movie <em>Chef</em>, with his chef mate Roy Choi, and quite fancies himself as a chef. In <em>The Chef Show </em>(see what he did there?), they hang out in the borrowed kitchens of their Hollywood buddies. It has about as much script or editorial control as a podcast, but with full quality video. What is most noticeable is that there\u2019s no attempt to give recipes \u2026 in fact, all the ingredients seem to arrive pre-prepped and measured in tiny plastic pots. I want to hate the OG bro-fest format, but it\u2019s actually compelling if you relax into it.</p> <h2>7 Julia Child and Jacques Pepin</h2> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=julia+child\">YouTube</a></em></p> <p>The next time you\u2019re down the YouTube rabbit hole, seek out Julia Child.

  "<h2>Johan Lundgren, chief executive, easyJet</h2> <p>For Lundgren, memories of one particular meeting underline just how swiftly coronavirus turned from a distant Chinese problem into an insurmountable block on aviation.</p> <p>It was 3 March and Lundgren was in Brussels for a summit of A4E \u2013 an airline association that includes carriers such as easyJet, Ryanair, BA, Lufthansa, and Air France-KLM. The main subjects for discussion were airspace management and green targets. With coronavirus restrictions at that point limited to northern Italy, Ryanair said plummeting demand would be a short-term blip.</p> <p>Lundgren says: \u201cI remember some companies were saying it wouldn\u2019t have a big impact. And I said, \u2018We don\u2019t know anything about this. It\u2019s very uncertain \u2013 you can never tell.\u2019 I wish I had been wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Four weeks later, easyJet\u2019s entire 337-strong fleet was grounded.</p> <p>\u201cFirst and foremost it was a public health issue, so the focus was on the wellbeing of our people and customers. It\u2019s one of those things: when the virus first hits you and you get the first reported case, it becomes very, very real.\u201d</p> <p>At this point, easyJet had only one reported coronavirus case among operating crew, and the airline does not know if they contracted the disease on board.</p> <p>The majority of easyJet employees around Europe have been put on furlough \u2013 just over half of them in the UK scheme. \u201cWe had around 14,000 staff, and now there are about 650 people working, almost all from home.\u201d</p> <p>He holds daily remote conferences with his team and tries to communicate with the whole company via Facebook\u2019s Workplace platform. He says those employees who have not been furloughed staff have never worked harder: \u201cPeople are flat out \u2026 It\u2019s the biggest crisis aviation has ever gone through.\u201d</p> <p>For Lundgren, the main focus is financial \u2013 \u201cgetting access to liquidity, and to reduce the cash burn so we can survive and manage a prolonged scenario\u201d. That has included renegotiating a \u00a34.5bn contract with Airbus for new aircraft \u2013 a deal that has been the subject of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/easyjet-agrees-delay-with-airbus-on-delivery-of-24-new-aircraft\" title=\"\">broadsides from easyJet\u2019s founder and biggest shareholder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou</a>, who last week called for Lundgren to be sacked.</p> <p>The easyJet chief says keeping in touch with staff is vital: \u201cClearly there are a lot of people out there sitting at home, without work, concerned, who want to get back flying. You want to be sure that as we go through this crisis, you don\u2019t leave them out. But it\u2019s hard. We\u2019re not getting everything right.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/10/airlines-law-refunds-voucher-schemes-coronavirus\" title=\"\">EasyJet has been criticised for not automatically offering refunds</a>, and for being slow to cancel flights when restrictions meant passengers were unlikely to travel. Lundgren says the company has been doing its best: \u201cYou make sure you look after, as much as you can, your customers during this process \u2013 and that\u2019s difficult. We\u2019ve got customer call centres in countries affected by the lockdown, that have been operating with limited access when the demand has been very high.\u201d</p> <p>The airline is maintaining \u2013 rather than mothballing \u2013 its fleet, so the planes can be ready to fly again at 15 days\u2019 notice, and Lundgren says the airline is in daily communication with EASA, the European safety regulator, about measures that could be needed for flights to restart \u2013 from disinfecting planes to blocking off middle seats.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to do it in a way that\u2019s safe, orderly and matches the demand that\u2019s out there. But at the same time, no one knows what will happen.\u201d<br><strong>Gwyn Topham</strong></p> <h2>Philip Jansen, chief executive, BT</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e242186b3ff9987b3d2d622b3e0964c9ea878e3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e242186b3ff9987b3d2d622b3e0964c9ea878e3d/0_418_6916_4149/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Jansen, chief executive of BT. \u2018My priorities were to keep customers connected and staff safe.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Jansen, chief executive of BT. \u2018My priorities were to keep customers connected and staff safe.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The coronavirus outbreak hit home for Jansen when he became the first FTSE-100 boss to be <a href=\"https://amp.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/13/bt-chief-executive-philip-jansen-tests-positive-for-coronavirus\" title=\"\">publicly confirmed </a><a href=\"https://amp.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/13/bt-chief-executive-philip-jansen-tests-positive-for-coronavirus\" title=\"\">as infected with the virus, in mid-March.</a></p> <p>At that time, BT had already started changing the way it worked in some territories. \u201cWe had started in China, Hong Kong, Italy and Spain at the end of February and early March, as social distancing and lockdowns were implemented,\u201d he says. \u201cThen it became clear that the virus was in the UK. We were a little bit ahead because of our experience in other countries.</p> <p>\u201cThe week I began to have symptoms, the advice was to come to work but keep your distance. I turned up to meetings with the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, and new Ofcom chief executive Melanie Dawes \u2013 and deliberately didn\u2019t shake their hands.\u201d</p> <p>At the end of the second week of March, when Jansen tested positive and self-isolated with his family at their second home in Devon, the UK had recorded only 11 deaths and almost 800 cases.</p> <p>\u201cI had mild symptoms,\u201d he said. \u201cI was always up early, always working. My most important priorities were to keep customers connected and keep our staff safe.\u201d</p> <p>He continued to lead the company and his first job was to film a six-minute video for the 120,000 employees of BT, which includes mobile operator EE as well as Openreach, which runs the UK\u2019s broadband network.</p> <p>When the lockdown started, BT immediately saw a doubling of broadband usage as the country became housebound. Staff absence, due to self-isolation or sickness, is a particular problem. At times up to 20% of staff have been off work, and the company is currently down about 12%, he says.</p> <p>\u201cWe have 25,000 call-centre people, and we handle all the 999 calls \u2013 which have seen a massive spike. We have 30,000 engineers out there working on the broadband and phone network. They are all key workers, and at one stage we were 4,500 down.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most serious issues Jansen and other telecoms companies are dealing with is the spate of attacks on mobile phone masts by conspiracy theorists who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/14/arsonists-attack-phone-mast-serving-nhs-nightingale-hospital\" title=\"\">wrongly believe 5G technology is linked to the spread of the virus.</a></p> <p>\u201cWe have had 45 incidents, ranging from burning masts \u2013 about 18 \u2013 to barbed wire being put around fixed poles where people saw a shiny box and thought it was 5G kit when it wasn\u2019t at all,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have had people driving their cars at our Openreach engineers then swerving at the last minute to intimidate them, as well as verbal and physical abuse.\u201d</p> <p>He is scathing about the conspiracy theorists: \u201c It is more dangerous lying in the sunshine than walking past a 5G mast. It is unfounded nonsense.\u201d</p> <p>Jansen recognises that BT is not under the immense pressure that many businesses have found themselves under during lockdown. However, he says, its pay-TV operation is being hurt by there being no sport on air, and it will also be hit if many of the small businesses it provides telecoms services to do not survive.</p> <p>\u201cThe good news is everyone needs what we do,\u201d he says. People need connectivity more than ever before. But we are not immune. The two big areas are BT Sport and the impact on small and medium-sized businesses, restaurants and leisure centres and the like. We can see businesses in deep trouble, and if they fold, that will impact us. But we will weather the storm.\u201d <br><strong>Mark Sweney</strong></p> <h2>James Morris, managing director, Trafalgar Marquees</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3c30df73e5bee3a5657467cccaaaf7d21bdcf6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3c30df73e5bee3a5657467cccaaaf7d21bdcf6e/0_339_4449_2670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Morris, MD of Trafalgar Marquees\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Morris first realised coronavirus could be a problem in late February, when a German company cancelled its marquee booking for a corporate event in London in June. \u201cAt that point,\u201d he recalls, \u201cwe slightly shrugged it off, and said it was a bit extreme to cancel for June.\u201d But it was only the beginning.</p> <p>Morris would usually be gearing up for the busiest time of year for his events company, which he founded in 2007 using his student overdraft. He had, he says, the \u201cstrongest order book ever\u201d for his marquees, furniture and lighting.</p> <p>The company had been preparing to take on temporary staff and hire vans in April to take equipment to about six events per week, ranging from corporate meetings and outdoor opera to a food festival. Instead, he has lost \u00a3100,000 in cancelled and postponed bookings and has hurriedly tried to cut costs. \u201cOur income has just fallen off a cliff. We are doing some work for the NHS, but it doesn\u2019t really touch the sides.\u201d</p> <p>Morris\u2019s request for an overdraft extension from his bank \u2013 NatWest, part of Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 was refused. He has subsequently tried to apply for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/15/covid-19-bailout-loans-issued-uk-firms-banks\" title=\"\">government\u2019s coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (Cbils)</a>, but the bank has told him his business is not eligible as it is \u201cnot viable\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe have invested heavily back in the business, so we have made a loss, but that\u2019s due to our investment. All our assets are fully owned, they are not financed,\u201d says Morris. He claims NatWest has \u201cstonewalled\u201d him and looked only at Trafalgar\u2019s accounts for the last six months, including the quiet winter period, which he says is unrepresentative.</p> <p>Morris had six weeks\u2019 worth of cash in the bank before the shutdown.

Instead, sales are down by two-thirds after the company closed its stores a few days ahead of last month\u2019s high street lockdown.</p> <p>Chief executive Neil Clifford says online trade is up 10% \u2013 led by an 80% jump in sales of slippers as the nation stays indoors \u2013 but it\u2019s nowhere near enough to offset the lost store sales. \u201cIt\u2019s a shocker. I used to be depressed by a 10% drop; now I look and it\u2019s down 66%,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Clifford reckons it will take three years to rebuild to where Kurt Geiger started the year \u2013 on a high with record takings of nearly \u00a3400m, underlying profits of \u00a340m and 10 new shops planned.</p> <p>It is hoped shops will be able to reopen in June, and summer stock sold in July and August. But in the meantime Kurt Geiger has slashed costs where possible, freezing rents and benefiting from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/17/billions-in-loans-scrapping-of-rates-the-chancellors-help-for-businesses\" title=\"\">business rates </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/17/billions-in-loans-scrapping-of-rates-the-chancellors-help-for-businesses\" title=\"\">holiday</a>. It has had to cancel orders, delay shipments and try to repurpose materials, such as leather ordered for summer footwear, into styles appropriate for autumn. Despite that, it has mountains of stock which is unlikely to sell this year, though some will be held until next spring or summer.</p> <p>Clifford has been encouraging employees not required at work to volunteer for the NHS. He is offering 50% discounts for health workers and giving away 2 million pairs of shoes to NHS staff.</p> <p>He is also not drawing a salary until stores reopen, and expects to ask higher-paid staff to take a pay cut next month. But he is topping up the pay of the 83% of employees who are furloughed. Clifford says the firm has been able to do the right thing with support from its banker, Lloyds, and private equity backer Cinven. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to come out of this on the right side from a human perspective,\u201d he says. \u201cIt gives the message to employees that everyone\u2019s together on this. But there is no manual for this event. It\u2019s not something you could Google \u2013 what to do in a pandemic.\u201d</p> <p>As the business fights these battles, it is also planning for a different future: Clifford believes this will accelerate the move to online.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clearly an awful time for everyone.

  "<p>Pandemics \u2013 as the historian <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19d90308-6858-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75\">Yuval Noah Harari</a> has observed \u2013 press the fast-forward button on history. Suddenly, changes that would in pre-corona times have generated years of debate, dissent, hesitation, opposition and delay turn out to be possible overnight.</p> <p>Exhibit A in this context is the way in which hundreds of thousands of white-collar workers are suddenly able \u2013 indeed, required \u2013 to work from home.</p> <p>Exhibit B \u2013 more worrying \u2013 is the way governments are either <a href=\"https://pandemicbigbrother.online/en/\">already deploying</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/growth-in-surveillance-may-be-hard-to-scale-back-after-coronavirus-pandemic-experts-say\">actively considering</a>, surveillance technology of such intrusiveness that it would have caused outrage and furious protests even a month ago.</p> <p>Exhibit C is <a href=\"https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/apple-and-google-partner-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology\">the decision</a> of the two huge tech companies that control mobile phone technology \u2013 Apple with its iOS operating system and Google with Android \u2013 to create application programming interfaces (APIs) that will enable governments to build and deploy proximity-tracking apps on every smartphone in the world. This is remarkable in two ways. One, it involves cooperation between the two members of a global duopoly that would normally trigger antitrust suits \u2013 yet there hasn\u2019t been even a whimper from competition authorities. And two, the companies insist that if governments do not comply with the conditions that they \u2013 Apple and Google \u2013 are laying down, then they will withdraw the APIs. The specific condition is that apps using the APIs are not mandatory for citizens. They have to be opt-in. So here we have two powerful global corporations laying down the law to territorial sovereigns. Unthinkable a month ago. But now\u2026</p> <p>Signs of dramatic changes are everywhere \u2013 even in GP surgeries. The <em>New York Times</em> published an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/world/europe/telemedicine-uk-coronavirus.html\">interesting report</a> on how the work of GPs in London is being transformed by the virus. \u201cWe\u2019re basically witnessing 10 years of change in one week,\u201d one GP told the paper. \u201cIt used to be that 95% of patient contact was face-to-face: you go to see your doctor, as it has been for decades, centuries. But that has changed completely.\u201d Before the virus, video appointments made up only 1% of annual appointments with British GPs and other practice staff. But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/gps-told-to-switch-to-remote-consultations-to-combat-covid-19\">NHS has urged</a> thousands of clinics across the country to start switching to remote consultations and has fast-tracked approval of digital providers to ramp up their offerings.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is still a serious digital divide and on the wrong side of it are many elderly people \u2013 who are the most at risk</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of these providers is accuRx, which was already being used by many GPs as a trusted tool for sending text messages to patients. As the crisis deepened, accuRx built a video-calling system <em>over a weekend</em> after the virus arrived in the UK and has \u2013 according to the <em>NYT</em> report \u2013 quickly become \u201cthe go-to provider for online appointments, offering a stripped-down interface and the comfort of having long been in primary care clinics\u201d. Having watched one of their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aryAqMqdHg0&amp;feature=youtu.be\">instructional videos</a>, I can see why it\u2019s taken off. Zoom could learn a few tricks from them.</p> <p>While the pandemic continues to turn the world upside down, new realisations are beginning to dawn on us. As the tech analyst Ben Evans <a href=\"https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/4/13/covid-and-forced-experiments\">puts it</a>: \u201cWe\u2019re all online now, and, just as importantly, we\u2019re all willing to use this for any part of our lives, if you can work out the right experience and business model. Today, anyone will do anything online.\u201d</p> <p>Well, up to a point. While it\u2019s true that not being online suddenly puts one at a real disadvantage, community volunteers up and down the country are realising that there is still a serious digital divide: and on the wrong side of it are many elderly people \u2013 who are the most at risk from the virus.</p> <p>The most important implication of the breakneck changes currently under way, though, is that there\u2019s no going back to normality. That train has left the station. The coronavirus isn\u2019t going away. And even when there is a vaccine, the risk will endure, because climate change and the erosion of wildlife habitats will <a href=\"https://jembendell.com/2020/03/23/the-climate-for-corona-our-warming-world-is-more-vulnerable-to-pandemic/\">ensure a ready supply</a> of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis\">zoonotic viruses</a>. Companies will have learned to build supply chains with resilience built in. White collar workers will have discovered that they don\u2019t have do as much commuting as before. Air travel will go back to being a luxury. And so on.</p> <p>A useful metaphor for the new normal will be what happens when driving a car on black ice. The worst thing to do is to slam on the brakes, because then you completely lose control. Instead you pump them \u2013 brake a little, then back off and repeat the process until back on gritty tarmac. Our immediate futures will be like that: a combination of what some people are beginning to call \u201cthe hammer and the dance\u201d \u2013 the hammer of successive lockdowns followed by digital dances in which we use surveillance and testing to find and control outbreaks. We are heading into a cautious, rather than a brave, new world \u2013 with Orwellian overtones. I wonder what Aldous Huxley would have made of that.</p> <h2>What I\u2019m reading</h2> <p><strong>Covid and forced experiments<br></strong>A long and <a href=\"https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/4/13/covid-and-forced-experiments\">thoughtful essay</a> by Benedict Evans.

  "<p><strong>I was born in 1981 and raised as an only child</strong>, so a lot of this will be about my mum. I\u2019m remembering the lovely food she made. And I\u2019m picturing this kitchen with a really odd, red linoleum floor, check red. I stood next to her a lot at the sink, while she was washing and I was drying \u2013 it\u2019s a good time and place to chat. I never really cooked alongside her, but I don\u2019t know why.</p> <p><strong>Mum\u2019s home food </strong>was comfy, exquisite and she was also capable of the most wonderful gourmet food. She\u2019d mix the rice and dal with stuff and roll these easy-to-pick-up extra-softened little balls of rice. I have a very vivid memory of them. I think she\u2019s the best cook in the world. Lots of people say that about their own mothers, but many people say it about my mother. </p> <p><strong>Some of my mother\u2019s Indian friends\u2019 daughters</strong> would be learning to cook with their mother and they\u2019d tease me about learning sitar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/24/tribute-to-ravi-shankar-albert-hall-hariprasad-chaurasia-anoushka\">with my dad, Ravi Shankar,</a> instead. It was nothing nasty but I developed a complex about it.</p> <p><strong>I ate Bengali food after my parents married</strong> and Dad started living with us, in both Willesden and in Delhi for three years, and then we all moved to California. Dad said he could make a really good dal, but I never saw him cook during the whole time we lived together.</p> <p><strong>My memories of meal</strong><strong>times</strong> are a real bleed of music and food. Music never really stopped in the music room, because everyone would move out to the table with their sitars. My dad would have an idea and we\u2019d all be keeping time at the table, singing along, keeping patterns. And so many artists coming through, with amazing discussions around me.</p> <p><strong>George Harrison became my uncle</strong> \u2013 not by blood but through love. It\u2019s sort of an Indian cultural thing. He was deeply into the ayurvedic system and often talked to me about that. George and I were close and he was very jovial. I mean, both he and my dad were real jokesters, so there was a lot of laughter at the table.</p> <p><strong>Moving to California made things better</strong>, somehow. In London, there\u2019d been a real self-consciousness about being Asian. I felt that in California it didn\u2019t mean anything to anyone \u2013 no one knew anything about India! \u2013 and that I could just make my own identity.</p> <p><strong>Food is quite tricky for younger people who move and travel.</strong> I see it in my own kids now. Milk\u2019s different in different countries; bread\u2019s totally different. So, I remember getting quite teary whenever we moved. But usually only for a couple of days.</p> <p><strong>One thing I\u2019m really finicky about</strong> is having proper kettles around. So I always carry one in my suitcase. I feel protected when I\u2019m holding a really hot mug of tea.</p> <h2>My favourite things</h2> <p><strong>FOOD</strong><br>A good salad full of protein, vegetables, leaves.</p> <p><strong>DRINK<br></strong>Tea. Breakfast tea, homemade chai, camomile, matcha latte.</p> <p><strong>RESTAURANT<br></strong>I love scrambled eggs at the Wolseley as a special, decadent brunch. The texture is just perfect \u2013 really creamy and sort of done but not done. I can\u2019t get them right at home. I\u2019m always one or two seconds out, one way or the other.</p> <p><em>Love Letters is out now (Mercury KX)</em></p> <ul> <li><p><em>This interview took place before the UK lockdown</em></p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>",

The city\u2019s post-handover mini-constitution, the Basic Law, bars the mainland Chinese government from interfering in Hong Kong affairs, and article 22 states that no department under the Chinese central and local governments \u201cmay interfere in the affairs which the Hong Kong special administrative region administers on its own in accordance with this law.\u201d</p> \n<p>But the liaison office statement, published late on Friday, asserts that \u201ca high degree of autonomy is not complete autonomy.\u201d It stresses that Hong Kong\u2019s right to self-rule is \u201cauthorised by the central government.\u201d</p> \n<p>The statement argues that the liaison office and the HKMAO \u201care not what is referred to in article 22 of the Basic Law, or what is commonly understood to be \u2018departments under the central people\u2019s government\u2019.\u201d It adds that the offices derive their authority both from China\u2019s constitution and the Basic Law.</p> \n<p>This week, pro-democracy lawmakers accused the Chinese government of \u201cblatant intervention\u201d and violation of article 22 of the Basic Law after the HKMAO said some lawmakers were guilty of misconduct in public office for delaying bills, failing to appoint a House committee chairman and paralysing the legislature by filibustering.</p> \n<p>The liaison office statement said people who made such allegations were distorting the Basic Law and misleading public opinion, adding that \u201cloyalty to the country is a necessary requirement\u201d for lawmakers.</p> \n<p>China law expert Prof Jerome Cohen at the New York University descibed China\u2019s statement is \u201castounding and incendiary\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/test-trace-lessons-hong-kong-avoiding-coronavirus-lockdown\">Test and trace: lessons from Hong Kong on avoiding a coronavirus lockdown</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cIf taken seriously, it collapses the whole one country, two systems edifice that was constructed over so many years since the joint declaration,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Prof Michael Davis, a global fellow at the Wilson Center and former law professor at the University of Hong Kong, said China\u2019s aggressive language would \u201cresult in further pushback\u201d from Hong Kong society, which has already experienced its most severe political crisis.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe danger is that Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy will be squandered and this has implications for all countries that have relied on the promises made to Hong Kong,\u201d he said. \u201cThis fear that Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy will be lost, along with it the rule of law, is what has driven the many protests in Hong Kong and international concern.\u201d</p> \n<p>Alvin Cheung, a legal scholar specialising in Hong Kong issues at New York University, said: \u201c[The fact that] Beijing is not even pretending to keep up appearances heralds a dark new stage in Hong Kong\u2019s post-1997 development \u2026 It suggests repression will intensify further.\u201d</p> \n<p>A Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office spokesperson said in a statement that the UK government was concerned about the arrests and stressed that the right to peaceful protest was \u201cprotected in both the joint declaration and the Basic Law\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is essential that any protests are conducted peacefully, and that the authorities avoid actions that inflame tensions. The authorities should focus on rebuilding trust through a process of meaningful political dialogue,\u201d the statement said.</p> \n<p>Chris Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong, said while the world\u2019s attention is focused on the covid-19 epidemic, Beijing has taken \u201cyet another step towards burying one-country, two-system\u201d and the arrests show that \u201cBeijing is determined to throttle Hong Kong\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said the liaison office\u2019s claim that it is not bound by the basic law is \u201ca reckless argument which shows that Xi Jinping is determined to abandon the policies pursued by his predecessors, even at the cost of destroying Hong Kong\u2019s way of life\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt should be rejected immediately by all those governments and parliaments around the world who know the importance of safe-guarding the high degree of autonomy which is guaranteed by the Basic Law.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lee, often dubbed the \u201cFather of Democracy\u201d in Hong Kong and a drafter of the Basic Law, said after he was released on bail that he had \u201cno regrets\u201d and felt \u201cproud to walk the road of democracy with the outstanding youths in Hong Kong\u201d.</p>",

She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following events she chooses not to disclose, and has intermittent anxiety and depression. She lives between London and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, and is expecting her first child.</p> <p><strong>How did you first realise that being outdoors helped your mental health?<br></strong>\u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed being outdoors \u2013 I grew up in the country, and I was nerdily into gardening as a child. When I got sick, my GP insisted that I got out of the house every day. When she found out I used to do a lot of riding, she said: \u201cWell can you book yourself some riding lessons?\u201d She\u2019d be as interested in what I was doing outdoors as she was in how my medication was working.</p> <p>But it was on my second bout of sickness leave that I really began to focus on what nature could offer. This was during the snap election in 2017, which I was too ill to cover. I made myself go for a walk every day and I started to notice all the wildflowers growing outside our house, and thought: \u201cWhy don\u2019t I make a note of everything I see and photograph them?\u201d</p> <p>I was in Cumbria, which is one of the best places in the country for wild orchids, and I discovered that there was a site not that far from me. I got so immersed in looking for these plants, which are quite hard to find, and the concentration required meant I wasn\u2019t thinking about all the corrosive stuff.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I didn\u2019t want this to be just another book about how someone went for a walk and didn\u2019t feel quite so depressed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Of everything you tried \u2013 running, hiking, wild swimming, forest bathing, and more \u2013 what worked best?<br></strong>Cold-water swimming has made such a difference, not just to my daily mood but my ability to cope with some of the situations that trigger flashbacks and my tendency to get really angry. I\u2019m not naturally an angry person, but I have been very angry at times, and it helps you control your fight-or-flight response, as you are leaping into freezing-cold water.</p> <p>Once my partner, John [former Labour MP John Woodcock], drove me to Coniston Water after a particularly bad flashback, and he said between me going into the water and getting back out, the difference was \u201clike Izzy is back again\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Is being outdoors helpful in protecting mental health during the coronavirus </strong><strong>pandemic?<br></strong>It\u2019s going to be really important for people that they have some way of getting out, whether it\u2019s exercising or looking for nature wherever they are. Even in urban areas, it\u2019s there. One of my most exciting botanical finds was in a car park in Glasgow, which was a really rare orchid called <a href=\"https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/wildflowers/broad-leaved-helleborine\">a helleborine</a>.</p> <p><strong>What if you\u2019re quarantined inside?<br></strong>You can still keep a log of what birds you see out of your window. People always assume that in the middle of a city it\u2019s just pigeons, but you might see sparrowhawks, you might see a peregrine falcon \u2013 they nest around tall buildings \u2013 and we\u2019ll start to see migratory birds coming back for the spring. You\u2019ll see crows, maybe magpies and jays \u2013 they\u2019re very intelligent birds and watching their behaviour is very satisfying. You could also start growing some salads and micro-greens on a windowsill.</p> <p><strong>Is this your way of managing symptoms, rather than a cure?</strong><br>Yes, that\u2019s really important. I\u2019ve seen people saying: \u201cIsabel Hardman used to have really bad mental health, but NOW\u2026\u201d Well, I\u2019ve just spent the last two months off sick. It\u2019s about coping strategies, alleviating symptoms, sometimes avoiding a downward spiral. But my illness is still there: it\u2019s inventive, it\u2019s cunning, it\u2019s powerful. It\u2019s really important that we don\u2019t see mental illness as something you have for a bit, and then if you put in enough effort, you conquer it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c95767e0176d06046c7a47e3cff8aab1c477f7e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c95767e0176d06046c7a47e3cff8aab1c477f7e3/0_780_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Isabel Hardman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hardman at the end of a 10-mile run in aid of Refuge in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What about really severe cases of mental illness?<br></strong>I didn\u2019t want this to be just another book about how someone went for a walk and didn\u2019t feel quite so depressed; I really wanted to talk about people being sectioned too. When I went to Bethlem [a London psychiatric hospital using gardening as therapy for inpatients] I was really struck by how they had designed their garden so that people didn\u2019t hang themselves in it.</p> <p><strong>Has pregnancy changed your routine?<br></strong>I\u2019ve had to adapt \u2013 I\u2019d got used to managing un-pregnant me, who could go for a six-mile run! I\u2019ve had to learn new coping mechanisms, and that\u2019s going to be the case once the baby arrives too.</p> <p><strong>Do you see the stigma surrounding mental health lifting?<br></strong>I knew people were going to be kind when I said I was unwell, but I think there\u2019s still a lot of stigma for people with severe mental illness \u2013 talk to anyone who has OCD or schizophrenia, and they don\u2019t think the stigma is lifting at all. And many people still haven\u2019t really grasped what the symptoms of even really common mental illness are. When I\u2019ve been paranoid or angry it\u2019s: \u201cYou\u2019re not really allowed to be ill in <em>that </em>way, you\u2019re allowed to be sad.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Does focusing on self-help strategies let the government off the hook of funding better mental health treatment?</strong><br>It\u2019s so easy for politicians to use social prescribing and talk about the importance of outdoor exercise as a way of masking the fact that they\u2019re not investing in beds. But it\u2019s not a case of substituting [treatment] for going for a run, it\u2019s that it\u2019s <em>part</em> of your treatment. I don\u2019t want people to think I\u2019m suggesting this as an alternative, but just as physiotherapy is really important in some physical conditions, these sorts of things are an important part of recovery.

  "<p>A ruined <em>yal\u0131</em>, or Bosphorus mansion, is still standing on the shore of the largest island of the Istanbul archipelago. The roof is long gone and the once manicured gardens have colonised its insides, but in better days it was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/08/leon-trotsky-turkish-island-hideaway-property-sale\">magnificent home </a>of Leon Trotsky, who fled to Constantinople after his exile from the Soviet Union in 1929.</p> <p>Trotsky arrived during the turbulent birth of modern Turkey. While the new republic sought to rid itself of Armenians, Greeks and other \u201cundesirable\u201d populations, at the same time Istanbul was opening its arms to White Russians, disillusioned Bolsheviks and African American jazz musicians. Later in the 20th century, intellectuals and dissidents from Germany and the Balkans would add to the diversity of a city that has always stood at the world\u2019s crossroads.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902Wqy6Ul6GNIt9/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902Wqy6Ul6GNIt9/\">Graphic</a> </figure>  <p>A similar dynamic is playing out in Turkey today. On the one hand, domestic opposition to President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government is met with disproportionate force, and journalists, human rights activists and Kurdish politicians languish in prison on terrorism charges. Yet on the other, Istanbul has become a beacon of safety for persecuted people across the Muslim world. Here, Uighur refugees practise their faith freely; young Saudis and Iranians dance the night away; and Arab activists displaced by the Arab Spring still raise their voices against the regimes they fled at home.</p> <p>\u201cTurkey is increasingly looking eastward, away from its Nato partners, to its old sphere of influence during the Ottoman Empire,\u201d said <a href=\"https://carnegie-mec.org/experts/1346\">Mohan</a><a href=\"https://carnegie-mec.org/experts/1346\">ad Hage Ali</a>, a fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center. \u201cIts cultural influence can be seen all over the Middle East today: there are new Arabic translations of Turkish poets, and novels about the city coming out in Arabic. Over the last two decades we\u2019ve seen a strong cultural bridge form.\u201d</p> <p>While the Arab world used to centre around the cultural output of Cairo in the 1950s and Beirut in the 1970s, today most look to Istanbul\u2019s screen stars. When Ramadan begins on Thursday, people across the Middle East are looking forward to a month of reruns of beloved Turkish television shows \u2013 dramatic tales of sultans and harem girls and soapy modern love stories.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f948be359bf74ab65f5b1ebb5b59e751fbd14ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f948be359bf74ab65f5b1ebb5b59e751fbd14ab/0_196_3469_2081/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nobel peace prize winner Tawakkol Karman, of Yemen, during a protest over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi outside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nobel peace prize winner Tawakkol Karman, of Yemen, during a protest over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi outside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murad Sezer/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The old political fervour of Cairo and Beirut has relocated to Istanbul, too. The city of 17 million people is now home to an estimated 2 million Arabs, who have opened coffee shops, book stores, theatre and media companies, and joined the staff of universities. Thanks to Turkey\u2019s generous visa system and location as a transport hub, it is easier for families scattered across the world to meet in Istanbul than elsewhere.</p> <p>The Arab Media Association of Istanbul numbers 850 journalists, including Yemeni Nobelpeace prize winner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/07/tawakkul-karman-profile\">Tawakkol Karman</a> and Egyptian Ayman Nour, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/28/ayman-nour-pardoned-egypt\">former politician</a> who fled after the 2013 coup that bought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/abdel-fatah-al-sisi\">President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi </a>to power. Both now run opposition television stations.</p> <p>\u201cIstanbul revitalised the Arab Spring in a way no other place could,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/labib-al-nahhas\">Labib al-Nahhas</a>, a senior member of the Syrian political opposition. \u201cThe city has provided Arabs and Muslims the opportunity to meet face to face and freely share their experiences, hopes and visions.\u201d</p> <p>Welcoming Muslim exiles \u2013 in particular those with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood \u2013 is a high priority for Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government, which likes to showcase its particular flavour of political Islam.</p> <p>\u201cIstanbul is certainly now the Muslim Brotherhood hub, but there are also so many other Arab political streams present in the city,\u201d said Hage Ali. \u201cIn fact, the exposure to other types of thinking and the experience of a cosmopolitan city means people sometimes end up leaving the Brotherhood and becoming more liberal.\u201d </p> <p>Istanbul\u2019s beauty and the city\u2019s palpable sense of history have long inspired writers across the Islamic world. For Yasmine Seale, a French-Syrian writer and translator, there is no better place: \u201cSeeing the Bosphorus every day. Hearing Arabic. The persistence of small trades and slow crafts. The generosity and humanity of neighbourhood life. Anglosphere literary scenes seem self-absorbed at this remove,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to let the world in.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"763648d6e03477cc957a690bfc54b64004263b56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/763648d6e03477cc957a690bfc54b64004263b56/546_0_864_1080/800.jpg\" alt=\"Egyptian cinematographer Ahmed Hassan in the 2013 documentary The Square.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Egyptian cinematographer Ahmed Hassan in the 2013 documentary The Square.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noujaim Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet adapting to Turkish life can pose challenges: foreigners often find the fiercely patriotic national identity inaccessible, and racism against Arabs is widespread.

But when you bite, it has no taste.

  "<p>In the middle of the 14th century, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/18/mass-grave-shows-how-black-death-devastated-the-countryside\">the Black Death</a> killed perhaps a third of Europe\u2019s population, hastening the breakdown of rigid social hierarchies \u2013 what we now call \u201cfeudalism\u201d \u2013 to an astonishing degree. But there was nothing inevitable about that transformation. It happened because people such as William Caburn exploited the crisis.</p> <p>Two years after the plague hit England, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-aRYk3mRD3wC&amp;pg=PA504&amp;lpg=PA504&amp;dq=Lincolnshire+ploughman+William+Caburn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZclechTEaY&amp;sig=ACfU3U1oSyBqJAmVWmJwEOLZqP5_hZuZ0g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjT67mIu-3oAhUjUBUIHfXDBtUQ6AEwAHoECAsQKA#v=onepage&amp;q=Lincolnshire%20ploughman%20William%20Caburn&amp;f=false\">this Lincolnshire ploughman</a> was in court for \u201crefusing to work at the daily rate\u201d. He had no legal right to do so, but leveraging the fact that landlords didn\u2019t have enough workers to cultivate the land, he bartered for higher wages.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just wages \u2013 peasants also collectively bargained for lower rents. We see in the accounts of one landlord how, in the several villages dotted across his Warwickshire estate, most tenants suddenly went into arrears at the same time. Almost certainly they were secretly communicating and cooperating.</p> <p>Local protests and uprisings against landlords had happened before, but after the Black Death they became more common. The <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item132518.html\">Peasants\u2019 Revolt</a><a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item132518.html\"> of 1381</a> was the biggest, but it was an overreach and was defeated. The ruling aristocracy resisted the peasants\u2019 demands from the outset. Brutal new laws tried to stop labourers asking for better pay, and even specified what kind of fabrics people of different classes could wear.</p> <p>But the peasants\u2019 movement survived; in fact, it thrived. Some landlords cut their rents by more than half between 1350 and 1400. In the same period, wages for agricultural workers rose by around 50% for men and 100% for women. And by the turn of the century, almost all rents in England were paid in cash, rather than feudal services, reflecting how many former serfs had bought their freedom.</p> <p>But over the next five centuries, a minority of freed peasants enclosed common farming land and made it their private property, so that most of the labouring classes were forced into cramped city slums and dangerous jobs. And at the beginning of the 20th century, the anger this engendered was radicalised, first by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/16/first-world-war-imperial-bloodbath\">failures of Europe\u2019s ruling classes</a> in the first world war, and then by another plague: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/spanish-flu-pandemic-centenary-first-world-war\">the 1918 outbreak of Spanish </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/spanish-flu-pandemic-centenary-first-world-war\">flu</a>, which killed tens of millions.</p> <p>Across many of the countries affected by the pandemic, militants and reformers demanded change, and governments improvised public health innovations. The eventual result was the first phase of welfare state construction across the world, which climaxed with the Swedish social democrats\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.crf-usa.org/bill-of-rights-in-action/bria-14-3-c-the-swedish-model-welfare-for-everyone\">ambitious reforms of the 1930s</a>. These provided housing, childcare, child benefits, pensions and other social security. Once again, political organising in response to a pandemic had enabled enormous change.</p> <p>But Spain\u2019s experience during this period shows us there\u2019s no reason why organising or change have to be progressive. When influenza reached the Iberian peninsula (it wasn\u2019t actually \u201cSpanish\u201d flu \u2013 that was a misnomer), the response of the country\u2019s establishment reflected its reactionary goals. In<a href=\"https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9781137339201\"> his history of the outbreak there</a>, Ryan Davis shows how politicians, doctors and journalists sought to control the unhygienic masses with a \u201csanitary dictatorship\u201d. In Galicia, police accompanied doctors on house visits, and in Murcia <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=taEhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=youth+juntas+Murcia+spanish+flu&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LrTd6WM9O6&amp;sig=ACfU3U1WCAp_Pc1U5ImLY8IchK47NqeYQQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjfmaPoj-_oAhUIM8AKHa2LDCEQ6AEwAHoECAsQKA#v=onepage&amp;q=youth%20juntas%20Murcia%20spanish%20flu&amp;f=false\">youth juntas were created</a> to denounce public health infractions.</p> <p>As well as weakening the country\u2019s revolutionary socialist and anarchist movements, this militarisation of Spanish society laid the social foundations of the dictatorships that would rule Spain \u2013 with brief interludes \u2013 until the mid-1970s.</p> <p>In recent weeks, some people have optimistically predicted that the Covid-19 outbreak will force governments to build <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/08/the-coronavirus-outbreak-shows-us-that-no-one-can-take-on-this-enemy-alone\">fairer economic systems</a>. But the peasants\u2019 story reminds us that change isn\u2019t automatic, and Spain\u2019s history shows that the bad guys can take advantage of a crisis, too. Look at the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">seizing the right to rule by decree</a> while citing Covid-19 as his excuse.</p> <p>There are great strategic challenges ahead. Lockdown gives workers and renters power \u2013 the government has to pay people not to work, and landlords are struggling to evict tenants or get new ones \u2013 but it will not last. While previous pandemics cut the labour force, this crisis will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-uk-business-activity-plunges-to-lowest-ebb-since-records-began\">increase unemployment</a>, perhaps to levels unknown for centuries, and bosses will exploit workers\u2019 desperation so that they can keep wages low and conditions poor.</p> <p>Conservatives are organising already, subtly shifting responsibility for the severity of the outbreak from government failures on to individual \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11368296/police-force-660-part-covidiots-lockdown-rules-coronavirus/\">covidiots</a>\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/24/salvini-attacks-italy-pm-over-coronavirus-and-links-to-rescue-ship\">migrants</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/18/not-racist-at-all-donald-trump-defends-calling-coronavirus-the-chinese-virus-video\">other countries</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SamCoatesSky/status/1250101883747930113?s=20\">gearing up for a return to austerity</a> when the downturn slows.</p> <p>Countries with social democratic governments could strengthen the hand of workers by paying all residents a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/universal-basic-income-help-self-employed\">basic income</a>, but there\u2019s no chance of Britain\u2019s Tories doing that. The question for the UK trade union movement is an old one: how to choreograph a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d strategy, with enough radical action to force concessions out of politicians and bosses, and enough conciliatory noises to build a broad coalition of support.</p> <p>The left will need to work through and rebuild all sorts of institutions for collective action. Members of renters unions such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Living_Rent\">Living Rent</a> have negotiated rent cuts and breaks since lockdown began: imagine the power that tenants could wield \u2013 and hold on to after lockdown ends \u2013 if everyone getting grief from their landlord was told how to fight back. (Here\u2019s the <a href=\"https://www.livingrent.org/covid_19_faqs\">advice for Scotland</a>, and for <a href=\"https://londonrentersunion.org/coronavirus-qa/\">England and Wales</a>.)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/covid-19-mutual-aid-how-to-help-the-vulnerable-near-you\">Mutual Aid groups</a> have created an exceptionally diverse and capable network of neighbours who are excited about helping their communities. Once the outbreak is over, it\u2019s vital they carry on that organising, for instance, lobbying local businesses to pay a living wage.</p> <p>Like the generations of peasants who took advantage of their landlords\u2019 need for labour, we hold enormous power, but only if we fight together. Even then, change may be inevitable but progress certainly isn\u2019t: look at how, over a decade, Spain\u2019s reactionaries exploited their country\u2019s influenza outbreak. In an age when political decision-making happens at lightspeed on Twitter, Whatsapp and Zoom, we need to act collectively \u2013 and we need to act now.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Power Sayeed is the author of a history of New Labour and Britain in the 1990s, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/1997-Future-that-Never-Happened-ebook/dp/B076M7TMGH\">1997: The Future that Never Happened</a></p> <p><br></p>",
  "<h2>\u2018I do not want my children to believe that my husband is a war criminal\u2019<strong><br>Charlotte W\u00e4chter, 1977</strong></h2> <p>In the 1960s, my brother and I often visited our grandparents in Paris, near the Gare du Nord. As children, we understood that the past was painful, that we should not ask questions. Their apartment was a place of silences, one haunted by secrets. They only really began to be addressed when I was in my 50s, the consequence of an invitation to deliver a lecture in Lviv, in Ukraine. Come talk about your work on crimes against humanity and genocide, it said.</p> <p>I went to Lviv, and one thing led to another. I found the house where my grandfather Leon was born in 1904. I learned of the terrible events that occurred there, unleashed with a speech delivered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/11/nazis-nuremberg-executed-hermann-goring\">Hans Frank</a>, governor general of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/21/europe-grandmother-holocaust-russia-poland-germany\">Nazi-occupied Poland</a>, on a warm day in August 1942. His words exterminated my grandfather\u2019s family, and hundreds of thousands of other families. Four years later, the speech-giver was hanged in the courtyard of Nuremberg\u2019s Palace of Justice, for crimes against humanity. A year after going to Lviv, I met Frank\u2019s son Niklas, a fine journalist who despised his father. It was he who introduced me to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/19/my-nazi-legacy-review-the-poison-of-the-past-lives-on\">Horst Arthur W\u00e4chter</a>, the son of Otto W\u00e4chter, an Austrian, the governor of Krakow and later of Galicia, based in Lviv. W\u00e4chter the father was indicted for mass murder but never caught. He died in Rome in 1949, in unexpected circumstances. In due course I would learn all about the virus that was said to have killed him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2020/apr/18/i-was-a-nazi-boy-then-everything-was-gone-philippe-sands-the-ratline-audio-extract\">'I was a Nazi boy - then everything was gone': Philippe Sand's The Ratline - audio extract</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou will like Horst,\u201d Niklas tells me, \u201calthough he is different from me: he loves his father.\u201d In the spring of 2012 I make the first of many visits to Horst, to the dilapidated 12th-century castle in the village of Haggenberg, north of Vienna. Horst, who is in his early 70s, is genial and chatty, dressed in a pink shirt and Birkenstocks. We talk, we eat, we drink. He speaks of his parents\u2019 Nazi beliefs, his love for his mother Charlotte (\u201ca Nazi until the day she died\u201d, Horst\u2019s wife, Jacqueline, whispers), and a childhood of plenty (\u201cI was a Nazi child,\u201d he says with a smile, named in honour of the \u201cHorst Wessel\u201d song and Arthur Seyss-Inquart, who ran Austria after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1938/mar/14/leadersandreply.mainsection\">Anschluss</a> and was Horst\u2019s godfather). He can\u2019t say he loves Otto, he explains. \u201cI hardly knew him, but it\u2019s my duty as a son to find the good in the father.\u201d</p> <p>Horst shares albums filled with black and white photos from the 1930s and 40s, images of family holidays on lake or mountain interspersed with the occasional swastika, a picture of Hitler, a haunting photograph of a child in the Warsaw ghetto. The scrapbook tells me that the W\u00e4chters sat at the top Nazi table. There is apparently an extensive collection of diaries and letters, scrapbooks filled with Charlotte\u2019s handwritten reminiscences. These I will only see much later. I leave on that first visit intrigued by Horst and his papers. I like him, as Niklas predicted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d88fe0517a9f83e65ba2bf583cb88139980cfc6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d88fe0517a9f83e65ba2bf583cb88139980cfc6f/1204_616_3436_3436/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Otto, Charlotte, Horst and Traute, Zell-am-See station, 1944.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Otto, Charlotte, Horst and Traute, Zell-am-See station, 1944.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Permission of Horst W\u00e4chter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A year passes. I write a profile of Horst and start writing <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/22/east-west-street-origin-genocide-crimes-against-humanity-philippe-sands-review\">East West Street</a></em>, which catalyses a commission for a BBC documentary. Filming in the archives of Lviv, Niklas wonders aloud whether Horst is a \u201cnew Nazi\u201d (an accusation he later retracts). This upsets Horst, who wants to counter the claim. Be open, I suggest, making it clear that I do not think of him as a Nazi. I\u2019ve seen a few pages from his mother\u2019s diary, and one or two letters, but nothing more from the family archive. Give all the materials to a museum, so others can review it. It seems to be a unique collection, tracing the life of a leading Nazi couple from their meeting in 1929 to Otto\u2019s death, two decades later. Horst offers the material to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC, digitised, made public. Would I like a set? A few days later, a USB stick drops through my letterbox: 13 gigabytes of digital images, 8,677 pages of letters, postcards, diaries, photographs, news clippings and official documents.</p> <p>The collection includes Charlotte\u2019s <em>Erinnerungen</em> (Memories), written for Horst and the couple\u2019s five other children, reminiscences grouped by time: 1938\u20131942, 1942\u20131945, etc. There are also <em>Tonb\u00e4nder</em>, sound recordings, 14 old cassette tapes, digitised, allowing me to hear Charlotte\u2019s German cadence, methodical and rhythmic, high-pitched, anxious and, I feel, not warm. \u201cConversation with Melitta Wiedemann\u201d, she labelled a 1977 tape, recorded at the Four Seasons Hotel in Munich. Glasses are clinked, toasts offered, views expressed. A \u201creal personality\u201d, Charlotte exclaims of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/oct/21/oswald-mosley-interview-archive-1968\">Oswald Mosley</a>. \u201cI was an enthusiastic Nazi,\u201d she adds. \u201cSo was I,\u201d Frau Wiedemann replies. \u201cStill am.\u201d \u201cGreat times,\u201d Charlotte says. \u201cHitler was our saviour.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe the material will offer answers to the questions that arise, as I immerse myself in governor W\u00e4chter\u2019s nefarious work in Krakow and Lemberg, and his apparent role in heaping misery on my grandfather\u2019s family, and on so many others. What exactly did he do? Why did he travel to Rome, and what caused him to die there, at just 48 years old? How much did Charlotte know, and what support did she provide? What kind of relationship did they have?</p> <h2>\u2018The Jews are being deported in increasing numbers, and it\u2019s hard to get powder for the tennis court\u2019<br><strong>Otto W\u00e4chter, August 1942</strong></h2> <p>The material is voluminous, and mostly handwritten. It lingers for several weeks, until my colleague, the historian Lisa Jardine, intercedes. She has recently delivered an inaugural lecture at University College London, \u201cTemptation in the Archives\u201d. How do you assess archival material of a personal nature? What is the historical value of personal documents?</p> <p>Brilliant Lisa, who has terminal cancer, nevertheless summons a few of us to her flat in the shadow of the British Museum. Bring documents, she instructs. Lisa gravitates towards the personal correspondence and diaries. She is struck by the sheer number of letters written in the last months of Otto\u2019s life, while he was on the run. \u201cWhy would a husband and wife write to each other so often, at such length and detail?\u201d she asks. \u201cBecause they loved each other?\u201d I venture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba607e941a29244ac48a4fa9091a2c3e6e0a864f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba607e941a29244ac48a4fa9091a2c3e6e0a864f/175_93_2995_2195/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Charlotte and Otto, near Going, Austria in late 1948.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"733\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unstinting support \u2026 Charlotte and Otto, near Going, Austria in late 1948.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Permission of Horst W\u00e4chter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lisa is ahead of us. \u201cNo, there\u2019s more there, sharing things they don\u2019t want others to see.\u201d Focus on the last year of Otto\u2019s life, she advises, and the nature of Charlotte\u2019s role. So begins a research project over several years, an exploration of what lay between the lines and behind the words. It takes four years, opening unexpected doors. We stumble into a world of escape and espionage, of double dealing and duplicity, of exhumations and reburials, travelling from the Vatican to Syria and South America, into monasteries, over lakes, across mountains, and enter the world of the \u201cratline\u201d \u2013 the escape route used by Nazis to travel from Italy to Argentina and other places \u2013 barely imaginable. At the heart of the story is a relationship, one that survived, the wife believed, \u201cbecause our love was without any limits and even went beyond death\u201d.</p> <p>Charlotte fascinates and repels. Born into a wealthy family of steelmakers, in the small Styrian town of M\u00fcrzzuschlag, she was, on her own account, a difficult and rebellious child, intelligent if not intellectual. She enrolled as a student at the Women\u2019s Academy and School for Free and Applied Art, developing a fine artistic eye, helped by teachers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/03/make-it-a-double-cabaret-fledermaus-bar-recreated-for-barbican-show\">Josef Hoffmann</a>, of the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte. A career blossomed, designing fabrics, sold with success in Germany and Britain.</p> <p>A fine sportswoman, in the spring of 1929 she travelled to the local Schneeberg ski resort, sharing a train compartment with a stranger, a striking young lawyer. \u201cMy new \u2018Baron\u2019 was tall, slender, athletic, with delicate features, very beautiful hands,\u201d she recorded. \u201cHe wore a diamond ring on the little finger of his right hand and had a noble appearance, one that any girl would notice.\u201d 6 April: \u201cI fell in love with good-looking, cheerful Otto.\u201d</p> <p>They courted for three years before they married. He qualified and became increasingly active in the Austrian chapter of the Nazi party. She supported and encouraged his politics. In the summer of 1934, Otto participated in an unsuccessful coup attempt on the government of Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss. He fled to Berlin and joined the criminal division of the <em>Sicherheitsdienst</em>, or SD, the intelligence service of the SS, working in the same building as Adolf Eichmann. He entered the orbit of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/aug/14/historybooks.germany\">Heinrich Himmler</a>, who became his patron. Charlotte joined him in Berlin in 1936, with Horst\u2019s two oldest siblings.</p> <p>Two years later, in March 1938, Germany seized Austria and they were able to return home. \u201cEvery Nazi felt such joy about this miracle,\u201d Charlotte recorded. She drove to Vienna to pave the way for her husband\u2019s return, a moment of unbridled happiness. \u201cThere he was, in the doorway of my parents\u2019 flat in Vienna, as a Brigadef\u00fchrer, in his black SS coat with white lapels and SS uniform,\u201d she recalled four decades later. \u201cIn spite of the strain and the fatigue, he looked splendid.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"53ba55ee9e71a3865163941082640cb3a5401379\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53ba55ee9e71a3865163941082640cb3a5401379/0_0_2874_3590/801..jpg\" alt=\"A page from Charlotte\u2019s photograph album.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A page from Charlotte\u2019s photograph album.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Permission of Horst W\u00e4chter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They made their way to the Hofburg palace, through crowds overcome with \u201ca spontaneous and heartfelt outburst of joy\u201d. \u201cSeyss-Inquart and his wife and a number of others came with the F\u00fchrer, who slowly climbed the stairs of the Hofburg, up to the balcony. He was standing a metre in front of me, and I could see and hear him well.\u201d At the bottom of those stairs, after the joy, she told Otto he should accept Seyss\u2019s offer of a senior job in the new Nazi government, rather than return to the life of a lawyer. The decision changed their lives, as well as those of their children and grandchildren and, it turned out, that of my own family.</p> <p>Charlotte\u2019s diaries pass in silence on the substance of Otto\u2019s new position. As a state secretary, his function was to remove Jews and other undesirables from public positions, from the federal chancellery to the postal service. He axed thousands of individuals, including his own university teachers. As Otto crossed lines, Charlotte offered unstinting support. She loved the perks, the Mercedes and cocktail parties, the concerts at the Salzburg festival and Bayreuth (\u201cMarvellous,\u201d she wrote to Otto, \u201cthe F\u00fchrer is here, eating with H[immler]\u201d). And she appreciated the new homes, freshly emptied and appropriated. In Vienna, they occupied a large villa with its own park (a friend \u201cobtained the Jewess Bettina Mendl\u2019s house for us\u201d, Charlotte recorded, along with the china and art works). Later, on Lake Zell, they acquired a \u201csmall summer house\u201d with 16 hectares, previously owned by the governor of Salzburg, who ended up at Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp.</p> <p>The arrival of war, in September 1939, propelled Otto\u2019s career to even greater heights. Seyss-Inquart procured a new position for Otto, as governor of Krakow in western Poland, newly occupied by Germany working under Frank. Charlotte was fully aware of what he was up to. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on here,\u201d Otto wrote in December. \u201cTomorrow I have to have another 50 Poles publicly shot,\u201d a first and notorious act of reprisal killing, on the orders of Hitler. Otto signed off on acts against the city\u2019s Jews and Polish intellectuals, then ordered the construction of the Krakow ghetto. I looked for a hint of regret in Charlotte\u2019s papers. None was to be found.</p> <p>Three years later, the Krakow job completed, Charlotte celebrated when Hitler chose her husband to move to Lemberg and clean up Distrikt Galicia, recently occupied by Germany. Frank visited in August 1942, lodged with the W\u00e4chters, announced the implementation of the Final Solution and played and lost a few games of chess with Charlotte. Otto kept her abreast of developments. \u201cThere was much to do in Lemberg after you left.\u201d The harvest was gathered, Polish workers sent to labour camps (\u201calready 250,000 have been sent from the District!\u201d) and \u201cthe current large Jewish operations (<em>Judenaktionen</em>) implemented. Lots of love, forever\u201d, he signed off. \u201cWith Hitler \u2013 all or nothing.\u201d Himmler visited, to check on progress and Otto\u2019s commitment to the job. \u201cI was almost embarrassed about how positively he talks about me,\u201d Otto reported. On the other hand, manual labour was proving to be difficult to find, as \u201cthe Jews are being deported in increasing numbers, and it\u2019s hard to get powder for the tennis court\u201d.</p> <p>As the deportations and exterminations proceeded, Charlotte spent time with the children on the Schmittenh\u00f6he. There were picnics in solitude, near a pond, with naked dips in the sun. She missed Otto. \u201cWe stayed for four hours, on the moss and in the blazing sun, overwhelmed by the sheer extent of nature.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I hope that the English will be fed up and unite with us\u2019<br>Charlotte W\u00e4chter, July 1944</strong></h2> <p>Charlotte\u2019s papers sometimes refer to a big political event: war, France occupied, eastern front difficulties, march of the Red Army, collapse. Throughout, and particularly in her later reminiscences, life with Otto is often presented as an idyll. Lurking below the surface, however, are hints that things aren\u2019t perfect. In the midst of the tumult and unmentioned mass murder, mundane life continues. Meals are to be cooked, children fed, grandparents tended to. A husband\u2019s absence may be a matter of pride (if visiting Herr Himmler) or irritation (if he forgets a daughter\u2019s birthday).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Charlotte's papers provide secret details of Otto's escape from Austria to Italy; his dramatic arrival in Rome, assisted by Vatican figures</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is, too, the matter of sex. Otto\u2019s looks and power brought ample opportunities, causing Charlotte much unhappiness. Why didn\u2019t he take her to Budapest, like lovely Hans Frank, who took his wife? Charlotte finds ways to get her own back. She terminates a pregnancy. She names their second daughter Traute, after one of her husband\u2019s lovers. \u201cThat should please you,\u201d she tells him.</p> <p>Digging deeper, Charlotte\u2019s diary reveals more. Working as a volunteer nurse at a hospital in Lviv, she records in an English that Otto cannot read that she has lost her heart to a young soldier. And in the spring of 1942, as the Final Solution is being implemented, she falls for Otto\u2019s boss, Hans Frank. I send the pages to Niklas. \u201cSensational!\u201d he responds by mischievous return: perhaps he and Horst are brothers.</p> <p>The letters trace the bitter last weeks of war. At the most acute moments, as the Red Army approaches Lemberg and the end nears, Charlotte and Otto still find time to write to each other, and to hope. Ever the Anglophile, Charlotte imagines a new ally in the struggle against the dreaded Soviets. \u201cI hope that the English will be fed up and unite with us,\u201d she writes. There is an impediment, however \u2013 the Jews, \u201calways getting involved, contaminating everything\u201d.</p> <p>On 9 May 1945, the war is over. Otto is indicted for mass murder and promptly disappears. His name is in the papers, listed as a \u201cwanted war criminal\u201d, with Seyss-Inquart, who is caught, put on trial at Nuremburg, convicted and executed. (Seyss\u2019s photograph hangs near Horst\u2019s bed.) To survive, Otto must rely on Charlotte. The tables are turned. A new chapter opens. Evasion and escape require new friends and allies, in the Vatican and beyond. Charlotte\u2019s papers provide secret details of Otto\u2019s escape; the time spent hiding in the Austrian mountains with a young companion, who I would come to meet; the manner in which he made his way across the Dolomites from Austria into Italy; the friends and lovers who provided refuge and other forms of assistance and comfort on the way, in Bolzano and other places; and the dramatic arrival and stay in Rome, assisted by senior Vatican figures, including a \u201cvery positive \u2026 religious gentleman\u201d with connections to the top. There is, too, the matter of what the Americans were up to in the Eternal City, who their new allies were, and what exactly they knew about his whereabouts, and when. The path to the \u201cratline\u201d comes into view.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I am so grateful that there are still people today who \u2026 have positive things to say about my husband\u2019<br>Charlotte W\u00e4chter, 1977</strong></h2> <p>What is it about Horst and his family that captures my imagination? There is no simple answer. I pondered the question a couple of months ago, doing my other job, sitting in the International Court of Justice in The Hague, listening to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/10/aung-san-suu-kyi-court-hague-genocide-hearing-myanmar-rohingya\">Aung San Suu Kyi</a>. It could just as easily have been any other leader associated with gross wrongdoing, male or female. She sought to persuade the judges that the Myanmar military\u2019s actions against the Rohingya community might be excessive but they were not plausibly genocidal. None of the 17 judges was persuaded. How could she not see the facts as others did? Some who know her believe the reason lies in her relationship with her father, the architect of Burmese independence, founder of the Tatmadaw (Myanmar\u2019s armed forces), assassinated six months before independence. As she addressed the court, I thought of Horst and Charlotte.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eeab2f0d60ad7f21e8dba999f32eafee91087567\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eeab2f0d60ad7f21e8dba999f32eafee91087567/969_99_3906_2342/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Aung San Suu Kyi at the the UN\u2019s International Court of Justice, December 2019/\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aung San Suu Kyi at the the UN\u2019s International Court of Justice, in December 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Koen van Weel/ANP/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Love blinds. Over time, it transforms perceptions of reality, and then reality itself. Like me, Horst was born into a family of silences. When the war ended, he \u2013 as Charlotte\u2019s favourite \u2013 was protected, nourished and loved, and taught that his father was a fine and decent man. \u201cI am so grateful that there are still people today who \u2026 have positive things to say about my husband,\u201d his mother told Melitta Wiedemann. \u201cI do not want my children to believe that he is a war criminal who murdered hundreds of Jews.\u201d</p> <p>Horst doesn\u2019t want to believe it, either, even if he knows the facts point elsewhere. Together, he and I have stood before a site of mass murder, near Lviv. There, the pain on his face is plain. He does not deny what happened, or his father\u2019s connection to the horrors, or his mother\u2019s support of them. He just wants to characterise them differently, as Charlotte did. It\u2019s a way of being able to live, a means of survival. I cannot share Horst\u2019s characterisation of the facts yet I feel an affection for him, and respect his open spirit, his willingness to engage in this project, to respond to suggestions that the looted objects his mother passed on to him should be returned to their rightful owners (we are still working on the china from Villa Mendl, which the owner\u2019s daughter, who lives in Australia, has asked for). I feel, too, anxiety for the price he has paid for sharing these personal papers, cutting himself off from much of the rest of his family.</p> <p>Horst and I are bonded by a sense of dislocation, and to events distant in time and place. Our points of departure were different, opposite sides of a shared story, yet our paths crossed and we arrive at an endpoint. It\u2019s a curious waltz, a constant movement, a double act in which each seeks to lead and persuade the other. What emerges are secrets \u2013 and questions of lies, justice and love.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Philippe Sands is professor of law at University College London and a barrister at Matrix Chambers.

  "<p>When Lukus Estok recovered from a traumatic case of Covid-19 that sent him to hospital, he tried to donate his plasma for an experimental treatment that could help <a href=\"https://health.mountsinai.org/blog/mount-sinai-to-begin-the-transfer-of-covid-19-antibodies-into-critically-ill-patients/\">critically ill</a> coronavirus patients.</p> <p>The 36-year-old New Yorker spent hours applying to donate at one of the New York Blood Center\u2019s Manhattan locations, answering questions online, passing medical tests and completing phone screenings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/17/new-york-nursing-homes-coronavirus-deaths\">Hundreds of recent deaths in New York nursing homes linked to coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He finally attended an appointment last week, but as soon as a worker there<strong> </strong> learned he was gay, her face turned cold.

In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) relaxed its guidance but still required men to abstain from sex with another man for at least a year before they could give blood, a policy that the the American Public Health Association said was \u201cnot based in science\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a very long struggle to try to get them to just simply adapt and include the current science in the policy,\u201d said Scott Schoettes, counsel and <a href=\"https://www.lambdalegal.org/about-us/staff/scott-schoettes\">HIV project director</a> at Lambda Legal, a civil rights organization.</p> <p>Under pressure from lawmakers and in light of the coronavirus pandemic, which has ravaged parts of the US and forced thousands of blood drives to cancel, the FDA fast-tracked new guidance in early April to further ease the restriction to three months.</p> <p>If the recommendations are implemented early, <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/92490/download\">the FDA said</a>, they could \u201chelp to address\u201d the US\u2019s \u201csignificant shortage\u201d in blood amid a crisis.</p> <p>However, administrative conflicts and hurdles have meant most blood banks haven\u2019t yet applied the revision, despite the FDA\u2019s go-ahead. Kate Fry, the chief executive at America\u2019s Blood Centers, estimated it will take two to three months, on average, for blood centers to update their practices and welcome gay and bisexual men who meet the new criteria.</p> <p>Fry cited a slew of upgrades<strong> </strong>\u2013 to the computer system, training processes, manuals, donor education items and a universal donor history questionnaire \u2013 that \u201cunfortunately just does take some time\u201d to incorporate.</p> <p>\u201cI am not aware of any blood center who has made any changes yet. It\u2019s just far too early,\u201d Fry said.</p> <p>The American Red Cross similarly said it was \u201cworking aggressively to implement the many eligibility changes outlined by the FDA as soon as possible\u201d, but had not done so yet.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the New York Blood Center did not respond specifically to Estok\u2019s allegations of being treated as \u201cless than\u201d but echoed its industry peers. It said it is \u201cpleased with this new guidance\u201d and \u201cworking to implement the changes as quickly as possible\u201d.</p> <p>For some men who are suddenly eligible, that isn\u2019t quick enough.</p> <p>Brennon Mendez, a 24-year-old student at Yale Law School,<strong> </strong>felt \u201cecstatic\u201d after he heard about the FDA update.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting to donate blood for my entire adult life, and the current blood shortage caused by Covid-19 made that desire that much more urgent,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On the day the guidance was published, Mendez immediately made an appointment at the<strong> </strong>UCI Health Blood Donor Center in Orange, California. But when he got there, he was turned away, much like Estok.</p> <p>Mendez said the receptionist told him the clinic wasn\u2019t yet complying with the new FDA guidance.</p> <p>\u201cI felt stigmatized, and I also felt outraged that such a refusal to adapt to the urgent circumstances of this crisis would result in less blood being available to those who need it most,\u201d Mendez said.</p> <p>\u201cThe numerous steps that exist to ensure the safety of the blood supply\u201d, such as updating procedures and retraining staff, aren\u2019t meant to marginalize anyone, John Murray, assistant director for media and public relations at UCI Health, said in a statement.</p> <p>Before the California site can start complying with recent guidance, Murray added, <a href=\"http://www.aabb.org/about/who/Pages/namechange.aspx\">the AABB</a>, a standard-setting association in charge of the donor history questionnaire used by donor centers across the country, needs FDA approval for a revised version of that document.</p> <p>But Michael Felberbaum, a spokesman for the FDA, contradicted Murray. He said licensed blood facilities do not have to wait on any association\u2019s revised donor questionnaire. They can instead come up with their own materials and implement the changes now.</p> <p>The nation\u2019s blood supply has stabilized since the pandemic\u2019s early days, Fry said, though there was still an ongoing need for donations. But Schoettes\u2019s larger concern was around people such as Estok, who have blood rich in coronavirus antibodies that could be used to possibly <a href=\"https://health.mountsinai.org/blog/mount-sinai-to-begin-the-transfer-of-covid-19-antibodies-into-critically-ill-patients/\">counteract the virus\u2019s devastating effects on the country\u2019s most vulnerable patients</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to continue to push because there is a more urgent need there, and I don\u2019t think we necessarily need to be patient on that front,\u201d Schoettes said.</p> <p>A few days ago, a member of Estok\u2019s gospel choir reached out to him for help. The man told Estok he knew someone who hoped to try the plasma treatment but had to wait because there weren\u2019t enough donations.</p> <p>Estok couldn\u2019t do anything for that family, or for anyone else, even though he wants to desperately.</p> <p>\u201cTo know that I\u2019m healthy, to know that I\u2019m a candidate \u2013 like a solid candidate \u2013 for donation, but I can\u2019t because \u2026 I don\u2019t know, they can\u2019t get an IT guy in to fix their computers?\u201d Estok said. \u201cThat\u2019s so hard for me to wrap my head around.\u201d</p>",

Save for a few exceptions \u2013 such as children with special educational needs or single-parent families \u2013 minors are to remain in their homes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fa0a05a73f74f368d8ec95a367f95c9e2602907\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fa0a05a73f74f368d8ec95a367f95c9e2602907/0_0_5000_2999/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, with her childrenat an event in the city last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, with her children<br>at an event in the city last year.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sopa Images/LightRocket via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The stringent measures were unleashed as the country tackled a Covid-19 outbreak that was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/spain-coronavirus-response-analysis\">spreading at one of the fastest rates in the world.</a> Spain has seen one of the world\u2019s highest rates of deaths per million inhabitants, with more than 20,000 people killed as the virus races through the country. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-spain/spain-considers-summer-school-for-quarantined-children-coronavirus-deaths-rise-idUSKCN21Y1CS\">Amid concerns that the actual number of deaths</a> caused by the virus could be much higher, the government has said the lockdown is likely to stretch into mid-May. </p> \n<p>Recent days have seen the calls for children to be let out intensify \u2013 particularly after the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/spain-to-begin-return-to-work-despite-fears-of-resurgence\">relaxed the lockdown</a> to allow some non-essential workers to return to factories and construction sites.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhy do our children have to keep waiting?\u201d Colau asked, arguing parents could be trusted to safely take their children out for walks close to home. \u201cLet\u2019s find a way to do it right and according to the advice of health experts.\u201d</p> \n<p>Her view was echoed by more than 300 professionals who work with children \u2013 from psychologists to paediatricians \u2013 who signed an open letter to the socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe results of this rigid confinement for children are beginning to show, particularly in urban areas with limited domestic spaces, with increased levels of stress and anxiety,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.heikefreire.com/2020/04/coronainfancias-carta-presidente-ministro-sanidad.html\">the letter read,</a> urging that children be let out for at least one hour each day.

After weeks of total confinement, most Italian authorities now allow minors out for a walk close to home, accompanied by one parent. Last week, Denmark reopened its primary schools and kindergartens, while Norway plans to follow suit later this month.</p> \n<p>Campaigners argue that the situation is particularly acute in Spain, where the dense layers of apartment buildings that sprawl across cities have left many of the country\u2019s nearly seven million children without direct access to fresh air or sunlight. \u201cApproximately 70% of Spanish families with children live in apartments, many of them 50-70 sq metres and without balconies,\u201d said Freire.</p> \n<p>The Spanish government has so far fended off any push to relax the rules, advising caution in a country where multi-generational families are common. \u201cThe measures \u2013 some of the strictest in Europe \u2013 are out of prudence, as children are a vector of transmission,\u201d Salvador Illa, the country\u2019s health minister told reporters last week. His government was monitoring the epidemiological data to decide when it would be safe to allow children outside, he added.</p> \n<p>Those who work with children say they have already seen a rise in anxiety issues. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more children with nervousness, more with insomnia, more with chest and stomach pains,\u201d said Madrid paediatrician Alicia Ar\u00e9valo.</p> \n<p>She stressed, however, that these cases were a minority. \u201cI have families telling me that they\u2019re rebuilding relationships now that day-to-day life has calmed,\u201d she said, citing adolescents who said they were speaking more to their parents or engaging in more family time with activities such as baking or painting.</p> \n<p>That may be the case for some children, said Freire. But she warned against any generalisation, noting that the situation risks exacerbating existing inequalities. \u201cYou can\u2019t compare a child that lives in a 600 sq metre house with a backyard with a child that lives in a 30- or 50-sq metre apartment without a balcony,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t compare parents who have no economic problems with children whose parents have been temporarily laid off, or who have lost their jobs.\u201d</p> \n<p>She argued that the issue was fundamentally one of human rights. \u201cBy law, children have the right to fresh air, sunlight, movement, play and contact with other children,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my view, a society that doesn\u2019t put its children ahead of everything \u2013 that doesn\u2019t ensure their needs are met \u2013 is sliding back towards barbarism. It\u2019s completely inhumane.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qV7R2iYVXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

The MCC also operates under the name Michigan Trump Republicans, and in January<a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/michigan-trump-republicans-2020-grand-opening-event-tickets-86846252479#\"> held an event</a> featuring several members of the Trump campaign.</p> \n<p>\u201cAbsolutely the Michigan event was a huge inspiration and it was a huge success,\u201d said Evie Harris, organizer of a ReOpen Maryland protest planned for the state capitol on Saturday.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat was the model for our event.\u201d</p> \n<p>Thousands drove to the Michigan state capitol in Lansing, while the Michigan Freedom Fund purchased Facebook advertising to promote the rally. Protesters, many waving Trump campaign signs, honked their horns and chanted for Governor Gretchen Whitmer to end the stay-at-home rules.</p> \n<p>The protest was covered exhaustively by the rightwing media. Harris said her Facebook following grew from \u201c700-800 people\u201d to more than 15,000 members following the Michigan rally, inspiring her to organize \u201cOperation Gridlock Annapolis\u201d for Saturday.</p> \n<p>Harris said her group had support from some elected officials in Maryland, but declined to name them.</p> \n<p>While ReOpen Maryland might not have funding from rightwing advocacy groups, it appears to be linked to at least four other \u201creopen\u201d organizations.</p> \n<p>\u201cGovernment mandating sick people to stay home is called quarantine,\u201d ReOpen Maryland said. \u201cHowever, the government mandating healthy citizens to stay home, forcing businesses and churches to close is called tyranny.\u201d</p> \n<p>That text is identical to text on Facebook pages calling for rallies in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Virginia.

  "<p>Death was the catalyst for Walter \u201cHawk\u201d Newsome\u2019s most contentious idea. It came to him during the first few days of July in 2016. This was the week that a Minnesota police officer shot 32-year-old Philando Castile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/20/philando-castile-shooting-marijuana-car-dashcam-footage\">five times</a> and killed him in his car; an off-duty New York police officer <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/off-duty-shoots-man-dead-road-rage-incident-brooklyn-article-1.2698074\">killed</a> 37-year-old Delron Dempsey in front of his family; and two Louisiana cops fatally shot Alton Sterling <a href=\"https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/local/coroner-releases-autopsy-toxicology-reports-for-alton-sterling/289-532514020\">six times</a>.</p> <p>These extrajudicial slayings bedeviled Newsome, who spent his youth being terrorized by the NYPD in the Bronx. Despite the Democratic politicians he had canvassed and campaigned for \u2013 from Bloomberg before his \u201cstop and frisk\u201d days to Barack Obama \u2013 the situation didn\u2019t seem to get better. Blacks were still being killed by the police at a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/08/09/what-weve-learned-about-police-shootings-years-after-ferguson/\">disproportionate rate</a>.</p> <p>On that dog day of summer, Newsome decided to take a walk, beginning in Lower Manhattan near Wall Street. By the time he\u2019d gotten Uptown, sweaty and crying, he arrived at a conclusion that might have seemed incongruous, but was grounded in its own fascinating logic.<strong> </strong>\u201cI thought to myself, \u2018Fuck this! Black people shouldn\u2019t vote.\u201d</p> <p>This sentiment blossomed into I Ain\u2019t Voting Until Black Lives Matter, a meteoric and strange campaign during the 2016 presidential election in which Newsome and a cadre of activists implored blacks to withhold their votes until a candidate adopted policies against police brutality, such as independent prosecutors for police misconduct and jail time for cops who falsified reports.</p> <p>It\u2019s a campaign that Newsome said has been vindicated by the country\u2019s embrace of progressive politics in recent years. But would it apply to this year\u2019s election?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"194f8a5dfff21d6ca44bc8a3a396d4413bd4ce16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/194f8a5dfff21d6ca44bc8a3a396d4413bd4ce16/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People protest against police brutality and in support of Black Lives Matter during a July 2016 march in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People protest against police brutality and in support of Black Lives Matter during a July 2016 march in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eduardo Mu\u00f1oz/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Black Americans have been loyal to the Democrats for years. <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/exit-left/476190/\">Since 1964</a>, Democratic presidential candidates have received at least 80% of the black vote.<strong> </strong>However, as Princeton political scientist <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691148014/uneasy-alliances\">Paul Frymer</a> describes, this loyalty can <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/black-voters-are-so-loyal-that-their-issues-get-ignored/\">devalue the concerns of blacks</a> and give swing voters more power.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Democrats talked to gay people, they got marriage equality. When Dems talked to immigrant communities, they got Daca. But when it is black people, we get jive talk and the electric slide,\u201d said Newsome, the 42-year-old founder of <a href=\"https://www.blacklivesmattergreaterny.com/founder\">Black Lives Matter of Greater New York</a>.</p> <p>To launch his campaign, Newsome reached out to<strong> </strong>actor and rapper Nick Cannon, who had released the viral song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AQjZ8ZbnF4\">Too Broke to Vote</a>. They chose the Republican national convention to debut, because, \u201cthe white supremacists said that [Black Lives Matter] better not show up\u201d. Cannon supported Newsome and 11 of his followers with banners, T-shirts, a van and a house. They marched and held a news conference, <a href=\"https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-07-20/i-aint-voting-will-black-lives-matter-reject-right-vote\">gaining</a> some attention.</p> <p>But at the Democratic national convention the following week, there was backlash. \u201cOlder blacks thought that I was dishonoring MLK,\u201d Newsome said. \u201cBut he fought for the <em>power</em> of the vote, not for it to be a popularity contest.\u201d Newsome\u2019s own mother later told him that she thought he\u2019d \u201clost his mind\u201d, and some of his politically minded peers in the Bronx hosted small-scale counter-demonstrations.</p> <p>Newsome stuck to his convictions. He believed Hillary Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/hillary-clinton-black-millennial-voters\">history</a> of backing the 1994 <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/05/the-tragic-politics-of-crime/392114/\">crime bill</a>, which expanded the death penalty and lengthened prison sentences,<strong> </strong>and the time she referred to <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/election/2016/2/25/black-queer-protester-hillary-clinton-you-owe-black-people-apology\">black </a><a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/election/2016/2/25/black-queer-protester-hillary-clinton-you-owe-black-people-apology\">young men as \u201csuperpredators\u201d</a><strong> </strong>made her symbolic of everything he protested against. On 8 November, he wrote in his own name on his presidential ballot. \u201c\u2018I only wish that <em>more</em> people would have stood with us. It might have forced Hillary to do more to draw people to the polls,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Like his I Ain\u2019t Voting initiative, Newsome is polarizing \u2013 even within the Black Lives Matter movement. He\u2019s been criticized for speaking at a <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wjx9m4/speaking-at-a-trump-rally-made-this-blm-activist-an-outcast\">Trump rally</a>.<strong> </strong>While his videos debating conservatives like Tomi Lahren go viral, and he\u2019s a regular face on CNN and BET, he has a history with alcoholism and domestic abuse. \u201cI had to look at myself and say, \u2018You are a toxic individual and you need to change,\u2019\u201d he said. Newsome has made public apologies, is four years sober, and participates in therapy, but some have been reluctant to work with him.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2011/08/01/138891494/bertha-lewis-from-acorn-to-the-black-institute\">Bertha Lewis</a>, the 69-year-old organizer, was one of those suspicious activists. She said she would come to his demonstrations, but remain in the background to observe. \u201cHe\u2019s followed the credo of \u2018I can show you better than I can tell you,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cSo he\u2019s just kept it moving, and people have had to give him a grudging respect for that.\u201d</p> <p>While Newsome is an outlier, though, he\u2019s not alone in encouraging blacks to hold their votes for ransom. In 1924, in the shadow of strict loyalty to the Republican party following the American civil war, activist James Weldon Johnson asked, \u201cHow can the Negro expect any worthwhile consideration for his vote as long as politicians are always reasonably sure as how it will be cast?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9f0e9ef0e19e3a4d05178089405264f60ac2851c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f0e9ef0e19e3a4d05178089405264f60ac2851c/0_0_2000_3000/667.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Older blacks thought that I was dishonoring MLK,\u2019 said Walter \u2018Hawk\u2019 Newsome, a Black Lives Matter activist, of his political strategy.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Older blacks thought that I was dishonoring MLK,\u2019 said Walter \u2018Hawk\u2019 Newsome, a Black Lives Matter activist, of his political strategy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Noble Jr./The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1965, months before the Democrats would secure the black vote for generations with the Voting Rights Act, Malcolm X implored blacks to treat their <a href=\"http://www.edchange.org/multicultural/speeches/malcolm_x_ballot.html\">ballots like bullets</a> and only use them when there was a target within reach.</p> <p>And during the 2016 election, Fredrick C Harris, Columbia University\u2019s director of the Center of African American Politics, and Eddie S Glaude, chairman of Princeton University\u2019s department of African American studies, crafted the Blank-Out Campaign, which was introduced in a <a href=\"https://time.com/4504138/black-vote-blank-out/\">Time</a> op-ed. It called for blacks to leave their presidential ballots blank in red states.</p> <p>They hoped this would force politicians to \u201cnotice that black voters are more than cattle chewing cud, to be herded to the polls\u201d. But the audacious essay was mostly ignored or criticized. Social justice activist Bill Fletcher Jr <a href=\"https://inthesetimes.com/article/19502/the-blank-vote-is-not-a-strategy-for-black-power\">called the proposed tactic</a> a \u201ccherry bomb\u201d because it created noise, \u201cwhile producing nothing but smoke\u201d.</p> <p>Looking back, the 2016 election saw the first decline in black <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/black-voter-turnout-fell-in-2016-even-as-a-record-number-of-americans-cast-ballots/\">voter turnout in 20 years</a>. In trying to explain the downturn, pundits have cited everything from increased <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/election-2016-restrictive-voting-laws-numbers#raceandvoting\">restrictions</a> such as voter ID laws to the disinformation efforts of Russian operatives, whose <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49987657\">chief target was </a>blacks. The Russians used Facebook pages with misleading names like \u201cBlack Matters\u201d to encourage blacks not to vote \u2013 a fact <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-11-17/donald-trump-black-voters-election-politics\">some believe reflects the abject foolishness</a> of Newsome\u2019s efforts.</p> <p>Newsome disagrees. \u201cThe Russians saw what I saw \u2013 that the Democrats were disregarding blacks,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they were trying to discourage \u2026 I was telling people to make politicians work for your vote.\u201d</p> <p>While \u201cI Ain\u2019t Voting\u201d didn\u2019t galvanize many voters, Newsome believes that its spirit made it a success. Both parties have prioritized recapturing the more than 765,000 eligible black voters who sat out of the 2016 election \u2013 whether it\u2019s presumptive nominee Joe Biden pledging to nominate a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/25/21153824/biden-black-woman-supreme-court\">black woman</a> to the supreme court or Donald Trump talking about <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2020/02/trump-just-bragged-about-criminal-justice-reform-look-closer-at-how-his-administration-is-undoing-it/\">criminal justice</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Newsome also sees a Trump presidency as a 'curse and a gift' that opened a lane for radical politics.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Newsome also sees a Trump presidency as a \u201ccurse <em>and</em> a gift\u201d that opened a lane for radical politics. For him, this is embodied in the rise of politicians like the New York US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for whom his group members were <a href=\"https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/campaigns-elections/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-beats-joe-crowley.html\">early supporters</a>. And the early success of Senator Bernie Sanders.</p> <p>While Sanders failed to get the Democratic nomination, largely thanks to his inability to rouse support from older blacks, his presence has pushed the Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden, a shepherd of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/joe-biden-crime-bill-mass-incarceration.html\">racist crime bills in the 90s</a>, to a more progressive criminal justice platform that includes a $300m grant for racially representative, community-oriented policing.</p> <p>Newsome also believes that many of the black youth under 30, among whom Sanders won a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/bernie-sanders-black-voters/607789/\">majority of support</a>, will be a part of the #BernieOrBust contingent, and withhold their support for Biden. He feels this is linked to I Ain\u2019t Voting. \u201cMany black youth understand voting as a futile effort, in which the politicians they put in place never follow through,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But when it comes down to this year\u2019s election, Newsome is changing course. He has decided to vote, and encourage other black people to cast their ballots as well because he believes politicians are now working harder, and because his sister Chivona is running for a local seat in the Bronx.</p> <p>There\u2019s just one caveat: \u201cI\u2019ll be encouraging blacks to vote the issues,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I stand behind the issues and the person fails me, I can still sleep at night.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>On Thursday evening, Donald Trump took to the dais in the White House press briefing room and declared that he was leading America in a \u201chistoric battle against the invisible enemy\u201d that amounted to the \u201cgreatest national mobilisation since world war two\u201d.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?471257-1/trump-administration-issues-guidelines-reopen-economy\">Warming to his theme</a>, the US president said the country was now ready to move to the next phase in the war against coronavirus.

  "<p>The coronavirus has been kind to Germany\u2019s political elite. After years of bleeding votes to the Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland on the right and the Greens on the left, Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union has finally started to see rising <a href=\"https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2020-03/forsa-umfrage-bundestagswahl-cdu-csu-gruene-spd-afd-linke-fdp\">approval </a><a href=\"https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2020-03/forsa-umfrage-bundestagswahl-cdu-csu-gruene-spd-afd-linke-fdp\">ratings</a>. It\u2019s easy to see why. The country\u2019s lockdown was enacted relatively swiftly and <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20200329-merkel-shines-in-handling-of-germany-s-coronavirus-crisis\">presented clearly</a>, its <a href=\"https://text.npr.org/s.php?sId=820595489\">testing programme</a> has been unparalleled in the western world and its healthcare system has proven far <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-death-rate.html\">more robust</a> than those of neighbouring countries. Now, however, with the virus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-under-control-in-germany-as-some-countries-plan-to-relax-lockdowns\">seemingly in retreat</a> and parts of Europe tentatively easing out of lockdown, tensions are beginning to show, and Germans may soon look back on the quarantine with a kind of nostalgia.</p> <p>The most immediate cause of contention has been a report by the Leopoldina, Germany\u2019s National Academy of Sciences. The <a href=\"https://www.leopoldina.org/uploads/tx_leopublication/2020_04_13_Coronavirus-Pandemie-Die_Krise_nachhaltig_%C3%BCberwinden_final.pdf\">report</a>, which suggests a gradual easing of restrictions, places special emphasis on opening schools and returning to free-market principles as quickly as possible. Merkel\u2019s announcement on Wednesday of <a href=\"https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/lockerung-der-corona-massnahmen-was-aendert-sich-was-bleibt-wie-es-ist-das-haben-bund-und-laender-beschlossen/25744256.html\">a loosening of restrictions</a> seems largely to follow the guidelines provided by the institute \u2013 some shops will reopen from Monday. Bookstores, car dealerships and bike shops will be allowed to reopen regardless of size, while other shops will be allowed to open only if they are small enough (800 square metres or less), and are able to present adequate plans for maintaining hygiene. Schools will begin reopening on 4 May, with special emphasis on graduating classes, the oldest primary school children and students who are expected to take exams.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/angela-merkel-announces-plans-reopen-schools-shops-germany-coronavirus-lockdown\">Merkel announces plans to reopen schools and shops in Germany</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government has emphasised repeatedly that the relaxation of the measures is provisional and that continued progress will require the development of sophisticated <a href=\"https://www.merkur.de/welt/corona-deutschland-virologe-ndr-drosten-app-kontaktverfolgung-rki-corona-datenspende-zr-13646073.html\">contact-tracing</a> programmes, including the controversial suggestion that smartphones be used in a widespread programme to track interactions between citizens. The \u201c<a href=\"https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/coronavirus-angela-merkel-wil-mehr-oeffentliches-leben-zulassen-in-kleinen-schritten-a-2be084d0-0a33-4497-80c2-3c159ae3ae84\">fragile partial success</a>,\u201d Merkel has insisted, can only hold if the population continues to abide by social distancing regulations as much as possible.</p> <p>The plan to reopen some shops has been largely greeted with muted relief, though there doesn\u2019t seem to be much hope that it will stimulate the economy more broadly. The plan for reopening schools has been roundly criticised. The Leopoldina\u2019s guidelines for maintaining social distance and proper hygiene at schools are \u201cjust not realistic,\u201d as Ilke Hoffmann, the head of the education union, Gewerkschaft Erzeihung und Wissenschaften, told <a href=\"https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/leopoldina-vorschlaege-fuer-schulen-realitaetsfern-a-d8cd164a-77f3-49b5-bdd1-155b70ab4d95\">Der Spiegel</a><em>. </em>There aren\u2019t enough teachers to maintain class sizes of 15 students or less, as the report suggests, and classrooms are far too small to maintain a two-metre distance between students. Furthermore, the report\u2019s claim that older primary school students would be able to abide by social distancing strictures has been roundly criticised, with teachers calling the idea a fantasy. Harriet K\u00fchnemann, the director of a primary school in Gie\u00dfen, Hesse, told NTV that she \u201cabsolutely cannot guarantee that students will wash their hands\u201d.</p> <p>While plans to reopen primary schools have been criticised for moving too quickly, the Leopoldina\u2019s recommendation that nurseries stay closed until the end of the summer break in August or September has been widely condemned as too<em> </em>restrictive. The theologian and ethicist Peter Dabrock, for example, has said the decision endangers the wellbeing of children. Closing daycare for six months, Dabrock told <a href=\"https://www.deutschlandfunkkultur.de/sozialethiker-kritisiert-lange-kitaschliessungen-kinder.1008.de.html?dram:article_id=474595\">Deutschland Funk</a>, would constitute \u201ca massive violation of the rights of children\u201d. Heinz Holger, the president of the Deutschen Kinderschutzbundes<em>,</em> a child welfare organisation, <a href=\"https://www.br.de/nachrichten/deutschland-welt/kritik-an-kita-und-grundschulschliessungen-wird-lauter,RwJDAIf\">warned that</a> such a long closure had already led to increased calls to their domestic violence hotline. Parental groups, meanwhile, have <a href=\"https://taz.de/Corona-Lockerungen-in-Deutschland/!5676691/\">pointed out</a> that many families already face enormous financial difficulty due to the lack of childcare.</p> <p>The inept recommendations of the Leopoldina can hardly be surprising given its membership. The panel that issued the report consisted of 24 men and two women. The average age of its members was over 60. One wonders how the institution arrived at the conclusion that it was more important to include a physicist specialising in the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.iwm.fraunhofer.de/en/about-us/management-organization/peter-gumbsch.html\">mechanics of materials</a>\u201d than experts on the experiences of immigrants, people of colour, or women. Professor Jutta Allmendinger, a member of the Leopoldina (though not a signatory of its report), had no trouble in assembling a more diverse group of signatories to an <a href=\"https://sync.academiccloud.de/index.php/s/MBO8UMvnCSwNOZe\">open letter</a> criticising the report \u2013 more than 40 female professors from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds have signed the letter calling for daycare centres to be opened more quickly.</p> <p>As the burden of the coronavirus begins to be distributed more and more unevenly, and as women and the young are forced to bear more and more of the weight of the crisis, one suspects that many Germans will look with bitter envy towards Denmark, whose prime minister, Mette Friedriksen \u2013 a 42-year-old mother \u2013 has made early childhood education the first priority as the country <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52291326\">emerges from lockdown</a>. Denmark\u2019s experts have concluded that it is not the young but the elderly who should bear the burden of social isolation during the remainder of the pandemic. The very young, who are generally not at risk from the virus, should not have to sacrifice important educational opportunities so that those who belong to at-risk groups can return to public life more quickly. It\u2019s no coincidence that Germany, in contrast, is keeping the youngest children in isolation, while hair salons and department stores are being allowed to reopen.<strong> </strong>Ending lockdown is not an end in itself, as the German government has made clear, but even getting that right in a country that has excelled so far is proving to be harder than imagined.</p> <p>\u2022 Peter Kuras is a writer and translator based in Berlin</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong>The year I turned 11, my uncle Josiah Ssesanga was admitted to a hospital in Uganda with meningitis. It was 1994, and he was HIV positive. Between him and death stood a tattered post-civil war health system. </p> <p>Treatments for HIV and Aids existed in other parts of the world, but in Uganda they were mostly limited to those used in clinical trials. For my uncle\u2019s particular infection \u2013 cryptococcal meningitis \u2013 there was a drug called Fluconazole. But he didn\u2019t know it existed; regardless, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford it. and even among patients who took it, only 12% survived beyond six months.</p> <p>The day after his admission, \u201cpeople from some American project\u201d arrived with a mountain of paperwork, my aunt remembers. They were doing a clinical trial testing a more effective combination therapy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/macron-urges-on-trials-of-controversial-coronavirus-drug\">Macron calls for clinical trials of controversial coronavirus 'cure'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere were about three pages on possible side-effects of the drug. We were also warned that he would need to keep taking the drugs even if the project ended,\u201d my aunt says. \u201cBut for most of us, in that hour, our answer was yes. We were desperate. Anything to stop that pain.\u201d</p> <p>Cryptococcal meningitis causes very severe headaches. These headaches drove uncle Ssesanga out of his mind and he often needed to be physically restrained.</p> <p>Once on the trial, my uncle received a combination of two drugs with rapid results: in under two weeks, he was discharged from inpatient care. In the subsequent months, he completed his university degree and became an inspector of schools. He would return to the hospital to meet researchers and had to endure painful lumbar punctures to track his recovery. </p> <p>However, the clinical trial provided only a few months of therapy beyond the researchers\u2019 initial period of investigation. After that, my uncle was told to start paying for his pills. A week\u2019s supply alone cost more than he earned in a month. He quietly stopped the treatment.</p> <p>About a year later, a researcher came looking for him. She implored my relatives to get him back on treatment. But there was still not enough money. Two years later, he fell seriously ill and died in the harrowing way every Aids patient without access to antiretroviral therapy did.</p> <p>Today my family is proud that my uncle contributed to the development of combination therapy that restored hope and dignity to so many Aids patients globally. But we are still heartbroken that, for him and many other African patients, their contribution to these advances was unmarked and thankless.</p> <p>Now I fear that we will replay this painful script again as we face the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Recently, two French doctors <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP0bfBQ6zzc&amp;feature=youtu.be\">suggested that coronavirus</a> vaccine trials should be done in Africa: the continent with <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">the lowest numbers</a> of confirmed cases so far. Speaking on French TV, one said: \u201cIf I can be provocative, shouldn\u2019t we be doing this study in Africa, where there are no masks, no treatments, no resuscitation?\u201d </p> <p>Given the long history of medical racism and painful experiences like that of my family\u2019s, some Africans were <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/racism-row-french-doctors-suggest-virus-vaccine-test-africa-200404054304466.html\">understandably annoyed</a>, calling these comments racist and akin to treating people as \u201chuman guinea pigs\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-52192184\">Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus</a>, the director general of the World Health Organization, described the doctors\u2019 comments as a hangover from a \u201ccolonial mentality\u201d, and said that \u201cAfrica can\u2019t and won\u2019t be a testing ground for any vaccine\u201d.</p> <p>And yet \u2013 as happened with the Aids pandemic \u2013 Africa will certainly be a testbed for some coronavirus therapies, vaccines or contagion controls. It already is. The European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) has, for instance, put out an early \u20ac4.75m call <a href=\"https://www.edctp.org/call/mobilisation-of-funding-for-covid-19-research-in-sub-saharan-africa/\">for research proposals</a> on Covid-19 responses in Africa. And this is actually a good thing.</p> <p>Excluding the continent from ongoing pandemic research is not the answer. Clinical trials can be ethically done \u2013 and many African countries and institutions now have ethics review boards to oversee this research.</p> <p>The injustice is in how geopolitical power imbalances, through patent law, ration access to the drugs that come out of successful trials.<strong> </strong>In 1996, the United States began approving the powerful combination therapies to treat HIV and Aids that came out of studies like the one my uncle was part of. It was <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/markschoofs/how-to-survive-yet-another-plague\">a watershed moment for US activists</a> (many of them marginalised gay men).</p> <p>But it should not have been only theirs. Patients across the developing world had also given their own blood, spinal fluid and sinew, to test and establish these therapies.

Earlier today, the premier, <strong>Mark McGowan, </strong>said the man had been to Bali in March and described the travel as \u201cselfish\u201d and \u201cirresponsible\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The government\u2019s new statement this evening says the case is \u201cnot cause for alarm\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Rio Tinto conducted the test but public health officials are working to verify the results because the test used might not be reliable. </p> \n  <p>From the statement:</p> \n  <p>\u201cWestern Australians can be reassured that a confirmed case of Covid-19 in a mining worker, following a blood test performed by mining company Rio Tinto, is not cause for alarm and should not be interpreted as potential community transmission.</p> \n  <p>Western Australia\u2019s Chief Health Officer, Dr Andrew Robertson, said the case was one of only three being reported in WA overnight, with the other two linked to the cruise ship Artania.</p> \n  <p>Dr Robertson said the Department of Health was investigating the case and undertaking appropriate contact tracing but that there was no evidence of community transmission resulting from this case.</p> \n  <p>Dr Robertson said the case had become mildly symptomatic shortly after returning from a trip to Indonesia which would indicate he most likely contracted the virus overseas. He was in isolation for the period in which he would have been infectious.</p> \n  <p>Dr Robertson said the pin-prick test performed by Rio Tinto was <em>not</em> an acute diagnostic test or even a reliable means of screening for current Covid-19 infection.</p> \n  <p>He said the reason point-of-care testing had been banned as an acute diagnostic test under emergency provisions of the Public Health Act was because it measured the presence of antibodies to Covid-19 \u2013 not the virus itself. This could lead to results being misinterpreted, with both false negatives and false positives being common, as demonstrated by recent such testing.</p> \n  <p>Dr Robertson said public health officials were currently working to verify the results of the individual at an accredited laboratory because the validity of the point-of-care test was unknown.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T08:35:08.493Z\">at 9.35am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9ab13f8f08bade1f29582b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T07:50:46.189Z\">8.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And here\u2019s the Queensland premier:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AnnastaciaMP/status/1251303678864011266\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MeAt20?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MeAt20</a> - in Queensland of course! <a href=\"https://t.co/QQDBc0Mrkd\">pic.twitter.com/QQDBc0Mrkd</a></p>\u2014 Annastacia Palaszczuk (@AnnastaciaMP) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnnastaciaMP/status/1251303678864011266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 18, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T08:01:57.125Z\">at 9.01am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9aaae98f080ee11044736d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T07:25:52.213Z\">8.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Over the past few days, the #MeAt20 challenge has taken off on Twitter.

One of the deaths that happened yesterday was a 42-year-old man who was a crew member on the Artania cruise ship, which is leaving Fremantle today on its way to the Philippines.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSo that is by far our youngest person that has died in Australia from this disease, and a terrible tragedy for that man and his family,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cBut it is a reminder for us that this is not just an old person\u2019s disease. We are all in this together for a reason. </p> \n  <p>\u201cBecause it can affect any of us, and while it is true to say that the majority of cases, over 80%, are mild, some of them can be very severe. <strong>We still have 55 people across Australia in intensive care right now, some of those have been ventilated, some of them extremely sick. </strong>These are really strong reminders for us why we are taking this disease seriously and why, indeed, the whole world is taking this pandemic seriously. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe are continuing to concentrate on the way out of where we are now. Australia has done extremely well compared with the rest of the world up to this point. But it is not a time for us to decrease the measures that we have in place. We have, for example, been one of the major testing countries for Covid-19 and a recent paper published by the London school of hygiene and tropical medicine \u2013 I am an alumnus of that institution \u2013 shows that we are at the highest level in terms of case ascertainment and making sure that the cases that are out there are being found. </p> \n  <p>\u201c<strong>We reached a milestone: we now have over 400,000 tests that have been done here in Australia, and so again, by sheer numbers, we are doing a lot of testing. </strong>But one of the challenges that was put back to the Australian health committee from the national cabinet on Thursday was for us to <strong>continue to look and consider what our testing strategy should be into the future. So that is part of our surveillance plan that we are developing, and we had a discussion about that today at our Australian health committee meeting with the other chief health offices. I chaired that meeting today and we discussed what that surveillance plan should look like and particularly what should we be doing in terms of expanding testing</strong> now that we have that capability to do so.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe other thing we discussed today at the committee meeting was about our rapid response capability. How should we, and how could we, respond to things like what is occurring in north-western Tasmania at the moment?\u201d</p> \n  <p>He is referring here to the healthcare worker in Tasmania with the virus who worked across with three aged-care facilities in the north-west, and as a result in the past 24 hours, almost 500 tests have been done on all the residents and the staff of those facilities.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T05:43:05.422Z\">at 6.43am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9a8a378f08b7689b030b83\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T05:11:00.104Z\">6.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Afternoon summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Let\u2019s take a look at some of the key announcements and updates from today:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The <strong>federal government has said its Covid-19 tracing app will not be compulsory. </strong>The government services minister, Stuart Robert, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/18/australia-coronavirus-updates-live-investigations-into-aged-care-homes-amid-outbreaks-latest-news?page=with:block-5e9a69cd8f080ee1104472a4#block-5e9a69cd8f080ee1104472a4\">revealed details about how the app will work</a>, saying there will be no geolocation, surveillance, or tracking of people with the app, and that the federal government would not have access to any of the app\u2019s data.

It simply swaps phone numbers and names. That information is held encrypted and securely on the individual\u2019s mobile phone. <strong>You control your own data and if you test positive to coronavirus, that information is given straight to state governments so they can contact individuals [who] may have come into contact with an infected person.</strong></p> \n   <p>Right now, a privacy impact assessment is being conducted. The privacy commissioner is involved, and all that will be made public. <strong>The source code will be made public,</strong> so all Australians can have absolute assurance, from the privacy right the way to the security, right the way to the individual elements, the bits and bytes of the code, that the app is simply a health app for individuals voluntarily used to help us trace those who may have been close to someone who has been infected by the virus. </p> \n   <p>So we want to be as transparent as we possibly can.

  "<p>The first arrests took place on the harbour at Yarmouth, the cobbled, picture-book port that lies on the Isle of Wight\u2019s quieter western side. It was a Sunday evening, 30 May 2010, almost a decade ago, but Nicky Green still sees it in Technicolor. She was working in Salty\u2019s, the family\u2019s restaurant just yards from the marina. \u201cIt was the bank holiday weekend and we were absolutely stacked,\u201d she says. Her parents were serving behind the bar, her daughter was waiting tables and her younger brother, Jamie, a 42-year-old fisherman, was out on the quay, just back from sea. \u201cI\u2019d called and asked him to bring in some lobsters,\u201d Nicky recalls. \u201cI was expecting him to walk through the door when someone told me he\u2019d been arrested.\u201d</p> <p>In the moment, she was too busy to follow it up. \u201cI was juggling the food, the crowds, the tables, and I knew Jamie was having an issue with some other fishermen \u2013 they were accusing each other of pinching lobster pots, and he was dodging the CID guy trying to deal with it. I thought this was fishermen bickering. I never on this Earth thought it was serious. How would I have ever imagined the gravity?\u201d</p> <p>But Jamie Green never came back. A year later, on 2 June 2011, Green, his crew of three \u2013 Scott Birtwistle, Daniel Payne and Zoran Dresic, as well as Jonathan Beere, a local scaffolder \u2013 were found guilty of conspiracy to import class A drugs. Their sentences, a combined total of 104 years, reflected the scale of the haul: a fisherman had found 250kg of cocaine worth an estimated \u00a353m roped together in holdalls and floating in the island\u2019s Freshwater Bay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a331751c8b6f9ce519d9679e5633c3b2193ad9d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a331751c8b6f9ce519d9679e5633c3b2193ad9d5/0_384_6436_3862/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicky Green, whose brother Jamie was one of the five men found guilty of conspiracy to import class A drugs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicky Green, whose brother Jamie was one of the five men found guilty of conspiracy to import class A drugs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The men, now known as the Freshwater Five, were not typical multimillion-pound drug smugglers. They had no previous convictions relating to drugs or dishonesty, no forensic evidence linked them to the cocaine, and a Proceeds of Crime Act inquiry assessed their gains from criminality at zero. They did not lead lavish lifestyles, and how they planned to distribute such a quantity of drugs was not made clear. The case has rocked the island, dividing friends, family and fishermen. While Birtwistle and Payne are out on licence, the remaining three men are nine years into 24-year sentences. Now new evidence means their case is coming back to the appeal court, a chance for all five to clear their names.</p> <p>***</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As a kid, Jamie was fishing mad \u2013 that\u2019s all he\u2019s done. He was a rufty-tufty fisherman who didn\u2019t suffer fools gladly\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A couple of miles across the Solent from the UK mainland, the Isle of Wight\u2019s private beaches, secluded inlets and narrow valleys have made it a smuggling base for centuries. It remains strangely isolated, a place where many juggle two or three jobs, since wages, employment and opportunities are all markedly lower than in the rest of the south-east. But for most, smuggling has been relegated to movies and history books. Today, the movement of drugs, firearms and people belongs to organised crime \u2013 which is partly why the Freshwater Five case stands out.</p> <p>Jamie Green, the central figure linking the men, was born and raised on the island; at trial, the prosecution accepted that he was \u201ca legitimate lobster fisherman\u201d. His parents founded Salty\u2019s more than 25 years ago, converting a garage first into a fish shop, then a bar and restaurant, which are now under new ownership. \u201cAs a kid, Jamie was fishing mad \u2013 that\u2019s all he has ever done,\u201d Nicky says. Green left school at 16, got his first boat at 17, and by 2010 owned the 39ft Galwad-y-Mor, supplying London restaurants and fishmongers, and exporting to mainland Europe.</p> <p>The family were well known in Yarmouth. Green had convictions for public order offences and drunkenness \u2013 and always pleaded guilty. \u201cHe was a rufty-tufty fisherman who didn\u2019t suffer fools gladly, and there are a lot of fools round Yarmouth,\u201d Nicky says. At the time of his arrest, Nikki, his wife of 21 years and the mother of their three children, was being treated for breast cancer.</p> <p>Birtwistle, the Galwad\u2019s only permanent crew member, saw Green as a mentor. Now 29, he has moved back home with his mother on the mainland in Selsey, a seaside town in Sussex. Calm and measured, he\u2019s balancing his wish to speak out with a wariness of not being believed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The police had intelligence that a drug delivery was arriving on a container ship to be picked up by a smaller boat</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Like Green, Birtwistle had always loved fishing. \u201cI loved the freedom. It didn\u2019t even feel like a job,\u201d he says. On leaving school, he placed an ad on findafishingboat.com. Green contacted him in December 2009, and within weeks Birtwistle had moved to the island to live in a caravan on Green\u2019s land and crew the Galwad. \u201cJamie knew his stuff and taught me so much,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Selsey, skippers take control and don\u2019t teach you anything in case you get your own boat and take their business. Jamie was different.\u201d</p> <p>Danny Payne, now 45, had known Green since his teens. Now back on the Isle of Wight, he\u2019s working on building sites, still adjusting to \u201clife outside\u201d. Payne had been a more reluctant crew member on that bank holiday trip. \u201cDo you know Quint, the shark hunter from Jaws?\u201d Payne asks. \u201cWell, that was Jamie. I used to call him Quint. He\u2019d bark and shout if you were doing it wrong, but he sure knows his way around a boat.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d worked for Jamie a lot over the years and used to enjoy it,\u201d he continues. \u201cMy dad was a submariner, and I\u2019ve always been around the sea. But by then, I was living with my girlfriend, we had a rescue dog and I didn\u2019t want to go out on the boat for days on end. I was doing more building work for nearly as much money, but I knew Nikki was ill and Jamie was having problems finding crew. It\u2019s ridiculously hard and always dangerous \u2013 even in the calmest weather, there\u2019s rope flying, the stink of rotting crab and fish and diesel. Most people only came once.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2c98038356acf9c9a1b8a9e8468b4fd963d6d85f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c98038356acf9c9a1b8a9e8468b4fd963d6d85f/0_395_6616_3970/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Freshwater Bay, Isle Of Wight, where 11 holdalls filled with cocaine worth \u00a353m were found floating in 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Freshwater Bay, Isle Of Wight, where 11 holdalls filled with cocaine worth \u00a353m were found floating in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Zoran Dresic, 36 and from Montenegro, was the third crew member. Married with three children, he\u2019d worked in Austria and Italy before coming to the UK on a false passport just two days before. According to Dresic, he\u2019d been promised work by a friend of a friend. This was not unusual \u2013 the whole fishing industry uses foreign crew and the Yarmouth harbourmaster confirmed the Galwad\u2019s high turnover. However, the prosecution\u2019s case was that Dresic, who spoke no English and had little if any fishing experience, had come with the express purpose of overseeing a drug drop, and that the \u201cfriends of friends\u201d \u2013 two men who\u2019d delivered Dresic to the island before returning to the mainland and disappearing \u2013 were coconspirators.</p> <p>Green set sail with his crew on the afternoon of Saturday 29 May, heading to the shipping lanes where cargo ships head east to Europe or west to the United States. According to Green, the forecast was bad but expected to break around midnight, by which time they\u2019d have reached the five-mile central reservation between the lanes, less heavily fished and rich with spring tides. What he couldn\u2019t have known was that it was also the centre of a massive police operation that weekend, run by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) and Middle Market Drugs Partnership (both of which have since been disbanded).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Galwad was searched and partly dismantled. Every inch of the boat was scanned, but no molecule of cocaine was found</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Operation Disorient had received intelligence that a drug delivery was arriving on a container ship, to be picked up by a smaller boat and taken ashore. Patrol ships and surveillance planes were looking out, and at some point the Galwad crossed their radar. Mid-channel, where the suspected transfer took place, in the dead of night in a force eight gale, there was nothing much to see. The Galwad\u2019s instruments show that the boat never stopped moving, though at 12.40am, for three and a half minutes, it reduced its speed from 5 knots to .57 of a knot. The prosecution claimed this was sufficient for Green and his crew to recover 11 holdalls of cocaine they believed had been jettisoned by a passing container ship, the MSC Oriane, travelling to Holland from Brazil. (The Oriane continued on; no trace of drugs were found on it. )</p> <p>How close these two vessels came has been hotly disputed, and at trial, one expert witness said he couldn\u2019t help but be \u201camused\u201d by the prosecution\u2019s claims. Anyone on the Oriane, travelling at 18 knots, would have risked ripping the holdalls apart if they chucked \u00a353m of cocaine into the sea. And on the Galwad, in the pitch black, in high winds, on rough seas, retrieving even one holdall in three and a half minutes would have been \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d683c333b2538fef66f99e24572d5e57c75836a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d683c333b2538fef66f99e24572d5e57c75836a9/0_200_6006_3604/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Green\u2019s 39ft fishing boat, the Galwad-y- Mor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green\u2019s 39ft fishing boat, the Galwad-y-Mor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In any case, the Galwad eventually headed back towards the island. That Sunday was clear and bright. The boat stayed out all day \u2013 in full view of bank holiday crowds, plus two police officers on Tennyson Down, a grassy chalk cliff with panoramic sea views. Shortly before the Galwad arrived back in Yarmouth, these police officers radioed in an entry: \u201cSU116 (the Galwad\u2019s ID number) is moving westbound, six to seven items overboard at intervals.\u201d Green has claimed that, if these \u201citems overboard\u201d were anything, they were old bait and waste; the crew may have been clearing the boat at the end of the trip, though he doesn\u2019t recall doing so.</p> <p>On arrival in Yarmouth, baskets of lobster in their arms, they were arrested and the boat seized. Police were so certain drugs were on board that Green\u2019s original charge sheet cited \u201cpossession and intent to supply\u201d. The Galwad was searched and partly dismantled. Its tank was pumped, an itemiser \u2013 a highly sensitive piece of police equipment \u2013 scanned every inch of the boat, but no molecule of cocaine was found.</p> <p>The following morning, Monday 31 May, a lobster fisherman found 11 holdalls, each stacked with cocaine, strung together on a rope attached to a weighted buoy in Freshwater Bay. (It was an area too shallow for the Galwad to have reached, but the prosecution claimed the holdalls may have drifted.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The police told me I didn\u2019t have to be in prison, I could have a new identity \u2013 but I told them I didn\u2019t know anything</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is where the investigation gets contentious. The court heard that on the Monday morning, in a police operation debrief, substantial amendments were made to the police log \u2013 so many that they became longer than the log itself. (In court, the log keeper claimed her radio had stopped working during the operation, which meant much had been missed.) The most critical amendment, and the only direct evidence linking the men to the drugs, was made by the two police officers from Tennyson Down. Contrary to strict protocol, they didn\u2019t attend the debrief, but made this amendment when they met the surveillance commander in a car park. It read: \u201cThe items appeared to be dark in colour and approximately the size of a large holdall. They were tied together on a line and were dispatched from the boat one after another, totalling 10-12. The last item was a red floating buoy.\u201d</p> <p>Had Green really deposited this enormous haul of cocaine when it was clear and sunny, in a bay where the shore and cliffs were heaving with people? Would an experienced fisherman leave the bags floating and drifting instead of carefully anchored and submerged? And having witnessed such a suspicious deposit, would police leave these items in the sea all night without even taking a photograph or noting the GPS? (In court, one of the police officers claimed they didn\u2019t have a camera.)</p> <p>No more evidence emerged. There were satellite calls made on the Galwad at sea that Saturday night \u2013 but their content is unknown. Although the cocaine was damp, suggesting leakage, no traces were found on the boat. And though a guilty plea would have substantially reduced their sentences, all five insisted they were innocent. Before the trial, police visited Payne in Parkhurst prison, offering freedom in exchange for information, but Payne insisted he had nothing to give. \u201cMy girlfriend had split up with me. They knew I was struggling,\u201d he says. \u201cThey told me I didn\u2019t have to be there, I could go wherever I wanted, I could have a new identity \u2013 but I told them I didn\u2019t know anything. That fishing trip was your normal bloody nightmare like every other fishing trip.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the figure most tenuously linked to all this was the fifth man, Jon Beere, who was arrested eight months later, then tried and convicted alongside the Galwad crew. Beere was 42, married for 18 years to Sue, a special needs support worker, and father of Elle, Maisie and Flynn. He ran a scaffolding business and though, according to Sue, Beere and Green weren\u2019t close, they\u2019d known each other for years \u201cas everyone on the island is connected\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"28a2afbd50a40daafbdbc475da92ee7a10875cd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28a2afbd50a40daafbdbc475da92ee7a10875cd9/1001_1156_4537_2722/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sue Beere, the wife of Jonathan Beere, one of the convicted men, with Maisie and Flynn, two of their three children.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sue Beere, the wife of Jonathan Beere, one of the convicted men, with Maisie and Flynn, two of their three children.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For nine years, Sue has raised their children without Beere. \u201cWhen it happened, Jon had a scaffolding job on the harbourmaster\u2019s building in Yarmouth, right by Jamie\u2019s boat,\u201d she says. The case against Beere is that, on Friday 28 May, the day before the fishing trip, he\u2019d taken his distinctive pick-up on the hovercraft to Portsmouth, where he met Dresic, and delivered him, along with two associates who were helping him as they spoke English, to Green. The defence claimed that Green had been at sea, unable to collect this potential crew member, so he\u2019d called Beere from his boat and asked him to do it as a favour. This was the extent of the case against the scaffolder.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest joke is that for doing that, he was the land-based criminal mastermind, the \u2018organiser\u2019,\u201d Sue says. The prosecution failed to produce any phone records, emails, texts or other lines of communication between Beere and whoever was supplying the drugs from abroad, or any other network, other than these two men. \u201cJon\u2019s the most disorganised person I know,\u201d Sue continues. \u201cHis filing system is Tesco bags tied with a knot, or telephone numbers scribbled on scraps of paper. He used to drive his poor secretary round the twist. Jon was very much part of the community \u2013 he\u2019d do anything for anyone. He wouldn\u2019t just give you a lift, he\u2019d lend you his car. He was a decent bloke. I talk like he\u2019s dead! But it\u2019s so hard, because every aspect of life hasn\u2019t been the same since.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>The Freshwater Five\u2019s trial took place in Kingston upon Thames, Soca\u2019s home turf, though the defence team had pushed for it to be held locally, or somewhere jurors might understand conditions at sea. \u201cDespite that, we still went into it believing it would all be resolved, that in a minute someone would see sense,\u201d Nicky Green says. \u201cYou\u2019re in this arena, you don\u2019t know the rules, and you don\u2019t see the steam train coming at you.\u201d Although the judge\u2019s final summary appeared to pour doubt on much of the evidence \u2013 referring to the \u201clarge number of additions and alterations\u201d to the police log and the \u201cextraordinary\u201d account from Tennyson Down \u2013 the jury reached a guilty verdict with a majority of 11 to one.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If it was a year in prison, I\u2019d have been devastated, but 24? How could I tell the children? How was I going to cope?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was like one of those films where the whole tone changes, like someone has flicked a switch,\u201d Nicky says. \u201cThere was this huge rush of emotion. Sue was howling. Nikki was howling. You\u2019re picking up all these broken people around you.\u201d</p> <p>The sentences followed that same day, the harshest reserved for Green, Beere and Dresic, who were seen as more deeply involved. \u201cI remember hearing \u201824 years\u2019,\u201d Sue says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a huge number. If it had been a year, I\u2019d have been devastated, but 24? How was I going to tell the children? How was I going to cope? What about the business? What about the house? What about\u2026 us?\u201d</p> <p>How has she coped? \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019ve got through it, if I\u2019m honest,\u201d she says. \u201cSupport, love, family, friends \u2013 and believing in Jon. My dad does the \u2018blue jobs\u2019 \u2013 splitting the wood, fixing the car. My mum has been amazing with the children.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Jon was arrested, our eldest was doing her GCSEs and our youngest was still in playschool. He\u2019s missed Elle getting her GCSE results, he\u2019s missed the birth of Willow, his first grandchild. He\u2019s missed two graduations. Maisie\u2019s first communion. Flynn\u2019s first day at primary. His last day at primary. Jon has never seen Flynn play football, and Flynn\u2019s in the top team on the island. He missed his best friend\u2019s funeral last year. Births, marriages, deaths. Everything.\u201d</p> <p>Jamie Green has also missed family milestones. His children have grown up, begun work, had children. One daughter now runs a local crab business (We\u2019ve Got Crabs) and his son, just 13 when Green was arrested, is now a North Sea skipper. Their mother Nikki died of cancer four years into Green\u2019s sentence. For 18 months, she was too sick to make the journey from Yarmouth to HMP Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire \u2013 though Green was allowed to visit her once in a hospice. He also attended her funeral, handcuffed to a guard.</p> <p>\u201cThere were about 700 people there and every one of them tried to hug him,\u201d Nicky says. \u201cFair play to the prisoner officer \u2013 he did his best to get out the way, with arms flying everywhere.\u201d Green also gave the eulogy with the guard crouched behind the podium. Green has said that when his voice started to falter, the guard quietly urged him on, and told him he could do it.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The appeal has given some hope to the families. It\u2019s being fought by Emily Bolton, the English lawyer who founded the Innocence Project New Orleans (which has exonerated 36 people to date) and is now director of <a href=\"http://appeal.org.uk/\">Appeal</a>. For Bolton, working in the UK has been a shock. \u201cIt\u2019s far slower, there\u2019s less access to information, no one picks up the phone, there\u2019s no sense of urgency,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the US, we got someone out in one year \u2013 I\u2019ve been working on this case for six.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This has destroyed a big part of my life and I want to rectify that, but even if I clear my name, I\u2019ll have the stigma</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One piece of evidence that Bolton had been requesting since 2014 \u2013 and that forms the basis of this appeal \u2013 finally arrived at the end of 2019. It involves the digital data taken from the onboard computer of the police cutter that was tracking the Galwad that night. The data had reportedly not been disclosed or used at trial, but shows two things. One is that in the shipping lanes around the time of the \u201chandover\u201d, the Oriane was heading south, moving further from the Galwad than had been suggested in court.</p> <p>More significantly for Bolton, back at Freshwater Bay at the time of the \u201cdeposit\u201d, it showed a mystery vessel heading towards the exact location where the drugs were later found, after the Galwad had passed through the area. \u201cThat was either the ultimate suspect panicking and dumping the drugs because police were everywhere, or a police boat going to search the area the Galwad had left and finding nothing,\u201d Bolton says. \u201cEither of those should have been disclosed at trial \u2013 and if it had been, I\u2019ve no doubt the men would not have been convicted.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s cautiously optimistic. \u201cI think the evidence is strong,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s digital, not something subject to human interference \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t wake up at 4am worrying about it. The families have been through so much, the idea that we might lose is absolutely chilling.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fce1cbeaf3adcac5df53adb72cb48509fa3460a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fce1cbeaf3adcac5df53adb72cb48509fa3460a/235_442_6132_3679/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Birtwistle, 29, another crew member who isout on licence.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott Birtwistle, 29, another crew member who is out on licence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the men themselves, there\u2019s hope mixed with dread mixed with disbelief. During Sue Beere\u2019s most recent prison visit, her husband said that perhaps, with luck, this would be one of the last times she\u2019d have to make the journey. But Birtwistle and Payne have lower expectations. \u201cThis has destroyed a big part of my life and I want to rectify what\u2019s wrong,\u201d Birtwistle says, \u201cbut even if I clear my name, I\u2019ll always have the stigma.\u201d Payne abandoned hope years ago. \u201cIt was not doing me any good mentally,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you continue to think about it, you\u2019d go mad. I\u2019ve got no faith in the system any more, no faith whatsoever \u2013 and when I accepted that, it just got easier.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 April 2020 to add Emily Bolton\u2019s current role as director of Appeal.</p>",

On a planning statement proposing the creation of the national football centre, the architects wrote: \u201cThe new open area of water will provide suitable habitat for dragonflies and damselflies, breeding opportunities for amphibians and foraging habitat for bats.</p> <p>\u201cThe margins of the open water will be planted with native species such as sweet flag and common reed and other aquatic species will be included. Public access will be controlled to prevent disturbance to ground nesting birds.\u201d</p> <p>Jay Tiernan from Stop the Cull said: \u201cThere is something sinister in creating a pond which you show off as part of your green credentials, only to slaughter the birds that come to use it because you don\u2019t like bird poo on your lawn.</p> <p>\u201cTheir planning permission application in part hinged on the benefits of the development to wildlife, so to then go and kill the geese is shocking. It\u2019s a terrible act of hypocrisy.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cLet the wild be wild. Nature should be allowed to flourish, and organisations like the Football Association should be leading the way with a far more holistic approach towards wild animals.\u201d</p> <p>Thirty-two other licences to kill greylag geese to protect public health were granted in 2018, data published by <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/wildlife-licences\">Natural England shows</a>.

  "<p>People feeling time hang heavy as they struggle with the restrictions of the lockdown may find an unexpected green uplift in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. The restrictions placed on going outside are fuelling a new online surge in citizen science, as internet users tune into data-crunching projects led by academic researchers.</p> <p>Enforced inactivity for hundreds of millions of people around the world is giving scientists the opportunity to recruit a vast army of online helpers, aiming their collective firepower at some seemingly intractable problems, from the climate crisis to plastic waste, as well as some cute ones - spotting spider monkeys, interpreting baby burblings and snapping blossoms.</p> <p>Unlike some previous citizen science projects, such as the recently paused <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/05/all-the-data-we-need-seti-computing-project-wound-up-after-20-years\">Search for Extra Terrrestrial Intelligence (Seti)</a> that relied on exploiting the unused computing power of home PCs while their users were offline, this new crop requires people to be alert and often interactive. Instead of searching through outer space, the project leaders invite people to connect with nature and solve environmental problems closer to home.</p> <p>\u201cCitizen science helps scientists and researchers analyse huge data sets which they simply couldn\u2019t manage by themselves, helping to save them hours of time and contributing to scientific breakthroughs,\u201d said Katherine Mathieson, chief executive of the British Science Association, which is helping to coordinate some of the UK-based initiatives. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic way to know you are making a positive difference without even having to leave your own home.\u201d</p> <h2>Coronavirus</h2> <p>Covid-19 is inevitably one of the most pressing research areas. Despite the efforts of governments and scientists around the world, data on the virus is still patchy, ranging from the very thorough in places such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-testing-how-some-countries-germany-south-korea-got-ahead-of-the-rest\">Iceland</a>, where a high proportion of people have been tested, to the alarmingly opaque, as the spread in many developing countries is likely be taking place without the tracking available in countries with better healthcare.</p> <p>Doctors and researchers at King\u2019s College London and Guys and St Thomas\u2019 hospitals are asking people to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/24/uk-app-aims-to-help-researchers-track-spread-of-coronavirus\">fill in data on their symptoms</a>, or lack of them, through an<a href=\"https://covid.joinzoe.com/\"> app</a>. The results around the UK are encouraging so far, as there has been a fall in the number of people aged 20-69 recording active symptoms, down to about 1.4 million people, from 1.9 million on 1 April. This is no substitute for proper testing, but will provide scientists with valuable data on the possible incidence and spread of the virus.</p> <h2>Earth Day</h2> <p>Fifty years ago, an estimated 20 million people took to the streets in the US and around the world to protest against the rampant destruction of the natural environment, the extinction of species, toxic pollution, and the despoliation of pristine habitats. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jul/06/guardianobituaries.environment\">Earth Day on 22 April 1970</a> marked the first major demonstration of a new environmentalism that sought to recognise the harm we were doing through untrammelled industrialism.</p> <p>The results of that protest are<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/07/save-the-planet-guide-fighting-climate-crisis-veganism-flying-earth-emergency-action\"> still being felt</a>, in legislation enacted to safeguard the environment, in the global climate movement and in conservation efforts. But planned demonstrations for the 50th anniversary \u2013 aimed at spurring a new generation of environmental activism \u2013 have had to be curtailed.</p> <p>Earth Day is now going online instead, and everyone with a smart phone or internet connection can take part. Two projects are currently active, on plastic and air quality, with more to follow, including tracking declining insect populations.</p> <p>Taking pictures of <a href=\"https://earthchallenge2020.earthday.org/pages/plastics\">plastic litter</a> and uploading them will allow for greater tracking of the plastic waste problem than has been possible up to now. Knowing what kind of litter is prevalent and where will help in formulating plastic waste reduction policies. The added bonus is that any cleaning up of plastic litter you do on your daily exercise outdoors will also be tracked.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-pandemic-leading-to-huge-drop-in-air-pollution\">Air quality has improved under the coronavirus lockdowns</a>, but that is likely to be short-lived as restrictions are lifted. The Earth Day <a href=\"https://earthchallenge2020.earthday.org/pages/airquality\">air quality app</a> invites people to photograph their horizon daily and send it in, to be processed centrally to gain a clearer picture of air pollution around the world.</p> <h2>Animal magic</h2> <p>Anyone itching for a bit of escapism without forbidden travel can spend some quality time in central America, courtesy of the Spotting Spider Monkeys project.</p> <p>Spider monkeys are fascinating creatures, very long-lived primates that are slow to reproduce, with each female on average having only one infant every three years. Huge areas of the monkeys\u2019 habitat are being lost to agriculture and other encroachment, with palm oil production one of the leading causes. All spider monkey species are now classed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/18/over-half-of-worlds-wild-primate-species-face-extinction-report-reveals\">threatened with extinction</a>.</p> <p>Researchers are now using drones to track spider monkeys through the forest, and using the footage they are developing an artificial intelligence algorithm capable of finding spider monkeys on its own. Before it can get to that stage, however, the systems needs to be fed thousands of images tagged for the presence of spider monkeys, to train the algorithm. This would take years, without the input of citizen scientists who are being <a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/rossmcwhirter/spotting-spider-monkeys\">asked to look at the images</a> from surveillance cameras and point to the presence of spider monkeys.</p> <p>This will also help researchers track the pattern of habitat loss and deforestation, which are threats to other species as well as the monkeys.</p> <h2>Blooming April</h2> <p>Leaving home only once a day for exercise might seem to give little opportunity for outdoor citizen science projects, but you too can do your bit. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/spring-blossom-images-unite-uk-nature-lovers-amid-corona-crisis\">Photographing blossom on your daily walk</a> will help the National Trust compile a changing gallery of pictures from around the country to delight those who can\u2019t make it to see the spring blooms in person.</p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of people have now joined up with the charity\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/features/blossom-watch\">#BlossomWatch</a>, either by sending in pictures or looking at what others have contributed. The project was launched last month to emulate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/apr/01/japanese-cherry-blossom-in-full-bloom-in-pictures\">hanami</a>, the Japanese custom of celebrating the fleeting sight and scent of blossom.</p> <p>Next year, the National Trust will develop the project further and produce a map to track the blossom across the UK, with a scientific purpose \u2013 it will help track climate change, and shed light on the pollinating insect who rely on blossom, and the birds who feed on them in turn.</p> <p>On similar lines, the <a href=\"https://naturescalendar.woodlandtrust.org.uk/\">Nature\u2019s Calendar website</a> run by the Woodland Trust allows people to record when they see their first butterfly or birds of the spring. With 2.9m records currently, it is the biggest biological record of its kind in the UK and ripe for more.</p> <h2>City Nature Challenge</h2> <p>Coronavirus lockdowns have cleared the streets of our cities of traffic and people and sent nature and wildlife <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/animals-cities-coronavirus-lockdowns-deer-raccoons\">bounding</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/20/dolphins-and-fish-nature-moves-into-spaces-left-empty-by-italian-coronavirus-quarantine-video\">splashing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/29/uk-wildlife-enjoys-humans-lockdown-but-concerns-raised-over-conservation\">scurrying</a> to fill the vacuum. The City Nature Challenge has run for five years, but this year promises to be different.</p> <p>Participants photograph any form of wildlife \u2013 from interesting fungi or even slime mould, to insects and birds, to the traces of animals \u2013 droppings, fur, feathers, shells or even carcases. They are uploaded via the <a href=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/\">iNaturalist</a> app and the online community helps to identify them.</p> <p>It takes place from 24 to 27 April, with the results to be announced on 4 May. The observations gathered become open-source data that will help scientists gauge patterns of global change in natural ecosystems and wildlife.</p> <h2>Rainy days</h2> <p>One for the rainy days is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/26/call-isolated-britons-help-digitise-historical-rainfall-data\">project from Reading University</a>, which will help researchers shed new light on the climate crisis by making local rainfall records of the past digitally accessible, so they can be fed into computer models. Some of Britain\u2019s rainfall and temperature records go back centuries, and this has been invaluable in drawing up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jun/10/data-store-drought\">detailed pictures</a> of the past climate, and thus computer models used to forecast climate change.</p> <p>But some of these vast hoards of data are still marooned in reams of old-fashioned paper records, and thus effectively unusable. Now scientists at the University of Reading are planning to rescue these obscure rain gauge records, using citizen scientists to do the work. Under the <a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/edh/rainfall-rescue\">Rainfall Rescue</a> project, volunteers will fill the gaps in British digital weather records between the 1820s and the 1950s by transcribing observations from scans of the old paper records.</p> <p>Rainfall is already proving popular: in the first 24 hours after the launch, 450,000 tasks had been completed, reports Ed Hawkins, a professor of climate science at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and the University of Reading. \u201cThese records will help scientists better understand how and why rainfall varies so much in different locations across the UK. With much of the population facing long spells indoors due to Covid-19, the chance to be part of a serious science project may provide a welcome distraction.\u201d</p> <h2>Lighting up the world</h2> <p>Coronavirus has highlighted the plight of people in developing countries who struggle with the basics of life, and whose precarious existence could topple over into disaster. One of the ways in which development organisations are hoping to improve people\u2019s lives is through providing safe access to power, for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/mar/06/fossil-fuels-poverty\"> clean cooking</a> and for lighting, that will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/11/260-million-school-global-fund-child-marriage-trafficking-labour\">help children with their learning</a> and adults to earn extra money.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/alycialeonard/power-to-the-people\">Power To </a><a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/alycialeonard/power-to-the-people\">the People project</a> will help train artificial intelligence algorithms to spot buildings from photographs of rural areas in developing countries, which in turn will allow them to be connected to the power grid.</p> <h2>Baby burbling</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/30/neuroscientists-decode-brain-speech-signals-into-actual-sentences\">Human speech</a> is one of the abiding scientific mysteries, and language development is a fascinating study. Scientists have been recording baby speech, from children aged between three months and four years, whose parents have agreed for them to wear a recorder for several hours each day.</p> <p>The resulting clips can record some of the first sounds babies make. But by their nature, the recordings also capture a lot of background noise, such as parental speech, television or other sources of sound.</p> <p>Armchair researchers can <a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/chiarasemenzin/maturity-of-baby-sounds\">listen to the recordings</a> and identify short clips by their type of sound, to detect which are worth further study. What could be more cheering in isolation than to listen to babies experimenting with speech for the first time?</p> <h2>TB or not TB</h2> <p>Coronavirus may be the most pressing health issue globally, but other diseases have not gone away. Tuberculosis is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/nov/14/why-is-the-world-losing-fight-against-history-most-lethal-disease-tb-tuberculosis\">on the rise again</a>, as new drug-resistant bacteria have surged among the poor and vulnerable around the world.</p> <p>Over the next five years, researchers will be collecting more than 100,00 samples from infected patients, and they want to work on testing which antibiotics are still effective, to understand how and where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/29/antibiotic-resistance-as-big-threat-climate-change-chief-medic-sally-davies\">resistance is growing</a>.

  "<p>It\u2019s 5.41pm, and I am worried. My boyfriend usually calls me on the dot of 5.30, and during these unusual times, I crave this daily check-in. The thing is, I can\u2019t call him. Leo is married and in lockdown with his wife and two children. It was hard enough being a mistress (a terrible 17th-century word, but nothing else quite fits) in \u201cpeace time\u201d, but Covid-19 has given our relationship a whole new dimension.</p> <p>Leo and I are both writers. We met at a literary festival last June. I am 51, a newly divorced Londoner, with a daughter at university. Leo is 49 and lives near Manchester. I knew from the outset that he was married: he wasn\u2019t wearing a ring, but one of our first conversations was about family holidays. I wouldn\u2019t say it was love at first sight, but he was funny and clever. Nice-looking, yes, but it was more his personality that attracted me; he radiated humorous warmth.</p> <p>Knowing and respecting the rules (married men are off limits), I said goodbye to Leo and got into my car. But two days later, I was pleased to receive a Facebook message. Witty texts led to WhatsApp and, finally, a phone call. Soon we were speaking twice a day, often for hours \u2013 his wife has a corporate office job, Leo works from home \u2013 and he wanted to meet again. I put him off a few times, but we both knew it was going to happen eventually.</p> <p>In November, we had a passionate reunion in London. Yes, we had sex \u2013 the first time I had slept with anyone since the end of my marriage. My nervousness soon evaporated and it was lovely. Mostly, we laughed and talked.</p> <p>Leo never says anything negative about his wife. He insists she is \u201ca good person\u201d, but they have been together since they were 16 and complacency has set in. He feels taken for granted, and they are no longer physically intimate. Any concerns that he wanted me just for sex soon dissolved. Leo is an attractive and successful writer; if he was after a fling, he could have found one nearer his own part of the country, surely. I don\u2019t feel great about adultery. It isn\u2019t sisterly \u2013 and Leo\u2019s wife sounds nice. On the other hand, I don\u2019t feel guilty. I haven\u2019t met her, and he says she has repeatedly ignored his requests to go to couples therapy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What would you do if you met the partner of your dreams languishing in a marriage past its shelf life?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In winter and early spring, Leo and I enjoyed several rendezvous, weekends away, even four days in France. When we knew coronavirus was coming to the UK, we sneaked in a last tryst in the Lake District. It was very intense, very loving.</p> <p>We have talked several times about the future. Leo is the main carer for his teenage children, and from the start told me they were his priority. So we are planning a life together after his younger child leaves home, in about four years\u2019 time. This makes me respect and love him more. I can wait: I am busy with work, friends, my daughter. I know some people will roll their eyes, but Leo tells me his marriage is over and I have chosen to believe him. To critics, I would say: what would you do if you met the partner of your dreams, languishing in a marriage past its shelf life?</p> <p>These days, the only time we can talk on the phone is when Leo goes for a run \u2013 and there is a limit to the number of runs a person is allowed. But these daily conversations are a lifeline. He will stop somewhere quiet, panting from the exercise. After four weeks in lockdown, Leo tells me his relationship with his wife has deteriorated further. (I don\u2019t take pleasure in this.) She is, understandably, anxious and needy. The kids have cabin fever. He is the chef and chief \u201ccheerer-upper\u201d, but this has become wearing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8d503499fd1565407d513fb13590696f58b186be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d503499fd1565407d513fb13590696f58b186be/0_128_2362_2234/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018He will stop somewhere quiet to talk to me in the street.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"946\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He will stop somewhere quiet to talk to me in the street.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Gym Class/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Less burdened with family responsibility, I try to make him laugh, and it isn\u2019t long before he makes me laugh, too. There is less intimacy (he is calling on a suburban street, after all). Instead we show our love through psychological support and fantasies about our eventual reunion. As for the virus, Leo is a healthy man in his late 40s. But I do worry; if he became ill, I have no idea how I would find out \u2013 except from the radio silence. I don\u2019t know his landline number or his address; I have met only one of his male friends. If the <em>very</em> worst happened, I would be that mysterious woman you see in the movies, lurking at the back of a graveyard with big sunglasses and a black trenchcoat. (This is what happens when a person with an overactive imagination goes into lockdown.)</p> <p>The toughest thing is the sense of powerlessness that comes with most of our communication flowing only one way. Anxiety aside, I am an impatient person who doesn\u2019t enjoy waiting. Today, when Leo finally calls just before 6pm, any irritation evaporates \u2013 partly in relief, partly in empathy.</p> <p>The question is: do I want to keep putting myself through this? And who knows how things will be when we get back to normal. My philosophy is this: if things don\u2019t work out between us, I will be very upset, but not destroyed. My corona affair has taught me that I can love again after a horrible marriage breakup \u2013 and be loved again in return.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>Names and details have been changed.</p>",

He adds sketches of people such as the supreme court chief justice, Samuel Chase, (who thought he should have been inaugurated that day), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/28/david-blight-on-frederick-douglass-i-call-him-beautifully-human\">abolitionist and orator Frederick Douglass</a>, nurse Clara Barton and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/walt-whitman\">poet Walt Whitman</a>, with his tart description of the capital city: \u201cThis huge mess of traitors, loafers, hospitals, axe-grinders, &amp; incompetencies &amp; officials that goes by the name of Washington.\u201d</p> <p>It is also, of historical necessity, the story in parallel of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/from-the-archive-blog/2015/apr/14/president-lincoln-assassination-1865\">John Wilkes Booth\u2019s obsession with Lincoln</a> and involvement in a conspiracy to kidnap him on inauguration day or even to assassinate him there, perhaps in some imitation of the murder of Julius Caesar. Booth is the second character in the book.</p> <p>In early March 1865, Washington was a mess. Literally with mud-soaked streets and crowded hospitals treating combatants; figuratively, with unscrupulous war profiteers and a dysfunctional Congress racing to the end of its session. In the war itself, William Tecumseh Sherman continued his march through the South while Ulysses S Grant tightened the noose around Lee at Petersburg.</p> <p>In the midst of it all stood Lincoln. The French minister in Washington wrote that \u201c[h]is face denotes an immense force of resistance and extreme melancholy. It is plain that this man has suffered deeply.\u201d The president\u2019s own secretary, John Hay, noted that \u201cthe boisterous laughter became less frequent year by year; the eye grew veiled by constant meditation on momentous subjects\u201d.</p> <p>Achorn wisely avoids deep psychobiography but simply and accurately notes that \u201cLincoln\u2019s hard life had left him with thick scar tissue over his psychic wounds\u201d from his upbringing, yet the war \u201chad reawakened his thoughts about God\u2019s role in this world of suffering\u201d.</p> <p>Lincoln\u2019s religion or lack thereof has been a subject of lively debate. Achorn falls squarely in the pro-belief camp. Indeed, Lincoln had foreshadowed the themes and words of the Second Inaugural in remarks in 1862 to a delegation of Chicago ministers who wanted him to move more quickly on slavery. Achorn believes Lincoln spoke truthfully, not cynically, in saying to General Ethan Allen Hitchcock: \u201c[D]id I not see the hand of God in the crisis \u2013 I could not sustain it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ae5066c7530b93fb3e52f24db795134fec40134c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae5066c7530b93fb3e52f24db795134fec40134c/0_0_3500_5252/666.jpg\" alt=\"A memorial edition of The National News, 14 April 1866.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A memorial edition of The National News, 14 April 1866.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his message to Congress in 1861 and more famously at Gettysburg, Lincoln put the vast struggle in a universal context affecting all humanity, asking if republics could survive. Particularly after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/17/emancipation-proclamation-150-anniversary-abraham-lincoln\">the Emancipation Proclamation</a>, the war had proceeded beyond the expectations of either side into a war not only for the Union but to abolish slavery, which Lincoln accurately described as \u201cthe cause of the war\u201d.</p> <p>Now, Lincoln went deeper, turning the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/15/donald-trump-inauguration-jefferson-lincoln-hard-acts-to-follow\">inaugural </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/15/donald-trump-inauguration-jefferson-lincoln-hard-acts-to-follow\">address</a> into an extended reflection on the causes of the war, divine justice and \u201cthe mystery of suffering\u201d. As Achorn writes, Lincoln \u201cwould not bask in the glory of recent, hard-fought military victories, or present a detailed plan for reconstruction. He would speak about human depravity, about the hideous sin committed by both sides, and about the justice of God\u2019s infallible, implacable, inescapable will.\u201d</p> <p>The speech was \u201ca confession of grave national failure \u2026 Lincoln was freely stating that he had not been in control of the nation\u2019s fate, a confession of weakness rare for any politician\u201d \u2013 and, in a sense, that <em>he</em> was responsible for the calamity as well. While the evil of slavery had caused the war, <em>both</em> sides, not the South alone, were responsible for the conflict and its horrors. The sacrifice Lincoln now asked of all Americans was to sacrifice hatred and vengeance, and in their place put charity.</p> <p>We treat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/15/donald-trump-inauguration-jefferson-lincoln-hard-acts-to-follow\">the Second Inaugural as a valedictory</a>, prior to Lincoln\u2019s assassination a few weeks later. Douglass felt there was \u201cmurder in the air\u201d that day, and he was right. As Lincoln walked through the crowd, the official planning the inauguration \u201chappened to see a man jump\u201d into the official procession, \u201cdetermined to get close to Lincoln\u201d. It was Booth (who had an official ticket; read the book to find out why), but after what one described as a \u201csevere struggle\u201d Booth was released \u2013 a great \u201cwhat if\u201d of history.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/28/lincoln-project-donald-trump-cooper-union-rick-wilson\">'Right makes might': Lincoln Project takes aim at Trump from Cooper Union</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The day was fraught with portents. Vice-President Andrew Johnson made a drunken speech to the Senate. Violent winds and rain gave way to bright sunshine as Lincoln rose to speak. Whitman noticed that \u201ca curious little white cloud, the only one in that part of the sky, appeared like a hovering bird, right over him\u201d. The many African Americans in attendance applauded vigorously but, as Douglass noted, during the speech the crowd was \u201cwonderfully quiet, earnest, and solemn\u201d.</p> <p>Its broader reception was mixed, largely based on partisan affiliation, a reminder of how unpopular Lincoln was in certain parts of the North. Lincoln\u2019s own verdict is typically direct: \u201cIt is a truth which I thought needed to be told; and as whatever of humiliation there is in it, falls most directly on myself; I thought others might afford for me to tell it.\u201d</p> <p>Achorn has done Lincoln justice, distilling the essence of the speech in a reflection Lincoln would have understood: \u201cIt was time for Americans to stop thinking about self-righteousness. The only way forward was to recognize that all had been wrong and to treat each other with mercy.\u201d</p>",

Then it was the turn of the 15 members and six advisers on the emergency committee, drawn from around the world.</p> \n<p>The debate was highly technical but it had one critical issue at its heart. It was known by then that the virus had spread from person to person, but the question was how easily?</p> \n<p>If human-to-human transmission was only happening in close quarters, in families, or between patients and health workers, then perhaps it could be largely contained without a worldwide alert, and all the global economic disruption that entailed. If the virus was spreading freely among communities, there was not a moment to lose.</p> \n<p>The emergency committee was split down the middle on the question.

The US is well represented in the top ranks of the organisation. There were more than a dozen officials from the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) embedded in the WHO in January and February.</p> \n<p>US health leaders were part of regular conference calls, weekly or twice weekly, beginning on 7 January.

It was sent from Taiwan\u2019s CDC to its WHO liaison officer on 31 December, hours after the first official report of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan were published online.</p> \n<p>According to the text provided to the Guardian, the email said: \u201cNews resources today indicate that at least seven, atypical pneumonia cases were reported in China.\u201d</p> \n<p>It restates the details of Chinese report, adding \u201cI would greatly appreciate it if you have relevant information to share with us.\u201d</p> \n<p>The email did not contain new information, and certainly nothing about human-to-human transmission. The WHO had picked up the same report on the night of 30 December and was urgently seeking more information. On 1 January it activated its incident management support team, putting the organisation on an emergency footing.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/18/china-coronavirus-who-diplomatic-challenge\">China's handling of coronavirus is a diplomatic challenge for WHO</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Taiwanese government has claimed that it did not receive a reply to its inquiry and was generally shut out from WHO deliberations. Since the UN voted to recognise the People\u2019s Republic as the sole representative of China in 1971 and the World Health Assembly followed suit in 1972, Taiwan has not had full member status in the WHO, but it is involved in the organisation\u2019s work.</p> \n<p>It is one of 15 non-state entities that have access to expert deliberations through an information network established by the International Health Regulations (IHR), a pact on collective action against infectious disease with roots stretching back to the nineteenth century. The latest version was agreed in 2005 by 196 countries, and it provides the legal framework for the work of the WHO.</p> \n<p>However, Taiwan says its participation is fragmentary and selective, largely because Chinese obstruction. A Taipei government statement pointed out that it reported its first confirmed coronavirus case on 21 January through the IHR system, but was not invited to participate in the three emergency committee meetings held in January, where its voice may have made a difference.</p> \n<p>Taiwanese experts were among the first to visit Wuhan, in the first half of January, and its containment measures later proved effective. Singapore, meanwhile, had two representatives on the committee.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Covid-19 outbreak is a reminder to all the world once again, that politics has barred Taiwan from contact and communication with WHO and global public health experts, and this can only gravely damage global cooperation in epidemic prevention and control,\u201d the statement said.</p> \n<p>Tedros has also drawn criticism for his tireless praise of China and Xi Jinping\u2019s leadership, hailing Beijing\u2019s transparency despite the critical early weeks left when the authorities tried to cover up the extent of the problem in Wuhan. The director general\u2019s defenders say such diplomatic flattery is the price of ensuring Chinese cooperation with information and WHO site visits. Tedros also complimented Trump in a March 23 tweet, claiming he was doing \u201ca great job in the fight against Covid-19\u201d, and Trump was also effusive in praising Xi in the first weeks of the pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re making it seem like he\u2019s a crony of China, but he\u2019s caught in the middle of a super power struggle competition,\u201d Gostin said.</p> \n<p>The WHO also provided ammunition to its detractors when, on 14 January, it put out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1217043229427761152?s=20\">a tweet</a> citing preliminary Chinese studies finding \u201cno clear evidence of human-to-human transmission\u201d.</p> \n<p>It was issued on the same day the WHO\u2019s technical lead on Covid-19, Maria Van Kerkhove (a US immunologist) gave a press briefing in Geneva warning of precisely the opposite \u2013 the potential for rapid spread. Concerned that her briefing conflicted with the initial Chinese findings, a middle-ranking official told the social media team to put out a tweet to balance the Van Kerkhove briefing. In so doing, the WHO exposed itself to the charge of contributing to an air of complacency. But the tweet was factually true and does not appear to have been part of a deliberate strategy.</p> \n<p>Again and again, the events of January reflected the difficulties Tedros and his organisation faced in negotiating a path between two hostile superpowers, and the egos of their leaders, without any independent powers to enforce compliance and information sharing.</p> \n<p>However, what mistakes that may have been made in charting that course have little to do with the lethal fiasco that unfolded in the US in the two months after the WHO raised an international alarm.</p>",

Birx was working to identify additional testing capacity, he added, and the taskforce believed states could double it by activating existing laboratories.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/director\">Dr Anthony Fauci,</a> director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, admitted that there had been failings. He told reporters: \u201cIt was a problem that was a technical problem from within that was corrected and it was an issue of embracing, the way we have now, and should have, the private sector who clearly has the capability of making and providing tests at the level that we will need them.\u201d</p> <p>Governors, members of Congress and public health experts have argued that testing should be more widespread and that the federal government needs to provide more resources.</p> <p>Dr Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and associate professor at Brown University, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/test-troubles-cloud-trump-recovery-effort\">told the Associated Press:</a> \u201cThere are places that have enough test swabs, but not enough workers to administer them. There are places that are limiting tests because of the CDC [Centers for Disease Control] criteria on who should get tested. There\u2019s just so many inefficiencies and problems with the way that testing currently happens across this country.\u201d</p> <p>There are complaints from hospitals and state health departments that they are being forced into a bidding war against each other for swabs, equipment and chemicals manufactured in China necessary to carry out tests. Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, said: \u201cThe federal government cannot wipe their hands of this and say, \u2018Oh, the states are responsible for testing.\u2019 I don\u2019t do China relations. I don\u2019t do international supply chain.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday, Trump was also asked fresh questions about claims that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/trump-us-coronavirus-theory-china\">Covid-19 escaped from a virology lab</a> in the Chinese city of Wuhan and again, in a rambling answer, he fanned the flames of speculation. \u201cWe are looking at it. A lot of people are looking at it. It seems to make sense.\u201d</p>",

His latest provocative interventions followed demonstrations against stay-at-home orders in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia and other states that have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/far-right-coronavirus-protests-restrictions\">drawn elements of the far right</a>.</p> \n<p>Some protesters have carried guns, waved Trump and Confederate flags and sought to frame the debate as a defence of constitutional freedoms. They have been egged on by conservative media hosts such as Fox News\u2019s Jeanine Pirro, who said: \u201cWhat happened in Lansing [Michigan] today, God bless them: it\u2019s going to happen all over the country.\u201d</p> \n<p>At Friday\u2019s White House coronavirus taskforce briefing, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1251298532964872192?s=20\">Trump played down fears</a> that by crowding together, the protesters themselves could spread the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1227248333871173632?s=20\">Covid-19</a> illness. \u201cThese are people expressing their views,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI see where they are and I see the way they\u2019re working. They seem to be very responsible people to me, but they\u2019ve been treated a little bit rough.\u201d</p> \n<p>In 2017 the president was condemned for reacting to a deadly clash between white nationalists and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/15/donald-trump-charlottesville-trump-tower-white-supremacists\">observing</a> that there \u201cwere very fine people on both sides\u201d.</p> \n<p>On Friday, Trump also stood by his criticism of the Democratic governors, even though they are following his own federal guidelines. \u201cI think some things are too tough,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you look at some of the states you just mentioned, it\u2019s too tough, not only in reference to this but what they\u2019ve done in Virginia with respect to the second amendment is just a horrible thing ... When you see what other states have done, I think I feel very comfortable.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked if he believed Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia should lift their stay-at-home orders, the president added: \u201cI think elements of what they\u2019ve done are too much, just too much ... What they\u2019ve done in Virginia is just incredible.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump, known to watch Fox News closely, has offered mixed messages. On Monday he claimed \u201ctotal\u201d authority to order an end to the stay-at-home measures, but on Thursday issued phased \u201cguidelines\u201d that passed the buck to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/trump-coronavirus-reopening-us-economy-guidelines-governors\">governors to make decisions</a> on the ground about when and how to reopen. His tweets on Friday appeared to undercut his own experts\u2019 warnings and drew sharp criticism.</p> \n<p>Jay Inslee, the Democratic governor of Washington, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GovInslee/status/1251235713414123521\">tweeted in response</a>: \u201cThe president\u2019s statements this morning encourage illegal and dangerous acts. He is putting millions of people in danger of contracting Covid-19. His unhinged rantings and calls for people to \u2018liberate\u2019 states could also lead to violence. We\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d</p> \n<p>Beto O\u2019Rourke, a former Texas congressman who like Inslee ran for the Democratic nomination, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetoORourke/status/1251240005332238343\">said</a>: \u201cRepublicans will turn a blind eye [and] too many in the press will focus on \u2018tone\u2019. But history books will say: in April of 2020, when the pandemic had already claimed 35,000 lives, the president of the United States incited people to storm their statehouses with AR-15s and AK-47s.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b78fefbe-1dfb-4640-b32b-19788d62e6bb\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4b6GvszlkR0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Michigan has taken big hits in both coronavirus cases and job losses and will be a critical battleground state in the presidential <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">election</a>.

It said that all deaths of people who had tested positive for Covid-19 needed to be recorded, whether they occurred in hospitals, homes or care homes.</p> \n  <p>On Friday, health ministry figures put the total number of cases in Spain at 188,068 \u2013 up 5,252 from the previous day. That suggests an overnight increase in new cases of 2.9%, which is well in line with recent daily increases \u2013 and markedly down from the 38% daily rise seen when the state of emergency was declared in Spain just over a month ago.</p> \n  <p>The same set of figures show an overnight death toll of 348 \u2013 well down on recent days. But speaking at his daily press conference, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies put the overnight death toll at 585.</p> \n  <p>The new recording and reporting criteria also seem to have skewed the number of cured people. On Thursday, the health ministry said that 74,797 people across Spain had recovered.
