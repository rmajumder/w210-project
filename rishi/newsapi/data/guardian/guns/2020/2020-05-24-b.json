Thanks as always for following along. </p> \n  <p>Here are the most important developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Wuhan lab had bat coronaviruses \u2013 but not Covid-19.</strong> The Chinese virology institute in Wuhan, the city in China at the heart of the coronavirus pandemic, has three live strains of bat coronavirus on-site, but none match the Covid-19 strain, its director has said. The director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology told state broadcaster CGTN that claims by US president Donald Trump that the virus could have leaked from the facility were \u201cpure fabrication\u201d. In an interview filmed on 13 May but broadcast on Saturday night, Wang Yanyi said the centre had \u201cisolated and obtained some coronaviruses from bats. Now we have three strains of live viruses \u2026 But their highest similarity to Sars-CoV-2 only reaches 79.8%.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>US opens up for summer. </strong>There are fears the US will suffer a second wave of coronavirus infections as it opens up for summer, just days away from the grim milestone of 100,000 Covid-19 deaths. Every state has relaxed restrictions to some extent, with many flocking to beaches and outdoor areas. The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/new-york-times-front-page-1000-covid-19-death-notices\">filled the entire front page</a> of Sunday\u2019s paper with the death notices of victims from across the country as the country recorded more than 97,000 deaths.</li> \n   <li><strong>Argentina extends lockdown. </strong>Argentina has extended the mandatory lockdown in Buenos Aires until 7 June and tightened some movement restrictions, after a steady increase in the city\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases in recent days. Officials will tighten traffic controls between the capital and Buenos Aires province, the area with the second highest concentration of cases. The country recorded 704 new infections on Saturday, one of the highest single-day increases since the pandemic began.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil cases near 350,000. </strong>Brazil registered 965 new coronavirus deaths on Saturday, taking the total number of fatalities to 22,013, the health ministry said. The country now has 347,398 confirmed cases, according to the ministry, up 16,508 from Friday, when it surpassed Russia to become the world\u2019s virus hot spot behind the US. The actual number of cases and deaths is believed to be higher than the official figures disclosed by the government, as the testing capacity of Latin America\u2019s largest country still lags.</li> \n   <li><strong>New Zealand reports no new cases. </strong>New Zealand\u2019s health ministry has announced there were zero new coronavirus cases confirmed in the last 24 hours. According to NewsHub, there are now only 27 active cases left in New Zealand, with one more patient recovered, bringing the country\u2019s total to 1,154, with 21 deaths.</li> \n   <li><strong>Australian states ease restrictions. </strong>In Australia, Victorian state premier, Daniel Andrews, has said Victorians will be allowed to have 20 people in their homes as well as overnight stays in hotels from 1 June. In New South Wales, Australia\u2019s most populous state, health minister Brad Hazzard announced that beauty, tanning, nail and waxing salons would all be open from 1 June.</li> \n   <li><strong>Pompeo threatens Australia over Belt and Road projects. </strong>The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has implied information sharing with Australia may be at risk if the Victoria proceeds with any Belt and Road projects that jeopardise communications networks. Issuing the highly qualified warning during an interview with Sky News Australia, the News Corp-owned channel, Pompeo urged Victoria to scrutinise any proposals \u201cincredibly closely\u201d because Belt and Road projects could \u201cbuild up the capacity of the Chinese Communist party to do harm\u201d. Victoria has attracted domestic political criticism for signing an agreement that would allow for it be part of the Belt and Road Initiative.</li> \n   <li><strong>French churches to hold first masses since lockdown started. </strong>French churches were preparing to hold their first Sunday masses in more than two months after the government bowed to a ruling that they should be reopened. Nearly two weeks into the relaxation of its shutdown, the government finally allowed churches, mosques and synagogues to reopen. Worshippers will have to wear masks, there will have to be disinfectant gel on hand and the seating will need to be organised to ensure people keep a safe distance from each other.</li> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser under pressure as second trip emerges. </strong>In the UK, prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, faces renewed pressure to resign after new witnesses reported <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/23/new-witnesses-cast-doubt-on-dominic-cummingss-lockdown-claims\">seeing him making a fresh trip</a> hundreds of miles to Durham.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/coronavirus-latest-24-may-at-a-glance\">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-24T07:11:22.294Z\">at 8.11am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eca19d58f0886ce4f5d951e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-24T06:56:05.370Z\">7.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In Australia, a Darwin pub has been fined more than AU$5,000 (US$3,270) for repeatedly failing to adhere to strict coronavirus laws.</p> \n  <p>Police and environmental health officers issued a caution to Lola\u2019s Pergola on 15 May for failing to serve separate meals to people consuming liquor, patrons not being seated while drinking and social distancing not being implemented.<br><br>One week later, further observations confirmed reports from concerned patrons that alcohol was being served without meals.</p> \n  <p>Advice about the chief health officer\u2019s directions was provided to the owner at the time.<br><br>But the next day, the venue had to be cautioned again and the following day the infringement notice was issued.<br><br>More than 11,000 compliance checks have been completed and 57 fines issued.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-24T06:58:26.951Z\">at 7.58am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eca10b58f08a1782fa807f8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/michael-savage\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-24T06:47:27.642Z\">7.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>UK low-income households denied coronavirus support by benefit cap</h2> \n  <p>Tens of thousands of poor households are being denied extra support designed to ease the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, after being hit by the government\u2019s benefit cap.</p> \n  <p>The number of low-income households affected by the cap in London has doubled since the crisis started, according to analysis seen by the <em>Observer</em>. Households already at the cap when the crisis hit have been missing out on \u00a3320 a month in additional support. For private renters with children, this is \u00a3532 a month. A further 22,000 households are now at the cap and are missing out on an average of \u00a3185 a month.</p> \n  <p>It has led to an outcry that there is now a two-tier system, in which workers on the government\u2019s furlough scheme have access to far more support than some of those reliant on welfare.

The docuseries also show how the scandals that rocked the Clinton administration led Hillary to further strengthen her defences to avoid public scrutiny.</p> <p>The gendered double standard that dictates female politicians must be \u201clikeable\u201d, and able to freely show their emotions, would undercut her political achievements even as she became a global feminist icon. It would contribute to her 2016 election loss to Donald Trump, despite winning the popular vote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"547e087ea1645a06f1ce87bcecc39f739d213a7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/547e087ea1645a06f1ce87bcecc39f739d213a7d/0_169_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary\u2019s legacy has always been shaped by the ways in which she was forced, as a young female lawyer, to withhold her emotions to demonstrate her credibility.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary\u2019s legacy has always been shaped by the ways in which she was forced, as a young female lawyer, to withhold her emotions to demonstrate her credibility.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SBS On Demand</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Clintons have played such a powerful role in modern history that it\u2019s easy to overlook their influence as a cultural barometer. But, as Amanda Hess puts it in a<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/arts/television/paula-jones-monica-lewinsky-bill-clinton.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> November 2018 New York Times article</a>, The Clinton Affair takes a largely neutral stance, recounting the events of the 1990s in chronological order. In doing so, it shows us, for the first time, how the Clintons themselves were caught up in cultural change.</p> <p>The Clinton Affair introduces Hillary as a new kind of first lady. She isn\u2019t an ornament to be looked at. She\u2019s a formidable lawyer who sits near her husband, her closest collaborator, in the West Wing. When Bill is inaugurated, she\u2019s chosen to chair the Task Force on National Health Care Reform, an attempt at more inclusive healthcare policy that still haunts pandemic-era America.</p> <p>But revelations that Bill was involved in a two-year sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a bright 22-year-old White House intern, and the string of events that would lead to his 1998 impeachment, shattered national perceptions of the Clintons as a couple whose relationship was rooted in shared ideals.</p> <p>At the time, the tabloids framed this as \u201cthe Lewinsky scandal\u201d. Invoking age-old gendered tropes, they cast Bill as the philandering husband, Hillary as the long-suffering wife and Lewinsky as young seductress. But Lewinsky gives in-depth accounts of her version of events and its painful implications for her life and family, and by putting her front and centre, The Clinton Affair exposes the invisible misogyny at work during that cultural moment. The documentary makes clear how the scandal was exacerbated by a newly potent 24-7 news cycle interested in bankable stories and easy targets.</p> <p>Most importantly, The Clinton Affair asks us to reconsider Lewinsky\u2019s testimony, and the part she played in history, from the position of a post-#MeToo era, one in which powerful men like Harvey Weinstein are held accountable for exploiting young women.</p> <p>Just as The Clinton Affair reclaims Lewinsky\u2019s perspective, Hillary wrests back Hillary\u2019s story by illuminating the ways in which her own chances at the presidency were compromised by the failures of the men around her. Hillary reveals how leaked sexts sent by Anthony Weiner, the husband of her top aide, Huma Abedin, sparked James Comey\u2019s new investigation into her use of a private email server, fuelling rumours about her trustworthiness that had lingered since her husband was in office. In doing so, Hillary sheds new light on the age-old feminist struggle that demands women must be perfect to be taken seriously.<br><br>Almost three decades on, the Clintons\u2019 60 Minutes interview is a powerful testament of the their legacy. It raises questions that still loom large in our culture, about the role of good wives and good husbands, about whether feminism can truly elevate all women, about whether lapses in moral judgment compromise the ability to lead. But it also shows us that it\u2019s impossible to reduce people to ciphers and that even events that have become symbolic are a consequence of specific moments in time. Since we were first introduced to the Clintons, the world has changed in ways we could never imagine.</p> <p>When Hillary was asked, on an<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/01/hillary-clinton-gutsiest-thing-shes-ever-done-was-to-stay-in-her-marriage\"> October 2019 ABC interview</a>, to name the gutsiest thing she\u2019d ever done, she replied, \u201cmake the decision to stay in my marriage\u201d.

The staff of NHS laboratories do everything they can to minimise false positives, she said.</p> \n<p>Asked by Madders to name all the Covid-19 tests in use, Dorries declined to do so.

Even though the test is far from perfect the inability for healthcare and social care workers to access the test for themselves, their patients and their families has hampered our ability to respond to the pandemic and control its spread within hospitals and care homes.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Nick Phin, PHE\u2019s incident director, declined to respond directly to the HCSA\u2019s concerns.

The Rt Revd Nick Baines, bishop of Leeds, said: \u201cThe question now is: do we accept being lied to, patronised and treated by a PM as mugs?

It is an insult to sacrifices made by the British people that Boris Johnson has chosen to take no action against Dominic Cummings. The public will be forgiven for thinking there is one rule for the prime minister\u2019s closest adviser and another for the British people.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe prime minister\u2019s actions have undermined confidence in his own public health message at this crucial time.

Matthews tweeted a link to a route from the running app Strava that he had dubbed \u201cBrick Run aka Dominic Cummings Spotting Run\u201d.</p> \n<p>It marks the area where he saw Cummings at 3.45pm on 19 April.

Lees made a complaint by email to police on Sunday after reporting that he saw Cummings and his family walking in the town before getting into a car.</p> \n<p>The alleged sighting of Cummings in the town appeared to come while he was still ill, according to his own account. Writing in the Spectator last month, Cummings said: \u201cAt the end of March and for the first two weeks of April I was ill, so we [Cummings and his wife] were both shut in together.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson did not dispute that his adviser had made a trip to the Tees Valley beauty spot. Asked directly about the visit, the prime minister said: \u201cWhen you look at the guidance, when you look at the particular childcare needs that Mr Cummings faced at the time, it was reasonable of him to self-isolate as he did for 14 days or more with his family where he did. I think that was sensible and defensible and I understand it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Durham police has yet to respond to complaint but the Guardian understands the force is considering whether it needs to take any further action in relation to Cummings.</p> \n<p>As well as Lees\u2019 complaint, the leader of the Liberal Democrats group on Durham County Council has demanded the police open an investigation into whether Cummings broke the 2020 Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations.</p>",

Without such reassurances, leaders struggle with the ethical side of opening up, unsure of the risks and therefore unable to mitigate against them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Whiteman revealed that the DfE\u2019s discussions with unions have been \u201cbusiness-like and open. That\u2019s not to say it is getting everything right, but it really isn\u2019t the case that we\u2019re at loggerheads as some front-page headlines have suggested.\u201d</p> \n<p>Two polls published over the weekend \u2013 one in the Daily Mail and one in the Sunday Telegraph \u2013 found that 60% of parents were not prepared to allow their children to go back to school.</p> \n<p>Sir Michael Wilshaw, the former chief inspector of schools in England, told Sky News that implementing social distancing for children as young as five \u201cis going to be like herding cats, it\u2019s going to be really difficult.

  "<p>Boris Johnson resolutely defended Dominic Cummings when the furore over him forced an unscheduled appearance at the coronavirus press briefing on Sunday.</p> \n<p>But while the prime minister, speaking at the daily Downing Street conference, said he thought that Cummings had acted \u201cresponsibly, legally and with integrity\u201d, he left many questions unanswered, skirted around key issues and provoked fresh fury among Tory MPs and political opponents alike.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/boris-johnson-backs-dominic-cummings-in-face-of-tory-calls-for-chief-aide-to-resign\">Boris Johnson backs Dominic Cummings in face of Tory calls for chief aide to resign</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Johnson insisted Cummings had not broken any guidelines by travelling to Durham for childcare reasons</strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p><em>Mr Cummings did isolate for 14 days or more and the circumstances of his self-isolation were determined by the difficult childcare position that he found himself in ... the guidance makes it very clear that where you have particular childcare needs that has got to be taken into account.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Johnson did not make clear which guidance he was referring to. Cummings\u2019 home is in London, and the government rules at the time were specific \u2013 stay at home.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The prime minister himself had implored people not to travel and visit relatives. Cabinet Office advice was also emphatic: \u201cLeaving your home \u2013 the place you live \u2013 to stay at another home for a holiday or other purpose is not allowed. This includes visiting second homes.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked by reporters on Saturday for her reading of the exemptions in the coronavirus guidelines, the deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, suggested that an exemption would be \u201cunless there is an extreme risk to life\u201d. Nobody has suggested this was the case with Cummings and his family.</p> \n<p>Johnson did not explain how Cummings got to Durham in the first place. Was it by car? If so, did he stop on the way? By train? If so, was he with other passengers? Nor was there any detailed explanation for why the couple\u2019s childcare needs could only be catered for with a 260-mile trip to Durham, rather than in London.</p> \n<p><strong>Johnson said some of the allegations made against Cummings were false and that he had acted to stop the spread of the virus</strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p><em>Though there have been many other allegations about what happened when he was in self-isolation and thereafter, some of them palpably false, I believe that in every respect he has acted responsibly and legally and with integrity and with the overwhelming aim of stopping the spread of the virus and saving lives.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Again, Johnson did not specify which of the allegations he regarded as \u201cpalpably false\u201d. But when he was asked a direct question about whether Cummings had taken a trip to Barnard Castle during his stay in Durham, Johnson ignored the question, and said that what Cummings had done more generally was \u201csensible and defensible\u201d. He said Cummings had been in self isolation for \u201c14 days or more\u201d and had behaved responsibly.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/one-law-for-dominic-cummings-another-for-the-rest-of-us\">One law for Dominic Cummings, another for the rest of us | Letters</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But if Cummings did go to Barnard Castle on 12 April, as the Guardian reported, that would seem to be a very clear and obvious breach of the lockdown guidelines, whether or not his 14-day period of isolation was at an end.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Barnard Castle is close to 30 miles from the house where Cummings was staying. It is exactly the kind of day trip that ministers, in briefing after briefing, have urged millions of people not to make but to \u201cstay at home, protect the NHS, save lives\u201d.</p> \n<p><strong>Johnson said Cummings had behaved as any parent would have done, and denied it was one rule for some and another rule for others</strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p><em>Is this government asking you \u2013 the people, the public \u2013 to do one thing, while senior people here in government do something else?\u2026 I think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent.

As the Tory MP, David Warburton, tweeted shortly after the briefing: \u201cWe\u2019ve all been tasked with tempering our parental, and other, instincts by strictly adhering to govt guidance.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tim Montgomerie, creator of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ConservativeHome\" title=\"ConservativeHome\">ConservativeHome</a> website, went further. \u201cIn a pandemic the messages the government puts out have to respected. And if you have a key adviser flouting those rules and no apology, that is a terrible failure on the part of government. That is a terrible undermining of government communications. We have come to realise how reliant Boris Johnson is on Dominic Cummings as an adviser. I\u2019m afraid he has chosen to stick with him. If Johnson loses Cummings, he risks losing the whole operation he has surrounded himself with.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a tweet, the Labour MP Jess Phillips said: \u201cThe instincts of most other fathers in the country was to look after their partner and children at home.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The prospects of a trade war between China and the western economies ratcheted up on Sunday as Beijing accused the US of pushing relations towards a \u201cnew cold war\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cChina has no intention to change, still less replace the United States,\u201d China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said on Sunday in the latest escalation in tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the United States to give up its wishful thinking of changing China and stopping 1.4 billion people in their historic march toward modernisation.\u201d</p> <p>He said US political attacks on China over the coronavirus and global trade matters \u201care taking China-US relations hostage and pushing our two countries to the brink of a new cold war\u201d.</p> <p>Relations between the UK and the US have also soured as a string of Conservative politicians pressed on Sunday for tighter controls to protect struggling UK companies from Chinese takeovers, and the UK announced an emergency review of the deal to allow the Chinese telecoms firm Huawei to help run the forthcoming 5G mobile network.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre is expected to conclude that recently announced US sanctions against Huawei will make it impossible to use the Chinese company\u2019s technology as planned.</p> <p>A government spokesman said: \u201cFollowing the US announcement of additional sanctions against Huawei, the NCSC is looking carefully at any impact they could have to the UK\u2019s networks.\u201d</p> <p>Last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/22/boris-johnson-forced-to-reduce-huaweis-role-in-uks-5g-networks\">Boris Johnson was forced to give in to to Conservative backbench rebels opposed to the presence of Huawei in 5G networks</a>.

<strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> had denied the Scottish government tried to cover up coronavirus cases linked to a Nike conference in Edinburgh in late February. <br></p> \n  <p>In angry exchanges at first minister questions, Sturgeon accused the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, <strong>Jackson Carlaw</strong>, of unfairly impugning her integrity and that of health officials by suggesting this early outbreak was hushed up. <br></p> \n  <p>Investigations found that at least 25 people linked to the event contracted Covid-19, including eight in Scotland, but the incident was not made public until it was revealed in a television documentary earlier this month. <br></p> \n  <p>The first coronavirus case in Scotland was announced on 1 March and was a Tayside resident unrelated to the conference. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>But the Sunday Times says it has been reported locally that the north-east of England\u2019s \u201cpatient zero\u201d attended the conference in February and the infection was passed to a second person in Newcastle at a child\u2019s birthday party. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>The Chronicle newspaper also states that a church in Newcastle closed after a member tested positive for coronavirus, with it being \u201cunderstood the patient works for Nike in Sunderland and contracted the virus after attending a conference in Edinburgh\u201d - although this was unconfirmed at the time. <br></p> \n  <p>In a further report on Sunday, the Scottish Sun said one staff member at the Sunderland base contracted the virus after the Edinburgh conference. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>Murray, Labour\u2019s only MP in Scotland, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> The Scottish government has fresh questions to answer about its cover-up of the ground-zero coronavirus outbreak. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n   <p>Not only were people in Edinburgh kept in the dark, the decision to keep the information secret means people in north-east England were also unaware of how the virus could easily spread to their region. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n   <p>There are questions too for the UK government, which should have acted when the Scottish government failed to be transparent. </p> \n   <p>The lack of transparency from both governments is harming public confidence at a vital time for the country as we move towards the easing of lockdown measures. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-24T12:00:29.907Z\">at 1.00pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div

  "<p>Ever get the feeling you\u2019ve been cheated? Boris Johnson has previously lauded the effort and sacrifice of the British people, who for nine weeks of lockdown have endured not only inconvenience and discomfort, but hardship and in many cases real sacrifice: of desperately needed income, of the opportunity to support struggling relatives, see dying family members, or attend the funerals of loved ones. Now it emerges that the rules are optional for the prime minister\u2019s friends. The stated message was: \u201cStay at home\u201d. The unstated: \u201cDo as we say, and not as we do\u201d.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/22/dominic-cummings-durham-trip-coronavirus-lockdown\" title=\"\">breach of rules</a> by Mr Johnson\u2019s adviser Dominic Cummings, revealed by the Guardian and the Mirror, is not an abstruse Westminster affair involving complicated financial dealings, or arcane parliamentary regulations. It is a matter that everyone understands and in which everyone has a stake, because everyone has given up something they valued and many have paid dearly. People feel not just indignation, but rage.</p> <p>It is possible that Mr Cummings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/did-dominic-cummings-break-the-law-on-lockdown-rules\" title=\"\">acted legally</a>, as the prime minister has insisted. But it is certain that he did not act either responsibly or with integrity. To praise him for following \u201cthe instincts of every father\u201d is an insult to every parent who followed the rules instead. Mr Cummings built his power by exploiting the theme that unaccountable elites treat ordinary people as dispensable idiots. In deciding to drive to his parents\u2019 home in Durham, after his wife fell sick, he not only demonstrated his arrogance, but may have put others at risk during any stop on the 264-mile journey.</p> <p>Mr Johnson and his government have been every bit as reprehensible in shielding him. Cabinet ministers \u2013 including, extraordinarily, the attorney general and the health secretary \u2013 have lined up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/boris-johnson-backs-dominic-cummings-in-face-of-tory-calls-for-chief-aide-to-resign\" title=\"\">to defend not only Mr Cummings but his actions</a>. They have put saving one man\u2019s career above saving lives, by portraying the rules as nothing more than guidance to be interpreted by individuals. Why, now, should the public be expected to abide by them?</p> <p>If Downing Street truly believed that he had done nothing wrong, it would not have obfuscated about where he stayed during the lockdown, nor refused to comment when the Guardian first asked about the adviser being seen in Durham. Nor would Mr Johnson refuse to address the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/23/new-witnesses-cast-doubt-on-dominic-cummingss-lockdown-claims\" title=\"\">new claims</a> that Mr Cummings further breached lockdown rules by visiting a town 30 miles from Durham \u2013 with No 10 instead adopting the Trumpian ploy of attacking \u201ccampaigning newspapers\u201d. </p> <p>A growing number of Tory MPs have now said publicly what ministers have said privately, and what is obvious: that Mr Cummings should go. Officials usually take the fall for ministers, not vice versa. That the prime minister has abandoned his already diminished authority for an unelected figure shows that Mr Johnson feels he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/how-dominic-cummings-became-indispensable-to-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">cannot do without him</a>. The problem is not only what Mr Cummings has done, but what the prime minister does not do.</p> <p>The worst possible course would be for the government to seek to assuage anger or divert attention by announcing or floating a premature relaxation of lockdown rules. Its advice has become increasingly muddied and confusing, and the messages defending Mr Cummings have added to the risks that others will disregard it. In one regard only its position is now clearer: as long as Mr Cummings remains in place, it is saying that lockdown is for the little people. And as long as it treats the public with contempt, it can expect that contempt to be returned.</p>",

  "<p>The shadow of death still hangs over the country. The losses from the Covid-19 virus continue to mount. The end is not yet in sight. The way we live will be altered by the pandemic and its consequences for years to come. Amid the weight and seriousness of life-changing and life-ending events, how can the national conversation be dominated for three days by the bad behaviour of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/dominic-cummings-must-resign-says-tory-mp-steve-baker\">Dominic Cummings</a> during the lockdown?</p> <p>The answer is brutal but clear. It is because Cummings has so much power and has done so much to make this country what it is today, first because of Brexit, and now because of the mishandling of the pandemic. The furore over his rule-breaking cannot be dismissed as a bubble issue, especially after Boris Johnson backed him so comprehensively and divisively from the No 10 lectern today. Now, whether Cummings ultimately goes or stays, this is a choice that affects everyone and everything.</p> <p>The poison in Cummings\u2019s journey to Durham is the taint of hypocrisy it injects into the public bloodstream at precisely the time when public confidence in the handling of the crisis is already beginning to fray. One rule for him, another for us. It\u2019s an absolutely lethal tag for any government project, but it\u2019s doubly, triply so in a pandemic. The arrogance and ineptitude are staggering.</p> <p>The Johnson government\u2019s initial lockdown message, which Cummings was intimately involved in formulating and promoting, could hardly have been simpler. Stay at home, it said. That simple injunction was reinforced by exceptionally direct messaging and public advertising. Johnson, speaking to the nation on TV, called it an \u201cinstruction\u201d. The ubiquitous ads said things like: \u201cIf one person breaks the rules, we will all suffer,\u201d and: \u201cBreaking the rules is breaking the law.\u201d</p> <p>The public got the message. To the evident surprise of some of the government\u2019s advisers, they took it seriously and overwhelmingly obeyed. Every day, ministers and scientists confirmed the public\u2019s discipline about sticking to the rules. The nation\u2019s sacrifices, some of them heartbreaking, were repeatedly extolled. What aspect of that message would Cummings himself not have understood when his wife, Mary Wakefield, told him that she was suffering from Covid-19 symptoms herself?</p> <p>It is utterly clear what Cummings should have done as he considered his wife\u2019s disturbing news and the implications for himself and their four-year-old son. He should have considered his options. He should then have warned the prime minister and the cabinet secretary about potential problems. He should have consulted with them very specifically about how to act. And he should have taken their advice on whether it was appropriate to travel to self-isolate. As a political animal, and someone who would know that he could be spotted and photographed, he should have been alert. He could have proposed that a proactive press release could have been issued to cover his back.</p> <p>Whether Cummings consulted anyone in that way is not clear. Nor is their response, if there was one. Perhaps he didn\u2019t bother to ask. Perhaps, with Johnson himself sickening with Covid-19 at the same time, no one was senior enough or brave enough to stand up to Cummings and say: \u201cStay in London.\u201d If that was the case, it says a lot about the workings of this government, none of it good. We are entitled to know what happened, and who knew, because the public policy implications could be so severe for the rest of us.</p> <p>The mishandling speaks volumes about Cummings\u2019s judgment and temperament. His lack of humility when the news broke was striking. To <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/23/dominic-cummings-no-10-accused-of-covering-up-lockdown-breach\">say</a>: \u201cWho cares about good looks. It\u2019s a question of doing the right thing. It\u2019s not about what you guys think,\u201d to journalists was characteristic Cummings. As so often, a humble apology might have killed the story. But Cummings does not do humble.</p> <p>The outcome will be devastating for the government\u2019s attempts to carry people with them. Public opinion has been noticeably steady through the pandemic. Most people have proved cautious, rule-abiding, risk-averse. Even now, pressure to loosen the restrictions only comes from a minority. It was entirely predictable that the public\u2019s judgments about Cummings this weekend would be overwhelmingly negative. So it has proved. <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2020/05/23/56b74/2\">YouGov found</a> that across every region of the UK, and among leave voters and remain voters alike, the majorities are all emphatically against him. </p> <p>What happens to Cummings is important. But the real question posed by the furore goes further. Johnson\u2019s credibility over the handling of the biggest domestic crisis faced by any recent government is in the balance. That credibility is vital in the next phases of the response to the pandemic, which are scheduled to be launched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/24/poll-reveals-half-of-parents-unconvinced-that-school-is-safe-for-their-childrens-return\">this coming week </a>\u2013 a week in which parliament is in recess, a typical Cummings touch. But the implications extend to the Johnson government\u2019s authority in the post-pandemic political world, too.</p> <p>That credibility was already on the line before a word of the Cummings story broke on Friday. Johnson\u2019s fatefully botched broadcast at the start of May started the recent rot. The pressure to loosen the original restrictions came overwhelmingly from the right of the Tory party and some of the media. Johnson \u2013 and Cummings \u2013 bent to the pressure. \u201cStay at home\u201d became \u201cStay alert\u201d \u2013 though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/13/boris-johnson-prime-minister-england-coronavirus\">only in England</a> \u2013 and the handling of the pandemic instantly became much harder. New infections and deaths continued. Johnson\u2019s ratings sagged. Confidence in the government dipped. Backbenchers began to revolt again.</p> <p>The Cummings scandal has arrived at a vulnerable moment. Faced with the pandemic, the government \u2013 and indeed the country \u2013 needed a team that could rise to the demands, and grow impressively into their responsibilities. That has not happened. Few ministers have enhanced their reputations. Several have been found wanting. And Johnson\u2019s own<em><strong> </strong></em>performance since coming out of intensive care last month has been intermittent at best. Charges that he is a part-time prime minister could be laughed off when Jeremy Corbyn made them, but are more damaging now. The qualifications for membership of Johnson\u2019s cabinet \u2013 unthinking support for Brexit and unquestioning loyalty to Johnson \u2013 seem less sufficient than ever. Few have enhanced their reputations during the crisis.</p> <p>The shallowness of the talent pool goes some way to explain Johnson\u2019s determination, in defiance of so much criticism, to hold on to Cummings. The sight this weekend of elected ministers rushing to the defence of an unelected official was humiliating, not just for them but for British politics. There have often been controversial advisers in modern British politics: Alastair Campbell, Damian McBride, Steve Hilton, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, to name but a few. In the end, though, they all had to go. Cummings\u2019s crisis moment marks an extraordinary inversion.</p> <p>The sight of Tory MPs beginning to turn against Cummings, and thus to some degree, against Johnson, is a sure sign that a political project is foundering. The ultimate irony is that Cummings, who came to power at the head of a populist, anti-elite uprising over Brexit, has now been shamed by an act of supreme elitism and disdain for ordinary people. When it came to the crunch the great despiser forgot that the moral law applies not just to all the rest of us \u2013 but to him as well.</p> <p>Bad behaviour and rule-breaking have got Johnson a long way in life. This evening\u2019s free pass to Cummings suggests there is to be no going back, no learning from mistakes, no attempt to grow wiser with new responsibilities. It is a reckless endorsement of an overmighty adviser, a snub to elected politicians on both sides of the Commons, a declaration of war against much of the press, a defiance of the institutional balances within Britain\u2019s system of democratic government and a self-centred, self-indulgent signal to the public that the rules no longer really matter.</p> <p>\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>Twenty years ago, Mary Pierce was being dragged across the court. As she chased Monica Seles\u2019s blows from side-to-side during their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlJQDgt3xY\" title=\"\">2000 French Open quarter-final match</a>, one vicious drive volley flew straight towards her. Pierce instinctively leaped into the air and connected with the ball between her legs, which lobbed high over Seles\u2019s head and landed perfectly inside the court. The shot has been replayed millions of times.</p> <p>For most players, Pierce\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAZaHJsPIVI#=1m01s\" title=\"\">famous tweener</a> would have been a great omen of things to come. But tennis fans had spent a decade as attuned to Pierce\u2019s demeanour as the actual strokes. The question was always, after all she had been through, if she was relaxed and loose enough to ever fly. As the crowd roa red, the answer came: Pierce sprinted the width of the court in glee and a smile glossed her face. A few days later she had beaten the world No 3, Seles, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/story/0,3604,330007,00.html\" title=\"\">No 1, Martina Hingis</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cWOhaB_8Fg\" title=\"\">Conchita Mart\u00ednez, the No 5, </a>and become the first French singles champion at Roland Garros since 1983.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/22/naomi-osaka-serena-williams-forbes-richest-list\">Naomi Osaka tops Serena Williams as world's highest-earning female athlete</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even today, after the rise of power, weight training and greater racket technology in the women\u2019s game, few players have ever struck a ball like Mary Pierce.

At the 1994 French Open, Steffi Graf watched in horror as she was hit clean off the court, 6-2, 6-2, in the semi-final. \u201cThere was very little I could do,\u201d Graf said. In March 2000, it was Serena Williams\u2019s turn to be obliterated. Williams lost 6-2, 6-1 and her conclusion was almost identical: \u201cEverything she hit was either on the line or a winner. So, I mean, what can you do?\u201d</p> <p>Pierce\u2019s father, Jim, realised his daughter\u2019s potential after witnessing a few of her first strikes of a ball.

Jim Pierce built his reputation with swiftness. He trash-talked opponents, he fought with their parents and then loudly berated his daughter in public. He also loved to brag about it.

  "<p>The criminal justice system in England and Wales is facing a backlog of 40,000 criminal cases, which will not be solved even if all crown courts are brought into service under physical distancing rules, the Criminal Bar Association has warned.</p> <p>The scale of the challenge to the justice system posed by the coronavirus pandemic is becoming apparent, as virtual hearings transform business in the higher civil courts but trigger alarms about the fairness of remote proceedings in the family and lower courts.</p> <p>Reliance on video technology is accelerating the government\u2019s pre-existing \u00a31bn court modernisation programme but also throwing up questions about where it is appropriate: many unrepresented claimants do not have super-fast broadband or are among those categorised as \u201cdigitally excluded\u201d.</p> <p>Even before the pandemic, some criminal cases were being listed more than a year ahead due to austerity cuts in the number of allocated judges\u2019 sitting days. With jury trials suspended, the backlog grew at 1,000 cases a month.</p> <p>The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, is considering whether to rent commercial premises \u2013 dubbed \u201cNightingale courts\u201d - with space to spread out jurors, lawyers and court staff.</p> <p>Caroline Goodwin QC, the chair of the Criminal Bar Association, said: \u201cThe restrictions imposed mean the courts cannot keep pace with that backlog, no matter how innovative the thinking is. </p> <p>\u201cSocial distancing measures currently required mean that even if we opened up all of the available crown courts, we would still at best only have half of all court rooms in use for hearings. A single trial presently requires three courtrooms. One for the judge, jury, witnesses, counsel and defendant, a second court for the public and the third for the jury \u2026</p> <p>\u201cWith deployment of even three-quarters of all courts for actual hearings, [it] would only take us back, at worst, to where we were at the start of the year with the backlog growing by up to 1,000 cases a month, and at best to simply maintaining the current, higher, backlog.\u201d</p> <p>In December, the crown court backlog was 37,500 cases. Goodwin added: \u201cThe lord chief justice this month estimated it was now around 40,000. Only when social distancing comes down from 2 metres to 1 metre can all the available courts be used for hearings.</p> <p>\u201cOnce we have the existing crown court estate open and functioning to the maximum and operating within safe social distancing parameters, then HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS) may want to consider using other court buildings or other buildings, not presently part of the court estate.\u201d</p> <p>Labour\u2019s shadow justice secretary, David Lammy, told the Guardian: \u201cUnless we can really up the pace of bringing particularly criminal and some civil law matters, where vulnerable people need to be heard, we are heading for a very serious backlog which this generation of lawyers has never seen.</p> <p>\u201cI have been urging [the Ministry of Justice] to co-opt buildings ... It seems clear that universities will not be returning before the late autumn. Why are we not co-opting those huge buildings to be temporary courts? There\u2019s a lack of urgency from the government.\u201d</p> <p>The Conservative former justice minister, Lord Faulks, warned that \u201cjustice delayed is justice denied\u201d. He raised the prospect of trial by judge rather than jury in some cases.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s already a big backlog because the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) decided to restrict the number of sittings days,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cI personally wonder whether we are not a bit too wedded to the concept of trial by jury \u2026 For a long time there\u2019s been a view that fraud trials are really unsuitable for trial by jury. There are different ways you could do it; you could have a judge with a couple of magistrates.</p> <p>\u201cPeople may say it\u2019s terrible, but if judges [deliver a verdict] they have to give reasons and therefore those reasons are apparent. It makes the process of making an appeal much clearer. You can see what\u2019s under the bonnet.\u201d</p> <p>There are attempts to reduce caseload pressure. Deputy chief constable Sara Glen, of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, has suggested forces consider whether more cases should receive a caution.</p> <p>The director of public prosecutions, Max Hill QC, on Thursday denied there has been \u201cdecriminalisation\u201d of offences but said cases were being delayed during the crisis. However, he supported calls for forces to consider whether lesser offences which are charged by the police might be dealt with by cautions rather than court appearances.</p> <p>The lord chief justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon, told MPs on Friday: \u201cWe have been able to keep a lot of working going that I know in other jurisdictions [abroad] have come to a halt ... The volume of remote hearings has resulted in us taking three steps forward.</p> <p>\u201cI suspect [after the crisis] we will take a step back.\u201d He also warned that the administration of justice had been \u201cunderfunded for years and years and the consequences are coming home to roost ...\u201d</p> <p>A HMCTS spokesperson said: \u201cA huge amount of work has gone into increasing the use of video and audio technology to keep courts running during this unprecedented crisis. Measures to increase hearings and help reduce the number of outstanding cases are being considered and these will be set out in due course.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 May 2020 to add a statement from HM Courts and Tribunal Service that was absent from an earlier version due to an editing error.</p>",
  "<p>The coronavirus pandemic has already led to significant changes to justice, some of the impacts of which are set to be long-lasting or permanent:</p> <h2>Jury trials</h2> <p>Four new crown court juries were sworn in on Monday at the Old Bailey, in Bristol, Manchester and Cardiff. The next three criminal trials are due to be in Winchester, Reading and Warwick, followed, it is expected, by Derby and Nottingham.</p> <p>Jurors, committed to fulfilling their civic duty, turned up. Spread out for social distancing, with staff and lawyers in adjoining courtrooms connected by video, the hearings have reassured participants.</p> <p>Alternatives to jury trials are being discussed. The Lord Chief Justice has suggested reducing the minimum number of jurors, currently nine, to seven. He has also discussed having a judge sit with two lay magistrates.</p> <p>Geoffrey Robertson QC has proposed adopting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/apr/26/non-jury-trials-could-help-clear-coronavirus-backlog-says-geoffrey-robertson-qc\">the system in some Australian states </a>where a defendant can opt for a judge-only trial. There is no appetite for remote jury trials where jurors would participate from home.</p> <h2>Virtual justice</h2> <p>In the main high court and court of appeal, civil hearings have switched to Zoom and online platforms where court cases involve few, if any, witnesses and are mainly legal arguments. Journalists are given remote access. Most agree it is laborious but workable.</p> <p>The problems are in the family, county and magistrates courts, where courtrooms are more cramped, claimants or defendants often unrepresented, and remote working is disliked by the public.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/announcements/president-of-the-family-division-welcomes-nuffield-report-into-effectiveness-of-remote-hearings-during-covid-19/\">survey by the </a><a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/announcements/president-of-the-family-division-welcomes-nuffield-report-into-effectiveness-of-remote-hearings-during-covid-19/\">Nuffield Family Justice Observatory</a> on behalf of Sir Andrew McFarlane, president of the family division of the high court, this month said many lawyers and judges found it \u201cextremely difficult to conduct hearings with the level of empathy and humanity\u201d required.</p> <p>\u201cParticular concerns were raised \u2026 about urgent applications for interim care orders in relation to newborn babies, with new mothers having to join hearings from hospital, with accompanying difficulties in connectivity and in ensuring any privacy while the hearing was taking place.\u201d</p> <p>A mechanism is needed for deciding which cases can be heard remotely and which cannot. Sir Andrew has sensibly left the decision to individual judges.</p> <h2>Open justice?</h2> <p>There is a difference between the judiciary and the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) over how transparent virtual justice can be. Should all courts where the public normally enter also be accessible online?</p> <p>The MoJ says that during the crisis everyone ought to be able to see online hearings. Judges fear that those granted access might record proceedings illegally or disrupt proceedings remotely. Allowing journalists, who are schooled in court reporting restrictions, to watch fulfils, it is said, the requirement for public scrutiny.</p> <p>Lammy is not convinced: \u201cJustice has got to be open. It\u2019s a fundamental part of our democracy. It has to be visible. Any member of the public in ordinary times can walk into a case at the Old Bailey. That principle must be extended into the virtual world.\u201d The Lord Chief Justice said on Friday: \u201cMembers of the public can ask to join.\u201d</p> <h2>Lawyers facing bankruptcy</h2> <p>Law centres have been given emergency funds by the MoJ, but professional legal bodies fear many barristers and solicitors will go bankrupt unless further financial help is provided or cases restarted. Rosaleen Kilbaneof the Community Law Partnership in Birmingham, which specialises in legal aid housing cases, said: \u201cOur costs are fixed. We can only last a few months. A lot of our clients don\u2019t have the internet at home.\u201d</p> <h2>Prisons</h2> <p>As of last week, only 55 prisoners had been released early under emergency measures to alleviate the Covid-19 crisis in jails in England and Wales; up to 4,000 prisoners were eligible.</p> <p>Will a newfound enthusiasm for technology among legal reformers encourage development of non-custodial alternatives to prison? Judges have been calling for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/nov/22/top-judge-calls-for-tough-community-service-as-alternative-to-prison-lord-chief-justice\">more effective community punishments</a>. New <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/19/alcohol-fuelled-offenders-may-have-to-wear-sobriety-tags\">sobriety tags</a> could help offenders reform outside jail.</p> <h2>Farewell, glitzy new offices</h2> <p>The vast, prestige City law offices and gleaming modern commercial courts may become long-term victims of coronavirus. Heavily lawyered virtual hearings function reasonably well in the high court with participants working from home. Lammy has suggested repurposing newly deserted business courts as urgently-needed crown courts.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 May 2020 to remove a statement from HM Courts and Tribunal Service that was added in error.</p>",
  "<p>Network Rail has urged potential passengers who do not need to travel to work or for emergencies to avoid taking trains during the bank holiday.</p> <p>The already drastically reduced national train service is undergoing a major overhaul over the long weekend with 490 upgrading projects taking place, it said.</p> <p>Line closures and disruptions include maintenance work on switches and rail crossings between London Victoria and Herne Hill/Peckham Rye. As a result, no Southern or Thameslink trains will be running into Victoria over the bank holiday weekend, Network Rail said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the company said services between Manchester airport and Liverpool Lime Street to Preston will be affected due to renewal work of the rail track near Carlisle.</p> <p>Other routes affected by this weekend\u2019s national rail upgrade projects include Leeds to Wakefield, where there will no direct service on Sunday or Monday.</p> <p>Andrew Haines, the Network Rail chief executive, urged travellers to plan their bank holiday journeys ahead.</p> <p>\u201cWhile Britain tackles the coronavirus and social distancing is in place, the railway can carry a fraction of the usual number of passengers. So, to make sure there is space for critical workers, please avoid travelling by train unless absolutely necessary.</p> <p>\u201cThis bank holiday, to make sure our railway is at its very best when we emerge from this pandemic, we are continuing to work and invest in the rail network to make it more reliable for passengers. That means some journeys may be different, so if you have to travel please check your journey before leaving home,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The head of tourism on Brighton and Hove council has also urged those living beyond the seaside resort to avoid the city on bank holiday Monday.</p> <p>Councillor Carmen Appich said stewards would be used to direct people to less busy parts of the seafront if the area becomes too busy on Monday.</p> <p>The city council also pointed out that its seasonal lifeguard service will not be operating on Monday.</p> <p>Covid-19 social distancing restrictions interrupted the council\u2019s usual recruitment drive for lifeguards and as a result will start later in the summer. The lifeguards normally patrol Brighton and Hove\u2019s beaches from the end of May until the end of the school holidays in September.</p> <p>Brighton will be one of the hottest places across the UK on the bank holiday with temperatures expected to reach more than 20C on the south coast.</p> <p>Most of the country should enjoy a fine day with spells of warm sunshine according to the BBC Weather Centre. However, in north-west Scotland there will be south-westerly winds bringing in cloud and rain later in the day.</p> <p>The chances of a heavier volume of cross-border traffic bank holiday from Northern Ireland into the Irish Republic, meanwhile, may have increased after the partial easing of restrictions on pubs in the south.</p> <p>According to reports in Dublin, pubs in the Republic can now deliver drinks and sell takeaway alcohol at their premises.</p> <p>The partial easing of the clampdown on Irish bars came about after the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na took legal advice on what pubs can and cannot sell during the lockdown.</p> <p>As long as drinks including poured pints are paid for on licensed premises they can be delivered to customers. However, takeaways from the bars can only be permitted if they are consumed more than 100 metres away from the pub and not drunk in any public place.</p> <p>Some bars in border areas have been running takeaway services, such as O\u2019Flahery\u2019s pub in Buncrana, which is a short drive from Derry in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Until last week, O\u2019Flaherty\u2019s was operating a \u201cGuinness Express\u201d with poured pints of stout being delivered wrapped in cling film. Gardai visited the bar last week but its owner claimed the police offices were unable to tell him which law he had broken by delivering pints.</p> <p>The new legal advice to the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na means O\u2019Flaherty\u2019s and all other southern Irish pubs can deliver drink including pulled pints if they are paid for in advance at the bar.</p>",

  "<p>A week before lockdown was imposed in March, Dane Whitehurst and his wife put the finishing touches to a room at their home in Kent that they hoped would be a chillout space for them and their three-year-old daughter.

I think the way we have been working has created the environment where that can happen.\u201d</p> <p>Whitehurst has now applied to patent the \u201cmagic wallet\u201d, part of what some intellectual property lawyers have reported is a <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/03/rush-patent-applications-bored-britons-lockdown-come-new-inventions/\">rush of new applications</a> since the lockdown period began. \u201cWe\u2019ve certainly seen a lot of people coming to us with Covid-related innovation that they want to protect,\u201d says Mark Richardson, a partner and patent attorney at Keltie LLP, the law firm working with Burgopak. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people looking at decontamination systems, PPE, there has certainly been an uptick in that area.\u201d</p> <p>Christopher Hamer, a partner at intellectual property specialists Mathys and Squire, agrees: \u201cIn terms of the volume of new work [since the crisis began], it was a striking amount, and I know other firms have seen this as well.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of it has been people coming and saying, \u2018we have talked about this in the past and I would like to progress it.\u2019 They are looking at their long-term future and trying to understand where they are going to be when things go back to normal.\u201d</p> <p>Although precise figures will not be available until next year, according to a spokeswoman for the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/intellectual-property-office\">Intellectual Property Office</a> where British applications are filed, \u201cearly indicators suggest that input this year is up on the January to April period last year\u201d.</p> <p>While some of the new applications directly address virus-related problems, others may have arisen from their creators processing a backlog of admin. By contrast, in some sectors such as pharmaceuticals, notes Tim Belcher, managing associate at law firm EIP, innovation has slowed due to laboratories having closed.</p> <p>But with the option of patenting ruled out the instant an idea has been discussed with anyone, Belcher says, the impetus to protect a good idea, even under lockdown, is clear. \u201cThey need to come to us before they have spoken to possible manufacturers, before they have discussed it with their friend on a Zoom call.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6978f1ea8c89e61c5f89fdf8db217c67f6d29059\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6978f1ea8c89e61c5f89fdf8db217c67f6d29059/0_19_5348_3209/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Atif Syed\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Atif Syed: \u2018Whenever situations like this happen, there will always be new applications [for the product]\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another innovator who has done that is Atif Syed, CEO and founder of a firm called <a href=\"https://www.wootzano.com/\">Wootzano</a>.

  "<p>The lockdown is a good opportunity to learn to repair some commonly broken items. Not only do many of us have more time on our hands than usual, but shops are closed so we can\u2019t easily replace items, and many expert restorers are shut, too. Prolonged proximity to your belongings, and a keener eye on your finances, may have given you a newfound appreciation for your stuff and the planet\u2019s resources. These days you can find a wealth of fix-it tutorials online, but here\u2019s where to start.</p> <h2><strong>Fix a wonky table</strong></h2> <p>Remove that bit of folded cardboard wedged under one leg. You may have a few things around the house that can stop a table wobbling so much, says Jay Blades, the antique furniture restorer and the presenter of the BBC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/26/the-repair-shop-we-can-fix-anything-but-a-broken-heart-and-brexit\">The Repair Shop</a>. One fix might be a few layers of felt \u201cthe same colour as the table. You could put that underneath to make it the correct height. Or you might have a cork coaster in your house \u2013 cut a bit to size and stick it underneath the bottom.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Do up your doors</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"994e70c1b4a9e4247bf4de192f1da6d1694ba99d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/994e70c1b4a9e4247bf4de192f1da6d1694ba99d/0_1218_4912_6142/800.jpg\" alt=\"A squeaking door can be easily fixed ...\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A squeaking door can be easily fixed ...</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Knowles/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A squeaky door can be easily fixed with a bit of cooking oil, if you don\u2019t have a lubricant such as WD40, says Blades. \u201cPut it on your finger and work it into the hinge where it\u2019s making the noise,\u201d he says.</p> <p>A door coming off its hinges needs to be screwed in again. \u201cIf the hole has become too big, push some matchsticks into the hole,\u201d says Blades. \u201cThe ones that are sticking out, either break them off or use a little saw to make them flush. Then you can put the screw back in, and it will be tight. The matchsticks will act as a rawlplug. When I\u2019m doing furniture, for little holes I put one in, but you might need four or five.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Repair broken plates, mugs and vases</strong></h2> <p>Cats \u201cseem to be the number one culprits\u201d when it comes to smashed pottery, says the ceramics conservator Kirsten Ramsay, who also appears on The Repair Shop. She advises against using items for their original purpose once repaired \u2013 a stuck-on handle may fail, which is not what you want when holding a mug of hot tea, and glued-together plates may leach chemicals into food, and will discolour. But they can be repurposed. A repaired vase can be used again, but with a cut-down plastic bottle or large yoghurt pot as a liner. And decorative items can be saved.</p> <p>\u201cCollect as much of it as you possibly can \u2013 I really mean every single tiny piece,\u201d says Ramsay. \u201cYou need to identify what the material is. The two main materials are either porcelain, which is harder and glassier and has a translucency to it, and earthenware, which has a more open, crumbly texture and usually a glazed surface.\u201d</p> <p>Before sticking it, she says, \u201cdo a visual inspection and try and see how it goes together. Sometimes things slot together really nicely.\u201d If they don\u2019t, she thinks it\u2019s probably best to leave it to a professional (if it\u2019s a valuable or sentimental item).</p> <p>\u201cWork out what order the pieces go in so you don\u2019t lock out a piece.\u201d Ramsay uses acetone to clean and degrease the edges of the broken pieces. You can buy acetone online and in some chemists, but it can be dangerous (it\u2019s flammable, an irritant and its fumes shouldn\u2019t be inhaled) so it might be wise to skip this step. \u201cIf it\u2019s a new break then it should already be clean and grease-free, so just use a soft, clean brush along the break edges to remove dust particles.\u201d</p> <p>Don\u2019t use a generic superglue: \u201cIf you stick it in the wrong place, it can be difficult to get it apart and re-stick it.\u201d Ramsay uses conservation-grade adhesives, which can be expensive and tricky for the average person to get hold of. For porcelain, an epoxy resin is suitable (a good hardware shop should be able to advise). She recommends HMG, a cellulose nitrate adhesive, for earthenware. Put a small amount of adhesive along one edge, put it in place, wipe off the excess and hold it together with small bits of clear tape.</p> <h2><strong>Attend to sad seating</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"336a0d9eaafca82bfea385cd335fb213c83a25ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/336a0d9eaafca82bfea385cd335fb213c83a25ae/84_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jay Blades inside The Repair Shop.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jay Blades inside The Repair Shop.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A ripped seat pad on a dining chair can be easily replaced, says Blades, who specialises in upcycling projects. \u201cYou could re-cover it with a tea towel \u2013 that looks quite pretty \u2013 or an old duvet cover. Cut out a square, put it over the old cover and staple it underneath. If you don\u2019t have a staple gun, use a hammer and tacks.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Fix your inkjet printer</strong></h2> <p>\u201cSo much of repair,\u201d says Janet Gunter, the outreach lead at the Restart Project, which teaches people how to repair electronics \u201cis actually just cleaning, but cleaning in a very conscientious way.\u201d This is especially true of inkjet printers. Even though she is not a fan of them \u2013 \u201cthey can be super-annoying\u201d \u2013 don\u2019t give up on one. Make sure the software is up to date. They need to be used every two weeks says Gunter, \u201cand most people don\u2019t know that. The print heads get clogged if they\u2019re not used.\u201d</p> <p>She says you should print a few lines in black, and print colours, every couple of weeks to maintain it. \u201cIf the heads do get clogged, you\u2019ve got a pretty big job to clean them, but it is possible.\u201d Look online for tutorials. \u201cWe also see a lot of printers where there\u2019s debris inside, or the rollers are dirty or something is jammed. You\u2019ll need to partially disassemble it to clean it properly. It would help to have a torch or headlight. With disassembly, make sure you\u2019re documenting as you go so you can put the thing back together again.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>And resurrect an old laptop</strong></h2> <p>Many people are fishing out old laptops from cupboards now that working (and learning) from home has become commonplace, says Gunter. Older laptops have an advantage over modern, skinny ones in that they can be relatively easy upgraded. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re broken, it\u2019s a perceived obsolescence,\u201d says Gunter. \u201cWith older laptops, the hard disk drives are going to slow down the machine.\u201d</p> <p>Replacing on of these with a solid state drive (SSD) is easier than you think, she says. \u201cYou can get them for about \u00a320 or \u00a330 and you can breathe new life into that old laptop. Many of the companies that sell them provide help in making sure you get the right one.\u201d</p> <p>You will need a very small screwdriver, \u201cbut you can get those shipped really easily with the replacement parts.\u201d If you don\u2019t need to get data off your old hard disk, it\u2019s a fairly straightforward job, says Gunter (and there is lots of help online). \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of unscrewing the body, fitting the new drive in and then installing an operating system.\u201d</p> <p>You may also be able to upgrade the memory by ordering extra Ram. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit fiddly, but it\u2019s not that difficult \u2013 people do it all the time at our events, and there are loads of YouTube videos online. Those two things together will breathe new life into almost any old machine. It feels like you\u2019re saving something from the shredder \u2013 it\u2019s really rewarding.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Restore a wooden worktop or table</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfdc8eb0b8e75a6e2b758285fda36b52e579fdbb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfdc8eb0b8e75a6e2b758285fda36b52e579fdbb/0_67_5000_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018You\u2019ll need a lot of elbow grease\u2019 ... how to spruce up an old table top.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You\u2019ll need a lot of elbow grease\u2019 ... how to spruce up an old table top.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EyeEm/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You need sandpaper, says Blades, \u201cand a lot of elbow grease. Sanding will get rid of knife marks and stains, but you\u2019ll have to do a lot of it. Start with coarse sandpaper and work your way up to a finer one. Do enough until it looks even throughout, then reapply wax or oil.\u201d He recommends using a hard wax, \u201cone that\u2019s safe for kitchens. It\u2019s very easy then to buff it up afterwards.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Sort out stains</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2b502538639b222435c5445c7fde697bf881914\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2b502538639b222435c5445c7fde697bf881914/0_0_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Don\u2019t drench the carpet in soap because it\u2019s hell to get out\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Don\u2019t drench the carpet in soap because it\u2019s hell to get out\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andriy Popov/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lots of marks on carpets and upholstery can be removed with warm water, says the TV cleaning expert Aggie MacKenzie, who runs <a href=\"https://aggiestips.com/\">AggiesTips.com</a>. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t work, try a carpet cleaner or even just a squirt of washing-up liquid, but very dilute in warm water,\u201d she says. Swish your hand around in the water until you get the foam at the top, \u201cand then use that foam to clean the carpet. Don\u2019t drench the carpet in soap because it\u2019s hell to get out, and it\u2019s just boring.\u201d Work from the outside of the stain in, \u201cso you\u2019re not spreading the stain. Don\u2019t rub too hard because you might damage the pile and it might look too different from the rest of the carpet.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Remove marks from walls</strong></h2> <p>Scuff marks can gather near the front door, or on the walls by the stairs. \u201cTeenagers always seem to stand next to a wall and stick one foot up on the wall,\u201d says MacKenzie. \u201cIt\u2019s really weird and very annoying.\u201d She recommends a \u201cmagic eraser\u201d, made by several brands. \u201cYou wet the sponge, squeeze it out and gently take it over the marks. It\u2019s very abrasive, so you have to be gentle, but it\u2019s brilliant at removing those stains from walls, and also from lino on floors.\u201d Weirdly, she adds, a bit of stale bread may also work.</p> <p>For a grease mark on walls, \u201cplace clean kitchen paper over the stain and press with a warm dry iron to draw out the oil. If any remains, dust the area with talc or cornflour and brush off with a soft brush.\u201d To remove hardened Blu Tack without taking the wallpaper or paint with it, \u201chold a plastic bottle filled with warm water over the area \u2013 it will become soft again. Now use a fresh piece of Blu Tack against the old, dabbing gently.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A UK government claim that insurmountable legal obligations to China prevent ministers offering a right of abode to tens of thousands of Hong Kong citizens has been blown apart by new legal advice handed to Conservative MPs.</p> <p>The advice by one of the UK\u2019s most prominent immigration QCs is likely to shift the mood on the Tory benches in the face of a potential clampdown on Hong Kong by the Chinese government.</p> <p>The advice says ministers are wrong to suggest they are bound by agreements with China to refuse a right of abode to the tens of thousands of Hong Kong citizens who hold a British national (overseas), or BN(O), passport.</p> <p>Home Office ministers have been resisting a claim to a legal right of abode on the basis it might be in breach of the understandings the UK government reached with China alongside the 1984 joint declaration on the future of Hong Kong.</p> <p>The issue has suddenly regained importance after the Chinese government said it intended to impose sweeping new security laws on Hong Kong that risk its semi-autonomous status.</p> <p>The offer of a right of abode to BN(O) passport-holders is seen as one of the few practical steps that may be in the sole gift of the UK, the former colonial power of the city, to alleviate the plight of citizens fearing persecution by the Chinese state.</p> <p>A group of Tory MPs, led by Bob Seely and Imran Ahmad Khan, have seen the new legal advice and want at least a clear government statement that no legal obstacle exists to an offer of a right of abode, and any refusal to make that offer is purely a political or diplomatic choice.</p> <p>BN(O) passport-holders have the right to visit for up to six months, but cannot automatically work in the UK or gain citizenship. Seely said: \u201cIt would be a stain on our country\u2019s reputation if other nations were to open their arms, metaphorically speaking, to Hong Kong BN(O) folk in their hour of need before the UK did so.\u201d</p> <p>Ministers have frequently said, most recently last year, that an offer of right of abode would be in breach of the commitments made by the British and Chinese governments in memorandums attached to the 1984 Sino-British joint declaration on the future of Hong Kong. Those memorandums established BN(O) in Hong Kong as a new class of British citizens that could only be claimed by those born before the handover.</p> <p>But in a new opinion, Laurie Fransman, the leading QC on nationality law, writes: \u201cDomestic British nationality law has evolved since the 1984 declaration including by giving greater extension of the right of abode to \u2018British nationals\u2019, including BN(O)s, in compliance with the expectations of international law.\u201d</p> <p>British citizens, including some BN(O)s, were given a right to register, he points out, adding: \u201cManifestly, the UK government did not consider itself barred by the memoranda, or anything else, from taking such action.\u201d He says he endorses those who claim BN(O)s can be given a right of abode.</p> <p>In making their legal case, ministers also frequently cite a report on citizenship written for the then Labour government by the former attorney general Lord Goldsmith in 2008.</p> <p>Goldsmith has himself written to the home secretary, Priti Patel, to ask the government to stop using him in aid of their argument. In his letter he insists he had not in 2008 himself passed any judgment on whether a right of abode from BN(O)s would be in breach of the joint declaration, adding his position had been mischaracterised by the government.</p> <p>He wrote that his report had merely cited, but not endorsed, the contemporary view of the Foreign Office that it may be in breach. His own subsequent independent examination of this issue, he said in his letter sent in February, found that the joint declaration was no obstacle.</p> <p>Goldsmith pointed out, in a view endorsed by Fransman, that the status of the BN(O)s is not mentioned in the joint declaration but in a memorandum of understanding sent by the British government on the same day. The memorandum was received by the Chinese government, but never signed or agreed.</p> <p>The memorandum excludes a right of abode, Goldsmith concedes, but he claims it did not bind the future domestic actions of the UK government in perpetuity.</p> <p>Armed with the new legal arguments, Seely and Ahmad Khan have now written to Patel, saying : \u201cGiven the deteriorating situation in Hong Kong, with the continued erosion of the rule of law, it strikes us that the government could consider reviewing its position on BN(O) passports.</p> <p>\u201cBN(O) passports were always a compromise, dependent in part on the rights guaranteed in the handover settlement. The introduction of the national security legislation means that that settlement is essentially dead. As such there are clear legal and practical grounds for looking again at this matter.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In Downing Street on Brexit night, 31 January this year, while Boris Johnson sounded a gong and quaffed Chateau Margaux, Dominic Cummings reportedly wept.</p> <p>For Johnson, getting Brexit done was part and parcel of achieving his long-held ambition to be prime minister (the next best thing to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/21/boris-johnson-route-to-number-10\">\u201cworld king\u201d</a>, as the young Johnson once put it).</p> <p>But for Cummings, breaching the union with the EU 27 fulfilled a long-held conviction \u2013 and, he hoped, opened up a once-in-a-generation opportunity of radical political reform.</p> <p>The two men are very different. Johnson courts approval; Cummings disdains it. Yet the prime minister, 55, has come to rely heavily on the 48-year-old Cummings, whom he first witnessed on the political frontline during the EU referendum campaign.</p> <p>Indeed, there could be no stronger indication of Johnson\u2019s fealty to his adviser than the fact he chose to throw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/23/cummings-and-cabinet-cheerleaders-feel-heat-from-social-media-fury\">a protective ring of cabinet ministers around him</a> this weekend rather than demand his resignation.</p> <p>For much of the tight-knit team around Johnson, that referendum summer of 2016 was the defining moment of their lives \u2013 a David and Goliath struggle in which they pitched themselves against the might of a lavishly-funded remain campaign.</p> <p>As Paul Stephenson, Vote Leave\u2019s director of communications, who was present at the Downing Street party, tweeted the next day: \u201cTotal outsiders in a shell of an office took on the entire establishment and won \u2026 and now the gang are making history.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/P_R_Stephenson/status/1223533906856681478\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Total outsiders in a shell of an office took on the entire establishment and won.. and now the gang are making history.

But with no majority and a deeply divided party, he also knew he would need to fight a general election in short order \u2013 and Cummings is the consummate campaigner.</p> <p>For Cummings, the call to Johnson\u2019s side in Downing Street last July was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Not just to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, the ringing election slogan that party legend says was first uttered by a participant in one of his beloved focus groups, but to pursue his other intellectual preoccupation \u2013 reshaping the British state.</p> <p>So total was Cummings\u2019 commitment that he postponed elective surgery in order to take the job.</p> <p>The 2019 election manifesto was peppered with his obsessions, from ensuring government made better use of data science to rebalancing the economy away from London and shaking up \u201cthe broader aspects of our constitution\u201d after Brexit.</p> <p>Other aspects of the programme, including ditching austerity, reflected long-held preoccupations of the prime minister. But it is unclear even to close colleagues what a Johnson prospectus, shorn of Cummings\u2019 influence, would have looked like.</p> <p>So perhaps it is not surprising that, despite musing at last year\u2019s Tory conference that he might not return after the general election campaign, Cummings was back at No 10 in January, seeking applications from \u201cweirdos and misfits with odd skills\u201d to work with him in remaking Whitehall.</p> <p>With a comfortable majority, there was an opportunity to pursue some of his preoccupations \u2013 including boosting state investment in science and shaking up government departments.</p> <p>Johnson has not always gone along with Cummings\u2019 wilder schemes: many of the most radical plans for overhauling Whitehall were ditched in place of modest tweaks, for example.</p> <p>But Cummings is ever-present, and his ability to slice through the complexities of day-by-day challenges is highly prized by Johnson, who is not known for his attention to detail.</p> <p>And just as for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/10/nick-timothy-and-fiona-hill-unelected-advisers-who-acted-more-like-dpms\">Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy</a>, who served May before being ousted after the 2017 election, and indeed for Corbyn\u2019s chief aide, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/19/seumas-milne-quits-guardian-for-permanent-labour-position\">Seumas Milne</a>, too, the boss\u2019s confidence brings with it immense power.</p> <p>One former cabinet minister described Cummings\u2019 attention sweeping across their department like the Eye of Sauron, in The Lord of the Rings.</p> <p>When Boris Johnson carried out a ruthless reshuffle three months ago, it was an open secret that Sajid Javid, the chancellor, resigned more because he had fallen out with Cummings than over any beef with the prime minister.</p> <p>Javid was told he must sack his aides and instead employ a team hand-picked by Johnson (for which, read Cummings). Instead, he chose to resign. It was such an open secret, in fact, that he subsequently joked in his resignation speech about \u201cCummings and goings\u201d at the heart of government.</p> <p>More recently, it was Cummings who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/revealed-dominic-cummings-on-secret-scientific-advisory-group-for-covid-19\">sat on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage)</a> as the prime minister\u2019s eyes and ears (and sometimes, it appears, mouthpiece).</p> <p>And insiders say it was Cummings, above all, who persuaded the laissez-faire, anti-nanny state prime minister to go for an all-out lockdown \u2013 not least because his focus groups were telling him the public wanted clear instructions. That now looks ironic, to say the least.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 May 2020. An earlier version said Boris Johnson had \u201cresigned\u201d as mayor of London.</p>",
  "<p>On 23 March, the prime minister <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-address-to-the-nation-on-coronavirus-23-march-2020\">announced a nationwide lockdown</a> to slow the spread of coronavirus. \u201cI must give the British people a very simple instruction \u2013 you must stay at home,\u201d said Boris Johnson. Dominic Cummings certainly ignored that diktat, along with government guidance not to travel anywhere else to self-isolate. But did he break the law?</p> <p>On 26 March, <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8875/\">regulations</a> were introduced in England that made it an offence to leave home without a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d and to gather in groups of more than two. <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/350/contents\">The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020</a> gave police powers to forcibly return those who refused to comply with the lockdown to their homes and issue fines to dissenters.</p> <p>We know Cummings went to Durham <em>after</em> the regulations came into force. He was seen running away from Downing Street on 27 March and was definitely in Durham by 31 March, when officers from the local police force spoke to his father.</p> <p>Downing Street has not contradicted a witness <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/23/new-witnesses-cast-doubt-on-dominic-cummingss-lockdown-claims\">who told the Guardian</a> they also saw Cummings in Barnard Castle, 30 miles from Durham, on 12 April.</p> <p>Whether he contravened the regulations depends on the definition of \u201creasonable excuse\u201d. The regulations do not define the term but they do provide non-exhaustive lists of reasonable excuses to be outside, such as shopping for necessities, doing exercise and travelling to and from work.</p> <p>Even when Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-in-the-house-of-commons-11-may-2020\">announced a slight relaxation of lockdown</a> in England on 11 May \u2013 when he said \u201cyou can drive as far as you like to reach an outdoor space\u201d \u2013 that was specifically only for the purpose of exercise.</p> <p>Asked by reporters on Saturday for her reading of \u201creasonable excuse\u201d, the deputy chief medical officer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/23/grant-shapps-defends-dominic-cummings-over-lockdown-breach\">Jenny Harries</a>, suggested \u201cextreme risk to life\u201d would fit the bill. \u201cIf you\u2019re symptomatic, you stay at home, take yourself out of society as quickly as you can and stay there, unless there\u2019s extreme risk to life,\u201d she said at the daily press conference.</p> <p>Downing Street\u2019s statement says Cummings travelled 260 miles north \u201cowing to his wife being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell. It was essential \u2026 to ensure his young child could be properly cared for.\u201d</p> <p>The regulations are clear that had Cummings been stopped by police en route to Durham, officers could have directed him to return to London and fined him. The wording of the regulations says police only need to \u201cconsider\u201d (ie believe) that someone had left home without a reasonable excuse in order to send them back.</p> <p>The government had already issued <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/covid-19-essential-travel-guidance\">non-legally-binding guidance </a>that said people should not leave home to isolate elsewhere: \u201cEssential travel does not include visits to second homes, campsites, caravan parks or similar, whether for isolation purposes or holidays. People must remain in their primary residence. Not taking these steps puts additional pressure on communities and services that are already at risk.\u201d</p> <p>Theoretically, police could also have sent Cummings back to London using another new law, the Coronavirus Act 2020, which gave police further powers to remove a potentially infectious person for screening/assessment and also to detain them if they refuse to comply. But whether the police can retrospectively fine someone considered to have broken the rules is unclear.</p>",
  "<p>The lockdown was a nationwide policy: everyone was expected to follow the same rules. It has nevertheless exposed some stark inequalities. Elites have been able to endure the period in comfort, often in remote, spacious holiday homes. Those with office jobs have found themselves stuck in their flats, juggling restless children and Zoom meetings. And at the lower end of the income scale, there are people still showing up for their essential jobs as cleaners, delivery drivers and nurses, with scant childcare support and constant worry about exposure to the virus.</p> <p>These are tense times, with millions of us making sacrifices, some large, some small. Whether\u2019s it\u2019s cobbling together a home-schooling programme while ill yourself, being deprived of the support of extended family or missing a loved one\u2019s funeral, the toll has been significant. It\u2019s no surprise then, that news the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser travelled from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/dominic-cummings-coronavirus-and-lockdown-a-timeline\">London to Durham</a> with his family while lockdown measures were in place has set off a wave of fury. While the British people have been remarkably forgiving of special privileges for senior members of the government \u2013 such as access to priority testing and tracing for themselves and their families, and early medical support upon diagnosis \u2013 extending this to an exemption from lockdown rules feels like a step too far.</p> <p>From a public health perspective, though, the situation with Cummings presents three problems. First, and most obviously, it undermines the core message to stay at home. This is vitally important because the purpose of lockdown is to buy time to drive down the number of cases to a level that would allow a package of interventions \u2013 including testing and tracing, and isolation \u2013 to take over the job of suppressing the outbreak. If lockdown is interpreted flexibly, or lifted too early, or seen as a symbolic gesture alone, it becomes pointless.</p> <p>Second, Cummings\u2019s actions give an unfortunate impression as far as exposing elderly people to the virus goes. According to Downing Street\u2019s statement on the affair, he remained with his wife and children in a house <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/23/dominic-cummings-no-10-accused-of-covering-up-lockdown-breach\">near, but separate to, his family</a>, including his mother and father. But to travel across the country to where his parents live inevitably erodes the strong message that precautions to protect older relatives are especially important, given that mortality increases with age.</p> <p>Third, Cummings travelled from London, an area that had a higher number of daily cases, and was ahead on the epidemic trajectory, to the north-east of England, which was less badly affected at the time, but which would soon become one of the hardest hits parts of the country. The lockdown measures were intended to prevent the spread of the virus from hotspots to less-exposed regions.</p> <p>Others advising on the pandemic response have had to resign for far less. This is not a left-right issue. Instead it is about right and wrong, and the government choosing to defend the actions of one of its leading figures over the public health message it has been pushing for the past eight weeks, and which is designed to save lives.</p> <p>Any undermining of that message could not come at a worse time: the UK is facing excess deaths of nearly 60,000, and has one of the highest death rates per capita in the world. There is no functioning test, trace and isolate system in place to take over the job of breaking chains of transmission and support the easing of lockdown. As other countries drive the virus to the margins and celebrate the reopening of shops, hairdressers, schools and businesses, the latest Office for National Statistics survey estimates <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19roundup/2020-03-26\">9,000 daily new cases</a> in the UK. People are suffering from an incoherent public health response, a late and consequently unnecessarily long lockdown, and leaders losing sight of those they\u2019re supposed to serve.</p> <p>While it might be psychologically appealing to believe the worst of the outbreak is behind us, early estimates from antibody tests, which provide a rough guide on what percentage of the population has been exposed, show most countries at under 10%, with cities slightly higher. The <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/05/21/17-londoners-5-rest-uk-have-coronavirus-antibodies-12739901/\">UK\u2019s estimate is 5%</a>, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/14/france-spain-say-large-scale-testing-coronavirus-shows-no-herd/\">Spain 5</a>% and Sweden 7%. This is nowhere near the level of exposure needed for population-wide natural \u201cherd\u201d immunity. Last week saw the largest number of daily new cases in the world, at 106,000, with outbreaks starting to take off in many low- and middle-income countries.</p> <p>The summer months must be used to think ahead, since the winter poses additional challenges. How can a second lockdown be avoided? How can more deaths be prevented? The clear lessons from east Asia are a robust test, trace and isolate system, close monitoring of hotspots such as care homes and hospitals, the protection of health and social care workers, border control and working towards a \u201cnew normal\u201d involving face masks, temperature checks and distancing.</p> <p>Every single person in the world is now affected by this outbreak. How exactly they are affected has more to do with their government\u2019s handling of the virus than anything else. Successful responses have not been correlated with country wealth, but rather with decisive political will and a clear strategy. Just compare the situations in the United States and Brazil with South Korea, Kerala in India, Greece, Vietnam and Senegal. Everything \u2013 whether it is schools reopening, the shielding of the elderly and vulnerable individuals, the viability of businesses, and families being able to see each other \u2013 depends on the ability of a government to contain this virus aggressively and quickly. Those of us who live in the UK need this government to succeed, but that requires it to focus all its efforts on public health planning, clear communication and retaining public trust \u2013 something made harder when a senior adviser appears to flout the rules.</p> <p>\u2022 Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh</p>",

Dunshea insists that racing is in a better position to make an early return than other sports which require human contact or team training.</p> <p>\u201cGovernment have recognised that we are different to the other sports that are being referred to,\u201d he said. \u201cWe largely are a rural-based sport, both our training and our racing environments are outdoor, which pose lower levels of risk and position us as a very different type of sport to football, rugby, where we have lots of close contact.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very, very comfortable that our sport is being seen as different to contact sports by government.

In reunion episodes, we get to hear from all the past contestants, with their thoughts on the trials and tribulations of the season. It\u2019s one for the hardcore fans, for sure.</p> <p>This one could make for a challenging watch (not to mention, a challenging recap) because it\u2019s all been done virtually, for obvious, world-changing reasons. But we must all do our best and plunge forward as safely and happily as possible. So here we go!</p> <h2>Do The Split-Screen</h2> <p>Three seconds in, and we\u2019re already exhausted. All the dolls are here, decked out in slumber-party finery, singing at us from their bedrooms, straight into our bedrooms (depending on where you watch it \u2013 but most people watch Drag Race in bed hungover, let\u2019s be honest). This makes it almost uncomfortably intimate. At least before, there was a solid fourth wall separation.

The instant a Drag Race contestant says they themselves deserve to go home, you know they\u2019re done for. Blind self-confidence is an essential component when it comes to drag, and if that leaves you, it\u2019s time to go home. We\u2019re now cutting between single, two, three and five screens, with alternating shots of all the contestants and clips from the show and it\u2019s all getting a bit confusing.

Oh. One of THOSE people. Sorry, but anyone who says they\u2019re having a great time in quarantine is lying. It\u2019s a nasty assertion designed to make the rest of us feel bad about ourselves. But we think Aiden\u2019s statements are just hyperbole, so it\u2019s fine. Aiden looks great on this reunion call. Maybe because this is the first time we\u2019ve ever seen her in a different wig. Watching the recap, it\u2019s good that Aiden left when he did, because that storyline would\u2019ve worn thin very quickly. Even just revisiting it is tedious. NEXT.</p> <h2>Brita</h2> <p>New York queen Brita says this season was hard for her to watch, because she didn\u2019t like the person she saw in herself. This is great \u2013 she did have some slight bullyish qualities, and it\u2019s good that she\u2019s seen that in herself and will hopefully change as a result of it. We feel for her, too \u2013 it must be horrible watching yourself back and not like what you see. For journalists, the equivalent is re-reading your first ever piece of published writing *shivers*.</p> <h2>Dahlia Sin</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e3764cc84ef5901aa62ee7d446d6ac74a945fdc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e3764cc84ef5901aa62ee7d446d6ac74a945fdc/65_58_1308_785/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drag Race\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dahlia Sin, for once not dressed as a broccoli.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VH1</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Next we head to Dahlia, who looks like Daenerys Targaryen if she had done a Fine Art degree at Central St Martins. RuPaul asks why she was so annoyed at being eliminated. Why do you think, Ru?! She got eliminated first! Surely that\u2019s reason enough to be annoyed!</p> <h2><strong>Rock M Sakura</strong></h2> <p>One of our favourites (and our main crush of the show, fyi) Rock M Sakura, says the show helped her self-confidence and seeing comments from fans around the world made her feel \u201cso validated\u201d. Now that\u2019s great, Rock, but be careful on that Instagram, especially now during lockdown when these things are magnified. You don\u2019t want to end up like <a href=\"https://youtu.be/oLc2E4P87QE\">Bryce Dallas Howard</a>. Rock also says she\u2019s been working on her relationship with her mum and RuPaul looks a bit tearful ... or maybe something just flew into his eye.</p> <h2><strong>Widow Von Du</strong></h2> <p>Next we head to one of this series\u2019 most matter-of-fact and memorable contestants, Widow. She was intriguing, colourful and promising but suffered the same affliction as Nicky Doll, with a crisis of self-confidence ending in her elimination. She says she always used drag as something to hide behind \u2013 hiding her real self, Ray, under the glitz and glamour of Widow. Much of the time, people start doing drag as a form of armour and defence. Which is fine \u2013 there are many coping mechanisms less healthy than drag. The trick is to not let it take over, and not forget your real self.</p> <h2>Jan</h2> <p>It\u2019s Jan\u2019s turn to chat next, and we\u2019ve just noticed her dressing gown is covered in a print of her face, in which she\u2019s wearing exactly the same makeup as she is on screen, which she later mentions is merch. We get to see Jan\u2019s Kris Jenner audition tape and it\u2019s great.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/merazlex_/status/1263997494427451392\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">the ONLY Kris Jenner that matters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jansportnyc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@jansportnyc</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DragRace?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DragRace</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/bckWcst3Q4\">pic.twitter.com/bckWcst3Q4</a></p>&mdash; alex (@merazlex_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/merazlex_/status/1263997494427451392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 23, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>Bits and Pieces</h2> <p>The next part of the episode is a bizarre amalgamation of outfit recaps, general chat and the opportunity for the girls to read each other. Gigi says \u201cMiss Jackie Cox ... you are so supportive, I can always count on you for a face to file my nails on.\u201d Crystal says \u201cHeidi, you must be enjoying social distancing because you do look best from at least six feet away.\u201d Widow says \u201cGigi Goode ... I bet R Kelly wouldn\u2019t even piss on you.\u201d IS THAT ... CAN SHE ... IS THAT EVEN LEGAL FOR HER TO SAY THAT? Either way, 10 points to Widow.</p> <p>Next we go to questions from fans, and WHOA, it\u2019s \u201cMaria from Rancho Cucamonga!\u201d We just googled Rancho Cucamonga \u2013 it\u2019s a city in California with a population of 177,751, making it the 26th most populous city in the state. It\u2019s home to two public libraries, which together contain a total of 200,000 books. Its top employer is Inland Empire Health Plan, which provides 2.5% of the city\u2019s total employment.

Then Brita does a fan question for herself. Then we get another character from Vanjie. Whilst these interludes get some cheap laughs, it would\u2019ve been nice to have some ACTUAL calls from Drag Race\u2019s devoted fans, with some actual interesting questions. Oh well.</p> <p>Jackie reveals that she visited her mother prior to the show, and she accepted Jackie\u2019s drag for what it is. She even sent a letter to RuPaul. Ru reads it and it\u2019s very sweet. We might be crying. Or maybe something just flew into our eye.</p> <p>Next week, we\u2019ll be at the final, and god knows what that\u2019ll bring. It\u2019s going to involve \u201cvirtual lipsyncing\u201d, \u201ccutting edge technology\u201d and more. What this reunion episode showed us, is that it\u2019s very difficult to properly recreate things, especially something as involved and physical as a drag show, via the medium of video calls. With lots of clever and probably painstaking editing, the Drag Race team have made it watchable, but the sad reality is that it was a poor imitation of the real thing - through no fault of anyone involved.<br><br>Here\u2019s to a sparkling 12th season of one of the most popular reality shows on TV, and to the return of film and TV studios \u2013 as soon as safely possible.</p> <p><br><br></p>",
  "<p>Founded by Martin Bisp and Jamie Sanigar in 2006, Empire Fighting Chance (EFC) has transformed the Empire Boxing gym \u2013 a respected Bristol institution since the 1960s \u2013 into a vital mental health service operating in the centre of the city. With world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury frequently advocating the value of boxing and fitness towards his own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/05/tyson-fury-champion-mental-health-boxer-depression-addiction\">mental health</a>, the connection with boxing and emotional health has never been stronger.</p> <p>EFC predominantly works with people aged eight to 25 who experience significant challenges in their lives, including those excluded from school and involved in antisocial behaviour \u2013 almost always as a result of mental health issues. With a unique programme of support, EFC provides an invaluable resource to more than 4,000 people each year in one of the UK\u2019s most deprived areas. It offers young people who would probably not access traditional forms of therapy a variety of bespoke services designed to support complicated home lives, blighted by poverty, deprivation and inadequate housing.</p> <p>\u201cWe are a charity that uses boxing, non-contact boxing and boxing training as a hook, to leverage the street credibility of the sport to knock down some of the barriers to entry for some of society\u2019s most difficult to reach young people,\u201d says EFC. Alongside that, it offers intensive personal development, psychological support, therapy, and advice on careers and education.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f51ea43f3e93ed5dd2b283565c7e27affebb4b65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f51ea43f3e93ed5dd2b283565c7e27affebb4b65/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Training on the punch bag.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Training on the punch bag.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"f90fa62b3344c4aafb654ffbf196122055919620\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f90fa62b3344c4aafb654ffbf196122055919620/0_0_4480_5598/800.jpg\" alt=\"Young people work out in the ring.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young people work out in the ring.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"3d6d7a6819944dcf619ba1c2eddf7ad0cdb453eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d6d7a6819944dcf619ba1c2eddf7ad0cdb453eb/0_201_4303_5379/800.jpg\" alt=\"Boxing gloves.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boxing gloves.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYoung people arrive at our doors with a range of behavioural and emotional issues, including anger, anxiety, depression and low self-esteem,\u201d says Bisp. \u201cTheir distress is often expressed in ways that can lead them into trouble rather than care and support.\u201d Young people are referred to EFC by schools, charities, pupil referral units and even the police.</p> <p>Bisp says: \u201cI\u2019ve not yet met a 10-, 12-, or 13-year-old whose real life ambition is to be selling drugs or who wants to get involved in some of the situations they have been involved in. We have not yet met young people who have any desire to be mentally unwell. What happens is that their behaviour can manifest itself in certain ways. What we\u2019ve found is that if you look at the symptom of anger or criminal behaviour, there are always underlying core problems. It may be chaotic home lives, it may be substance abuse by the parents, it could be domestic abuse, it could be sexual abuse. There is a whole series of factors that can lead into a behaviour that becomes symptomatic, which then gets a young person labelled.\u201d Through its unique package of non-contact boxing and intensive personal support, EFC seeks to challenge and inspire vulnerable young people to \u201crealise their unique potential\u201d and participate in sport, gaining support in ways that feel natural.</p> <p>Marvin Rees, the first directly elected black mayor of a UK city, trained at the gym as a young man. \u201cI was a very lost teenager, a mixed-race kid in the middle of a racially fractured Bristol in the 1980s,\u201d he says. \u201cPoor family, living in the inner city about 200 metres from this club. I had a reasonable brain but I was immobilised by a fear of failure and low self-esteem. Through boxing, I got a real sense of confidence. And I was also around coaches who cared.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was a very lost teenager, a mixed-race kid in the middle of a racially fractured Bristol in the 1980s</p> <footer> <cite>Marvin Rees, mayor of Bristol</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92dae60eb32000d03708f81425828cdef8280af9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92dae60eb32000d03708f81425828cdef8280af9/0_419_4190_5238/800.jpg\" alt=\"Marvin Rees, mayor of Bristol\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marvin Rees, mayor of Bristol</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many of the young people EFC works with may have fallen through the gaps in mental health services or be waiting to receive support. \u201cThe young people we are dealing with come from chaotic home lives, maybe lack of parental support, lack of parents in total, they have mental health issues,\u201d says Sanigar. \u201cThey want to access mental health services but the waiting list with CAMHS (child and adolescent mental health services) can be six months. The hoops that a young person has to go through \u2013 visiting the GP, getting a referral to CAMHS, making that appointment, filling out the forms \u2026 That is challenging enough if you\u2019ve got two parents in a middle-class family. But when you\u2019ve probably not got the support, the barriers to entry for that service are too challenging and too long-winded, too time-consuming and too late in the day. Within that period of time, anything could have happened.\u201d</p> <p>Describing some mental health services as \u201cculturally incompetent\u201d, Rees says: \u201c[Mental health services] are white middle-class services, designed by white middle-class people. What that means isthat if you are this type of person, it is going to work for you. If you are not, it probably won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Bisp says: \u201cThe feedback we get is that traditional talking therapy is middle-class, [young people] are often dealing with somebody they can\u2019t relate to. We\u2019re talking about a highly intimidatory atmosphere for a young person who is not confident and comfortable enough in themselves to sit in a room with somebody they barely know and start talking about their problems.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bc5c72f634a085f95b2c5b2a22eb8c9edd764099\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc5c72f634a085f95b2c5b2a22eb8c9edd764099/99_103_6383_3722/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young people train in the ring\" width=\"1000\" height=\"583\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young people train in the ring</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--halfWidth\"> <blockquote> <p>This is the sort of place where you don\u2019t even realise you are being cured, but you are</p> <footer> <cite>Prince Harry</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"cdd4f39d7e27c61c4272012e7103f1e65035a929\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdd4f39d7e27c61c4272012e7103f1e65035a929/0_0_4345_6518/667.jpg\" alt=\"April \u201cApril\u2019s relationship with her coach Courtney has grown to the point where he is a trusted adult.

However, this is the sort of place where you don\u2019t even realise you are being cured, but you are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA lot of these kids have gone through so much, it might be physical or sexual abuse, it could be anything \u2013 and they are angry,\u201d Bisp says. \u201cRather than try and tell people they shouldn\u2019t feel angry, actually what we start talking about is that anger is perfectly normal. Anger is a manifestation of issues, and they are issues they have a right to be angry about. So, what we\u2019re teaching them is how to react and how to deal with those situations in a way that\u2019s constructive.\u201d</p> <p>Bisp, who developed the programme along with Sanigar and a team of sports psychologists, says that \u201cthe metaphor [they] have built through the boxing relates back to the young person\u2019s individual life, and that\u2019s what the psychology is trying to do. That mini-goal might be \u2018don\u2019t get thrown out of school Monday\u2019, \u2018don\u2019t take drugs Tuesday\u2019. The psychology is about how it relates to the boxing, but really it\u2019s about how it relates to life.\u201d Through positive affirmation and the strong relationship built through the sport, the coaches are then able to use that relationship to offer support outside of the gym. \u201cI can\u2019t just come in here and start talking to them, but we use boxing as a tool to engage them and that\u2019s when we bring in our development points,\u201d says Ako, a coach at EFC.</p> <p>The former IBF featherweight world champion Lee Selby is a mentor at the club. \u201cI try and get into them that I\u2019ve worked my way up,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just sports that that works in, it\u2019s general life. If you work hard you can achieve your goals and your dreams.\u201d The influence of somebody such as Selby on marginalised young people \u2013 many of whom will have grown up watching and hearing of his achievements \u2013 can be dramatic. \u201cThey know I am from the same sort of background and they can relate to me,\u201d he says. \u201cAt school they are being told what to do by some posh guy and they are not really interested.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They know I am from the same sort of background and they can relate to me</p> <footer> <cite>Lee Selby, former featherweight world champion</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"627f2479a1cc51d2fa19d9773ab156c26a507387\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/627f2479a1cc51d2fa19d9773ab156c26a507387/0_749_4480_5971/750.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Selby, former featherweight world champion\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Selby, former featherweight world champion</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For many of the young people, a supportive, nurturing relationship with an adult can be a new experience. Sarah, foster mother of April, 16, describes how April\u2019s relationship with her coach Courtney \u201chas grown to the point where Courtney is a trusted adult. That has been a rare thing for her in her life, in her experience. It\u2019s really important.\u201d</p> <p>This type of relationship at EFC is built and maintained over a 20-week programme that combines non-contact boxing with mentoring and psychological education. The coaches believe that boxing, being largely individual and broken into three-minute rounds, allows a unique opportunity for therapy and mentoring.</p> <p>\u201cThe way that boxing is broken down into rounds means you\u2019ve got opportunities to build relationships and to talk while they are doing the activity,\u201d says Sanigar. \u201cThey can be skipping and you can be having a conversation. They can stop for a minute, you can have a conversation, you can\u2019t do that in football. You have your own individual goal set by a coach, and your goal might be to get five skips. We build small mini-goals for young people to achieve.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6d4165d5ff11e1bd075746452b693110c48c55f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d4165d5ff11e1bd075746452b693110c48c55f1/0_246_6549_4120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ellie trains with Matt.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"629\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ellie trains with Matt.<br>\u2018I struggle with really bad anger issues.

I can speak to someone, it doesn\u2019t necessarily even have to be about what\u2019s going on, it can just be about anything which helps and it\u2019s a nice distraction from everything else.\u201d</p> <p>Dontae, 17, was referred to the gym after being excluded from school a number of times. He is now at college studying health and fitness and says: \u201cI started coming in more and more regularly. I started loving it and my confidence grew more and more; knowing how I feel, and telling them how I feel, and them listening to how I feel. It\u2019s helped me to calm down. They are basically like mentors to me. My mental health has got better. My mental health was just about anger, anger, anger. Now it isn\u2019t. I feel better, I feel more normal. I feel more awareness, mentally stronger, knowing what decisions can benefit me.\u201d</p> <p>One issue that EFC regularly identifies in young people is low self-esteem and sense of self-worth. \u201cThe level of extremity has drastically changed over recent years\u201d, says Sanigar. \u201cThis is inner city, an area of deprivation that is going through a bit of a funny change at the moment. A three-bed house will cost you over \u00a3300,000. If you are growing up in this area with nothing \u2013 no role models, no mentors \u2013 it\u2019s practically impossible now for you to get on the property ladder. Youth services have been closed. There is nothing for them and they are becoming more isolated, sitting in their bedrooms. They are living a fantasy life on their phones, where it\u2019s Instagram, Snapchat \u2013 all these wonderful lives out there.

Its careers service sees 90% of users find employment, training or higher education.</p> <p>Sanigar says: \u201cIt\u2019s inspiring young people to understand the opportunities that are out there, which they often won\u2019t get to see. With careers we look at what inspires you, what is it that gets you excited. If it\u2019s football, the likelihood is you\u2019re not going to be a Premier League footballer but we will take you up to a local football club. There are 80 different trades there, from the marketing department to the stadium manager to the groundsman. [These are] all careers in football at one level or another. It may still involve them getting a shift at Tesco or Ikea, to work their way along that ladder but there is an ultimate goal. For us, it\u2019s about making the underlying, lasting changes to a person\u2019s life.\u201d</p> <p>One of the employment schemes EFC runs is with local coffee roasters Extract Coffee, who offer a barista training programme. Steven, 20, found employment after completing the course: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have got the job at Boston Tea Party without Empire giving me that push. When I started coming to Empire I wasn\u2019t in a great place, but now everything has changed. After doing boxing sessions day by day, my mood generally got a lot better. I feel happier, I don\u2019t have those days when I don\u2019t feel like doing anything because I don\u2019t have the self-esteem or the energy. I\u2019m actively looking to do stuff. Compared to where I first started that\u2019s quite a big leap.\u201d</p> <p>EFC has also trained qualified therapists in non-contact boxing skills in order to provide support to young people with some of the most severe mental health issues.</p> <p>\u201cThe demographic we have here is very varied,\u201d says therapist Jane Ivall. \u201cOften they will be some of the hardest-to-reach young people. The fact they are engaging and connecting here is a good starting point for them engaging and connecting with us. Here, there is a whole range of people with a whole range of issues, and we just come alongside them using the medium of boxing to enable them to access mental health support. The boxing breaks down the barriers to traditional therapy. It enables people to open up and access things they traditionally may not feel comfortable to access. Talking about a trauma is complex. Working physically enables you to shift trauma, to explore things and to build a rapport and trust with a therapist quicker.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32c7104dd15a95a15fe8c7cb6b5ca5a6cd89175d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32c7104dd15a95a15fe8c7cb6b5ca5a6cd89175d/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Courtney wraps Byron\u2019s hands\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Courtney wraps Byron\u2019s hands</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--halfWidth\"> <blockquote> <p>Rather than try and tell people they shouldn\u2019t feel angry, what we start talking about is that anger is perfectly normal</p> <footer> <cite>Martin Bisp, EFC founder</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"efe1f84faff32d2493c32532c9caf26baaff3e9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efe1f84faff32d2493c32532c9caf26baaff3e9c/0_883_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Callum trains outside.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Callum trains outside.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For many who come to EFC, boxing has a unique appeal that alleviates any stigma that may come with accessing more traditional mental health or careers services. Sanigar points to the \u201ccredibility and grit\u201d about what EFC does: \u201cBoxers and boxing gyms are respected within these communities. I would say that in any deprived community in the world there is a boxing gym. [Young people] are not embarrassed to come. They can be in here, doing a CV, doing homework, having a one-to-one session with a therapist, having a group session, with a coach and some psychology, some career goals, this and that. And that\u2019s the beauty of it. To everyone else, they\u2019ve just been to the boxing club.\u201d</p> <p>In 2019, EFC supported 4,245 young people. The impact is striking. Among those young people, the suicide ideation rate dropped significantly and 74% are no longer at risk of exclusion from school, 78% are no longer committing antisocial or criminal behaviour, 84% are more motivated and 73% are happier.</p> <p>According to Rees, \u201cthe benefits to the wider city are pretty straightforward: a healthier population. Young people who are less likely to become mentally unwell, who have more structure in their lives and who are better able to develop their own talents, abilities and ambitions in life. They are also less likely to become service users, or engage in activities that take away the quality of life from other people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"93721ee85b978344e00bae2f5a331ddb7c45783c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93721ee85b978344e00bae2f5a331ddb7c45783c/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Founders Martin Bisp and Jamie Sanigar at the gym.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Founders Martin Bisp and Jamie Sanigar at the gym.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Ivall, EFC is \u201calmost like a one-stop community shop \u2026 with support and care, and I\u2019m going to use the word love, though the boxing guys would probably shoot me for that. [There is] support of real compassion and kindness which is un-judgmental and nondiscriminatory in any shape, size or form. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are, if you come through that door you can have that support. That\u2019s life-changing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not careers specialists, we\u2019re not education specialists, we\u2019re not mental health specialists,\u201d says Bisp. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to just do our best and what we think is right, and thankfully the results over the last 10 years have proven that what we do does work\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Joe Rogan, the comedian, MMA commentator and podcaster, may seem an unlikely prospect for becoming the world\u2019s highest paid broadcaster. But after signing an exclusive deal with Spotify, that is what he may have become, marking a new era for podcasting in the process.</p> <p>To much of the world, Rogan\u2019s name is most associated with the periodic furores that erupt from the marathon interviews around which his podcast is structured.</p> <p>Elon Musk smoking weed during a 2018 interview brought a lot of heat, for instance, as did Bernie Sanders appearing on the show in the midst of his presidential campaign, less than six months after conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was brought on for his second sit-down in as many years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/mar/30/podcastings-netflix-moment-the-global-battle-for-domination\">Podcasting's Netflix moment: the global battle for domination</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Rogan\u2019s affably bro-ish demeanour, combined with his sponge-like interview style, has garnered him millions of fans over the thousand-plus episodes of his show, The Joe Rogan Experience. And that has made him a linchpin in Spotify\u2019s plans to transform the world of podcasting.</p> <p>Rogan announced the deal on 19 May, revealing his show would debut on Spotify in September, and become exclusive to the platform some point after that. Terms were not disclosed, but <a href=\"https://medium.com/@awilkinson/howard-stern-is-getting-ripped-off-1b721cc2f3f2\">one calculation from 2019</a> pegged Rogan\u2019s revenue from podcast adverts alone between $50m (\u00a341m) and $250m, with more coming from YouTube, where his shows get a million views in their first 24 hours. Add a premium for exclusivity on top and, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/05/19/wilkinson-howard-stern\">says podcaster John Gruber</a>, \u201cit seems likely that Joe Rogan is now the highest paid broadcaster in the world\u201d.</p> <p>The Joe Rogan Experience is the second significant acquisition by Spotify for its growing podcast business, after the company <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-ringer-deal-price-250-million-podcasting-bill-simmons-report-2020-2?op=1&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T\">bought US sports broadcaster The Ringer outright for nearly $200m</a> in February.</p> <p>Both deals, as well as smaller forays into exclusive content around topics such as gaming, true crime, and relationship advice, lie at the heart of the Swedish streaming service\u2019s attempts to transform podcasting from an industry built around a mishmash of open standards and traditional advertising into a platform economy \u2013 with Spotify at the centre.</p> <p>By requiring Rogan\u2019s listeners to use the Spotify app to tune in, the company gains far deeper data about who, when and where their audiences are; that, in turn, can be fed through to advertisers, who are more likely to pay higher rates if they can be assured that the target audience is listening. Control of the player also allows Spotify to vary the advertising to the audience, again increasing revenue.</p> <p>The benefits are familiar web economics, and many see the transformation Spotify has in mind as mirroring the changes to the wider web that unfurled over the 2010s. \u201cPodcasting feels like the web prior to the roll-up of power by Google and Facebook, with a lot of new voices, some very successful and most marginal, but quite authentic,\u201d <a href=\"https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/on-the-spotify-joe-rogan-deal-and\">said Matt Stoller</a>, author of Goliath, a history of monopolies.</p> <p>\u201cOnce Spotify has gatekeeping power over distribution and a large ad targeting business, it will also be able to control who can monetise podcasts, because advertisers will increasingly just want to hit specific audience members, as opposed to advertise on specific shows.\u201d</p> <p>But Spotify has competition. Apple \u2013 long the corporate leader in podcasting through its control of the Apple Podcast Directory and still the largest global platform for connecting listeners with broadcasters \u2013 has started acquiring original podcasts for itself for the first time, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-21/apple-ramps-up-original-podcasts-in-part-to-help-promote-tv\">according to Bloomberg News</a>. The two companies, in direct competition over music streaming, could be going head-to-head in a second field.</p> <p>Until then, Spotify\u2019s bigger problem is convincing podcast listeners to switch from their favourite app to the service\u2019s own \u2013 which may not have access to all the shows available in the open ecosystem. The company is not the first to try, and others, such as Stitcher and Luminary, have struggled to justify themselves to listeners. But Spotify has one big advantage: its app, already used by more than 250 million people a month, could serve to introduce podcasts to a whole new group of listeners.</p>",
  "<p>I slide the mask up over my nose and lean towards the electronic thermometer. \u201cYou have a temperature of 36.8C,\u201d says the smiling restaurant maitre-D. At least I assume he\u2019s smiling. His own surgical mask is pulled up to right below the eyes.</p> <p>He gestures with gloved hands to a guestbook in which I record my name and phone number. These details will be submitted into a centralised database and retained for 30 days. Should anyone in the restaurant test positive for Covid-19, the Malaysian government will trace any diners who may have come into contact with them that evening and tell them to self-isolate. I cast a furtive glance at my fellow diners to see how healthy they look before venturing in. These measures aren\u2019t exactly key ingredients for a relaxing meal with friends. But then again, we are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/may/19/how-the-covid-19-pandemic-could-reshape-restaurants\">dining out</a> in the middle of a global pandemic.</p> <p>It\u2019s been a little over two weeks since the Malaysian government authorised restaurants to reopen their doors to dine-in customers, one of the first countries in the world to do so. The easing of the country\u2019s movement-control order followed nearly two months of being cooped up, forbidden from anything other than infrequent trips to the local supermarket. Even outdoor exercise of any kind was strictly prohibited.</p> <p>Then on 4 May some restrictions were relaxed. That restaurants were one of the sectors given the green light, while schools, swimming pools and visits to family remained off limits, is testament to how central <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/dec/16/penang-malaysia-guide-best-bars-restaurants-hotels-culture\">eating out is to Malaysian culture</a>. Before coronavirus, families crowding round communal tables at outdoor food courts and queuing up for bowls of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/jun/14/top-10-street-food-george-town-penang\">char kway teow</a> (flat rice noodles) at one of the many hawker stalls was a regular evening sight. It\u2019s an informal and deeply sociable affair, and something I\u2019ve come to love since moving to Penang a year ago. And, if I\u2019m honest, it just isn\u2019t quite the same with masks, gloves and government databases.</p> <p>The maitre-D leads us through an almost empty restaurant into a new outside area, where long rectangular tables have been pushed together to form one larger table to ensure we\u2019re all sat a safe distance apart. Too far away to clink glasses as we raise a toast to finally being allowed out.</p> <p>The changes don\u2019t end there. The menu has only a few dishes available, a way to limit interaction between kitchen staff. And in the bathroom, there are lines of red tape stuck to alternate sinks to keep anyone from accidentally brushing against one another as they reach for the hand soap.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/17/my-self-control-has-gone-ill-take-anything-thats-delivered-to-my-door\">My self-control has gone.

But there\u2019s no escaping the fact that there\u2019s no ambience. I keep forgetting myself, holding out a glass of wine for my friend to taste before quickly snatching it back as the waiter spots what I\u2019m doing and hurries towards us. You can\u2019t overhear snippets of anyone\u2019s conversation. There\u2019s no polite squeezing behind someone\u2019s chair on the way to the toilet, or children running around. All things that once were annoying, and now seem a meaningful part of the experience.</p> <p>Tentative plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/cafes-in-england-could-sell-food-and-drink-from-street-stalls\">reopen the UK\u2019s hospitality sector</a> in July are under way, and already the idea of 50% capacity and two-metre gaps between tables has been floated.

The next few months will be a period of experimentation and innovation, and the best we as customers can do is to accept that things won\u2019t go back to \u201cnormal\u201d for a long time, continue to support our favourite haunts and raise a glass to their efforts.</p> <p>\u2022 Megan Tatum is a journalist based in Penang, Malaysia</p>",

Get in touch on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">Twitter @helenrsullivan</a> with tweets, takes, questions and comments.</p> <p>After a twisty little week, last Sunday\u2019s elimination saw everyone but Poh compete in an elimination challenge, over two rounds. The first, a one-on-one fight to the death, where contestants were randomly paired against each other to battle it out over a nation\u2019s cuisine. The second was \u201cclassic flavour pairings\u201d, and Laura made pasta <em>and</em> sang a song about the ingredients: \u201cDooo do do do tomato and basil.\u201d The judges liked the dish.</p> <p>Tessa was declared safe. Sarah C and Hayden were flummoxed by beetroot and horseradish. Hayden went home. </p> <p><strong>This week: </strong></p> <p>Monday. The contestants split into yellow and pink teams, with besties Brendan and Reece again competing with one another, this time as team captains. There was a bit of banter: </p> <p>Reece (pink): \u201cAre you ready to lose again?\u201d<br>Brendan (yellow): \u201cYou will be eating your words shortly\u201d. Bless their hearts.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday: Black Box Challenge</strong></p> <p>Ides chef Peter Gunn had the contestants replicate his \u201cBlack Box\u201d, a small cube filled with wonder. The finicky box evoked sensations of \u201cStar Wars\u201d and \u201cDarth Vader\u201d but was also described as \u201ccute\u201d. </p> <p>To me the BBC had the exact tone of this remix of<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skK3WoK5Z8A\"> the other BBC\u2019s (the news one) theme song remixed to Dua Lipa</a>. The \u201cbox of the day\u201d belonged to Laura.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday: Vegan mystery box challenge. </strong></p> <p>Reece smashed it. Poh smashed it. Simon smashed it. Jess smaaa-aaashed it. All of them got immunity. </p> <p><strong>Thursday: Ramen challenge</strong></p> <p>These dishes looked looked tasty as hell. Jess and Poh won the instant noodle challenge and advanced to the next round. Jess won. Reece and Simon headed for elimination. </p> <p><strong>It was a good week for... </strong></p> <p>Instant ramen</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mrbenjaminlaw/status/1263374568686669824\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Holy shit, tonight&#39;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MasterchefAU?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MasterchefAU</a> focuses entirely on instant ramen \u2013 a real Sophie&#39;s Choice moment for every East Asian person, shout out to my fellow yellows tonight. <a href=\"https://t.co/G1ziI0EL38\">pic.twitter.com/G1ziI0EL38</a></p>&mdash; Benjamin Law \u7f85\u65ed\u80fd (@mrbenjaminlaw) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrbenjaminlaw/status/1263374568686669824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 21, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Jess:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FierceRobert/status/1263425665644130305\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Talented \u2705<br>Beyond her years \u2705 <br>Helps out her competitors \u2705<br>Gorgeous inside and out \u2705<br><br>How can you not love Jess <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MasterChefAU?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MasterChefAU</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/xy0DFGEqCz\">pic.twitter.com/xy0DFGEqCz</a></p>&mdash; robert.

  "<p>Towards the end of her training in emergency medicine at Brown University, Rhode Island, Dr Alyson McGregor was asked what her \u201cspecialism\u201d would be.</p> <p>\u201cYou are expected to have a niche so my answer was, \u2018Well, I like women\u2019s health,\u2019\u201d says McGregor. \u201cFrom that, people thought, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s into obstetrics/gynaecology.\u2019\u201d So on busy shifts in the emergency department of Rhode Island Hospital, the state\u2019s major trauma centre, the newly qualified McGregor became everyone\u2019s go-to doctor for pelvic examinations because this was believed to be her special interest. \u201cI laugh about it now, but it\u2019s when I started to realise that there\u2019s this assumption that women\u2019s health is wrapped up in their reproduction. Women were men with \u2018boobs and tubes\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>But McGregor was interested in far more than that. By women\u2019s health she meant the health of the whole woman, whose female chromosomes exist in every cell and influence every bodily function. She was interested in how these differences \u2013 in hormones, in tissue, in systems and structures \u2013 impact every disease and the way it should be treated. Cardiovascular health provided her route in.</p> <p>\u201cThis was about 15 years ago when people were realising that women having heart attacks presented differently to men,\u201d she says. \u201cThey described different symptoms and had poorer outcomes, so I started to ask why; and if we\u2019re different in <em>this</em> way, what about <em>that</em> way? The more I delved, the more I realised the scope of this. In medicine, we\u2019ve ignored women because we\u2019ve used men as our standard \u2013 and it hasn\u2019t served women well.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When a doctor writes a prescription, ask, \u2018Is this specific to me as female?'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>McGregor has set this out in her new book <em>Sex Matters</em>. It\u2019s a wake-up call, a cry for action, a frightening and fascinating read. The takeaway message is that women\u2019s bodies are different to men\u2019s from cellular level onwards, yet our medical model is based on knowledge gleaned from male cells, male animals and male humans. Within this, there\u2019s a wealth of disturbing detail \u2013 the diseases we routinely fail to understand in women, the drugs that work in men, while being useless, dangerous or even deadly in the other 50% of the population. In an age where we hear talk of \u201cpersonalised medicine\u201d and \u201ctargeted therapies\u201d, it\u2019s impossible to read this book without feeling stunned by science\u2019s failure to have factored all this in earlier. \u201cThat\u2019s a common reaction,\u201d says McGregor. \u201cI often hear, \u2018Gosh, I thought medicine was taking this into account!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>We are talking a few weeks before the book\u2019s publication \u2013 though <em>Sex Matters</em> certainly won\u2019t have the launch once planned. Instead, McGregor is working long shifts in her emergency department because of Covid-19. (Her husband is a doctor, too \u2013 she tweeted pictures of the two of them in their protective gear.) When we Skype on her day off, I ask what life is like right now.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s challenging,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s the anxiety of being home and worrying about my family, and then my family worrying about us at work. And then being at work, but not recognising anyone because we\u2019re all covered up.\u201d The Covid cases in her hospital, says McGregor, are \u201cmanageable\u201d and, overall, her patient volumes are down. \u201cThe messaging has been, \u2018Stay home,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThough that makes me worry, too, because where are the heart attacks, the complications from dialysis, the infections? I am seeing people with underlying psychiatric issues seeking care as the pandemic restrictions have increased anxiety and depression for so many.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aaa8771ff2f99089bbe8d2f4949d73d5cc5610a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aaa8771ff2f99089bbe8d2f4949d73d5cc5610a6/0_0_4320_5400/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Women\u2019s health is assumed to be wrapped up in reproduction.

Though many countries, including the US and UK, have been slow to publish detailed sex-specific information, those that have suggested it could have killed up to twice as many men as women. In the UK, an analysis of 4,000 cases <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52308783\" title=\"\">by the Office of National Statistics</a> found the same ratio, while <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/04/07/new-york-coronavirus-deaths-data-shows-most-had-underlying-illnesses/2960151001/\" title=\"\">figures from New York City Health</a> suggest men account for more than 61% of Covid deaths. Social differences is one possible cause \u2013 in China, for example, far more men are smokers. Biological differences is another. Oestrogen helps stimulate the immune system, but the fact that women have two X chromosomes, which contain a high density of immune-related genes, could be key. (Men were also disproportionately affected by Sars and Mers.)</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to create a call for all countries to start collecting Covid-19 data by sex so that we can have this knowledge ahead of time,\u201d says McGregor. \u201cIn the H1N1 [swine flu] pandemic, it wasn\u2019t until we started looking at sex differences that we realised pregnant women were very susceptible to complications. If we have the information, we can look for explanations and target better treatments. And I\u2019m still not seeing it.\u201d</p> <p>McGregor believes the reason can be traced back to the beginnings of organised medical research when it was decided that women of childbearing age should be excluded from trials \u2013 effectively taking sex differences out of the picture. The reason was to protect them, but for the medical profession and pharmaceutical industry it also made work faster, easier and cheaper by taking out pesky variables such as menstrual cycles and hormone surges. In <em>Sex Matters</em>, McGregor lists multiple ways that today\u2019s drugs can still fail women as a direct result. Women metabolise drugs differently (there are lots of reasons, but many are linked to different hormones and different levels of enzymes), so certain drugs remain in the system for longer or drop to dangerously low levels at certain points of the menstrual cycle. McGregor also shows how common fillers used in generic drugs \u2013 which are typically only tested for two weeks in a group of healthy males \u2013 can alter bioavailability (how much of the drug that will reach the body and work as planned) in women by up to 24%, which is why she often asks presenting patients if they\u2019ve recently switched to a generic.</p> <p>One particularly frightening example is the impact of medication on our QT \u2013 that\u2019s the resting time between heartbeats. A woman\u2019s QT is already longer than a man\u2019s (a result of men\u2019s teenage testosterone surge) and many prescription drugs \u2013 painkillers, antidepressants, antihistamines, antibiotics \u2013 cause incremental QT increases as a side-effect. For women on multiple meds (and statistically, women are most likely to be on multiple meds), the risk of these combined increases can range from simple arrhythmia to sudden cardiac death.</p> <p>McGregor gives the example of one patient, a woman in her 40s whose back pain resulted in a common medication spiral \u2013 painkillers then sleeping tablets then steroids then anti-anxiety meds, and finally an antibiotic for a UTI. This cocktail, she believes, caused the patient sudden cardiac death, something she says is \u201cmore common than many physicians would like to admit\u201d. One German study found that 66% of long QT syndrome patients were female \u2013 and of these, 60% were drug-related.</p> <p>\u201cHydroxychloroquine, the drug being trialled as a treatment for Covid [and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/22/trump-hydroxychloroquine-study-coronavirus\" title=\"\">hyped by Donald Trump</a>], also has the side-effect of prolonging QT interval,\u201d says McGregor. \u201cIf it\u2019s prescribed to a female, we should have her QT interval measured first, but that\u2019s not even in the discussion.\u201d In fact, she is concerned that in the race to find a Covid vaccine, reverting to standard research protocols (male cells, male animals and no sex-specific analysis of human trials) could result in <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/our-response-to-covid-19-is-male-centric/\" title=\"\">dangerous gaps in knowledge</a>. </p> <p>Some of the areas covered in <em>Sex Matters</em> are already in the public eye. The British Heart Foundation is halfway through a three-year campaign to tackle what it calls the \u201cheart attack gender gap\u201d \u2013 a UK woman is 50% more likely than a man to receive an initial wrong diagnosis for a heart attack and, even after correct diagnosis, significantly less likely to receive life-saving treatments. One reason could be that women\u2019s symptoms don\u2019t always fit previous male-centric models. In men, plaque tends to build up, causing blood vessels to rupture. In women, plaque is more likely to gradually erode, making blood vessels stiffer and less flexible over time.</p> <p>Julie Ward is a senior cardiac nurse with the <a href=\"https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/who-we-are\" title=\"\">British Heart Foundation</a> who has worked on the campaign\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/influencing-change/appg-on-heart-and-circulatory-diseases\" title=\"\">All-Party Parliamentary Group</a>. \u201cCoronary care has been male-driven,\u201d she says. \u201cTreated by men using research by men carried out on men. We\u2019re only now beginning to understand the different physiology. Part of our campaigning is to encourage more UK women to sign up for trials, and also to encourage more women to become cardiologists.\u201d</p> <p>Our treatments for pain are another area where women are poorly served. Epidemiologic studies clearly demonstrate that women are at greater risk of pain conditions \u2013 from migraines to musculoskeletal, from IBS to PMS. The interaction between the sex hormones, neurotransmitters, like dopamine and serotonin, and the central nervous system is one key reason (a study of transsexuals undergoing hormone therapy found that half of those transitioning from female to male reported improvements in chronic pain conditions.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When a man says he\u2019s in a bit of pain, we think he\u2019s in a lot of pain. When a woman says it, we think she\u2019s worried</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s also women\u2019s XX chromosomes that create those aggressive immune responses so effective in fighting disease, but also prone to turn on the body itself (autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, are far more common in women). Yet women are more likely than men to receive a psychiatric diagnosis than a physical one (panic attack instead of heart attack), more likely than men to be given lifestyle advice rather than an exploratory x-ray when presenting with IBS \u2013 and in the case of \u201cwomen\u2019s conditions\u201d such as endometriosis, highly likely to be told that the pain they\u2019re experiencing is \u201cnormal\u201d. (In the UK, it takes women an average of 7.5 years to get an endometriosis diagnosis \u2013 and even then, we\u2019ve developed few effective treatments for this debilitating disease.)</p> <p>Dr Amanda Williams, Reader in Clinical Health Psychology at University College London agrees that women\u2019s pain is typically downplayed. \u201cPatient studies show it,\u201d she says. \u201cWomen are prescribed less analgesic. When a man says he\u2019s in a bit of pain, we think he\u2019s really in a lot of pain. When a woman says she\u2019s in a lot of pain, we think she\u2019s in a bit of pain, but worried about it.\u201d</p> <p>According to Williams, this can be traced back to Darwinism and the belief in a great \u201cchain of being\u201d, which put men at the top of the hierarchy and women at the lower end. Beliefs about pain reflected power and status. \u201cBlack people endured horrendous hardship and brutality so it was said that they were less sensitive to pain, and women endured childbirth, which was pretty painful, so it was believed they were oversensitive, prone to hysterics.\u201d White European men, it was decided, had it just about right.</p> <p>It\u2019s a bleak picture, but McGregor is confident it\u2019s changing. She is now a recognised sex and gender expert in emergency medicine at Brown (which covers a lot more than pelvic examinations)and has co-founded the Sex and Gender Health Collaborative, a national organisation which works to integrate sex and gender knowledge into medical education and clinical practice. \u201cIt has been an interesting evolution,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I first started talking about this, no one really understood what I was saying or didn\u2019t quite see the importance. Most physicians are data-driven \u2013 and now there\u2019s exponential data coming through that shows how significant sex differences can be. Now I see a different response when I\u2019m speaking. In 2016, the top research funder in the US stated you must include sex as a biological variable in your research design.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80ad8ccb093c72c6611f058261df47e1f1ba7d37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80ad8ccb093c72c6611f058261df47e1f1ba7d37/0_0_4320_5400/800.jpg\" alt=\"It\u2019s too big to wait for change from the top down.

Should I take a different drug at certain times of my menstrual cycle?\u2019 A doctor may not know those answers \u2013 but most people who go to medical school take an oath of lifelong learning. I hope doctors will say, \u2018Let me look.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Though McGregor believes it can be done in 10 years, the scale of change required seems enormous. \u201cYes,\u201d she nods happily, \u201cmammoth!

  "<p>Dundee were thinking big at the start of the 1992-93 season, their first in the Premier Division for two years. The manager, Simon Stainrod, had revamped the squad, with the former Everton captain Kevin Ratcliffe and the former Arsenal midfielder Graham Rix among that summer\u2019s arrivals. The club\u2019s new home strip was modelled on Sampdoria, who had been European Cup finalists that year. And the club\u2019s owner, the Canadian businessman Ron Dixon, had plans to build a new stand at Dens Park with an ice rink underneath.</p> <p>But three matches into the season, and despite being handed a gentle start with games against Falkirk, Airdrie and St Johnstone, Dundee were still looking for their first win.

They had big-money signings and internationals almost everywhere you looked; Mark Hateley and Ally McCoist up front; Stuart McCall and Alexei Mikhailichenko in midfield; Richard Gough and Dave McPherson in defence. We felt sure the wait for a win would go on for another week, the \u201cwe\u201d being my older brother and his friends who I met in a pub near the city\u2019s then only university before kick-off (soft drinks only for me).</p> <p>Dundee started well, encouraged from the sidelines by Stainrod, who caught everyone\u2019s attention by wearing a full-length raincoat and fedora, looking like Dick Tracy come to lay down the law. Ivo den Bieman, a Dutch winger who had originally come to Scotland to study, headed home Rix\u2019s corner at the near post to open the scoring. McCoist equalised from a free-kick soon after but Ian Gilzean restored Dundee\u2019s lead when Rangers couldn\u2019t clear another Rix corner. Gilzean\u2019s goal came a month shy of the 30th anniversary of his father, Alan, scoring a hat-trick for Dundee in an 8-1 win over K\u00f6ln in the European Cup.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJqmZmUDC4s\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XJqmZmUDC4s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Minutes before half-time, McCoist equalised again, this time from close range, but then midway through the second half, Dundee went ahead for the third time. Gilzean flicked on Alan Dinnie\u2019s cross and Billy Dodds beat Ally Maxwell in the Rangers goal with a first-time volley. It was a great finish but it would be another four years, long after he had left the club, before Dodds won the first of his 26 Scotland caps.</p> <p>Dodds and Gilzean had sights of goal to give Dundee a two-goal cushion and it looked like those missed chances would be costly when, with 10 minutes to go, the Rangers substitute Ian Ferguson thumped home Hateley\u2019s knockdown to make it 3-3. But instead of playing as if they just had the stuffing knocked out of them, Dundee continued on the front foot. And with six minutes to go, Gough fouled Gilzean and the referee awarded a penalty. Dodds sent Maxwell the wrong way and Dundee were back in front. We expected an onslaught in the time left but bar a McCoist shot that flew wide Dundee comfortably saw the game out. They had deservedly beaten the champions. Now our season was up and running.</p> <p>\u201cWe went for their jugular and ripped it out,\u201d said Stainrod of his side\u2019s performance.

When photographs of a newly opened and crowded Jacksonville Beach in northern Florida flooded social media, critics tweeted #FloridaMorons. In New York City, residents are angry at Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s <a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/health/nyc-beaches-open-for-holiday-weekend-no-swimming-allowed/6206187/\">previous</a> decision to keep city beaches closed during Memorial Day weekend.</p> <p>Beaches tend to evoke more reaction and anger than parks and other public spaces. It\u2019s in large part, experts say, because the US shoreline is increasingly private, and controlled by fewer, and richer, people.</p> <p>\u201cWe went from a time, prior to WWII, where much of American shorelines were treated as public land, to a frenzy of privatization where the shoreline was gobbled up,\u201d said Andrew Kahrl, a professor at the University of Virginia who wrote The Land Was Ours: African American Beaches from Jim Crow to the Sunbelt South.</p> <p>Earlier in the 19th century, US beaches were largely public and inhabited by working-class coastal communities, many of them African American watermen, Kahrl said. The coastline wasn\u2019t coveted property, since it was hard to maintain in the face of natural forces like hurricanes and high tide, and it was groups like <a href=\"https://gullahgeecheenation.com/\">the Gullah</a>, who were the keepers.</p> <p>By 1970, however, <a href=\"http://bostonreview.net/class-inequality-race/andrew-w-kahrl-free-beach\">over 95% </a>of US coastlines suitable for recreation were closed to the general public. To add to those restrictions, many municipalities imposed parking fees and tolled roads to limit entry.</p> <p>The result is that our public beaches have become smaller and more crowded, while a small group of affluent elite hold the keys to the rest of the coastline. \u201cThe public\u2019s ability to enjoy the shoreline has decreased in direct proportion to our increasing inequality,\u201d Kahrl said.</p> <p>During the pandemic, this dichotomy has become even more obvious. Public health officials promote exercise and fresh air during citywide lockdowns, and virologists have said it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html\">largely safe</a> to be outside as long as people observe physical distancing. But, as the Guardian reported earlier this week, 100 million Americans, especially people of color and poor communities, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/20/park-inequality-access-coronavirus-wellbeing\">don\u2019t have access</a> to a decent park or public space, which includes beaches.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The public\u2019s ability to enjoy the shoreline has decreased in direct proportion to our increasing inequality</p> <footer> <cite>Andrew Kahrl</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Neighborhoods in New York suffer from this lack of access, said Meg Walker, an architect with the Project for Public Spaces, including many of the neighborhoods in the boroughs of Queens and the Bronx that were hit hardest by Covid-19. \u201cThere\u2019s many people in these densely populated neighborhoods who have high asthma rates and poor air quality,\u201d she said, risk factors for the virus.</p> <p>Walker also pointed out that public beaches, even more than parks, tend to bring together people of different backgrounds, especially around holidays. The diversity on a public beach lies in stark contrast to that of a privately owned beach, which tends to skew white and upper class.</p> <p>The increased policing on beaches burdens black communities, who are more likely to have tense interactions with law enforcement. Already this year, in Los Angeles and Miami, the NAACP raised an alarm when <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-05/arrest-of-woman-at-beach-with-dog-prompts-questions-by-councilwoman-naacp\">black beachgoers</a> were reportedly aggressively <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/videos-show-miami-beach-arrests-black-spring-breakers-slammed-racist-n1160921\">accosted</a> by police.</p> <p>During the pandemic beaches have been caught in the political divide between Republican states that have loosened restrictions early and Democrat-run states, who have been far more cautious. In this case, states like Florida and South Carolina, which have long coastlines and Republican governors, opened their beaches as people in the north-east, governed by Democrats, remained at home.</p> <p>Now, as many communities in the north-east start to open up, they have decided to keep their shores closed to outsiders.

It\u2019s continuing to open more public spaces, like pedestrian roadways, and coming up with community-driven, creative ways to remind people to take precautions. In Detroit, for example, there was a project to open <a href=\"http://downtowndetroitparks.com/parks/Campus-Martius/things_to_do_in/The-Beach\">urban beaches</a> for residents.

Beijing has so far refused to be drawn into negotiations which it believes are the responsibility of the US and Russia, who together possess more than 90% of the world\u2019s stockpile of nearly 14,000 warheads.

Coel, who also co-directs and stars as Arabella, faces down the perils intrinsic to the lifestyle of a young, multicultural generation high on chemicals, partying and casual sex.</p> <p>For <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/mar/13/paapa-essiedu-hamlet-royal-shakespeare-theatre-stratford-interview\">Essiedu</a>, this means a deep dive into what masculinity means when its boundaries are broken, not by racist thugs or harassing police, but by demons unleashed by its own desires. \u201cI\u2019m into everything,\u201d boasts Kwame on another casual date, minutes before he is reduced to pleading: \u201cNot that.\u201d The representation of the moment when good sex turns bad is so up-close and personal that I wonder if he had any doubts about taking on the role?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qznkRYA_y5M\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qznkRYA_y5M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qznkRYA_y5M\">Watch a trailer for I May Destroy You.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cI\u2019ve done scenes before where we\u2019ve had nothing to support us and it\u2019s so stressful,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t have any qualms, mainly because of how sensitively it was handled \u2013 like we have an intimacy coordinator at all times. We spent a lot of time in preparation for those scenes.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/25/normal-people-intimacy-coordinator-works-sally-rooney-sex-scenes\">intimacy co-ordinator</a> was Ita O\u2019Brien, who also worked on the BBC adaptation of Sally Rooney\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/12/the-stakes-were-really-high-bringing-sally-rooney-normal-people-to-tv\">Normal People</a></em>. For all that it is being hyped as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\">#MeToo</a> drama, Essiedu rejects the idea that <em>I May Destroy You</em> is \u201cpandering to a zeitgeisty type thing\u201d. Obviously, he says, \u201cit\u2019s a series that confronts and challenges our current ideas around sex and consent and romance, and our responses to trauma as well. But a lot of it is inspired by things that have actually happened.\u201d In 2018 Coel spoke out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/aug/22/actor-and-writer-michaela-coel-speaks-out-about-sexual-assault\">about being assaulted</a>. \u201cMichaela is jumping from a place of authenticity,\u201d Essiedu continues. \u201cShe captures the reality of lives that I recognise.\u201d</p> <p>At a time when London has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/london-life-lockdown-coronavirus-social-distancing\">in lockdown</a> for several weeks, the teeming hang-outs and unguarded intimacies of those lives seem to belong to a far-off era. Bearded and keen to chat in his south London flat, where he has been keeping himself in shape with yoga and running, Essiedu says he\u2019s also been having \u201cinsane dreams\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05f9b622dd7de5081d3a5334f2e7104db2cf23fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05f9b622dd7de5081d3a5334f2e7104db2cf23fe/0_196_7152_4293/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Essiedu, left, with Michaela Coel in I May Destroy You.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Essiedu, left, with Michaela Coel in I May Destroy You.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Natalie Seery/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was co-starring in a three-hander, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/01/pass-over-paapa-essiedu-kiln-love-loss-chianti-riverside-tin-drum-coronet-high-table-bush-review\">Pass Over</a></em>, at London\u2019s Kiln theatre, when the curtain came down on live performance. Now, when many young actors are wondering whether they will ever work again, the 29-year-old is being beamed into the nation\u2019s living rooms from several directions.</p> <p>His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/mar/27/hamlet-rsc-stratford-paapa-essiedu-observer-review\">award-winning </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/mar/27/hamlet-rsc-stratford-paapa-essiedu-observer-review\">Hamlet</a></em>, from 2016, is being <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p089zf8r/culture-in-quarantine-shakespeare-hamlet\">streamed on iPlayer</a> by the Royal Shakespeare Company. He has also been cutting a dash as Alex, smooth-talking son of a gangland boss, in Sky Atlantic\u2019s horribly compelling <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/26/the-week-in-tv-after-life-gangs-of-london-emergence-have-i-got-news-for-you-and-more\">Gangs of London</a></em>.

As two black students at London\u2019s predominantly white Guildhall School of Music and Drama, he and Coel would often work together and, for their final showcase, performed a duologue that Coel knocked up for want of anything that suited them in the college library. \u201cIt was set on a basketball court, which was a bit of a risk since we were performing in a West End theatre,\u201d he says. For all that the ball did at one point bounce off into the audience of agents and casting directors, it clearly demonstrated his star quality. Within months he had joined the RSC for a small speaking part in <em><a href=\"https://www.rsc.org.uk/blogs/pathways-to-shakespeare/paapa-essiedu\">The Merry Wives of Windsor</a></em>, and two years later he proved his Shakespearean mettle by stepping up midway through a performance to play Edmund to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/apr/18/its-a-horrible-time-why-simon-russell-beale-fears-for-future-of-theatres\">Simon Russell Beale</a>\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jan/27/king-lear-national-theatre-understudy\">King Lear</a></em>, after Sam Troughton, whom he was understudying, lost his voice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9153c2766f9a1849ab179dca6780dcb8efb5aad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9153c2766f9a1849ab179dca6780dcb8efb5aad/197_336_7067_4239/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gangs of London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paapa Essiedu and Joe Cole in Gangs of London.

Reports at the time acclaimed him as the RSC\u2019s first black Hamlet \u2013 which he dismissed as a backhanded compliment, preventing him from being evaluated simply as Hamlet.</p> <p>Some pointed out that he too was carrying the burden of having been orphaned young \u2013 his father died in Ghana when he was 14 and his mother, a fashion and design teacher who brought him up alone in the east London suburb of Walthamstow, succumbed to cancer when he was still at drama school. \u201cThat is something I do carry with me, but you\u2019ve got to remember that at the end of the day it\u2019s still acting,\u201d he says. He doesn\u2019t belong to the school of method acting. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so self-indulgent as to see it as a means of me digesting my own guilt,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/mar/13/paapa-essiedu-hamlet-royal-shakespeare-theatre-stratford-interview\">Essiedu</a>, \u201cbut of course everything I do is informed by what has made me what I am, so there are levels of empathy.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I grew up in a single-parent, low-income family \u2013 kids who went on holiday to Center Parcs seemed the fanciest thing in the world.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Whereas <em>I May Destroy You</em> is fiercely contemporary, <em>Gangs of London</em> is rooted in colonial history. The gang at its centre is an alliance of Irish and African-Caribbean dynasties whose patriarchs \u2013 we learn in a grand funeral set piece \u2013 teamed up in defiance of notices proclaiming \u201cNo blacks, no Irish\u201d. Both Essiedu\u2019s Alex and Sean, played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/jul/01/joe-cole-actor-interview-i-was-ready-to-deliver-a-kicking\">Joe Cole</a>, are grappling with what it means to be sons and heirs, and both notably speak in RP accents very different from those of their parents. In one quietly revealing scene, Alex\u2019s young nephew is dropped off at what is clearly a private prep school.</p> <p>It\u2019s a reflection of a parental ambition that powered Essiedu\u2019s own childhood.

In <em>I May Destroy You</em> there\u2019s a moment when a chat-up alights on the \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d question. \u201cIt depends who\u2019s asking,\u201d says Kwame\u2019s date. \u201cIf it\u2019s a black person, I\u2019m from Nigeria.

I grew up in London but that culture is in my blood.\u201d</p> <p>One result of this mixed background is an ability to code-switch between different linguistic cultures, which electrified his Hamlet, creating a prince who is also a rude boy.

Legislation passed last year by Donald Trump requires the US to sanction officials as undermining Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy. It also requires the US to revoke favourable trade status granted to Hong Kong.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt looks like, with this national security law, they\u2019re going to basically take over Hong Kong,\u201d O\u2019Brien told NBC. \u201cAnd if they do\u2026 [secretary of state Mike] Pompeo will likely be unable to certify that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy and if that happens there will be sanctions that will be imposed on Hong Kong and China,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>O\u2019Brien said the city\u2019s attractiveness as a business and finance hub would also suffer. </p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how Hong Kong could remain the Asian financial centre that it\u2019s become if China takes over,\u201d he said, adding that global corporations would have no reason to stay.</p> \n<p>Last week, Hong Kong\u2019s main stock index dropped 5.6% as details of the looming law were released while countries around the world condemned the decision. The laws, to be directly added into Hong Kong\u2019s de facto constitution without consideration by the local legislature, would allow for Beijing to install \u201cnational security agencies\u201d in the city.</p> \n<p>On Sunday, the Hong Kong government said that criticism from \u201cforeign politicians\u201d of the decision \u201csmacks of double standards and hypocrisy\u201d. In a statement released late Sunday as police continued to detain demonstrators protesting against the measure, the government said: \u201cThe vast majority of law-abiding Hong Kong residents, including overseas investors, have nothing to fear.\u201d</p> \n<p>In response to questions about investor confidence in the Asian financial hub, Chinese foreign minister Wang said: \u201cInstead of becoming more worried, people should have more confidence in the future of Hong Kong.\u201d</p> \n<p>Wang said the laws \u201cwill improve Hong Kong\u2019s legal system, bring more stability, stronger rule of a law and a better business environment\u201d.</p> \n<p>Beijing\u2019s decision has further worsened US-China ties, already at record lows as Washington claims China is to blame for the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<p>Describing the national security laws as a \u201cdeath knell\u201d for Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and political freedoms, the US has threatened to revoke the territory\u2019s special economic and trade status. On Sunday Wang said: \u201cIt is unfortunate a political virus is also spreading in the US, jumping at any opportunity to attack and slander China. There are those in the US pushing the two sides to the brink of a new cold war.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is time for the US to give up its wishful thinking of changing China or stopping 1.4 billion people\u2019s historical march toward modernisation.\u201d Wang said China would \u201cemerge stronger, more confident ... in our nation\u2019s unstoppable march to rejuvenation.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Many experts are warning that this pandemic will leave a legacy of mental health issues. But these warnings sometimes seem vague. If you want to know exactly what this might mean, your own family history could be the place to start. </p> <p>Mine is probably typical in showing how the psychological legacy of an epidemic can last for many generations. But my history also suggests that living with quarantine and lockdown has been much more a part of social experience than we perhaps realise.</p> <p>Like many under lockdown, I\u2019ve been doing a bit of idle digging and delving into family ancestry. Mainly, I was looking to clear up one or two little mysteries. As a child, I had been the repository of my grandmother\u2019s memories and had always wanted to see if I could put names and dates to her stories. There was, for example, the question of her youngest brother, Sidney, news of whose death in 1915 in the First World War was as vivid for her in her 90s as when she first heard it as a young woman. But had he really volunteered at 15 and his body never been found?</p> <p>Another question was about my grandmother\u2019s daughter, Constance, my father\u2019s baby sister. My grandmother had told me sadly how she\u2019d died of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/mar/31/lessons-from-the-1918-spanish-flu-pandemic-podcast\">Spanish flu</a>, but I didn\u2019t know at what age. All I knew was what my father told me. He\u2019d been playing with his toys outside her room when the doctor had emerged to tell them she\u2019d died. He said he\u2019d felt terrible guilt that he\u2019d been lost in his game and hadn\u2019t thought of her. I\u2019d always wondered whether this had been a factor in his own melancholy, his persistent guilt about things he hadn\u2019t done and his generalised anxiety. The ancestry research confirmed she died aged three, when my father was eight, a loss that would have been traumatic for a young boy. And it was certainly a loss that shaped the family dynamic. The next year, my grandmother gave birth to another daughter, my aunt, over whom she hovered, fussed and imbued with timidity until her dying day.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>My father\u2019s experience of his sister\u2019s death left him chronically anxious, fearful of where the next disaster would strike</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Had this background anxiety of pandemic been a factor when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/polio\">polio</a> epidemic struck in the 1950s? Was it the reason my father injected so much terror into the disease even though the epidemic was largely under control by the time I came along? I can remember as a small child, walking with my parents in areas that, to this day, I still think of involuntarily as \u201cthis is where you catch polio\u201d. Maybe we were passing these places when I was questioning my parents about the children with callipers at my primary school. Maybe he gave me details of what the disease did (infecting the spine and muscle wasting). I remember he said it was in the soil, but that was probably his euphemism for faeces. What he did give me was a pretty deep-rooted fear of contagion and a lifelong commitment to frequent hand-washing.</p> <p>Contagious diseases were pretty much the stuff of my childhood. Most of the big illnesses \u2013 German measles (now considered mild), measles and mumps \u2013 all required quarantine. Children were often away from school for long periods, kept at home for over a fortnight, so there was no risk of spreading to other children. Written at an earlier period, in the 1930s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/arthur-ransome\">Arthur Ransome</a>\u2019s <em>Winter Holiday</em> immortalised the issue of quarantine. The children are quarantined and unable to return to boarding school when their friend Nancy, \u201ccaptain of the Amazons\u201d, develops mumps and is confined to her bedroom. For the most part, anxiety was pretty palpable. I remember my mother considering it lucky that I\u2019d got away with a few spots for chicken pox while my siblings had been covered. \u201cNone of the marks and all of the immunity,\u201d she said triumphantly.</p> <p>Some might be inclined to interpret my experience as indicating how these epidemics are part of the natural cycle that we\u2019ve always lived with. Those people assume most children find ways to deal robustly with the pervasive anxiety. And it\u2019s true that many children, given reassurance, can emerge without psychological damage. Patrick Cockburn\u2019s remarkable <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n09/patrick-cockburn/diary\">account</a> (in the <em>London Review of Books</em>) of catching polio during the epidemic in Cork is a powerful evocation of the fears and uncertainties of that epidemic but also an account of a child overcoming anxiety. But my memories suggest that epidemics that leave vague but powerful anxieties can cast a long shadow. My father\u2019s experience of his sister\u2019s death left him chronically anxious, fearful of where the next disaster would strike, and this was particularly acute around his children. I wish I could say I shrugged it off. But the truth is I picked up a lot of his anxiety, as any child does with an anxious parent. This is why <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52295894\">mental health charities and psychiatrists</a> are saying there is an urgent need to monitor the \u201cprofound\u201d effect on people\u2019s mental health \u2013 now and in the future.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/italy-lockdown-mental-health-psychologists-coronavirus\">Italy's lockdown has taken heavy toll on mental health, say psychologists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s something particularly difficult about losing someone in an epidemic. It\u2019s often sudden and frightening, and it\u2019s depersonalising. Your individual tragedy is just one of many and there\u2019s little comfort in being a statistic. In this current epidemic, with the restrictions around grieving and funerals, it means that you are also deprived of personal agency, unable to sort out rituals for your own comfort or to shape the narrative around saying goodbye.</p> <p>Recently, a friend\u2019s father died of coronavirus. She was unable to be with him and has been suffering from depression since. How many people are there like this, haunted by the lonely deaths of relatives and friends in care homes and hospitals? Or families of care workers and doctors distressed by what they\u2019ve seen? How many children are imagining the disease and what it did to their loved ones? It\u2019s hard to imagine that, without help, they won\u2019t carry this anxiety forward.</p> <p>If I still feel the legacy of the Spanish flu epidemic in how it shaped my family dynamic, it seems likely that unless the mental health issues are given proper prominence now, as we attempt to recover, this epidemic too will be carried far into the future.</p> <p>\u2022 Ros Coward is an author and journalist whose books include <em>Female Desire</em> and <em>Speaking Personally: the Rise of Confessional Journalism</em></p>",

The technology does not yet exist to track and trace the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser to ensure that he is complying with the lockdown rules that the rest of the country has been drilled to obey.</p> <p>Since his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/22/dominic-cummings-durham-trip-coronavirus-lockdown\">rule-breaking was revealed</a>, there has been a wave of demands for the resignation of Dominic Cummings and it is likely to grow stronger after today\u2019s additional allegations. This much is common ground and undenied by Downing Street. He left his family home when his wife had coronavirus symptoms and he feared he had contracted the disease, which it turned out he had. They travelled a long way: London to Durham is not a trip to the local shops for essential items. His Durham-based parents, both in their seventies, are in a high-vulnerability age group. That was a breach of the rules on lockdown which the entire nation was expected to obey on penalty of being found in transgression of the law. The government instructions which he had a hand in drawing up were not vague, but crystal in their clarity. If any member of a household has symptoms, \u201cdo not leave your home for any reason\u201d.</p> <p>Number 10 has been trying to bat off the demands for his resignation by depicting this as a human story, deserving of our compassion, in which worried parents needed help with childcare. They took a suspiciously long time to weave together this defence. The official statement was only issued after 10am on Saturday. That was more than 12 hours after the story broke, which is a very long time to produce a response to such a major development in the age of 24/7 media. The statement says that he and his wife made the long road trip because, \u201cowing to his wife being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell, it was essential for Dominic Cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for\u201d. </p> <p>I\u2019m not convinced that this defence will attract the public sympathy they hope for. Other Britons have faced similar agonies during a lockdown that has presented tough, sometimes heartbreaking dilemmas for many, many people. The rules are nevertheless clear. Anyone with reason to believe they have Covid-19 has to quarantine in their main family home for 14 days. The rules are clear for a reason. They don\u2019t work if people feel free to choose to make themselves exceptions, however much they may think they deserve to be. No infected household, however mighty or modest their status, was supposed to be making 264-mile trips to live somewhere else. The government\u2019s slogan was \u201cStay At Home, Save Lives, Protect The NHS.\u201d It was not \u201cStay At Home (Unless You Are Dom), Save Lives (Not Compulsory For The Prime Minister\u2019s Top Aide), Protect The NHS (At Your Own Discretion If You Work In Downing Street).\u201d</p> <p>The chief medical officer of Scotland was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/05/scotland-chief-medical-officer-seen-flouting-lockdown-advice-catherine-calderwood\">impelled to resign </a>for a lesser breach. Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College professor, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-adviser-prof-neil-ferguson-resigns-after-breaking-lockdown-rules\">forced to quit </a>the Sage advisory group when it was revealed that he had flouted the rules by having his lover visit him at home. \u201cThe right decision,\u201d said the health secretary, Matt Hancock. Public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the epidemic is badly corroded when key figures behave as if the rules apply to everyone but themselves. When trust, so absolutely essential to the handling of this crisis, is abused and diminished, the public loses faith in the calibre and integrity of decision-makers.</p> <p>Were we talking about anyone other than Mr Cummings \u2013 were we talking about a less powerful figure than the tea cosy-wearing Rasputin of Number 10 \u2013 he would be gone already. He survives only at the indulgence of his employer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Were we talking about anyone other than MrCummings, he would be gone already</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So what started as a significant revelation about the chief adviser is already evolving into an even more important story about Boris Johnson and his premiership.</p> <p>There was some surprise among Tories when Mr Cummings, a figure previously most closely associated with Michael Gove, was given such a sweeping role at Number 10. The explanation was that Mr Johnson had been impressed with the demotic energy and mendacious but effective messaging that he had brought to the Leave side of the Brexit referendum. He went up further in the prime minister\u2019s estimation by crafting the ultimately successful brinkmanship strategy that Number 10 employed during the bitter battles over Brexit during the last parliament. </p> <p>Since the Tories\u2019 majority-winning election result last December, Mr Cummings has amassed a vast amount of clout. Though he has not won every battle that he has started, he has made himself one of the most powerful unelected figures ever to work at Number 10. He instigated the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/sajid-javid-resigns-as-chancellor-amid-boris-johnson-reshuffle\">resignation of a chancellor </a>earlier in the year when Sajid Javid found his demands too humiliating to bear. One former cabinet minister recently complained to me: \u201cCummings has complete contempt for parliament and for the cabinet whom he regards as shit.\u201d He is the architect of a \u201chub and spokes\u201d design for government which is circulating within Whitehall and intended to make all ministers subordinate supplicants to an all-controlling centre run by him from Number 10 and by Mr Gove from the Cabinet Office.</p> <p>There was a hot controversy when it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/revealed-dominic-cummings-on-secret-scientific-advisory-group-for-covid-19\">revealed </a>that the chief adviser had been attending meetings of Sage, the body under the chairmanship of Sir Patrick Vallance, which is tasked with delivering dispassionate scientific counsel to the government. Some scientists on the committee actually welcomed his presence, on the basis that this was the only way to get their advice transformed into policy. They reported that only Mr Cummings could be guaranteed to seize the undivided attention of an easily distracted prime minister who is not renowned for his devotion to detail. That is a measure of his power. That is also an illustration of how dependent Mr Johnson has become on him.</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s first reflex will be to try to brazen this out. He will be cross about the furious cyclone that is now raging around Mr Cummings, but he won\u2019t be personally mortified that his chief adviser didn\u2019t follow the government\u2019s instructions. The prime minister\u2019s own biography is littered with examples of a cavalier attitude towards norms of behaviour. Rules are for other people \u2013 not for Boris Johnson. That has been one of the guiding principles of a life not otherwise distinguished by many principles. His own biography is also rich with examples of blunders and scandals that he has survived simply by refusing to be shamed by them. So his first desire will be for the storm to blow itself out after 48 hours or so.</p> <p>But if it doesn\u2019t? This prime minister is also a ruthless calculator of where his personal advantage lies. He will be weighing how much damage this furore could do to him if it doesn\u2019t quickly subside. This story broke at the end of what was already the government\u2019s worst fortnight of the crisis. Number 10 has been forced to perform a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/johnson-forced-to-drop-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">U-turn</a> on imposing \u201cNHS surcharges\u201d on foreign-born health workers, a reverse more hateful to the prime minister because he was forced into it after the leader of the opposition pursued him on the issue. Plans for a partial reopening of schools have collided with resistance from teachers and parents. </p> <p>The grim death toll in care homes and fresh concerns about the government\u2019s ability to deliver on tracking and tracing have contributed to a febrile mood among Tory MPs. Many of them will celebrate if Mr Cummings is defenestrated from Number 10. They resent his swaggering power, they hate the ill-disguised disdain with which he treats them, and they would be delighted to see him gone. As we enter the delicate and perilous process of easing out of the lockdown without reigniting the epidemic, public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the emergency has turned negative for the first time since the crisis began. Confidence is not likely to be restored by the revelation that the prime minister\u2019s closest adviser has been breaking the rules.</p> <p>Another thing the life of Boris Johnson tells us is that his only core commitment is to himself. Journalistic colleagues, fellow politicians and wives have all found that there is no such thing as the undying loyalty of this prime minister. However important you may be to him for a time, you will become dispensable when he decides you have outlived your usefulness.</p> <p>Dominic Cummings will have the full support of Boris Johnson. Until he suddenly doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u2022Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

She\u2019s due to give her weekly \u201crave lesson\u201d on fellow BBC Radio 1 presenter Nick Grimshaw\u2019s teatime show (today\u2019s subject: the week-long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/15/castlemorton-triggers-rave-crackdown\" title=\"\">Castlemorton party</a> of 1992).

They just had their second wedding anniversary. He\u2019s inside homeschooling their sons, who are three and six. Occupying them is a challenge, says Mac, who is 41. \u201cIt\u2019s about recalibrating your expectations rather than trying to genuinely be a teacher. Let\u2019s learn how to cook pasta or do a jigsaw or make a bird feeder out of a milk bottle.\u201d I\u2019m taking up most of Mac\u2019s two-and-a-half-hour working slot before they have to swap. Cramming in her workload is tough. She\u2019s bare-faced, her curls untamed. But paring back has been good, too \u2013 the fantasy of a more streamlined life forced into being. It suits her. \u201cI basically have three tiers of what I do in my work,\u201d she says, with the same zippy authority she brings to her shows, \u201cand it\u2019s really simple and it\u2019s really clear and it\u2019s very regimented, and it means that when you have work, you just fucking blitz it.\u201d</p> <p>In 2015, Mac took over from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/16/zane-lowe-apple-bbc-london-radio1-la\" title=\"\">Zane Lowe</a> to present Radio 1\u2019s flagship specialist show, five nights a week.

Then there\u2019s fronting a podcast, and writing her first novel, due out next year. That\u2019s just what\u2019s on at the moment. Earlier this year, she ran her Annie Mac Presents conference \u2013 a week of industry panels and new music gigs in London. In non-pandemic times, there would be even more: running a festival in Malta (inevitably cancelled), and DJing other summer events.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://podtail.com/en/podcast/finding-annie/\" title=\"\">podcast</a> is the reason for our chat. Two summers ago, Mac turned 40. She had been presenting on Radio 1 for about 15 years. For the first time, she found herself looking back on her life, although her \u201cdecimated\u201d memory made it hard. She started a podcast, Finding Annie, to reassemble her past from conversations with friends and peers, which helped. The loose concept introduced her to a new set of listeners unlikely to tune into Radio 1 on weekday nights, and ordained some fairly standard celeb-on-celeb chat, if admirably frank \u2013 like Mac telling Radio 2\u2019s Sara Cox about how indignant she felt at having to push her placenta out of her already \u201cred raw frazzled vagina\u201d during her first birth.</p> <p>Podcasting, says Mac, was about exploring self-expression and having something that was entirely her own, although the Finding Annie format had a shelf-life. After two series, she has renamed it <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/changes-with-annie-mac/id1465937091\" title=\"\">Changes with Annie Mac</a>, and pushed its focus outwards. In each episode, she asks a guest to share the childhood and adulthood changes that shaped them.</p> <p>\u201cYou can get to the really meaningful moments in a quick way,\u201d she says. There are celebs: Caitlin Moran on learning not to hate her body as an adult; Swedish popstar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/28/how-robyn-transformed-pop-music-honey\" title=\"\">Robyn</a> on how the next change she\u2019s anticipating is parenthood. But there are civilians, too: a formerly homeless man-turned-<a href=\"https://www.shelter.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Shelter</a> worker named Paddy; Candice Brathwaite, a rare working-class, black author in the \u201cmummy blogging\u201d world; an 18-year-old knife crime campaigner named Jhemar Jonas, whose brother was fatally stabbed.</p> <p>\u201cHaving spent a year or two really listening to podcasts, there seems to be an echo chamber,\u201d says Mac wearily. \u201cIt\u2019s everyone telling each other the same things, and they all have the same beliefs and the same politics and the same everything.\u201d She wanted to let people who have experienced genuine hardship talk on their own terms, an impulse confirmed by the episode with Jonas. \u201cYou never hear from the kids,\u201d she says. \u201cThe people who are brandishing the knives or running from the knife. It\u2019s the idea of humanising them and trying to understand them in order to be able to help them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4de16b7acbdb735e41daf8bdb9b89fc3b1c0958c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4de16b7acbdb735e41daf8bdb9b89fc3b1c0958c/133_264_2619_3272/800.jpg\" alt=\"Power of three: from left, Annie Mac, Jo Whiley and Sara Cox, Brit Awards, 2011.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Power of three: from left, Annie Mac, Jo Whiley and Sara Cox, Brit Awards, 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Young/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not that the celebrities are bait; her curiosity is genuine there, too. Nick Grimshaw tells me she gets the best out of everyone: \u201cShe never feels in a rush \u2013 she makes you feel like you\u2019re really important to her.\u201d But the podcast is a Trojan horse for her to delve into \u201cthe things that I\u2019m trying to figure out\u201d, she admits. \u201cAfter looking backwards for a while, now I want to look forwards and outwards, to see what really moves me, and what I could put my time into in the next phase of my life.\u201d</p> <p>Let\u2019s talk about the ways in which she\u2019s changed. \u201cOh shit, I have to do the thing?\u201d she says, surprised. Her holey memory has made childhood a blur. (An expert told her lack of sleep exacerbates memory loss: \u201cMy weird working hours for so many years have probably not helped this.\u201d) So she starts at 17. Mac \u2013 then MacManus \u2013 always thought she\u2019d be an actor. She doesn\u2019t know why. She didn\u2019t take drama at school, though she\u2019d starred in a school play, and practised her Oscar acceptance speech. But she auditioned for the drama course at Trinity College in Dublin anyway, and \u201ctotally fucked it up, like in a comedy way\u201d, she says. \u201cHad to do the speech from the end of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, went into paralysis, couldn\u2019t remember the words, was just so angry with myself.\u201d</p> <p>Afterwards she went directly to a hairdresser\u2019s and had her bum-length hair cut to an inch long, \u201ca very visceral reaction to my own failure\u201d. She once said a boy calling her \u201cmediocre\u201d at school was the worst thing anyone had ever said to her. It seems like she had roaringly high standards. \u201cMaybe I did,\u201d she says, quizzically. She was surrounded by high-achieving friends at the private Wesley College, though she doesn\u2019t think school had much to do with her confidence or aspirations. As the youngest of four kids born in five years, she had to strive to stand out. \u201cI was quite comfortable in chaos and noise from a young age, because I didn\u2019t really have much choice.\u201d</p> <p>The rejection was pivotal: Mac didn\u2019t know what to do until her mum suggested applying to study English literature at Queen\u2019s in Belfast. She got in. Leaving Dublin for Belfast was a game-changer, she says. \u201cI found radio and I found music.\u201d She moved to Farnborough, Hampshire, for an MA in radio before settling in London.

In retrospect, playing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lovebox-festival\" title=\"\">Lovebox</a> six weeks after having her first son was stupid, she says. \u201cNot knowing how you\u2019re going to feel, because you\u2019ve got no experience of motherhood \u2013 I found that really hard. I\u2019m a control freak, so I like to know where I stand.\u201d<br>She kept DJing after having her second kid, driving to and from gigs in one night so she could wake up at home. On the motorway one night last year, she became overwhelmed by the feeling that she was putting herself in danger, so she cut back. Weekends are her only opportunity to put her kids to bed, so she only takes gigs that allow her to do that. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more factors at play than just ambition.\u201d</p> <p>She squirms when I say she\u2019s one of the most influential women in British music and ask if that brings a certain degree of assurance. Thinking that way is bad for your decision-making process, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not what drives me at all.\u201d Creativity does, she\u2019s learned recently. Writing her first novel came out of a \u201cdesire to create something for art\u2019s sake\u201d. She insists it\u2019s the Radio 1 show that\u2019s influential, and whoever does it after her will inherit that influence. \u201cAnd let \u2019em have it,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me, the radio is about music and connection, that\u2019s what makes me wanna drive into town every day.\u201d</p> <p>But she uses her power in other ways. Label heads have credited her conferences with making them think differently about their artists\u2019 mental health. She\u2019s always vocal about the annual issue of gender inequality on music festival bills. (Though she\u2019s not combative towards the industry: \u201cThat\u2019s not how it\u2019s going to work.\u201d) Musician and podcaster Jessie Ware rang Mac for advice on managing a career as a mum.

The negative response to the song was eye-opening, she says. So were requests for her to comment further. \u201cIt\u2019s not about that,\u201d she despairs. \u201cIt\u2019s about speaking to the people who are suffering racism every day and can talk about it in a very eloquent way, in the way that Dave did.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5a47f4bc40087e28905e6d5a97da8f34382e9817\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a47f4bc40087e28905e6d5a97da8f34382e9817/296_1032_5659_7074/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We are finding new ways to be together\u2019: Annie Mac.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We are finding new ways to be together\u2019: Annie Mac.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephanie Sian Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This spring, Mac tweeted her support for the victims of Bristol grime artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/solo-45-the-grime-star-with-a-horrific-secret-life-of-abusing-women\" title=\"\">Solo 45</a>, who was charged with imprisoning and raping four women. She is an ardent rap fan, and questioned how her show should address explicitly misogynist forms of rap music. It\u2019s a historically complex issue, especially for a white woman to weigh in on. Did she feel any trepidation? It wasn\u2019t that she was telling anyone \u201cyou guys have got to change\u201d, she says, with a panto finger wag. \u201cIt\u2019s the idea of there being representation from all sides. I want to hear more women rapping, talking about what it\u2019s like to be a woman, how much they wanna shag men or other women or whatever.\u201d The point, with everything she does \u2013 podcast guests, festival line-ups \u2013 is to leverage her profile to expand the playing field.</p> <p>Radio 1\u2019s demographic is listeners aged 15 to 29. There\u2019s no doubting Mac\u2019s at home there. She is a brilliant broadcaster: excitable and compassionate; knowledgeable yet never exclusive or showy. But recently she\u2019s started to think about her future there. \u201cI\u2019m always very aware that Jo Whiley left Radio 1 when she was 43,\u201d she says. \u201cBut Jo was doing the mainstream daytime show, so you\u2019re much more visible there. The lovely thing about Radio 1 is that as a specialist DJ \u2013 Annie [Nightingale], John [Peel], Pete Tong, Tim Westwood \u2013 it\u2019s definitely not as much of a problem what age you are. It\u2019s very much a spirit thing and how young people relate to you.\u201d She loves her show and has no plans to leave, but she\u2019s curious about exploring what the BBC has to offer: \u201cYou\u2019re lucky in that you can grow old there.\u201d Equally, the Changes podcast is stretching her legs.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I like fishing.

I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever heard another woman say that. It\u2019s a feeling that\u2019s strengthened with age. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt, I dunno, touch all the wood\u201d \u2013 she pats her desk and head \u2013 \u201cpretty good about my existence, basically.\u201d Her husband says she\u2019s made of steel.

The first thing she wants to do once lockdown ends is go to Ireland. \u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming trying to figure out when I\u2019m gonna see my family again,\u201d she says. Getting sweaty in a club would be nice, too. I remember reading that she\u2019s into fishing and wonder if she has plans to go angling in the summer. That\u2019s something she did as a kid, she laughs, a reputation that stuck after she did a <em>Culture Show</em> bit about gender inequality in the field. \u201cBut I do like fishing,\u201d she says, thinking about it. \u201cI like not knowing what\u2019s under there, the whole feeling of anticipation. And I\u2019m an optimist, so it suits me \u2013 it\u2019s the idea of always hoping there\u2019s something on the other end of the line.\u201d</p> <p><em>Changes with Annie Mac is available on all podcast providers</em></p>",

It was studied in three clinical trials, but despite compelling and transparent scientific evidence, it failed. By contrast, hydroxychloroquine was backed only by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/16/hydroxychloroquine-how-did-an-unproven-drug-become-trumps-miracle-cure\">limited lab tests and case reports</a>.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, Orient argues hydroxychloroquine should be available over the counter. Concerns from scientists have \u201cnothing to do with concerns about safety and concerns about science\u201d, she argued. Her view that lockdowns are \u201cdespotic, tyrannical and completely unwarranted\u201d, and will probably also cause consternation in many circles.</p> \n<p>But on some subjects, all can agree: \u201cOur pandemic preparedness on the whole has been lousy.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In 1939, Jules Konopinski escaped the Nazis \u201cby the skin of my teeth\u201d when he fled to the UK as a nine-year-old boy. Eight years later, he found himself fighting fascism with his fists and boots on the streets of London, despite a world war that had supposedly defeated the scourge of nazism for ever.</p> <p>Konopinski, now 90, joined the 43 Group, a guerrilla army of British-Jewish ex-servicemen and others that waged physical battle against the far right in the aftermath of the war. \u201cThe enemy hadn\u2019t gone away,\u201d he told the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>It took four years to see off the postwar fascists. The group disbanded 70 years ago next month, and now there are only five members still alive: Konopinski, Harry Kaufman, Jerry Kaffin, Gerry Abrahams and Martin White.

By that time, he had lost nine uncles and aunts in the death camps. \u201cThen we saw the revival of something we thought we\u2019d killed off in the war,\u201d he said.

  "<p>Over the last two months, Islamic State has carried out a series of large-scale and coordinated attacks in parts of Syria and Iraq. The spike in attacks has renewed fears about the group\u2019s resurgence, a year after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/23/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-isis-caliphate\">collapse </a>of its physical caliphate in eastern Syria and only six months after the killing of its former leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/27/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-obituary\">Abu </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/27/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-obituary\">Bakr al-Baghdadi</a>. The heightened activity is especially worrying because the conditions that have made it possible appear set to worsen in the coming months.</p> <p>Isis has never ceased attacks in the two countries since the loss of its territories, but the recent operations are particularly bad news. Aside from the attacks, for example, reports from the ground consistently suggest that the group has had greater visibility and mobility this year in villages and suburbs across Iraq and Syria.</p> <p>The way in which some of the attacks were conducted also indicates that the group has access to information about troop movements and individuals it seeks to target. Such trends are usually early signs that the group has established roots, carved out space for itself and built the infrastructure necessary to launch attacks.</p> <p>This recovery is recent, and follows at least a year of weakness in both countries, due to the loss of Isis centres in Mosul and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/17/raqqa-recaptured-from-islamic-state-us-backed-forces-announce\">Raqqa </a>and the intense military campaigns against it. This weakness reached its lowest point with the killing of Baghdadi in October. The group seemed unable to carry out revenge attacks for the killing of its self-proclaimed caliph, or to exploit significant openings such as the US announcement that it was withdrawing its troops from Syria, which was followed by Turkey\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/us-withdrawal-from-syria-leaves-fate-of-isis-fighters-and-families-in-detention-uncertain\">invasion </a>of parts of the north.</p> <p>Warnings that such events would open the door for the group to re-emerge did not transpire. Several months later, though, the group rebuilt its capabilities and became more active \u2013 the most active since the collapse of its caliphate. This time lag between decreased pressure and the ability to rebound matters because it reveals precisely how Isis could be put back in its box.</p> <p>It took Isis some time to regenerate because the sustained military pressure against it had prevented it from quickly seizing clear openings such as the chaos that followed the American withdrawal \u2013 which was later reversed \u2013 and the Turkish invasion. The pressure had been building steadily against Isis since the recapture of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/iraqi-kurdish-forces-recapture-mosul-dam-isis\">Mosul </a>in 2017 and Raqqa in 2018, and the US-led forces largely focused on clearing operations in abandoned villages, mountains and deserts to ensure a more enduring defeat of the organisation. It would have been hard to contain the organisation had it been \u201cready\u201d to attack when such opportunities presented themselves in October.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b1d51fe83cd9be0913c3a6e95a409916d0b53df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b1d51fe83cd9be0913c3a6e95a409916d0b53df/0_248_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Afghan security forces with arrested alleged Isis fighters on 10 April 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Afghan security forces with arrested alleged Isis fighters on 10 April 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noorullah Shirzada/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The steady pressure was disrupted by a chain of events in both countries, paving the way for Isis to return. The initial US withdrawal from Syria caused its allies on the ground, the Kurdish-dominated forces, to seek the help of Russia and the regime in Damascus to prevent Turkey from taking over. Even after the US reversed its decision to withdraw, part of the third of Syria previously controlled by the international coalition became shared with the Russians. The damage was already done, as the international mandate against Isis shrank in both territory and influence.</p> <p>In Iraq, too, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/27/iraq-protests-aim-topple-regime\">mass protests</a> in Iraq in October triggered several events and raised the political temperature in the country. The protests in central and southern Iraq forced the government to resign and led to political stagnation that lasted until two weeks ago, when political parties agreed on a new prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/iran-iraq-khadimi-control-middle-east-suleimani\">Mustafa al-Kadhimi</a>.</p> <p>The protests, which sometimes included an anti-Iran tone, also added to the tensions between the US and Shia forces in the country. Attacks and counter-attacks, by the US and Iranian proxies, ultimately led to the killing of the Iranian general <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/making-of-a-martyr-how-qassem-suleimani-was-hunted-down\">Qassem </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/making-of-a-martyr-how-qassem-suleimani-was-hunted-down\">Suleimani </a>and the prominent Shia militia leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/abu-mahdi-al-muhandis-iraq-iran-militias-suleimani\">Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis</a>.</p> <p>Despite what seemed like a perfect storm, Isis could not expand its influence until recently. The earliest notable attack happened on 9 April, between the group and Syrian regime forces near Palmyra in the Syrian desert. The attack appeared sophisticated, as the group ambushed regime forces and clashed with them for several hours. Later that month, Isis conducted several attacks in Kirkuk, Diyala and Salah ad-Din. Such attacks included the attempted storming of the counter-terrorism and intelligence directorate in Kirkuk, and several coordinated attacks in Salah ad-Din. The attacks were among the most sophisticated in years.</p> <p>Isis clearly benefited from the security vacuum and decreased pressure in both countries. As Isis establishes a foothold, it soon becomes hard to weaken it without deeper international engagement. Renewed tactical operations might force it underground but it will not dismantle its networks, because that process requires a patient counter-terrorism strategy that seemed to exist a year ago.</p> <p>The recovery of Isis is still new and fragile, and so could be easily reversed if the pressure is restored. However, the problem is that the current trends seem more favourable to Isis than to local forces. Tensions between the US and Iraqi forces also make it harder for the two partners to work in harmony as they did during the fight against Isis in places like Mosul. The US has already withdrawn from several tactical bases in western and central Iraq, in the very areas in which it recently carried out attacks.</p> <p>In other words, the chances for further Isis recovery are increasing as the odds decrease for a tougher crackdown led by the US. This pattern is what makes the current phase particularly dangerous. If the pattern continues in the coming months, Isis is likely to become a far greater threat that will be much harder to contain than it is now.</p> <p>\u2022 Hassan Hassan is the director of the non-state actors and geopolitics programme at the Center for Global Policy thinktank, and co-author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>ISIS: Inside the Army of Terror</em></p>",

Some are also worried they might lose business if clients go to another stylist during the restrictions.</p> <p>Despite this, many are hopeful that it will not be too long before they can open their doors and correct some of the home jobs that have not gone to plan. However, Metcalfe thinks these clandestine cuts might be a taste of what the industry will look like from now on.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a luxury service any more where you spend three hours in the salon having a cup of tea and a natter.

  "<p>Sir Alan Ayckbourn, one of Britain\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/alanayckbourn\">most admired living playwrights</a>, has predicted that live entertainment will be the sector hardest hit and slowest to recover in Britain, with theatres seen as among the least safe environments in which to spend time.</p> <p>Ayckbourn is watching in sadness as the pandemic crashes down upon the business he made his life\u2019s work. His many plays, hits such as <em>Chorus of Disapproval</em>, <em>The Norman Conquests</em>, <em>Bedroom Farce</em> and <em>Absurd Person Singular</em>, have filled West End theatres with a judicious mix of high comedy and sensitive observation since the early 1970s.</p> <p>\u201cTheatre is one of the last places that is going to get back to something like normal,\u201d the 81-year-old playwright and director told the <em>Observer</em> this weekend. \u201cIt relies precisely on gathering people in one place. That is what it is. A theatre is an intimate space. If you want to catch a germ, then a small theatre built in the round, like the <a href=\"https://www.sjt.uk.com/\">Stephen Joseph Theatre</a> in Scarborough, the place I\u2019m most associated with, is the perfect place. If you want to have a wonderful theatrical experience, it is a wonderful place for that too, of course.\u201d</p> <p>In response to an appeal from Paul Robinson, the current artistic director at Scarborough (Ayckbourn himself was 37 years in the hot seat), the playwright has now not only produced a new play for audio broadcast but has gone back to acting after a 56-year break to appear in a cast of two beside his wife, Heather Stoney.</p> <p>He was happy to help and he had a play, <em>Anno Domino</em>, already waiting on the back-burner, but Ayckbourn holds out little hope for live theatre in the short term.</p> <p>\u201cPeople may have gone back to the theatres quickly after plagues and diseases since the Middle Ages, but they didn\u2019t have Netflix then did they? There was not much else to do,\u201d he said.</p> <p>If there are any chinks of light ahead, then Ayckbourn believes they lie in the direction of public curiosity about hearing fresh voices and seeing something new. \u201cSeeing new work will be very important,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the thing that keeps theatre going. It is lifeblood.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0011637a8290304313852828ed0df318b58daf3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0011637a8290304313852828ed0df318b58daf3/0_208_6240_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Bartholomew</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the playwright stepped back from running the venue after suffering a stroke in 2006, he still produces a stream of work for its loyal audiences. This week he was due to be in rehearsals with the cast of another new work, <em>Truth Will Out</em>: \u201cI am missing the process of getting a play ready desperately. I would have been in rehearsal now and was due to have two plays on this season. One old, one new.\u201d</p> <p>And the theme of that other new play gives cause for some wry laughter. \u201cIt is about the collapse of society, but I got the wrong virus,\u201d he said. \u201cMine was a computer virus that eventually brings down the national grid.\u201d</p> <p>When the Stephen Joseph Theatre suddenly went dark this spring Robinson asked Ayckbourn to help fill the void by writing a short monologue, but this did not appeal. \u201cInstead I suggested to Paul that Heather and I do a play together here and I saw his eyes light up because the theatre needs anything it can to draw attention to itself now. We need to say we\u2019re still here.\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fabe2590a1c33af116eff19eb59af7941ff6bd72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fabe2590a1c33af116eff19eb59af7941ff6bd72/1637_0_1321_1652/800.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Ayckbourn and his wife Heather Stoney in their garden at home in Scarborough.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Ayckbourn and his wife Heather Stoney in their garden at home in Scarborough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Bartholomew</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Anno Domino</em>, Ayckbourn\u2019s 84th play, looks with humour at the impact of a failing marriage and he and Stoney play four different characters each. \u201cIt was a play I\u2019d started some years back, but it kept getting gazumped by other plays,\u201d he explained</p> <p>And it is only Ayckbourn\u2019s history as an all-rounder, doing the sound for all his own shows, that has made the project possible: \u201cI recorded on a fairly basic system, but I could multitrack which was fun and allowed all the voice overlaps. The main trouble we had was differentiating the sound of the characters. I did use pitch control a little on teenagers, but the older couple and the middle-aged people were no problem for us.\u201d</p> <p>Ayckbourn is perhaps most famous for work set in the domestic or suburban world, something that might seem to make him especially suited to this challenge. After all, his linked 1999 pair of plays <em>House &amp; Garden</em> ran simultaneously on the same night on two stages, with the same actors switching between audiences. But some of the new audio locations are more adventurous and include a restaurant and a cafe. Stoney was also once an actor but stepped back a mere 35 years ago.</p> <p>\u201cHeather was very sweet and has taken second place, partly because she was sitting next to the author, who was also planning to direct, so I had the advantage. I had also spoken it all out as I wrote, which I usually do,\u201d said Ayckbourn.</p> <p>But the experience has not persuaded him to return to acting when audiences can be persuaded to take their seats again: \u201cI always enjoyed acting, but one thing I didn\u2019t miss when I stopped was having to go into the theatre in the evening. When I wrote my first play I realised I had the evening free. I went round the corner to the pub instead, but then I got a bit worried about how it might all be going and went in.\u201d</p> <p><em>Anno Domino</em> <em>is available for free as an audio play on the Stephen Joseph Theatre website for a month from 25 May.</em></p>",
  "<p>\u2018To speak about the meaning and value of life may seem more necessary today than ever.\u201d It\u2019s a quote that might have been plucked from any number of op-eds over the past couple of months. It\u2019s in fact the opening sentence of a 1946 lecture by psychotherapist and Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl.</p> <p>The previous year, Frankl had still been incarcerated in Auschwitz. Now he was giving a series of talks in Vienna about what his experience of Nazi death camps had taught him about the human condition. Those lectures have just been published in English for the first time as <em><a href=\"https://www.penguin.com.au/books/yes-to-life-in-spite-of-everything-9781846046360\">Yes to Life in Spite of Everything</a></em>. Frankl\u2019s is a voice that seems as necessary now as it was in the shadow of the Holocaust.</p> <p>Shortly after the lectures, Frankl published the book for which he has become celebrated \u2013 <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/09/viktor-frankls-book-on-the-psychology-of-the-holocaust-to-be-made-into-a-film\">Man\u2019s Search for Meaning</a></em>. In it, he argues that in order to survive the concentration camps one had to be able \u2013 even in the most degrading of circumstances \u2013 to find meaning in life. \u201cEverything can be taken from a man but one thing,\u201d Frankl wrote, \u201cthe last of the human freedoms \u2013 to choose one\u2019s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one\u2019s own way.\u201d</p> <p>Frankl\u2019s stress on the importance of one\u2019s attitude, whatever the circumstances, has turned him into a guru of positivity and self-help. At the heart of his philosophy, however, was not mindless optimism but responsibility. \u201cMan should not ask what the meaning of his life is,\u201d Frankl wrote, \u201cbut rather must recognise that it is he who is asked.\u201d</p> <p>Frankl was born into a Jewish family in Vienna in 1905. It was a city of intellectual and political ferment, graced by such towering figures as Freud and Wittgenstein, Popper and Schoenberg, Carnap and Klimt.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is humans, and humans alone, who imbue the world with meaning</p> <footer> <cite>Viktor Frankl</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The city was also deeply polarised, a seedbed for fascism and communism. In 1934, the far right seized control of Austria, shutting down parliament and banning the social democrats, of whom Frankl was one. Four years later came <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1938/mar/14/leadersandreply.mainsection\">Anschluss</a>,</em> the German annexation of Austria. In 1942, Frankl\u2019s entire family was transported to concentration camps. His parents, wife and brother all perished in the Holocaust.</p> <p>Frankl\u2019s philosophy was shaped by what came to be called \u201cexistentialism\u201d. For existentialists, humans do not possess an unchanging essence from which our capacities, personalities and values derive. Rather, humans create themselves, and their nature, by acting upon the world. Humans, the French existential philosopher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/22/jean-paul-sartre-refuses-nobel-prize-literature-50-years-books\">Jean-Paul Sartre </a>wrote, are \u201ccondemned to be free\u201d; condemned because we have no choice but to make choices.</p> <p>Frankl\u2019s experience of the death camps reinforced his existentialist views. It was here, he insisted, when almost everything worthwhile had been torn from people, and everything done to dehumanise them, that it was most important to find value and meaning in life. Those who survived were the ones best able to do so.</p> <p>The significance of Frankl\u2019s work lies not in his positivity or optimism but in his insistence that it is humans, and humans alone, who imbue the world with meaning. There is no external authority to whom we can turn to help us decide notions of right and wrong, good and bad. We can rely only on ourselves.</p> <p>Yet, if existentialism\u2019s strength lies in its insistence on the importance of freedom and responsibility \u2013 and on the necessity of making choices \u2013 its weakness stems from its difficulties in relating individual agency to our existence as social beings. We all live as part of communities and societies. It is through the social bonds we make with others that our individuality emerges.</p> <p>Meaning, too, is social as much as it is individual; the very ideas of \u201cfreedom\u201d, \u201cresponsibility\u201d or \u201cthe individual\u201d make sense only in specific social contexts. Existential arguments often seem as if individual choice and responsibility have been unstitched from the rest of the architecture of our lives. It leaves them open to be purloined by both libertarian ideas of the market and psychologies that obsesses with the self.</p> <p>Difficulties in understanding the relationship between the individual and the social is an issue not just for existentialists. It is one of the key problems facing western societies today. Whether immigration or free speech, the pressing questions of recent years have been fundamentally about how individual rights and social needs can be reconciled. So, too, have many of the controversies over coronavirus policy, from the debate over lockdown to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/15/when-will-schools-reopen-uk-children-safe-coronavirus\">question of when schools should reopen</a>. It\u2019s a good time to engage with both the strengths and weaknesses of Frankl\u2019s existentialism and to rescue it from those who can see the individual but not the social.</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",
  "<p>As a botanist, I am fascinated by the growing body of scientific evidence of the powerful and positive impact that simply being around plants can have on mental and physical health. From reducing healing times in hospitals to helping control pain and anxiety, spending time in nature can constitute an important therapeutic tool for many people, especially in the current situation.</p> <p>However, amid continuing lockdown, for many of us escaping on a forest walk or to a country park is difficult to achieve. For city flat dwellers like me, getting time with nature can be even tougher, just when we need it the most. So here are three simple ways in which anyone can benefit from the great outdoors, without needing to leave your front door.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c6d9ed45f27046dcd17c1888e0b7631bfcb1c2fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6d9ed45f27046dcd17c1888e0b7631bfcb1c2fb/0_0_3133_4700/667.jpg\" alt=\"Purple reign: lavender will thrive almost anywhere.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Purple reign: lavender will thrive almost anywhere.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aleksandr Volkov/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The interesting thing about the research linking green space with positive health outcomes is that it shows you don\u2019t even need to be physically out in nature for this to work. One of the earliest studies, for example, looked at the recovery rates of patients undergoing gall bladder surgery in hospital. It compared those who were in beds with a green view from their window with those who looked out on to a brick wall. By all measures, the \u201cgreen view\u201d group faired considerably better, with benefits including a reduction in signs of mental distress by as much as 80%.</p> <p>One of the easiest and cheapest ways to do this is with window boxes. They can be either inside the window with a trough of low-maintenance cacti and succulents, or outside on the ledge with some cheerful bedding plants.</p> <p>According to the evidence gathered so far, the benefits of being in nature are probably the result of several factors, including not just visual stimuli but other senses, too, such as smell and taste. We know, for instance, that many plant scents, such as lavender, have been repeatedly demonstrated to have a positive impact on health, reducing both subjectively reported feelings, such as anxiety, and objectively measured ones, like heart rate. Lavender also happens to be one of the balcony and patio plants that is the easiest to grow and maintain. Its Mediterranean origins mean it can handle baking sun and drought stress.</p> <p>Indoors, you could go for an option like gardenia, whose scent compounds have been shown in some of the early research to have a similar effect to Valium. While much more research needs to be done, I challenge anyone to have a gardenia on their bedside table and tell me they don\u2019t derive pleasure from drifting off to its scent.</p> <p>Finally, let\u2019s talk edibles. With fancy citrus houseplants, you get the best of all worlds \u2013 beautiful, glossy leaves all year round, powerfully scented flowers and tasty fruit. With Italian bergamot or Japanese yuzu, even if they only give you five pieces of fruit a year, that\u2019s 25 fancy margaritas from fruit which is rarely available in the shops. And all this from plants that are as easy to grow as a common lemon or orange. </p> <p><em>Follow James on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Botanygeek?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@Botanygeek</a></em></p>",

Jordan\u2019s own trajectory from baby-faced amateur to larger-than-life symbol to latter-day myth is exhaustively retold through a stylish blend of archival footage, present-day interviews and spare-no-expense soundtrack.</p> <p>Lengthy segments are, however, devoted to the other principals in Jordan\u2019s orbit: Scottie Pippen, the famed wingman and lone constant aside from Jordan on all six of Chicago\u2019s title teams; Dennis Rodman, the free-spirited, hard-partying rebounding machine; Phil Jackson, the hippie-mystic head coach whose triangle offense helped unlock the team\u2019s potential.</p> <p>But the star of the piece is Jordan, who after all these years remains both overexposed and mysterious: at once the most prominent cultural reference point the United States has ever produced and something of a recluse who has spoken only sparingly about the Bulls\u2019 imperious reign and still-mystifying break-up at the height of their powers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s maddening because I felt like we could have won seven, I really believe that,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cWe may not have, but man, just not to be able to try, that\u2019s something that I just can\u2019t accept.\u201d</p> <p>Before what proved to be the team\u2019s last season together \u2013 a sixth and final championship run \u2013 Jordan allowed the NBA\u2019s in-house entertainment division to film what became more than 500 hours of behind-the-scenes footage of them with the condition that it could only be used with his explicit consent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdf06ef77a38c203b444006a88c8802606b9d0fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdf06ef77a38c203b444006a88c8802606b9d0fd/0_0_5353_3569/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Barack Obama presents the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Michael Jordan at the White House in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Barack Obama presents the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Michael Jordan at the White House in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Harnik/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It does bear mentioning that Jordan\u2019s own production company is among the co-producers behind the project and he retained final cut and editorial control. Even while introducing the less pleasant elements of Jordan\u2019s legacy \u2013 his bullying and tyrannical proclivities with teammates and well-documented gambling problem (or, as he puts it, a <em>competition</em> problem) \u2013 the warts are exposed in order to be smoothed over. We are left with the unshakeable sensation that we are seeing Jordan as he wants to be seen.</p> <p>But if history is written by the winners, then Jordan\u2019s participation in his own hagiography is fair play, especially if the alternative meant the unseen footage that comprises the narrative spine of <em>The Last Dance</em> would have remained locked away in the league\u2019s New Jersey vault.

Watching this 57-year-old man grapple with his legacy out loud, whiskey in hand, and<a href=\"https://streamable.com/uxvwy1\"> weigh in on decades-old scores</a> makes for compelling theatre \u2013 to say nothing of the countless<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBCSBulls/status/1262211100701048833\"> memes</a> it has spawned.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b39dc27d4803e73c525c36cb6486c67224ebeed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b39dc27d4803e73c525c36cb6486c67224ebeed/0_0_2048_1462/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Jordan smiles at a press conference in Chicago to announce his retirement in 1999.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Jordan smiles at a press conference in Chicago to announce his retirement in 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sue Ogrocki/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jordan\u2019s peerless on-court performance is matched only by his business acumen, which <em>The Last Dance</em> unpacks by way of his influence on urban culture and effective launch of what has become sneaker culture. He earned a relatively modest $90m (\u00a374m) in salary over the course of his 15-year NBA career \u2013 with about $63m coming in his final two seasons with the Bulls \u2013 yet became the world\u2019s first billionaire athlete by selectively aligning himself with brands like Nike, Gatorade, Hanes, McDonald\u2019s and Upper Deck. He was ever conscious of the idea that his image became diluted the more it was used. In a time when the titans of sports and entertainment routinely bypass traditional channels to control the narrative through their own production companies or friendly platforms, Jordan was years ahead of the game.</p> <p>The film does make gestures toward placing Jordan\u2019s legacy in a broader context, relying on no less than a former president and fellow Chicago icon for authority. \u201cThere are great players who don\u2019t have an impact beyond their sport,\u201d Obama says. \u201cAnd then there are certain sports figures who become a larger cultural force. Michael Jordan helped to create a different way in which people thought about the African-American athlete. A different way in which people saw athletics as part of the entertainment business. He became an extraordinary ambassador, not just for basketball, but for the United States overseas as part of the American culture sweeping the globe. Michael Jordan and the Bulls changed the culture.\u201d</p> <p>But <em>The Last Dance</em> deftly resists the temptation to overreach and remains centred on Jordan\u2019s first and only concern: the pursuit of perfection and wholesale domination of his rivals. At a time when the games that bring us together have been put on indefinite hold, it\u2019s no surprise people flocked to the next best thing \u2013 even if they know how the story ends.</p>",

Instead of communal prayers at mosques or in the open air, large gatherings of family, friends and neighbours, and outings to enjoy special street lights and festivities, many of the world\u2019s two billion Muslims will be in lockdown. Some countries have imposed curfews, and religious authorities have told people to pray at home.</p> <p>In Iran, the centre of the pandemic in the Middle East, there has been a fresh surge in Covid cases since the government began lifting restrictions, allowing people back to work in mid-April and to communal prayers at mosques in the first week of May.</p> <p>Critics said moves to reopen the economy had been made before critical benchmarks indicatingthe spread of the disease had been brought under control were met. Official Covid figures \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/iran/\">7,300 dead and almost 132,000 infected</a> \u2013 are widely thought to be an underestimate, and the government has been criticised for its response to the outbreak, which began in mid-February.</p> <p>Since the new surge in cases in a number of provinces, including Tehran, the president Hassan Rouhani cancelled Eid prayers led by Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. But he has permitted prayers to be held outside some mosques with physical distancing.</p> <p>Last week health minister Saeed Namaki appealed to Iranians to avoid travelling during Eid. \u201cSuch trips mean new cases of infection \u2026 people should not travel to and from high-risk areas,\u201d Namaki said.,.</p> <p>\u201cSome 90% of the population in many areas has not yet contracted the disease.

The government has urged people to act responsibly over the country\u2019s six-day Eid holiday, but has not announced any special precautions.</p> <p>Celebrations were expected to be muted anyway after a plane crash in Karachi on Friday which killed at least 97 people. Flight PK8303 had been carrying many families travelling for Eid when it plunged into a residential neighbourhood near Jinnah International airport.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has ordered a 24-hour curfew over Eid, an extension to the current overnight curfew between 5pm and 9am.

  "<p>So perhaps, if we stay alert and follow Mr Johnson\u2019s absolutely infallible multicoloured plan, the shops will open soon. I don\u2019t know how I feel about that. On the one hand, I have missed ferreting through the TK Maxx beauty aisle, sorting the brand-name wheat from the quixotically named chaff (so many unlikely doctors selling moisturiser!) then entering a fugue state and emerging with a yoga block, some bath salts and four bags of nearly expired cantucci biscuits.

Since the panic buying subsided, I\u2019ve shopped in the ways I always knew I should: making careful lists, planning meals and staying local. Some intriguing alternative networks have sprung up around food, in particular, mixing old and new. A tip from an acquaintance about a wholesaler selling online transformed my stepfather into the yeast king of his street, doling it out to all comers. A weekly email sends me to a car park where a man in a van hands over foraged greens, local eggs and rhubarb on tick. A different man leaves an Eccles cake on your doorstep at 3pm if you DM him at 9.30am sharp.

Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned about my consumption.</p> <p>You can have too much mustard. Restaurant catering businesses have \u201cpivoted\u201d (definitely a word of the year) to selling retail, but catering volumes are vaster than you realise: I accidentally acquired several litres of Dijon mustard and a mountain of \u201cluxury\u201d nuts. We eventually finished the nuts, but the mustard will outlive me.</p> <p>Some kinds of shopping just don\u2019t work online. I want to poke at plants, and stationery is a tactile thing \u2013 the smell of fibre tips and the heavy grain of fancy paper. More generally, I can\u2019t impulse-buy on a website as I do in lovely shops, seduced by clever displays and cool music into emerging with a tasteful tea towel and some \u00a312 jam. My bank balance thanks me for it.</p> <p>Restaurant food is nice because of restaurants. Over-subscribed, aspirational meal delivery kits are the new bourgeois thirst trap. Devote your week to refreshing a dodgy website and you might snaffle one of these prized parcels, but you could still be disappointed: a restaurant meal out of a plastic box in front of <em>Pointless</em> is less appealing than an evening in an actual restaurant. I like the gyoza from my favourite Japanese, but what I really loved, it turns out, was the K-pop soundtrack, the buzz, and the strangers. God, I miss strangers.</p> <p>You\u2019ll buy one thing over and over again. Mine is butter: I can\u2019t walk past a pack of butter without buying it. This is what happens when a child is raised on Flora: in adulthood they\u2019re powerless in the face of Big Dairy.</p> <p>The unlikeliest purchase might be the best. Sure, if you managed to acquire hair clippers that\u2019s fun, and your family now looks like the bastard offspring of Sideshow Bob and Arthur Shelby from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/peaky-blinders-episode-by-episode\" title=\"\">Peaky Blinders</a></em>. But the real sleeper hit here was an electric \u201cmassage gun\u201d, bought in desperation for my son\u2019s 18th birthday. Unbranded, it came in a black case like an assassin\u2019s kit, with no instructions other than the weary plea: \u201cDo not use on genitals.\u201d Once assembled, however, it became our favourite distraction, passed from hand to hand, whirring and thudding with pleasurable pain. While we\u2019re all pretzelled into unergonomic spaces, take it from me, the massage gun is the new pasta.</p> <p><em>Follow Emma on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BelgianWaffling?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@BelgianWaffling</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Almost all of us will have missed out on something important in the last few weeks. My lockdown low was missing my niece\u2019s first birthday, a virtual singalong no substitute for a real cuddle. But celebrations and holidays can be postponed; children and young people are missing out on rites of passage they will never get back: their last day at primary school with the class they\u2019ve grown up with; the end of GCSE and A-level parties; their final term at university.</p> <p>Autumn is unlikely to herald a return to normality. Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/19/cambridge-university-moves-all-lectures-online-until-summer-2021\">Cambridge Universit</a>y announced that it was moving all of its large-group teaching online for the whole of the next academic year; others are likely to follow. So many of the events that make up university life will also have to likely go: freshers\u2019 fairs; sports, music and drama; student parties. Little wonder that one in five prospective students say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/20/uk-universities-facing-760m-hit-one-in-five-students-plan-defer\">they are considering deferring</a>.</p> <p>There has so far been no sign of a fee reduction; most full-time students in England will still be paying the maximum \u00a39,250 a year in tuition. It\u2019s hard not to sympathise with this take from a second-year student: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/20/very-very-upsetting-students-face-tough-decisions-over-university\">We\u2019re paying a lot of money to jump on a Zoom call</a>.\u201d Because repayment of student debt is income contingent and written off after 30 years, <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/R162-Education-spending-in-England-2019.pdf\">the government will end up </a>contributing around 45% of the cost of each cohort\u2019s tuition over their lifetime, possibly more depending on the length and depth of the recession. That\u2019s scant consolation, though, for a young person about to graduate in a fearsomely hostile labour market, facing decades of monthly repayments once they start earning above the threshold.</p> <p>But if it is rough to be contemplating a first year peppered with virtual lectures and minus a freshers\u2019 week, it is worse still to be a school leaver not going to university, who has lost their last term and had to make do with predicted A-level or BTec grades. These young people get a raw deal at the best of times: while university students\u2019 education and living costs are subsidised to the tune of \u00a325,000 on average, most of them don\u2019t get a fraction of that. </p> <p>They also get none of the state and institutional support with the social transition to adulthood that those going away to university do: the relatively frictionless glide into student accommodation followed by a house share; the mental health services and pastoral care; the self-discovery opportunities of student social life. No extended adolescence awaits them: too often a move straight into work that lacks training opportunities and prospects for progression, while feeling their own way towards independent living, with profound impacts for social inequality. Their situation has become immeasurably tougher now they are contending with a labour market where far more people are losing jobs than getting them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Elite universities are allowed to claim too much credit for the success of their graduates</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So we should not lose sight of the fact that, while all young people are being failed by this pandemic, they are not being failed equally. It never ceases to astound me that we spend 18 years of a child\u2019s life trying to unpick the impact of socioeconomic disadvantage through the education system, only to throw huge sums at a system that entrenches class privilege from 18 onwards. </p> <p>It\u2019s not just the huge gap in what the state invests in those who do and do not go to university (<a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/R162-Education-spending-in-England-2019.pdf\">a gap that Labour\u2019s plans to scrap tuition fees</a> would make even bigger), but the fact that the university system itself \u2013 for no overriding educational reason \u2013 intensely stratifies young people into institutions that are used by employers as shorthand for their potential, supposedly based on their academic ability, but in reality far too much as a product of their social background. This then allows elite universities to claim too much credit for the success of their graduates, at least some of which is the inevitable result of only letting the most upwardly mobile students through the door. It is a topsy-turvy disgrace of a system that a widening participation initiative here and there can never hope to do enough to fix.</p> <p>There is a good case for government mandating a fee rebate for this generation of students, and bailing out those universities that need it as a result. (Although Cambridge, which emailed staff last week to warn of potential pay reductions if it does not get the government support it is seeking, should not be first in line: the university and its colleges have a combined wealth of almost \u00a312bn and its vice-chancellor\u2019s remuneration package is almost half a million a year.) But at a minimum, the government should set aside a pound for training for young people not going to university for every pound it spends doing that.</p> <p>Even better, this crisis could prompt us to rethink the way we do post-18 educational and social transitions. We could, for example, invest in a universal and residential rite of passage that gives all young people the chance to move out of home with pastoral support, mix with people from different backgrounds and build up skills: a six-month paid civic service scheme that sends an army of young people to mentor children in schools, put on social activities for older people in hospitals, care homes and community centres, and undertake environmental projects, while also providing them with coaching and professional development. That might even reduce the importance of going away to university and help create a less elitist system where more people live at home and commute to their local university, at least for the first year or two of their degree.</p> <p>Too radical to countenance? My warning would be that in a world where education level is fast becoming the new political divide we urgently need to address the fact that the very design of the post-18 system magnifies social inequalities rather than reduces them. The paradox of coronavirus is that it is children whose health it puts least at immediate risk, but whose long-term prospects it most profoundly jeopardises. It would be a monumental injustice if we sought to alleviate those effects for some young people while ignoring others.</p> <p>\u2022 Sonia Sodha is the Observer\u2019s chief leader writer</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Jarvis Cocker\u2019s uplifting playlist <br></strong>\u2026 for raising the spirits</h2> <p>Cocker and his partner, Kim, have been keeping their spirits up during lockdown by doing domestic discos <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jarvisbransoncocker/?hl=en\">on Instagram Live</a>. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go for the uplifting music, haven\u2019t you?\u201d, Cocker says from his home outside Sheffield. \u201cThe world\u2019s on pause, after all.

  "<p>Parents are divided over the prospect of sending their children back to school, a new poll has revealed, as parent groups warned that mixed messages and poor communication had caused widespread anxiety about returning.</p> <p>With school leaders still grappling with the practicalities of reopening primary schools for some year groups in just a week\u2019s time in England, an Opinium poll for the <em>Observer</em> found that 43 per cent of primary school parents and 54 per cent of secondary school parents feel anxious about the prospects of returning.</p> <p>Primary schools have been instructed to prepare to bring back reception, year 1 and year 6 classes, as well as their early years provision. However, councils of all political colours have suggested they will not follow the advice, while Welsh and Scottish schools will wait to reopen.</p> <p>There are now also concerns that the return of pupils has become such a chaotic issue that it could worsen the attainment gap between affluent and poor areas and families. Some teaching unions have suggested the families of vulnerable children have been more reluctant to see them return to school. David Laws, the former education minister who now oversees the Education Policy Institute, said that a widening divide was a \u201csignificant risk\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Parents are not convinced about messages around schools being safe.

Some want the certainty of keeping children out of school until there is a vaccine, which may reflect families with underlying conditions. Then you have other parents that want a clear timeline.</p> <p>\u201cParents are not convinced about messages around schools being safe. They are not sure about that message from the government, or that the evidence for that is being communicated. There is a lot of uncertainty about the message being communicated by schools locally.\u201d</p> <p>Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, warned the situation on the ground was now \u201cchaotic and increasingly untenable\u201d. \u201cNot only are school leaders having to think about how to reopen schools, but how they convince parents that their children should go back, and organise the school site. Then they don\u2019t know how many staff they will have. Schools are vital for society. But they have to be safe.\u201d</p> <p>However, professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said schools should be allowed to reopen. \u201cCovid-19 generally barely affects children and young people and actually we\u2019ve shown that they are about half as susceptible,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s <em>Today</em> programme. \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind for children themselves, the balances are clearly in favour of going back to school.\u201d He said the risks to family and the community could be managed with an effective track and trace system and a phased return.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/reopening-schools-1-june-logistical-nightmare-teachers--coronavirus\">Reopening schools on 1 June will be logistical nightmare, say teachers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While a working track and trace system is seen as necessary for rules around schools and other parts of the lockdown to be loosened, several local government sources warned that councils were now facing a race against time.

They are there for all aspects of public health, working on things like HIV, hepatitis, pandemic flu. Disease control is their job. They are highly skilled \u2026 but they\u2019ve been cut out in quite a strange way.</p> <p>\u201cOther countries have deployed local resilience forums for testing and tracing. A national contact centre is never going to get to the granular detail you need for contact tracing. I\u2019ve been out with the people who do it \u2013 they are forensic.

  "<p>Curtis Sittenfeld\u2019s new novel, <em>Rodham</em>, is a reimagining of the life of Hillary Rodham Clinton and it\u2019s a wilder ride than that pitch might suggest. I kept losing track, as I read, of what kind of novel it was and of whether or not I approved. The first third, cleaving roughly to reality and Bill and Hillary\u2019s early years at Yale Law School and in Arkansas, includes a lot of feverish, Black Lace-type sex scenes featuring much cupping of scrotums and \u2013 apologies for the image this will provoke \u2013 the phrase \u201chis erection inside me\u201d.</p> <p>The second, a meditation on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/04/rodham-curtis-sittenfeld-hillary-without-bill-clinton-novelist\">experience of a single woman in politics</a>, follows Hillary back home to Chicago after she walks out on Bill. Finally and most surprisingly, in the last third of the book, <em>Rodham</em> becomes a kind of revenge fantasy for women who sublimate their own ambitions for the sake of their husband\u2019s careers, at which point I had to tip my hat to Sittenfeld. I went into the novel thinking the entire premise was crass and came out of it thoroughly entertained.</p> <p>Haters of Hillary Clinton won\u2019t read this book, which is, of course, part of the point. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/16/american-stories-curtis-sittenfeld\">Rodham</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/16/american-stories-curtis-sittenfeld\"> is Sittenfeld\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/16/american-stories-curtis-sittenfeld\">sixth</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/16/american-stories-curtis-sittenfeld\"> novel</a> and a faint echo of <em>American Wife</em>, her novel of 2008, in which she imagined the life of a first lady much like Laura Bush, an excavation that entailed slightly more effort than it was worth. <em>Rodham</em> is a different beast, focusing on someone so reviled and over-analysed that, by reputation, at least, she has ceased to be human. I don\u2019t hate Hillary, but I have had enough of her, or so I thought. The first surprise of the novel is how gripping it is; the second is how worthy its protagonist is as a subject for fiction.</p> <p>The author\u2019s sympathies are clear from the opening pages, in which she revisits Hillary\u2019s first encounter with public life, when, as a student graduating from Wellesley in 1969, she went rogue during her speech and, to the horror of the university authorities, told off the conservative senator who had spoken before her. The speech made national news and the novel sets it up as a kind of question: how did that 21-year-old firebrand, staring down convention, become known as a corporate shill and feminist sell-out, loathed by elements of the left as much as the right?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The charge sheet of slurs, many of them misogynist, is a shadow text to the novel: 'frigid', 'cold', 'mercenary', 'unlikable'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For a real answer you should go to Hulu\u2019s recent excellent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViAAwc0BtiE\">four-part</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViAAwc0BtiE\"> documentary about Hillary</a>, in which former staffers and friends talk about the warping effect of spending decades as the only woman in the room (and, later, on the debate stage). The joy of Sittenfeld\u2019s novel, of course, is that, with the monstrous presumptions of fiction, it imagines what being inside that reality might have been like.</p> <p>You can see why the author went overboard with the sex scenes. There is a shadow text behind <em>Rodham</em>, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/15/america-hillary-clinton-misogyny\">the charge sheet of slurs, many of them misogynist</a>, that the real Hillary has put up with for her entire career and which the novel seeks to dismantle. The first is \u201cfrigid\u201d. No frigidity here! The same goes for \u201ccold\u201d, \u201ccalculating\u201d, \u201cmercenary\u201d and \u201cunlikable\u201d, all of which Sittenfeld tackles with a shrewd eye for the way women in public life are held to impossible standards. Every scene that humanises Hillary is compared, in the reader\u2019s mind, with the reality of her image, along with events as they really happened. In the novel, Hillary leaves Bill at the first whiff of infidelity, but it is one of the book\u2019s strengths that, by implication, it explains why the real Hillary might have stuck with him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2eeeee047f0876903be362e964d3476f889a23ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eeeee047f0876903be362e964d3476f889a23ab/0_0_3250_4800/677.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton in 1969\" width=\"677\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton in 1969.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Balterman/The Life Picture Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The answer, in Sittenfeld\u2019s rendering, is that she straight-forwardly adored him \u2013 and he, her. The depiction of Bill Clinton is in some ways more satisfying than that of the novel\u2019s protagonist. He is drawn by Sittenfeld as capricious, self-indulgent, talented but not brilliant, and also attracted to Hillary as to nobody else. \u201cI knew plenty of smart people, but I\u2019d never before encountered a person whose intelligence sharpened mine the way his did,\u201d thinks our heroine after meeting Bill and the love story, if you can get over the slightly grim sense of prurience hanging over it all, is credible.</p> <p>What is more fascinating is the conclusion drawn by Sittenfeld that, without Hillary, Bill\u2019s political career would not have been viable. From the couple\u2019s earliest days in Arkansas, Hillary was painted as a political liability, a woman who insulted housewives by making fun of their cookie baking and who was stiff and alienating in public. In fact, as the novel contends, when the first of Bill\u2019s many female accusers came out of the woodwork with claims he had harassed them, Hillary\u2019s defence of her husband deflected the blame from him on to her. If, as in the novel, Bill had married a more demure and conventional political wife, he would have taken more heat for his infidelities. As it was, everyone decided to hate Hillary.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/22/curtis-sittenfeld-melania-trump-short-story-collection-you-think-it-ill-say-it\">Curtis Sittenfeld: \u2018I have declined to write fiction about Melania Trump double digits of times\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is a scarcity of action in the novel, at times, which is nonetheless strangely compelling. In the middle section, pages go by in which nothing much happens other than Hillary hanging out with her friends, feeling the chill of being a single, childless woman when most of her contemporaries are married with kids. The frisson of seeing her in these quotidian settings \u2013 a demonised woman at rest \u2013 is in some ways more captivating than the dramatic passages.</p> <p>A bigger problem is tone, which occasionally slides into the generic nerdy-girl-with-love-problems shtick that has been a weakness of Sittenfeld\u2019s since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/sep/11/fiction.features\">her </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/sep/11/fiction.features\">first novel</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/sep/11/fiction.features\">, </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/sep/11/fiction.features\">Prep</a></em>. As the years go by, Hillary becomes a thoughtful, hard-working, occasionally ruthless career politician, always vilified by the press, often longing for love, while Bill becomes an internet billionaire who is still basically an arsehole.

  "<p>Diana Kennedy has written nine cookbooks. The first, <em>The Cuisines of Mexico</em>, was published in 1972, is several hundred pages long, and has been widely credited with introducing traditional Mexican cooking to the English-speaking world.</p> <p>Kennedy is 97, white, and English \u2013 hardly the ingredients you\u2019d expect to make up a leading authority on Mexican food, but sometimes ingredients surprise you. She lives in the hills of Michoac\u00e1n, four hours west of Mexico City, on a piece of land she bought decades ago. In culinary circles she is adored. The Mexican chef <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/feb/14/foodie-traveller-san-francisco-cala-prisoners\" title=\"\">Gabriela C\u00e1</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/feb/14/foodie-traveller-san-francisco-cala-prisoners\" title=\"\">mara</a> describes her as \u201ca legend\u201d.

For years, Kennedy has travelled across Mexico \u2013 from Chihuahua, in the north, to Yucat\u00e1n, near the borders of Guatemala and Belize \u2013 in order to document its food culture, always with a sense of where she planned to go, but never entirely sure where she might end up. (\u201cThe important discoveries in my life have always happened by chance,\u201d she has said.) When she arrived in a new town, she would visit its food market, and she\u2019d ask the people she met there where they came from and what they liked to cook and how and which ingredients they used. Were they local? Were they imported from another state? Were they farmed or foraged? Later in life she roamed the country in a pickup. (\u201cI wish my trucks could speak out some of the experiences they\u2019ve been through with me.\u201d) But when she first arrived in Mexico she travelled by bus, \u201cwith all the chickens and the pigs\u201d, moving from village to village, region to region, taking great interest in the way food was cooked, the specificities of the recipes to which she was being introduced. She asked question after question. What were the local chillies? What were the local fruits? What were the local herbs? She touched. She tasted. She inhaled \u2013 fragrances as well as knowledge. \u201cAnything to escape,\u201d she says in the documentary, \u201cand to learn.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be95cfc9dfb691a31bf6fb04f9d2da8db43db734\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be95cfc9dfb691a31bf6fb04f9d2da8db43db734/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Down Mexico way: inspecting the produce at a local market.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Down Mexico way: inspecting the produce at a local market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dogwoof</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whenever possible, Kennedy would visit somewhere she had never been before, spending nights in the truck or, when the weather allowed, a hammock. She usually travelled alone. Sometimes she carried a tape recorder, sometimes a pistol. Nothing stopped her; her determination was unyielding. She would drive hundreds of miles in order to check a single fact \u2013 an ingredient, an exact measurement. In the foreword to <em>The Cuisines of Mexico</em>, the late food writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/feb/08/guardianobituaries2\" title=\"\">Craig Claiborne</a>, a close friend of Kennedy\u2019s, wrote, \u201cIf her enthusiasm were not beautiful, it would border on mania.\u201d She travelled compulsively, and she was always forthright and urgent, perhaps a little intrusive. \u201cI wanted to know where people lived. I wanted to learn what the landscape looked like. I wanted to know <em>more</em>.\u201d But people always responded generously. They were fascinated by her fascination. So they invited this odd Englishwoman into their kitchens, and she would stay for hours, or days, or even a week. \u201cI felt at home immediately,\u201d she says, \u201cwherever I went.\u201d She would record recipes faithfully \u2013 the specific ingredients and the precise measurements \u2013 and return to Michoac\u00e1n, laden with local specialities, to recreate them at home. Whenever she published a recipe, she always mentioned where it came from, and the woman who had shared it with her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a7636a5f44a96fb88f60ec0b3d328ab4a591db7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a7636a5f44a96fb88f60ec0b3d328ab4a591db7/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pot luck: trying out recipes at home, where she also held cookery classes for everyone from actors to renowned chefs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pot luck: trying out recipes at home, where she also held cookery classes for everyone from actors to renowned chefs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dogwoof</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kennedy first arrived in Mexico in 1957. She was born in Loughton, Essex, in 1923. After the Second World War she travelled to Jamaica, invited by a friend and \u201cpropelled by lots and lots of hormones\u201d, and then, impulsively, to Haiti. She landed during the revolution, along with several newspaper correspondents, including Paul Kennedy, a reporter with the <em>New York Times</em>. Paul was based in Mexico City. When he returned, Diana followed, \u201cand then began this absolutely fascinating time in love\u201d \u2013 with Paul, and then with the country that was now home. They married, and each time Paul left on a reporting trip, Diana left to explore her new world.</p> <p>Paul died in 1967, in New York, where they\u2019d gone so he could receive treatment for prostate cancer. In Manhattan, Diana felt out of her depth. She didn\u2019t know anyone. She was suddenly forced to hustle. She was \u201cterrifically depressed\u201d. Claiborne, the food writer, suggested she teach Mexican cooking, an idea she at first thought was crazy, but soon she was holding lessons in her apartment, \u201csix people in my little galley kitchen, cooking really traditional food. There was a dress designer, there was an actress. And here I was, teaching them how to make papadzules. I mean, hardly anyone in <em>Mexico</em> knew how to make papadzules. It was fun. It was a start.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK3UMhXQ1co\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JK3UMhXQ1co?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Later, an editor at Harper &amp; Row suggested she write a cookbook, which became <em>The Cuisines of Mexico</em>, and that\u2019s when the work really began. Other cookbooks followed \u2013 cultural studies, really \u2013 and then appearances on cooking shows (Martha Stewart <em>adored</em> her) and then cooking shows of her own. In front of a camera she was formidable: eager to share what she\u2019d discovered in Mexico but also slightly protective of it, and always straight-talking, almost to the point of rudeness. She would growl things like, \u201cPeople say they don\u2019t like cilantro. Please don\u2019t invite them!\u201d Or, \u201cGet some texture into your food. We don\u2019t want baby food all the time.\u201d Or, \u201cYou might not have a molcajete\u201d \u2013 a Mexican mortar and pestle, made of volcanic rock \u2013 \u201cso buy one!\u201d</p> <p>But the real work, the work she adored, was the travelling, using food as a way into people\u2019s lives \u2013 a \u201cdoctoral thesis performed in real time, in real life\u201d. She made the Michoac\u00e1n house her base. She didn\u2019t remarry. She never wanted children. (\u201cI don\u2019t want to bring up a little me. Can you imagine?\u201d). Instead, she gave herself to work. Carroll describes her as \u201can anthropologist of food\u201d who \u201chappens to be a killer cook\u201d. She has received heaps of awards, including the Order of the Aztec Eagle (big in Mexico), and a <a href=\"https://www.jamesbeard.org/awards\" title=\"\">James Beard Foundation Award</a> (big in food land). In 2002, Prince Charles visited Kennedy at her home to appoint her an MBE, for \u201cfurthering cultural relations between the UK and Mexico\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"140f2d207954827255dfbcc2364b32d867081bfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/140f2d207954827255dfbcc2364b32d867081bfd/3_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Get some texture into your food\u2019: gathering produce from her garden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Get some texture into your food\u2019: gathering produce from her garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dogwoof</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Do these things matter to her? It\u2019s not clear. But legacy is important. In a scene from the documentary, Carroll films Kennedy running a cooking camp at her home. Some of the students are accomplished chefs. One owns three restaurants in Manhattan; another has five in Portland. But Kennedy is undaunted. At one point she moans: \u201cIt is absolutely appalling that Mexico is importing chillies,\u201d and admonishes chefs for not taking a stand. Later she half-shouts:\u201cLearn, learn, learn. Read my books and learn. What are you going to do when I\u2019m gone? Who is going to start screaming?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a pressing question. Carroll filmed Kennedy over the course of six years, starting in 2013. \u201cWhen we first met her she was 91, running circles around us,\u201d Carroll says. \u201cShe was like, \u2018Get up, let\u2019s go to the market.\u2019 And we were like, \u2018This woman is three times our age!\u2019\u201d But by the end of filming, Kennedy had slowed, \u201cand you could see it was frustrating for her \u2013 that it\u2019s not the strength and energy she\u2019s been used to her whole life.\u201d When she spoke at a conference in 2013, Kennedy said, \u201cI am 90, so everybody gets very nervous, you see, that I\u2019m not going to be around much longer. So you\u2019ll want to hear all my complaints while I\u2019m alive.\u201d Recently those complaints have involved sustainability. \u201cWe live in such a diverse world,\u201d she says, \u201cand our education is so poor. How many kids at school realise how many insects there are? Millions and millions of different types, each playing their part in this marvellous universe.\u201d</p> <p>I was due to speak with Kennedy over the phone, but the call was delayed, and eventually cancelled. She is 97 now. Perhaps she has done all the talking she needs to do. Her legacy is assured. Her cookbooks are still in print. She is beloved by chefs, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/feb/09/chef-jose-andres-disaster-relief-puerto-rico\" title=\"\">Jo</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/feb/09/chef-jose-andres-disaster-relief-puerto-rico\" title=\"\">s\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s</a>, who calls her \u201cthe Indiana Jones of food\u201d. But \u201cit\u2019s not just rushing in, getting a recipe and coming out,\u201d Kennedy says. \u201cIt\u2019s recreating it in your own kitchen. How do you express this recipe so that people can do it, so that it won\u2019t be lost? God knows I tried.\u201d She adds, \u201cYou can\u2019t win them all. You just go on doing what you know you want to do, and at some point the tide will turn and you make your mark, or you may not\u2026 I\u2019m very honoured the way so many people do look at my books and appreciate what I\u2019ve done. That\u2019s all you can hope for.\u201d </p> <p><em>Diana Kennedy: Nothing Fancy is available to watch on digital platforms now</em></p>",
  "<p>When the Bank of England governor says he is not ruling out a cut in the cost of borrowing to below zero, you know there is trouble ahead.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/what-would-negative-interest-rates-mean-for-mortgages-and-savings\" title=\"\">Negative interest rates</a> are the last resort of the central banker and not to be used unless absolutely necessary. At least that is the thinking inside the forbidding walls of the Bank\u2019s offices on Threadneedle Street. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/uk-economy-to-shrink-by-25-percent-and-unemployment-to-double-warns-bank-of-england-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Only a couple of weeks ago,</a> governor Andrew Bailey said, in effect, that the Bank had never lowered interest rates to below zero and wasn\u2019t going to start now.</p> <p>With the Bank rate standing at 0.1%, it seemed odd to make a distinction between a moderately positive rate of interest and a moderately negative one. But in the world of central banking, such posturing appears alive and well. Only those economies considered weak and feeble go negative. Not the UK.</p> <p>Of course, there was more substance to Bailey\u2019s argument than that. Like his predecessors, he argued that negative rates would put a huge strain on high street banks, which would see their profit margins on lending squeezed. Tighter margins would lead them to accept households and businesses with only the safest credit histories, meaning fewer loans would be granted. Rather than being expansionary, negative rates would lead to a contraction in borrowing \u2013 the opposite of what the central bank wanted to achieve.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The problem lies with savers who are offered negative interest on their savings. What if they refuse to accept this new reality?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/20/uk-sells-government-bond-with-negative-yield-for-first-time-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Last week he changed his tune</a> and argued it would be \u201cfoolish\u201d to rule out such a move. For many economists, Bailey was recognising the magnitude of the current downturn. And, theoretically, there are ways to keep high street lenders safe from harm.</p> <p>Negative rates allow the borrower to pay back less at the end of the term than originally borrowed. Borrowing becomes very attractive, and nervous households that might not have taken a loan to buy a car or new kitchen might go ahead with credit this cheap. If a high street lender can borrow at an even lower negative rate from the central bank, there should be scope to maintain profit margins and stay profitable.</p> <p>The problem lies with savers who are offered negative interest on their savings. What happens if they refuse to accept this new reality? They will take their deposits out of the banks and find another home for them.</p> <p>Gold is the usual safe haven from negative interest rates, but middle-income families are unlikely to start buying bars of the stuff or even derivatives of gold that allow punters to buy and sell more easily. Cryptocurrencies on the other hand \u2013 long seen as an esoteric and volatile form of money \u2013 could take off even more than they have already with mainstream savers.</p> <p>And, deprived of deposits, the high street lenders will then lack the reserves they need to lend, defeating the object of the exercise.</p> <p>In Japan, the central bank has told high street banks not to worry about deposits and other usual safeguards; it has said it will act as the backstop for the entire financial system. The European Central Bank has tried to mimic this stance and been held back from such a wholehearted approach only by the reluctance of Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, which fear underwriting the shaky financial systems of their southern European neighbours.</p> <p>Bailey\u2019s gloomier outlook for the UK \u2013 one that expects a shallower recession but several years of business bankruptcies, higher unemployment and lower investment \u2013 could see the UK follow the Danes, who have sanctioned the high street lender Jyske Bank\u2019s plan to offer negative-rate mortgages.</p> <p>A poll of City economists found that the majority believe the unintended consequences of negative rates in an economy the size of Britain\u2019s will deter the central bank from pulling that particular lever.</p> <p>Let\u2019s hope the final assessment sets aside any notion of national pride and focuses on the real-world consequences. Britain is going to need all the support it can get from its central bank in the next few years.</p> <h2>Air travel\u2019s return will be closely watched</h2> <p>Mandatory face masks at all times, assessments in interview booths if you show Covid-19 symptoms and no goodbyes inside the terminal. Welcome to the unglamorous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/the-future-of-flying-eu-air-safety-body-issues-coronavirus-guidelines\" title=\"\">future of air travel</a>. These were the guidelines issued by the EU\u2019s air safety body last week for travel through airports.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.easa.europa.eu/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/easaecdc-issue-joint-guidelines-assure-health-safety-air-travel\" title=\"\">28-page document</a> is full of instructions that would have sounded outrageous in January: stand 1.5 metres from fellow passengers at check-in, boarding and passport control; no food and drink service on board; immediate midair isolation of passengers who develop a fever or cough on a flight. But several months into the worst pandemic in a century, the majority of the document seems proportionate.</p> <p>The guidelines from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency are a warning to other industries and to consumers who interact with them: this is the new normal. Not only will businesses have to adapt to the requirements of beating a highly infectious disease, but so will people who work in them and buy goods from them, whether it is going to the gym (limited class attendance, restricted access to machines), attending the pub (under the watchful eye of social distancing marshalls, if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/22/jd-wetherspoon-pubs-reopen-lockdown-staff-goggles\" title=\"\">it\u2019s a Wetherspoons</a>) or buying a dress in a shop (without trying it on).</p> <p>The danger for the global economy is that consumers balk at the changes and bin the gym membership, drink at home and shop online. If prospective holidaymakers, weekend tourists and business travellers decline to travel by air, the aviation industry\u2019s financial crisis will worsen and a shift in transport patterns and the holiday industry could become permanent.</p> <p>So aviation will be a test of consumer appetite for disruption and discomfort that will send a signal to other sectors shut down by the virus. When Ryanair and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/easyjet-to-resume-domestic-flights-across-england-and-france\" title=\"\">easyJet resume flights</a> next month, businesses should watch closely.</p> <h2>Whitbread borrows to seize an opportunity</h2> <p>In another big week for corporate fundraisings, Whitbread\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/whitbread-raising-1bn-from-shareholders-to-boost-finances-coronavirus-premier-inn\" title=\"\">\u00a31bn pitch to shareholders</a> stood out. First, it was a traditional rights issue, with all investors able to subscribe equally. Very admirable too: most offers during the crisis have left small retail shareholders in the wings in the scramble to raise cash quickly.</p> <p>The second difference is related to the first. Whitbread, owner of the Premier Inn hotel chain and the Beefeater restaurant business, could afford a leisurely timetable because it doesn\u2019t need \u00a31bn urgently.</p> <p>The company, like most in the hospitality industry, is leaking cash during lockdown, so any reinforcement of the balance sheet helps. But Whitbread could have chosen to raise less from shareholders and increase borrowings. Instead, it went for \u00a31bn with an eye on \u201coffensive\u201d expansion.</p> <p>Chief executive Alison Brittain\u2019s bullish argument that many rivals will be \u201cweakened by the pandemic\u201d, creating opportunities for Whitbread, sounds correct.</p> <p>The decline of independent hotel operators was a long-term trend anyway. Meanwhile, its main UK rival, Travelodge, is owned by private equity, and thus weighed down by the usual debt-heavy financial structure. In the fight for new development sites, Whitbread could enjoy a double benefit in the new world \u2013 lower commercial property prices and fewer bidders.</p> <p>Many of the same factors will apply in Germany, which was already Whitbread\u2019s big hope for the next decade. The goal of becoming the biggest budget operator in that country may have come closer.</p> <p>The Whitbread example points to a trend we may see in other sectors: strong companies taking chunks of market share from underequipped rivals. In retail, Boohoo has armed itself with \u00a3200m to add ailing retail brands to a collection that already includes Coast and Karen Millen.</p> <p>We may be looking at a two-speed world: an abundance of cash for strong operators and starvation rations for the weak.</p>",

  "<p>Can\u2019t be bothered with makeup? I get that. Seems pointless when your audience is mainly colleagues on Zoom with a dodgy internet connection (no one notices immaculate contouring on frozen screens.)

Apply a smidgen of foundation for warmth, neutral eyeshadow, an understated lip and, crucially, strong brows \u2013 just dip your spoolie in brow pomade and brush on. A face with great brows is akin to a dress hung up (as opposed to scrunched on the floor). It makes all the difference. That\u2019s the benefit of being bothered.</p> <p><strong>1.

The scent, created in Grasse, the home of great perfumery, is described as \u2018lavender bushels, freesia and magnolia flowers bundled in fresh white cotton sheets then spritzed with a nudge of musk\u2019. In other words it smells like fresh laundry \u2013 the ultimate scent of clean. And who doesn\u2019t like that? (Please don\u2019t tell me that\u2019s you.) I also fell for this candle because it burns for 50 hours \u2013 and the quality is lovely. Most people associate candles with particular seasons or occasions, but for me they are like sunscreen \u2013 relevant all year round. Except candles are a luxury. And seeing as I light a few at a time (my mother-in-law once said my home resembled a Catholic church), I am literally burning money. Thankfully, at this price, I can light candles guilt-free.

  "<p>In the depths of lockdown, the arrival of a takeaway can feel like a promising message from a lost world; one where restaurants continue to do what they always did. It\u2019s a sudden spike on the emotional heart monitor. A few weeks ago, I said I wouldn\u2019t talk about such things in this column and I never go back on my word. Except when I do. So many intriguing takeaways have arrived at my house recently that to not mention some of them would be a dereliction of my ludicrous duty.</p> <p>Mostly they have been taken in a professional capacity. Oh, that we should all have such professions. Just before restaurants closed, I was recording a third series of my podcast <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/out-to-lunch-with-jay-rayner/id1455111316\">Out to Lunch</a>, in which I grill marvellous people to a turn over a marvellous meal: Dita Von Teese at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/nov/10/norma-london-a-place-of-joy-restaurant-review\" title=\"\">Norma</a>, Charlie Brooker at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/dec/08/foodanddrink.shopping6\" title=\"\">Chutney Mary</a> and so on. But we have all had to adapt. So now I stay in for lunch and interview marvellous people by video, with a takeaway.</p> <p>We started outrageously. I was able to send both myself and Edgar Wright, director of <em>Shaun of the Dead</em> and <em>Baby Driver</em>, a Chinese. Except it was a gilded, Michelin-starred Chinese from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/may/27/foodanddrink.features5\" title=\"\">Hakkasan Mayfair</a>, which delivers across the centre of London. By gilded I mean literally so. Gold leaf may have been involved. The pert lobster dim sum, as full and rounded as an Instagrammer\u2019s lips, came topped with caviar. You may now wish me to check my damn privilege. Well I just have. It turns out I have loads. So that\u2019s nice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c3e3cdc474e5211ad8aebaa084ca6617812e6ef1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3e3cdc474e5211ad8aebaa084ca6617812e6ef1/107_0_746_933/400.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A gilded, Michelin-starred Chinese\u2019: dim sum from Hakkasan Mayfair.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A gilded, Michelin-starred Chinese\u2019: dim sum from Hakkasan Mayfair</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hakkasan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was prawn toast, the plump, sesame-crusted minced seafood a fabulously wealthy but distant relative of the dour high-street version. There was finely sliced rib-eye steak with lily bulb with punchy black beans, and a raucous dish of king prawns in a thick, spicy coconut sauce. It all survived the journey unharmed, mostly because it came via <a href=\"https://supper.london/#/home\" title=\"\">Supper</a>, a new high-end, app-based delivery service using bikes with temperature-controlled compartments that has partnered with some of London\u2019s fancier restaurants. Basically, my takeaway arrived by limo. Accordingly, it is not cheap. Main courses start in the high teens, but don\u2019t loiter there for long. (For \u00a3120 you can get a two-person menu, with all proceeds going to Great Ormond Street Hospital.) As ever, it\u2019s worth it, but only if you can afford it.</p> <p>Hush now. Here\u2019s something much cheaper. The charming singer-songwriter George Ezra got a bike\u2019s worth of top dishes from the glorious Middle Eastern supermarket <a href=\"https://green-valley.co/\" title=\"\">Green Valley</a> in Kensington: it featured tabbouleh, pumpkin kibbeh and falafel popcorn, which are two words that had long been waiting for each other. To match him I stumbled upon the delightful <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/limettbistro/\" title=\"\">Limett Bistro</a> in West Dulwich. They were due to open on 1 April. That obviously couldn\u2019t happen so they moved straight to delivery. Romanian-born George Moldoveanu\u2019s Mediterranean-inspired cooking is vivid, thrilling and a cheery exercise in value.</p> <p>All starters are around \u00a36.50. There is chargrilled pumpkin, spiced with the whipcrack of zatar, alongside crumbly feta and a herb salsa. Humble carrots are roasted with the punch of harissa to give them a leg up, and served with a citrus-boosted hummus, while spiced lamb meatballs arrive with a field-fresh cucumber salad and flatbread. The star is grilled chicken thighs marinated in yogurt, lemon and garlic alongside a mixed pepper stew and a fattoush salad, for \u00a39.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"610262d2e361abdf2e6d43cfdd0d432d0e30b969\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/610262d2e361abdf2e6d43cfdd0d432d0e30b969/0_80_800_480/500.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Vivid, thrilling and a cheery exercise in value\u2019: pumpkin from the Limett Bistro, West Dulwich.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Spiced with the whipcrack of zatar, alongside crumbly feta and a herb salsa\u2019: pumpkin from the Limett Bistro, West Dulwich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Lea</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There have been others worthy of note: the Vietnamese restaurant <a href=\"http://www.banhbanh.com/\" title=\"\">Banh Banh</a>, in Peckham, sent me a sweet-sour shredded papaya salad tossed with king prawns, crushed peanuts and crispy shallots, which made me feel like I was being healthy, plus chicken wings glazed in sticky fish sauce and chilli, which made me feel messy. I have also become mildly addicted to the fried chicken from <a href=\"https://birdrestaurants.com/\" title=\"\">Bird</a> in Brixton, with its undulating crusty skin, full of golden nooks and crannies and spiced echoing crunch. It\u2019s what KFC would be, if it had a career mentor and ambition. That, I ate on my own time.</p> <p>But undoubtedly the most engaging adventure was the readymeal kits dispatched to me by podcast guest Tom Kerridge, full of his familiar bravado and enthusiasm. I couldn\u2019t see the point in sending him a takeaway, when he was supplying his own from his pub, the <a href=\"https://www.thebutcherstap.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Butcher\u2019s Tap</a> in Marlow (alongside cooking hundreds of meals a week for the vulnerable). My starter of Isle of Wight tomato and feta salad with garlic pesto, priced at \u00a35.50, had 11 potted elements. I had a jolly time, layering sliced tomatoes, then dressing them with a sticky tomato reduction, a wild garlic pesto, a crispy shallot crumb and many other things besides.

I\u2019ve long fretted over the piles of plastic boxes that each takeaway moment can generate. They might carry a recyclable mark, but who knows whether that means anything? Those who have been involved in producing meals for vulnerable groups from home during this crisis, will now have found them damn useful. A black mark goes, then, to the restaurant local to me which dispatches its food in plastic pots closed up with a heat-sealed film instead of lids, meaning they are useless when emptied. Top marks, however, go to both Bird and Limett Bistro for using a paper-based packaging. And that, I can promise, is the last time I will mention takeaways in this column.

By that metric, the Trump presidency is a shambolic failure.</p> <p>In a book mostly written before the pandemic, Frum details the efforts of the 45th president to gut the rule of law and institutionalize \u201cwhite ethnic chauvinism\u201d, leaving the country reeling, the constitution bruised. Trumpian alchemy has turned gold to lead.</p> <p>Trumpocalypse recalls that in 2016, Senator Ted Cruz compared Trump to Benito Mussolini, then \u201cwent to work\u201d in his \u201ccloakroom\u201d. Most recently, the president has threatened Michigan and Nevada over absentee balloting and waged war on government inspectors general.

The party of Abraham Lincoln and the upward arc is gone.</p> <p>Frum was a speechwriter to George W Bush and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jan/28/usa.iran\">helped coin the phrase \u201caxis of evil\u201d</a>. Now he declares that 21st-century conservatism has \u201cdelivered much more harm than good, from the Iraq war to the financial crisis to the Trump presidency\u201d. Yet he remains committed to his Burkean worldview, of individual autonomy fused to social cohesion.</p> <p>Trumpocalypse quotes the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, that it is \u201cculture, not politics, that determines the success of a society\u201d. By the same measure, \u201cpolitics can change a culture and save it from itself\u201d.</p> <p>Frum criticizes the effective disenfranchisement wrought by the electoral college but does not call for its abolition. That would be futile. Although the Republicans lost the popular vote in six of seven presidential contests since 1992, they captured the White House three times. Few surrender power for the asking.</p> <p>After the debacle of 2000, Frum\u2019s boss extended an olive branch to blue America. Bush sought to broaden his mandate.

He also homes in on the contradiction at the heart of Trumpian populism.</p> <p>On the one hand, it is rooted in the belief that the silent majority should come first, not the elites. On the other, its operative dictum is \u201cwe should not choose our leaders just by counting who got the most votes\u201d. Shades of Animal Farm: some folks are more equal than others.</p> <p>Said differently, the people\u2019s preferences should not be equated with \u201cwill of <em>the </em>people\u201d. In the end, Frum says, Trumpism is about defending a \u201cdistinct way of life\u201d, one challenged by modernity.</p> <p>Frum makes clear that this outlook is shared by the cosseted segments of Trump\u2019s base. Trumpocalypse quotes <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/fema-tells-states-to-hand-public-health-data-over-to-palantir\">Peter Thiel, a pillar of Silicon Valley</a> and an early Trump supporter, who sees democracy at odds with his libertarian ideals. Thiel has written that he \u201cno longer believes that freedom and democracy are compatible\u201d.</p> <p>A PayPal co-founder and Kushner family partner, Thiel blames this decoupling on the \u201cextension of the franchise to women\u201d. He also contends that the welfare state has \u201crendered the notion of \u2018capitalist democracy\u2019 into an oxymoron\u201d. Recent reports, however, describe even Thiel <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/billionaire-maga-fan-peter-thiel-has-had-it-with-trumps-covid-19-response\">as displeased with Trump</a> over his handling of the pandemic.</p> <p>Trumpocalypse voices irreconcilable grievance. Still, Frum\u2019s dismay is not directed at the president\u2019s supporters, at least he tries not to. Frum understands that even if the incumbent loses re-election, the great American divide is not disappearing anytime soon.</p> <p>On that note, Trumpocalypse rejects progressivism\u2019s embrace of the \u201cGreat Awokening\u201d, the volatile brew of identity politics and intersectionality. The left\u2019s orthodoxies find few takers in swing districts. Frum opposes liberal immigration policies as devaluing the rights and status of actual citizens. He also criticizes Biden for advocating healthcare expansion to cover undocumented migrants.</p> <p>More Americans <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/440012308/Fox-December-8-11-2019-National-Topline-December-15-Release#fullscreen&amp;from_embed\">favor a wall along the southern border</a> than <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/democratic-candidates-healthcare-benefits-undocumented-immigrants-2019-7\">support granting government healthcare</a> to the undocumented.

  "<p>The Greek word krisis originally denoted that critical moment when things could go either way for the patient. We believe that our society is at a similar turning point.

We must:</p> <p>\u2022 Revalue care: nurses and carers deserve a pay rise, not just a round of applause. We should reverse marketisation of our NHS, and better integrate physical, mental and social care.</p> <p>\u2022 Reduce inequality: present levels of inequality benefit no one, fragmenting society, distorting democracy and overburdening care systems. We must reject austerity measures, house the UK\u2019s homeless and consider implementing a universal basic income.</p> <p>\u2022 Get to grips with the climate and ecological emergency, by \u201cbaking in\u201d good lockdown practices, adopting strict year-by-year carbon budgets in line with the UN\u2019s 1.5 degree target, and localising production, consumption and travel where possible.</p> <p>\u2022 Set up an independent public inquiry on the handling of the pandemic, to make sure the lessons are learned.</p> <p>\u2022 Create a UK Citizens\u2019 Assembly for the Future, selected at random, to counter the short-termism, lack of representation and bias of our political institutions.

That would potentially raise problems under the competition and consumer act.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not barracking for any particular bidder, but having AAP continue will be good for diversity.\u201d</p> <p>AAP is scheduled to close next month.

  "<p>When Martin Lee arrived in Hong Kong from China with his parents in 1949, he was just 11. Lee\u2019s father, Li Yin-wo, was a general in the Nationalist party who fought against the Japanese during the second world war.</p> <p>After his party was defeated by the Communist party in the civil war, instead of fleeing to Taiwan like most of his army colleagues, he brought his family to Hong Kong, where he became a schoolteacher.</p> <p>Years later, Lee\u2019s father told him he had chosen to come to the British colony because it was a safe haven for his children and he wanted to avoid being involved with either party.</p> <p>He did not want to continue serving the corrupt Nationalist government, nor stay in China to serve the Communist government, which he did not trust. Zhou Enlai, the first premier of Communist China, who knew Li when both were students in France, repeatedly invited him back to China, but Li declined.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e81624767b5ca897bde94fdda5fb99ddb55aa20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e81624767b5ca897bde94fdda5fb99ddb55aa20/0_0_775_711/500.jpg\" alt=\"Li Yin-wo on horseback in the 1940s.\" width=\"500\" height=\"459\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee\u2019s father, Li Yin-wo, was a general in the Nationalist party who fought against the Japanese during the second world war.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Martin Lee Chu-ming</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, Lee fears that the unique status of the city where his father found stability and peace is under threat as never before.</p> <p>On Friday, China revealed its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/23/global-outrage-erupts-over-chinas-draconian-security-law-for-hong-kong\">plan to impose a national security law on Hong Kong</a> to prevent and punish acts of \u201csecession, subversion or terrorism activities\u201d that threaten national security. The plan, which bypasses the city\u2019s legislature, would also allow Chinese national security organs to set up in the city.</p> <p>The move led to widespread unease in Hong Kong. \u201cTo people of my father\u2019s generation, this is a huge irony, because they thought this would be a safe haven for their families,\u201d said Lee, now 81.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cee9e4b40b9bb4cdc7ffb196369feaac26fc6716\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cee9e4b40b9bb4cdc7ffb196369feaac26fc6716/0_0_494_537/460.jpg\" alt=\"Li Yin-wo (left), Martin Lee and Martin Lee\u2019s son, Joseph.\" width=\"460\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Li Yin-wo (left), Martin Lee and Martin Lee\u2019s son, Joseph.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Martin Lee Chu-ming</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the change of sovereignty in 1997, Hong Kong was ruled by China under the \u201cone country two systems\u201d arrangement which guaranteed its freedoms for another 50 years.</p> <p>But China has tightened its control over the city and frustrations exploded into last year\u2019s mass anti-government movement, which was triggered by a proposed extradition law which could see individuals sent to China for trial.</p> <p>Lee has long been a thorn in the side of the Chinese government. In the early 1980s, as chairman of the Hong Kong Bar association, he was invited by China to become one of 23 Hong Kongers on the Basic Law Drafting Committee. But, after criticising Beijing for crushing the Tiananmen pro-democracy movement in 1989, he was banished from the body.</p> <p>His father\u2019s advice for him was: \u201cDon\u2019t trust the Communist party. When they need you, they\u2019d give you everything but when they\u2019re done they\u2019d drop you, kick you and stamp on you.\u201d</p> <p>Lee went on to found the Democratic party in 1994 and has since been seen as a \u201ctraitor\u201d to China for his lobbying for western support for the democratisation of Hong Kong.

We\u2019re the meat on the chopping board.\u201d</p> <p>Beijing has wanted Hong Kong to legislate a national security law since 2003, but it was shelved after mass protests that year. As the current anti-government movement approaches its first anniversary, and with China having run out of patience with Hong Kong\u2019s increasingly violent unrest, it decided to apply its national security laws through the Basic Law\u2019s Annex III, which allows national laws to be applied to the city.</p> <p>But Lee, a barrister who qualified in Lincoln\u2019s Inn and became QC in 1979, said Chinese laws that can be applied through this mechanism should only be those relating to defence and foreign affairs and \u201cmatters outside the limits of Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy\u201d. The national security laws did not fall into those categories, he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f384cc65e132620276fceeb6049186feb737fa7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f384cc65e132620276fceeb6049186feb737fa7/0_2_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Lee campaigns for his  Democratic party in the central district of Hong Kong in 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Lee campaigns for his Democratic party in the central district of Hong Kong in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Hilton/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What China is doing goes \u201ccompletely against\u201d the plan of the late Deng Xiaoping, paramount leader of China from 1978 to 1992, who wanted to keep Hong Kong\u2019s capitalism and core values alive while allowing a convergence period of 50 years to allow China to catch up in modernisation, he said.</p> <p>\u201cDeng Xiaoping wanted one country, two systems because he wanted China to change,\u201d he said. \u201cNow China doesn\u2019t even want to follow the rules of its own book \u2026 they are unwilling to undercut their power and they fear you\u2019re a threat.

Unsurprisingly, many of these revolved around allegations that the PM\u2019s advisor Dominic Cummings broke the lockdown rules back in March. Here\u2019s a summary of the key points:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The government has announced it will put \u00a3283m into moving public transport back to a full timetable</strong>. However, those who can should still work from home, and those who can should still avoid all forms of public transport. Even a fully restored service will only be capable of carrying, at best, one fifth of normal capacity, to allow for social distancing. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>There have been a further 282 recorded deaths, bringing the UK\u2019s total death toll to 36,675</strong>. Important to note - the government publishes the death toll based on those who definitely had Covid-19; broader figures based on suspected coronavirus deaths is larger. On average, the number of deaths is starting to come down, Harries said. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The \u201csteady, slow\u201d <strong>downward trend in hospital admissions in England is continuing</strong>.
