There should be a more consultative mechanisms where states sit together. There needs to be cooperation. There should be a blueprint for working together.

All countries in the region are affected and under lockdowns of varying degrees, with international travel suspended and movement increasingly prohibited. <strong>Ivory Coast</strong> has the highest number of confirmed cases at 654. </p> \n  <p>Yet, across west Africa testing is very limited, with <strong>Ghana</strong> testing about 35,000 people so far and Nigeria only about 5,000. In Lagos, authorities have just begun the first community testing to determine the spread in the wider population, as so far tests have only been conducted on people who have recently travelled into the country or who have alerted authorities to their condition. </p> \n  <p><strong>Nigeria</strong>\u2019s government is racing to strengthen a chronically underfunded health system, with only a few hundred ICUs and ventilators for its 200 million people, according to medical unions. Nigeria spends 4% of GDP on health, which is among the lowest levels in percentage terms in Africa. <br><br>Nigeria already has an oxygen crisis, with 625,000 people dying each year due to hospitals not having enough oxygen provision. In recent weeks, strikes by doctors have further highlighted the difficulties in health services, amid complaints of unpaid salaries and poor working conditions.<br><br>The number of laboratories testing for Covid-19 are being quickly expanded and health centres built with help from the private sector. But there remain fears that even a moderate outbreak could overwhelm the system unless much more is done. </p> \n  <p>The financial toll of the lockdowns on the poor in west Africa is already becoming clear, with videos across social media of citizens pleading for food supplies and money. Lockdowns have been widespread but help is incredibly limited. <strong>Ghana</strong> has been among the more proactive countries, yet most are struggling to provide adequate supplies to more than a fraction of the people affected. <br><br>In <strong>Senegal</strong>, there are fears that more than 100,000 street children, known locally as Talib\u00e9s, who beg on the streets are at a greater risk of contracting the coronavirus. Many are homeless or living in squalid, congested Islamic boarding schools. Senegalese authorities say they are trying to help by providing education centres for 1,500 children. <br><br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T10:20:20.160Z\">at 11.20am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e982a158f08cf571cdb2071\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T09:53:31.483Z\">10.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Europe still in the midst of the Covid-19 storm, World Health Organization warns</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-live-news-cases-worldwide-top-2-million-trump-doubts-china-death-toll?page=with:block-5e9823398f08ea7431f43ce7#block-5e9823398f08ea7431f43ce7\">More from the World Health Organization press briefing</a>, as the body\u2019s European regional director warns that the continent is still in the midst of the storm of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the number of cases nearing a million.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAs of today, Europe remains very much at the centre of the pandemic.

Maybe. <br></p> \n  <p>The US is now firmly entrenched at the center of the global coronavirus outbreak, with more than 600,000 people confirmed as being infected by Covid-19 and more than 30,000 losing their lives due to the virus.</p> \n  <p>There are hopes that the US is starting to hit a peak in terms of new infections, followed by a long plateau and then drop, which will open the way to a gradual restart of normal life such as the opening of schools and businesses.<br></p> \n  <p>Anthony Fauci, the federal government\u2019s top infectious diseases expert, has expressed \u201ccautious optimism\u201d that hospitalizations from the virus have started to slow down, although the rise in deaths will lag behind. \u201cOnce you turn that corner, hopefully we\u2019ll see a very sharp decline,\u201d Fauci said. On 13 April Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told NBC that \u201cwe are nearing the peak right now.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>A model relied upon by the White House, from the University of Washington, estimates that the virus will \u201cpeter out\u201d in May and then essentially grind to a halt by the summer. This is based on the experiences of China and Italy, previous coronavirus hotspots.<br></p> \n  <p>But this model, like all predictions, is dynamic and depends upon the application of measures such as social distancing to slow the rate of transmission. Other forecasts have been more pessimistic, warning that it will be difficult to tame the spread of the virus until well after summer. Premature relaxation of restrictions on gatherings of people could see a second, much more severe, increase in infections. <br></p> \n  <p>The sheer size of the US, as well as its large population, means that there will be several \u2018peaks\u2019 at different times across the country. While the situation may be starting to stabilize somewhat in New York, areas in the heart of the country have yet to see the worst of the virus.\u201dThat is going to be confusing for people,\u201d said Doug Burgum, governor of North Dakota. \u201cIf wow, New York had all these deaths and they are opening up, why aren\u2019t we opening?

  "<p>Formula One teams have failed to reach an agreement to adopt a substantial cut to the budget cap set to be imposed in 2021. Talks on Thursday between team principals, the FIA and F1 were understood to be constructive and they will come together again next week to readdress the issue. The original spending cap of $175m (\u00a3140m) has already been agreed to be reduced to $150m but the proposal being considered is to drop it further to $130m.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/15/f1-decisive-action-budget-crisis-mclaren-andreas-seidl\">F1 must slash budget or face financial ruin, says McLaren team principal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The meetings are considered a vital step towards ensuring the sport emerges intact from the coronavirus outbreak. The four-hour virtual meeting was the second in seven days to discuss the proposed changes as the sport attempts to come to terms with the financial implications of the virus. The president of the FIA, Jean Todt, described it on Twitter as an \u201cImportant meeting by video conference today with Chase Carey, @F1 &amp; @FIA teams to build together a New Deal for the future of our sport\u201d.</p> <p>The discussion centred on setting a ceiling of $145m for 2021 and then $130m in 2022. The latter was the target figure F1 had proposed to the teams under their plans for the future of the sport set out in 2018.</p> <p>Nine races have been called off this season, potentially placing F1 and its teams under enormous financial strain, with reports on Thursday suggesting Silverstone could host multiple races when it finally starts and Austria could be the venue for the opener. Race hosting fees are one of the three major sources of income for the sport and they are highly likely to take a major hit. Should more races be cancelled or postponed, broadcasting fees and sponsorship income are also likely to suffer.</p> <p>The concept of a sliding scale for the volume of aerodynamic research based on a team\u2019s position in the constructors\u2019 championship, weighted in favour of reverse order of success, was also discussed. The idea is understood to have been viewed favourably by F1.</p> <p>The McLaren team principal, Andreas Seidl, has been emphatic in warning that F1 could lose smaller teams if it failed to address the spending issue and his team had been pushing for a cap of $100m.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee1731b3646d31f9ca81f677dd2578bdea4446b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee1731b3646d31f9ca81f677dd2578bdea4446b6/0_0_3500_2404/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ross Brawn said: \u2018The dial has been set at 11 for too long.

We need to wind it down. We said this [sort of crisis] was what the budget cap was for when it was introduced. We\u2019re there sooner than anyone hoped or wanted, but we are there now and it would be irresponsible to ignore it. We\u2019ve all got to respond.\u201d</p> <p>The big three teams, Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull, are estimated to spend in excess of $400m a year, with the remaining teams having costs of between $150m and $250m. There are serious staffing implications with such a drastic cut for the top three teams, who employ between 800 and 1,000 staff.</p> <p>There had already been an informal agreement to drop the cap to $150m but it is understood both Red Bull and Ferrari were resistant to it falling any further. Ferrari\u2019s team principal, Mattia Binotto, had pointed out that a flat rate ceiling did not necessarily work across the board. \u201cWhen discussing a budget cap, we should not forget that we\u2019ve got different situations, and it\u2019s important that we find common ground somehow which is suited to the different situations,\u201d he said last week. \u201cThere is still analysis required to make the right decisions.

Summarising what it concluded, he told journalists:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There are indications that the measures we have put in place have been successful in slowing down the spread of the virus.</p> \n   <p>But, Sage also say that it is a mixed and inconsistent picture and, in some settings, infections are still likely to be increasing.</p> \n   <p>Sage assess that the rate of infection, or the R value, is almost certainly below 1 in the community.</p> \n   <p>That means that on average each infected person is, in turn, infecting less than one other person</p> \n   <p>But, overall, we still don\u2019t have the infection rate down as far as we need to.</p> \n   <p>As in other countries, we have issues with the virus spreading in some hospitals and care homes.</p> \n   <p>In sum, the very clear advice we have received is that any change to our social distancing measures now would risk a significant increase in the spread of the virus.</p> \n   <p>That would threaten a second peak of the virus, and substantially increase the number of deaths.</p> \n   <p>It would undo the progress made to date, and as a result, would require an even longer period of the more restrictive social distancing measures.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Raab refused repeated invitations to speculate on how or when the lockdown measures might be relaxed, but he came close to confirming that they would be eased in stages when he said there might be a \u201ctransition\u201d.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have been very clear that we will take the right decisions at the right moments based on the evidence. And they may well involve a transition out of the current measures. And, of course, they could be calibrated in different ways.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also said that Boris Johnson\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/19/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-london-lockdown-williamson-refuses-to-rule-out-government-putting-london-in-lockdown-by-weekend?page=with:block-5e73a9278f085c6327bc3389#block-5e73a9278f085c6327bc3389\"> claim on 19 March that the UK would be able to \u201cturn the tide\u201d in the fight against coronavirus within 12 weeks </a>was still realistic. Raab said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The prime minister said at the outset that it would take three months to come through the peak and I think that, broadly, is still the outline.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>(Presumably, then, this would be another transition period that No 10 would hope to be over by the end of 2020.)</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Raab said five tests would be used to decide when it was safe to start relaxing the lockdown. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>First, we must protect the NHS\u2019s ability to cope ...</p> \n   <p>Second, we need to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from coronavirus so we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak.</p> \n   <p>Third, we need to have reliable data from Sage showing that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.</p> \n   <p>Fourth, we need to be confident that the range of operational challenges, including testing capacity and PPE, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand.</p> \n   <p>Fifth, and this is really crucial, we need to be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelm the NHS.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Raab said that lifting the lockdown now would harm the economy, not help it. </strong>At this stage there was no conflict between health and the economy, he argued. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s not a trade-off here, if we get a second peak it\u2019s not just damaging for people\u2019s health and public safety, we will also end up back in a second lockdown which will prolong the economic risks.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Sir Patrick Vallance</strong>, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, made the same point. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At the moment this is not a tension between the economy and health, it\u2019s very clear what we need to do now, which is to keep this down, stop this from coming back again, stop a second wave, which would need a second lockdown.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Vallance said he agreed with Prof Neil Ferguson that a vaccine might provide the clearest exit strategy</strong>. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-uk-live-news-covid-19-lockdown-extension?page=with:block-5e9800a88f08ea7431f43be7#block-5e9800a88f08ea7431f43be7\"> 8.07am.)</a> Asked about Ferguson\u2019s comment, Vallance said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I completely agree that the way out of this is vaccines and therapeutics [medicines]. Those are going to be critically important.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Vallance suggested that there might be a need for people to carry on working from home for a prolonged period of time. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There may be a number of measures that need to continue in order to allow [the virus] to be suppressed and controlled whilst vaccines and therapeutics come along ...</p> \n   <p>There will be some changes, I think, that will need to take place, that have already taken place, around things like home working, that are going to be important to maintain that ability to break transmission.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, said that three other factors were more obviously risk factors for coronavirus than ethnicity.</strong> But the government did want to investigate further the extent to which BAME people seem to be more at risk, he said. He said over 90% of people who have died with coronavirus in the UK had at least one other disease, while other factors included being old and being male. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Being a member of an ethnic minority group is less clear [a risk factor], and I\u2019ve had discussions with scientists about this in terms of trying to tease this apart today.</p> \n   <p>This is something we are very keen to get extremely clear. We\u2019ve asked Public Health England to look at this in some detail and then what we really want is, if we see any signal at all, we want to then know what next we can do about it to minimise risk.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Whitty said that the government hoped to have a \u201ccrude\u201d idea as to what proportion of the public have had coronavirus soon, but that establishing a serology test (an antibody test) was complicated.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-uk-live-news-covid-19-lockdown-extension?page=with:block-5e9885a58f0895d83068f60f#block-5e9885a58f0895d83068f60f\">5.23pm.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30aa5c401bc56ab01d839a9a88b695db68076680\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30aa5c401bc56ab01d839a9a88b695db68076680/0_282_5356_3212/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Raab at the press conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Raab at the press conference.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Parsons/10 Downing Street/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T17:49:37.701Z\">at 6.49pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9895248f0895d83068f6e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T17:34:38.547Z\">6.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Nicola Sturgeon has asked that people continue to make \u201cdifficult sacrifices\u201d and adhere to Covid-19 restrictions in order to save lives.</p> \n  <p>Speaking after the UK government\u2019s Cobra meeting, Sturgeon said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If we were to lift any of these measures now, we would risk an immediate and potentially exponential resurgence of the virus.

row with the chair of an influential parliamentary committee was aired in public.</p> \n  <p><strong>Priti Patel</strong> has told the home affairs select committee, chaired by Yvette Cooper, she will give evidence to a hearing online on 29 April.</p> \n  <p>The offer comes after the select committee last week published a tranche of correspondence between Patel and Cooper, revealing an increasingly acrimonious dialogue between the two politicians, culminating in the home secretary warning she was becoming \u201cdisappointed at the increasingly adversarial tone of our exchanges\u201d.</p> \n  <p>It emerged Cooper had written to Patel six times - most recently in a letter issued on 8 April - in an attempt to fix a date for the home secretary to give evidence in public to the committee.</p> \n  <p>In the most recent correspondence from Patel, published today, the home secretary said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I want to assure you that I am committed to ensuring the Home Office is better open to scrutiny and transparency \u2013 hence my offer of regular briefings for you and your committee.</p> \n   <p>During this national crisis I am conscious of the need to give Home Office members of staff the time and space they need to carry out their essential duty of keeping the British public safe.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The committee has been pressing Patel to provide evidence since the end of January, during which time the secretary of state has been accused of belittling officials and presiding over an \u201catmosphere of fear\u201d at the Home

the latest twist in the debate about the use of such drugs to tackle symptoms of coronavirus infection.</p> \n  <p>The Commission on Human Medicines\u2019 expert working group on coronavirus has said that at present there is simply not enough evidence to link ibuprofen and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to contracting Covid-19 or the worsening of symptoms. The report says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Patients can take paracetamol or ibuprofen when self-medicating for symptoms of Covid-19, such as fever and headache, and should follow NHS advice if they have any questions or if symptoms get worse.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Ibuprofen has previously been found to increase the severity of certain diseases, such as chicken pox, but is used to lower temperatures in conditions such as flu.</p> \n  <p>The question of whether ibuprofen could exacerbate Covid-19 was raised last month when the French health ministry recommended against the use of anti-inflammatory medications including ibuprofen for treatment of Covid-19 after reports that four people \u2013 without underlying health conditions \u2013 had taken these drugs and were experiencing worse symptoms.</p> \n  <p>In the days that followed, the WHO maintained that it did not recommend against the use of ibuprofen, while the NHS <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/health-experts-criticise-nhs-advice-to-take-ibuprofen-for-covid-19\">came under fire</a> for continuing to recommend either paracetamol or ibuprofen for those with symptoms of Covid-19. It subsequently shifted its stance, saying that while there was little evidence that ibuprofen made symptoms worse, it recommended paracetamol instead. </p> \n  <p>At present the NHS website still says: \u201cThere is currently no strong evidence that ibuprofen can make coronavirus (Covid-19) worse. But until we have more information, take paracetamol to treat the symptoms of coronavirus, unless your doctor has told you paracetamol is not suitable for you.\u201d</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5926fed097389b0b236b31b59cfd5b80f80fbf69\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5926fed097389b0b236b31b59cfd5b80f80fbf69/0_0_5059_3036/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paracetamol sold out in some Pharmacies as the UK adjusted to life during the Coronavirus pandemic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paracetamol sold out in some pharmacies as the UK adjusted to life during the coronavirus pandemic.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Livesey - Danehouse/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T13:52:24.328Z\">at 2.52pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e985a0a8f08ea7431f43fce\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T13:14:42.318Z\">2.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">740 more people die in England</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A further 740 people who tested positive for the coronavirus have died, NHS England has announced, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 12,396.</p> \n  <p>The patients were aged between 28 and 103 years old.

The government has always ruled out requesting an extension to the post-Brexit transition period, and it has stuck to that position even though coronavirus has made it increasingly hard to see how the UK and the EU will be able to conclude a trade deal by the end of this year when crisis management is a full-time job and officials cannot even meet in the same room to carry out the negotiation.</p> \n  <p>But, as <strong>James Forsyth</strong>, the Spectator\u2019s political editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/15/uk-coronavirus-live-government-lockdown-exit-strategy-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9721728f0895d83068e908#block-5e9721728f0895d83068e908\">reports this week</a>, there has been speculation that the EU itself could request an extension of the transition. One theory was that it would be hard for the UK to refuse.</p> \n  <p>But the UK would refuse such a request, the spokesman said this morning. He told journalists:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We will not ask to extend the transition. And, if the EU asks, we will say no. Extending the transition would simply prolong the negotiations, prolong business uncertainty, and delay the moment of control of our borders. It would also keep us bound by EU legislation at a point when we need legislative and economic flexibility to manage the UK response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>What is also interesting about this comment is that it shows No 10 is now arguing that coronavirus strengthens the case for the UK to break away from regulatory alignment with the EU. Opposing regulatory alignment could end up with the UK having to negotiate with the EU on WTO terms (what used to be called a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit), although of course the government says it wants a Canada-style trade deal.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T12:23:39.093Z\">at 1.23pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9849938f0895d83068f309\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T12:08:17.732Z\">1.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>EasyJet may keep middle seats empty to follow physical distancing rules once coronavirus travel restrictions are lifted, its chief executive has said.</p> \n  <p>Kalyeena Makortoff reports that Johan Lundgren<em> </em>said it was one of the options being explored as the low-cost airline starts planning for flights to resume, following the grounding of EasyJet\u2019s entire fleet on 30 March.

The prime minister\u2019s spokesman deflected a lot of questions by telling reporters to wait until the press conference this afternoon, but he also strongly hinted that some social distancing measures would remain in force for potentially months - or even longer.</p> \n  <p>Asked if the government agreed with what Prof Neil Ferguson told the Today programme this morning about how a significant element of social distancing might have to remain until a vaccine is available (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-uk-live-news-covid-19-lockdown-extension?page=with:block-5e9800a88f08ea7431f43be7#block-5e9800a88f08ea7431f43be7\">8.07am)</a>, the spokesman said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The position of the government is that we will be guided by scientific and expert advice in deciding what measures to keep in place and that we will make the right decisions at the right point in time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>It was then put to the spokesman that this implied that some form of social distancing would remain in place for many, many months. Was that fair? The spokesman replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My answer on this is not going to change at this point in time, which is that we will be guided by the scientific and expert advice. </p> \n   <p>And, to repeat - we must not undo all of the progress which has been made so far by releasing the social distancing measures too soon.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>If No 10 is saying that it will be \u201cguided by scientific and expert advice\u201d, it is worth stressing that Ferguson <em>is</em> the scientific and expert advice - or at least a big component of it. Scientists do not always agree with each other, but Ferguson is a member of Sage, the scientific advisory group on emergencies, and he heads the team at Imperial College that produced the coronavirus modelling that persuaded the government to impose the lockdown in the first place. </p> \n  <p>In <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2020-03-16-COVID19-Report-9.pdf\">the report (pdf)</a> that prompted Boris Johnson to announce the lockdown, Ferguson and his team said the \u201csuppression\u201d strategy would have to remain in place for potentially 18 months. They said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The major challenge of suppression is that this type of intensive intervention package \u2013 or something equivalently effective at reducing transmission \u2013 will need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more) \u2013 given that we predict that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed. We show that intermittent social distancing \u2013 triggered by trends in disease surveillance \u2013 may allow interventions to be relaxed temporarily in relative short time windows, but measures will need to be reintroduced if or when case numbers rebound.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And this morning Ferguson said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s not going to be going back to normal. We will have to maintain some form of social distancing, a significant level of social distancing, probably indefinitely until we have a vaccine available.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T12:01:36.360Z\">at 1.01pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9845468f08ea7431f43efe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/robertbooth\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T11:50:13.384Z\">12.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>On Tuesday we told the story of Wren Hall nursing home in Nottinghamshire, where the manager, Anita Astle, expressed her anguish at losing 10 of her 26 residents to confirmed or suspected coronavirus in the space of just a few weeks. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/are-people-dispensable-care-home-manager-tells-how-third-of-residents-have-died-from-covid-19\">'Are people dispensable?': care home manager tells how third of residents have died from Covid-19</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>There has been some good news since then, reports Robert Booth, the Guardian\u2019s social affairs correspondent.

The Ministry of Defence has created a 23,000-strong Covid Support Force, which could be used for further frontline support in settings such as hospitals and prisons.<br></p> \n  <p>Healey is calling for the following measures: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Testing armed forces personnel and publishing the results as other countries are doing, with priority given to the Covid Support Force.</li> \n   <li>Postponing large-scale training exercises where these cannot be done safely, to prevent outbreaks that other country\u2019s armed forces have experienced.</li> \n   <li>Ensuring support for deployed personnel including full PPE for frontline staff in the UK, withdrawal from non-essential overseas postings to places where it is easier to protect personnel and urgent provision of adequate medical supplies to deal with any coronavirus outbreak. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>US and French navy ships have recently experienced coronavirus outbreaks, with the first US death on active duty reported on Monday. Yet, as Healey points out, one of the UK\u2019s two flagship aircraft carriers, the HMS Queen Elizabeth, is reportedly due to set sail on a training exercise later this month.</p> \n  <p>The US is one of the countries to publish aggregate data on testing of military personnel. The MoD does not currently do this. </p> \n  <p>John Healey said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Coronavirus is showing again how our armed forces help keep us safe.

The latest figures for tests show just 16,000 tests a day taking place. Asked why it was not more if the government had the capacity to carry out 25,000 tests a day, Hancock replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have increased the capacity, over the Easter weekend far fewer people came forward to be tested frankly than we expected.</p> \n   <p>Hence, yesterday, I could say that all social care staff who needed to be tested can be tested, and residents in social care and people coming from hospital to social care, precisely because we have got that capacity.</p> \n   <p>We\u2019ve increased the capacity and that is on a trajectory to get to the 100,000 by the end of the month.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said there had been 27 verified deaths of NHS staff with coronavirus. </strong>This morning the <strong>Nursing Notes </strong>website has lists 56 health and social care workers who have died with coronavirus on <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://composer.gutools.co.uk/content/5e97f53e8f08ea7431f43bb1&amp;sa=D&amp;source=hangouts&amp;ust=1587109624520000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGZYjbnc5hOFKTLRdd7rJhfz7rOsA\">its online memorial.</a></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e982c138f0895d83068f123\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T09:58:11.848Z\">10.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51c2af8d16c610b95ea22d66797c7a3381a632ab\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51c2af8d16c610b95ea22d66797c7a3381a632ab/15_580_2643_1587/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Billboards in Kensington, London, promoting tonight\u2019s Clap for our Carers event.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Billboards in Kensington, London, promoting tonight\u2019s Clap for our Carers event.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah McKay/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9828928f08cf571cdb205e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T09:47:38.188Z\">10.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jonathan Ashworth</strong>, the shadow health secretary, told the BBC this morning that Labour believed a three-week extension of the lockdown would be \u201creasonable\u201d.

But it would also require an emphasis on scaling up testing and contact tracing, because if measures were relaxed without a strong plan in place there was too much risk of a resurgence in cases. </p> \n  <p>Discussing whether lockdown measures could be eased after another three weeks, Ferguson said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think that will very much depend on quite how quickly case numbers go down, and that does require us to get on top of things like transmission rates in hospitals and care homes.</p> \n   <p>I think the other thing I would say is that it really requires a single-minded emphasis in government and the health system on scaling up testing and putting in place the ability to track down cases in the community and contact-trace.</p> \n   <p>Because without that, our estimates show we have relatively little leeway; if we relax measures too much then we\u2019ll see a resurgence of transmission.</p> \n   <p>What we really need is the ability to put something in their place. If we want to open schools, let people get back to work, then we need to keep transmission down in another manner.</p> \n   <p>And I should say, it\u2019s not going to be going back to normal. We will have to maintain some form of social distancing, a significant level of social distancing, probably indefinitely until we have a vaccine available.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Ferguson said there were some first signs that social distancing measure in the UK may be working, with trends such as the number of calls to 999, 111 and admissions to hospital beginning to flatten. </p> \n  <p>But he said more needed to be done to ensure the UK could leave lockdown safety. He called for a \u201ccommand and control centre\u201d, and suggested that any tracing provided by mobile phone apps would have to be supplemented by a \u201csmall army\u201d of people-testing and tracing. </p> \n  <p>Asked whether the government was moving towards having an exit strategy in place, Ferguson said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m not completely sure.

  "<p>Dominic Raab has warned the public that lockdown measures could last into June as ministers came under increasing pressure to set out a detailed plan to ease the stringent restrictions.</p> \n<p>Setting out plans for a minimum three-week extension to prevent a deadly \u201csecond peak\u201d of infections, Boris Johnson\u2019s stand-in said that any relaxation now would \u201csubstantially increase the number of deaths\u201d.</p> \n<p>And dispelling any hopes that the conditions would be lifted entirely before the May bank holiday, he said that there could be ongoing local lockdowns well into the summer to avoid new hotspots emerging. </p> \n<p>Raab said ministers had received \u201cvery clear advice\u201d from Sage, the expert scientific committee advising the government, that lifting restrictions now would risk a damaging second wave of infections, which would \u201csubstantially increase the number of deaths\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt would undo the progress made to date, and as a result, would require an even longer period of the more restrictive social distancing measures.\u201d</p> \n<p>His announcement came as ministers faced new calls to explain how they intend to control the virus so that the lockdown can eventually be relaxed \u2013 with one adviser, Neil Ferguson, breaking ranks on Thursday to call for a \u201csingle-minded emphasis on scaling up testing and contact tracing\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said the government needed to accelerate action as it had with Brexit and argued that a huge infrastructure of testing and contact tracing would need to be in place in order for the lockdown to be lifted without further peaks.</p> \n<p>\u201cWithout that, our estimates show we have relatively little leeway. If we relax measures too much, then we will see a resurgence in transmission,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Today programme.</p> \n<p>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, reacted to the criticism testily, saying Ferguson \u201cadvises government. He is not in the government.\u201d</p> \n<p>When pressed for a timescale on lifting restrictions, Raab pointed to Boris Johnson\u2019s remark of a month ago, on 19 March, that it would take 12 weeks to \u201cturn the tide\u201d of the virus. \u201cThat, broadly, is the outline,\u201d Raab said. The UK is now in its fourth week of lockdown.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fb1b1673-7f08-4a17-9903-35657563c582\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZD4PYP6eayQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Raab set out five conditions that would need to be met before any loosening of the rules. These included a sustained fall in the daily death rate, and confidence that the supply of PPE and testing can meet future demand.</p> \n<p>In a rebuke to rightwing commentators arguing for the lockdown to be lifted to alleviate the economic costs of having businesses shuttered and workers furloughed, Raab added that \u201cearly relaxation would do more damage to the economy over a longer period\u201d.</p> \n<p>Rather than lifting the restrictions, Raab talked of \u201cadjusting\u201d them, adding: \u201cIt could mean relaxing measures in some areas, while strengthening measures in some other areas\u201d. A Downing Street source called the approach \u201ckeyhole surgery\u201d.</p> \n<p>He stressed that while the infection rate had fallen in the community, \u201cwe have issues with the virus spreading in some hospitals and care homes\u201d.</p> \n<p>Hancock promised more testing and protective equipment for care home staff on Wednesday, with many reporting inadequate supplies and haphazard advice from the government.</p> \n<p>The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, welcomed the extension of the measures. \u201cI fully support the government\u2019s decision to extend the lockdown,\u201d he said. \u202a\u201cThe priority now must be to ensure we see a ramp-up in testing, that staff get the PPE they desperately need, and that more is done to protect our care homes from the virus. We also need clarity about what plans are being put in place to lift the lockdown when the time is right.\u201d</p> \n<p>Raab was deputising for the prime minister, who is convalescing at Chequers after being hospitalised with the virus. Downing Street said Boris Johnson was not involved in the decision to extend the restrictions, but that Raab had updated him by phone.</p> \n<p>One Tory MP said it was \u201crightwingers in cabinet and the wider party\u201d who were pushing for an early exit from the lockdown, but that No 10 was highly cautious.</p> \n<p>A senior Westminster source with knowledge of the government\u2019s thinking said they believed a move towards contact tracing conducted by an army of trained people was about to become \u201cthe next big U-turn\u201d. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"694eca0f-6d8c-491d-b329-2be5c5bcc847\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZYXGxByRUwE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Previous reversals of government policy include the acknowledgement of the need for mass testing, the abandonment of the herd immunity strategy, and the realisation that an antibody test was harder to develop than first thought.</p> \n<p>Another change of heart could be over the wearing of masks by members of the public. Chief medical officer Chris Whitty said this was \u201ca very live issue that we are re-examining\u201d. He said there was medical evidence of a \u201csmall\u201d effect on the transmission of the virus.</p> \n<p>Advisers had previously suggested there was little benefit to wearing masks, but Whitty said: \u201cThe point about scientific advice is, it evolves.\u201d</p> \n<p>The chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, also hinted at ongoing measures, saying the challenge was to get R \u2013 the transmission rate of the virus \u2013 below 1 and keep it there. \u201cThere may be a number of measures that need to be continued to allow that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be some changes that need to take place, around things like home-working.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hancock will come under pressure to commit to a coordinated testing and contact tracing regime when he appears before a blockbuster select committee hearing on Friday, led by former health secretary Jeremy Hunt and attended by several other committee chairs as guests.</p> \n<p>Hunt has long been pushing for a mass testing and tracing strategy, which was dismissed by the government\u2019s experts in mid-March when they moved from a policy of trying to contain the virus to trying to delay its peak.</p> \n<p>At that point, on March 26, Dr Jenny Harries said testing and contact tracing was \u201cnot an appropriate mechanism as we go forward\u201d, despite the World Health Organization\u2019s exhortation to \u201ctest, test, test\u201d.</p> \n<p>The government has since conceded the point on mass testing and begun to develop an app that can help trace contacts. However, there are concerns that online tracing will not be effective at reaching older people, that it is voluntary, and that privacy concerns may hamper its usefulness. </p>",

  "<p>Public Health England must publish the data it holds on the deaths of BAME patients from Covid-19 as failure to do so could be putting lives at risk, politicians and pressure groups have warned.</p> \n<p>With patients from ethnic minority backgrounds over-represented in critical care units and among NHS staff who have died, the government on Thursday agreed to an inquiry into why they appear to be more affected by the virus.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/inquiry-disproportionate-impact-coronavirus-bame\">Inquiry announced into disproportionate impact of coronavirus on BAME communities</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But with no comprehensive data about the ethnicity of those who have died as a result of the virus publicly available, critics said the failure to publish the information could create the impression that the problem doesn\u2019t exist.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, the government said there would be a formal review by NHS England and Public Health England into why ethnic minorities appear to be disproportionately affected by the virus. But no information about what \u2013 if any \u2013 data would be shared or timeframe was provided. BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) campaigners said it was imperative that figures were shared quickly so that analysis could begin as soon as possible.</p> \n<p>A Guardian analysis found that of 53 NHS staff known to have died in the pandemic so far, 68% were BAME. They include 22 nurses, two porters, a radiology support worker, a patient discharge planner and a hospital bus driver.

We suspect that BAME individuals, including frontline and essential workers, are disproportionately exposed to this virus. If Public Health England has ethnic data on who\u2019s dying in hospital, they must release it. Only with transparency of data and quick action from all relevant agencies will we save lives.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s low-key announcement of an inquiry came after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/10/uk-coronavirus-deaths-bame-doctors-bma\">the head of the British Medical Association (BMA), Dr Chaand Nagpaul, gave an interview with the Guardian last week calling for an official investigation</a>. He said: \u201cAt face value, it seems hard to see how this can be random.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Guardian understands that Public Health England is collating and analysing data on the ethnicity of patients who have died of Covid-19 in healthcare settings. However, it is not clear how long it will take to gather and publish the data.</p> \n<p>Dr Zubaida Haque, deputy director of the Runnymede Trust, said: \u201cIf you\u2019re not disaggregating by ethnicity, that means we have no idea whether there is any racial disproportionality at all.

However, if the review is to have any meaningful impact, it needs to be informed with real-time data to understand why and how this deadly virus can have such a tragic disproportionate toll on our BAME communities and healthcare workers. This must include daily updates on ethnicity, circumstance and all protected characteristics of all patients in hospital as well as levels of illness in the community, which is not currently recorded.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/role-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-in-bame-medic-deaths\">Vitamin D deficiency could have role in Covid risk to BAME community | Letter</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cIt also means taking vital steps now to protect our BAME communities until we can develop a detailed understanding of the threats they face. This could include that those at greatest risk, including older and retired doctors, are not working in potentially infectious settings.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yasmin Qureshi, MP for Bolton South-East, has also called on the government to release data about BAME deaths. Along with a group of 27 Labour MPs, she urged Matt Hancock, the health secretary, to examine why such a large number of BAME doctors were dying. \u201cWhen I became aware of these statistics I asked the Department of Health to explain,\u201d she said. </p> \n<p>Ethnicity is not collected on death certificates in England and Wales, unlike in Scotland where it was added in 2012. This means that based on current mortality data it will not be possible to assess who has died from the virus outside hospitals.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for the Office for National Statistics said work was underway to match data on Covid-19 deaths to other data sets to understand more about how ethnicity and deprivation are related to who is dying. However developing the new data is expected to take weeks, by which time it is anticipated the peak of the first wave of the virus will have passed.</p> \n<p>The chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said the intention of the inquiry was \u201cto look at this in some detail and then what we really want is, if we see any signal at all, we want to then know what next we can do about it to minimise risk\u201d.</p> \n<p>PHE medical director, Yvonne Doyle, said: \u201cThere is emerging evidence to suggest that Covid-19 may be having a disproportionate impact on ethnic minority groups. There is limited recording of ethnicity across almost all data sets so we must be very careful in making any assumptions. This is a really important issue and detailed and careful work needs to be done before we draw any conclusions.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Sarah Marsh</em></p>",

  "<p>Italian authorities have broadened their investigation into care home deaths during the coronavirus outbreak after 190 people were reported to have died at Milan\u2019s largest care home.</p> <p>Police on Wednesday seized documents connected to Pio Albergo Trivulzio, which has more than 1,000 elderly residents, from the offices of the Lombardy regional authorities amid what has been described as a \u201cmassacre\u201d.</p> <p>On 7 April, the newspaper La Repubblica published a photo of nine bodies in the home\u2019s mortuary on its front page, and another of the chapel filled with coffins. There is no official data on how many residents have died in Trivulzio since the coronavirus outbreak, although the newspaper reported on Thursday that there were more than 190 deaths during March and the first half of April.</p> <p>Silvio Brusaferro, the chief of the Higher Health Institute, said last Friday that 1,822 people had died across all care homes in Lombardy, but it is unclear how many were killed by Covid-19 as many were never tested.</p> <p>The manager of Trivulzio is under investigation amid allegations that no safety precautions were adopted and that care home staff were not allowed to wear face masks, at least in the early stage of the outbreak, in case they frightened the residents. About 200 staff have been infected with the virus, according to Rossella Delcuratolo from the Cisl labour union.</p> <p>Meanwhile, under a regional measure, 17 patients who were being treated for other illnesses at a hospital in Milan were transferred to the care home in March to free up beds in packed wards.</p> <p>\u201cAfter these 17 people arrived, the first coronavirus cases emerged,\u201d Delcuratolo said. \u201cThey said they were not positive but they couldn\u2019t have known as they were not tested for coronavirus.

It\u2019s not a hospital.\u201d</p> <p>Teresa Fusco is also among the relatives. Her father, Ferdinando, was sent home from Trivulzio in March. The 73-year-old had been in the home for two months while undergoing post-stroke therapy.

  "<p>The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, on Thursday confirmed the extension of the UK\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown measures for a further three weeks. The announcement had been widely trailed, and if Mr Raab had said anything else it would have been a surprise. It was nevertheless a big decision \u2013 the biggest this government has taken in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/12/boris-johnson-leaves-hospital-as-he-continues-recovery-from-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson\u2019s absence</a>. The lockdown will now continue until at least 7 May. On the basis of the country\u2019s behaviour these past three weeks, there is good reason to expect the measures to be observed.</p> <p>The extension puts fresh pressure on the public, the vulnerable, business and the economy. But it is the correct decision. The coronavirus pandemic remains virulent. Thursday brought <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public\" title=\"\">confirmation</a> of 4,618 new positive tests for the virus and of 861 new deaths in hospital in the UK. These figures are worse than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/15/uk-coronavirus-live-government-lockdown-exit-strategy-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e970ccf8f08213494be722b#block-5e970ccf8f08213494be722b\" title=\"\">Wednesday\u2019s</a>. The trend of new cases and deaths is abating by comparison with a week ago, which is cause for some relief. But the numbers are still high. The fight against the pandemic, as Mr Raab said, is at a \u201cdelicate and dangerous\u201d stage. This is not the time to start easing the control measures in ways that could endanger lives and threaten to overwhelm the health and care services.</p> <p>Mr Raab was aware that things are beginning to change in some countries. But he gave few clues away about UK government thinking on future easing. That was no surprise either. Ministers still regard public discussion of any exit strategy as off limits. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/uk-needs-lockdown-exit-strategy-says-key-coronavirus-adviser\" title=\"\">Matt Hancock</a> gave a vigorous defence of that policy in a round of interviews on Thursday, insisting that the government has no intention of deviating from the core message to stay at home and save lives. His junior minister <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NadineDorries/status/1250494730451836928?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\" title=\"\">Nadine Dorries</a> even said journalists should stop asking about the subject.</p> <p>But the pressure on ministers to start setting out their future options will not go away. Nor should it. Ministerial silence means one of two things. It either means that ministers cannot agree what to do next, especially without a lead from Mr Johnson. Or it means they do not trust the public to behave responsibly. Both are alarming. The first implies that parts of the government may have a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52304993\" title=\"\">Trumpian</a> recklessness towards public safety. The second implies that ministers underestimate the people. Both of them justify <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/keir-starmer-calls-for-ministers-to-set-out-plans-to-end-coronavirus-lockdown\" title=\"\">Labour</a> attempts to bring the exit strategy issue out into the public realm where it should now belong.</p> <p>There is no contradiction between maintaining lockdown and airing some practical issues to which the country will need to become accustomed when the lockdown is eased. The public can keep two ideas in their heads at the same time. Most people understand that social distancing remains key to suppressing the pandemic until immunity is established and vaccines can be developed. Even more would do so if British ministers possessed the kind of communication skills about the dilemmas that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/angela-merkel-draws-on-science-background-in-covid-19-explainer-lockdown-exit\" title=\"\">Angela Merkel</a> displayed this week. Refusing to discuss the easing of controls may in the end have the opposite effect to what is intended, by creating a pent-up wish to abandon the current disciplines.</p> <p>Mr Raab skated on thin ice over this. But the return of parliament next week will make the government\u2019s position harder to maintain. So will the prudent easing measures that are being introduced in some <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52291326\" title=\"\">European countries</a> this week. It is therefore time to lay the ground for an eventual easing here too. It needs to be done well and rationally, not badly and confusedly, let alone in the Trump manner.</p> <p>We need to start getting used to the idea that parts of the economy, some demographic groups and maybe some regions will begin, perhaps in late May, to be subject to different levels of control. Some businesses, workforces, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/lockdown-exit-uk-faces-segmenting-older-family-from-young-9zpgqwxsw\" title=\"\">demographic groups</a> and locations will nevertheless remain in lockdown, possibly for months. Continued social distancing, wider public use of protective equipment including masks and gloves, and some system of testing and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/who-urges-countries-to-track-and-trace-every-covid-19-case\" title=\"\">tracing</a> will all need to be considered. Good policing of the easing will be crucial. The new normal will not be like the old, pre-pandemic, normal in many ways. The government may need to call a halt if virus cases spike upwards. But Britain stumbled into the Covid-19 crisis. It does not need to stumble out of it.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cIf you ask me whether any Bluetooth contact tracing system deployed or under development, anywhere in the world, is ready to replace manual contact tracing [to deal with coronavirus], I will say \u2026 the answer is, no.\u201d Those are not the words of a tech luddite but were <a href=\"https://blog.gds-gov.tech/automated-contact-tracing-is-not-a-coronavirus-panacea-57fb3ce61d98\" title=\"\">posted</a> by Jason Bay, head of digital services of the world\u2019s most wired-up city state, Singapore. The island has seen only 10 deaths out of a population of 5.6 million and its response has been <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/23/singapore-teach-united-states-about-covid-19-response/\" title=\"\">celebrated</a> as a model approach to the virus. Singapore used large-scale testing of citizens and a digital app \u2013 TraceTogether \u2013 to track the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 infection.</p> <p>But technology is no panacea to the crisis. With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/16/nhs-in-standoff-with-apple-and-google-over-coronavirus-tracing\" title=\"\">just 12%</a> of Singaporeans using the app, Mr Bay correctly observes the quality of data analysis is only as good as the quality of the data provided. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/15/834497497/antibody-tests-for-coronavirus-can-miss-the-mark\" title=\"\">False positives and false negatives</a> have real-life (and death) consequences,\u201d he writes. \u201cWe use TraceTogether to supplement (manual) contact tracing \u2013 not replace it.\u201d</p> <p>In the west the privacy challenges of smartphone apps are complex, and we must resist attempts to normalise <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/bvge5q/snowden-warns-governments-are-using-coronavirus-to-build-the-architecture-of-oppression?__twitter_impression=true\" title=\"\">any level of totalitarian surveillance</a>. Yet the speed of the spread of the viral pathogen makes it difficult to see how such technology can be avoided. In such a system a person who develops symptoms and then, say, tests positive for Covid-19 lets his or her phone app know of their infection. This is then broadcast to every other app in the network which then searches their records to see if they have been close to the infected individual\u2019s phone since the time of infection. For this to work in the UK an app must hold data <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/nhs-coronavirus-app-memo-discussed-giving-ministers-power-to-de-anonymise-users\" title=\"\">temporarily and anonymously</a>, be installed at users\u2019 discretion, and have privacy at its core.</p> <p>But this is only the first step. Until we develop a vaccine or a treatment, infections will have to be detected quickly, and infected individuals possibly quarantined. The bottom line is that to contain the epidemic and prevent another spike we will need an <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/13/coronavirus-health-agencies-need-army-of-contact-tracers/\" title=\"\">army of public health workers</a> for ongoing testing and monitoring. How many would be needed? In Wuhan there were 81 public health officials for every 100,000 people. In New Zealand\u2019s success story \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/new-zealand/\" title=\"\">just nine deaths in a country of 5 million people</a> \u2013 the comparable figure was four. But those low staffing levels can be maintained because New Zealand had the outbreak under better control and the islands\u2019 remoteness makes it easier to track visitors.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2020/a-national-plan-to-enable-comprehensive-COVID-19-case-finding-and-contact-tracing-in-the-US.pdf\" title=\"\">study for Johns Hopkins university</a> in the US suggests that with Covid-19 circulating widely for many weeks, and without sufficient levels of testing, a region might need 15-30 public health workers per 100,000 people to bring the crisis under control. In the UK that would mean a new coronavirus workforce of 10,000-20,000 people to work in a system that Conservative governments since 2010 <a href=\"http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/hot-topics/public-health-cuts/deprived-areas-receive-six-times-more-cuts-to-public-health-budgets/20039637.article\" title=\"\">have starved of cash</a>.

Portugal has offered temporary citizenship to those seeking asylum; Spain has loosened its regime of immigration detention; Germany suspended the use of the Dublin regulation \u2013 the law that determines which EU state is responsible for examining an application for asylum; Ireland has said it will respect a firewall for any undocumented people seeking healthcare or social services during the pandemic: they will not be reported to immigration or the police. Forced deportations are also down.</p> <p>But Greece, Belgium, the Netherlands, Cyprus and Slovenia have temporarily suspended access to asylum, and Hungary has cancelled the right to asylum altogether because of \u201crisk related to the spread of Covid-19\u201d. </p> <p>The contagious nature of Covid-19 creates a public health paradox: if migrant workers, undocumented or otherwise, are unable to seek medical help or social assistance when sick, they will continue working, putting the wider community\u2019s health at risk. \u201cYou want people to receive the right healthcare to remain healthy, and keep the whole population healthy,\u201d said University of Birmingham sociologist Jenny Phillimore, who specialises in migration and public health.</p> <p>As the EU attempts to establish a common approach to lockdown exit and the economic consequences of the pandemic, it is now also being urged to advocate for a common approach towards migrants.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no justification for limiting the right to asylum,\u201d Catherine Wollard, director of the European Council on Refugees and Exiles said.

An earlier version said that the Moldovan government\u2019s insistence on returning migrants buying medical insurance before boarding their flights home had been ruled illegal by the courts.

By mid week it was clear I wasn\u2019t coping after six weeks in iso. I mean, I thought I was coping, so my column this week was meant to be on the joys of acceptance and stillness. I thought I was there, at the final zen stage. After that, I was going to retire, bitch.</p> <p>That was until I woke up on Wednesday to find my iso buddy had left his dishes in the sink overnight. WTF, man. Wash everything. Leave nothing on the bench overnight! DO YOU WANT THE MICE TO COME AS WELL AS THE PLAGUE?? Normally I wouldn\u2019t care, normally I leave dirty dishes in the sink, but something in me snapped \u2013 hard. I was filled with a deep, sudden and volcanic rage. I was a <em>rage vessel</em>. I\u2019m not proud of this, but in the surge of anger and energy running through me, I picked up the dirty dishes and smashed them in the sink. Glasses, a bowl and some ceramic thing that I quite liked, shattered. In the process I cut my hands on the broken glass \u2013 but I DIDN\u2019T CARE!! THERE WERE DIRTY DISHES IN THE SINK AND I WAS ANGRY.</p> <p>My hand, bleeding now, but my anger not spent, propelled me outside where I picked up the empty washing basket, which was made from a heavy, durable plastic. I hurled the basket with great force towards an outside wall, which not only caused the plastic to shatter but an arch of blood to spray from my hand through the air. Plastic shards and blood rained from the sky. The urge to primal scream was strong.</p> <p>Instead I took my bleeding hand inside \u2013 not even feeling pain yet, just a slight dissipation of rage and also curiosity about it (what the hell just happened? Am I \u2026 losing it?) and went to reply to an email before realising I was still bleeding \u2013 all over the keyboard.</p> <p>I sat outside and waited to calm down \u2013 but still the rage was there. An old Smashing Pumpkins lyric took on an eerie, fresh meaning: \u201cDespite all my rage/ I am still just a rat in a cage.\u201d</p> <p>My hand had stopped bleeding but was now throbbing, as I thought of all the introverts, happy at home, quilting and darning their socks by the fire \u2013 never wanting this to end ever. They like their cage. But I want out.</p> <p>My mate Trav called. I told him about the rage. He laughed. He had been there last week. \u201cIt\u2019s rock bottom, dude, but that\u2019s the worst it will get \u2013 and from here, you\u2019ll feel better.\u201d</p> <p>Pure anger and rage are not emotions I experience frequently \u2013 they are once-a-year things that come from nowhere and always stun me with their enormous surge of energy and power and the way they scramble things in their aftermath. Pure rage shifts things quickly. Directed at another person in full throttle it can alter the relationship irrevocably. Atoms and patterns shift around it. Rage can also have an immensely clarifying effect. In its wave you suddenly become viscerally aware of your limits and feeling.

But he cautioned: \u201cWe need to do even better than that \u2026 so when we move to a less restricted environment, we can identify outbreaks very quickly and respond to them.\u201d</p> <p>His government has proposed a mobile app that would trace the movements of patients.

But while some companies will see robust demand, the overall impact will be negative.<br></p> <p>She explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An important aspect of the economic effects of Covid-19 is that they will be highly asymmetric. Firms that relied on social interaction or non-essential visits have had to close down temporarily, while others that can offer services remotely or by delivery have been less directly affected. Recent analyses have highlighted the different ways spending might be affected in sectors that can remain open.</p> <p>On the one hand, firms that offer substitute products will see demand increase: for example, purchases of food from supermarkets instead of cafes and restaurants; or streaming of films or television in place of cinema trips or live entertainment. But on the other hand, all sectors will suffer from falls in demand owing to lower income and increased uncertainty elsewhere in the economy. In my view, the latter effect is likely to dominate. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>So what is the Bank of England doing about it?</strong> Tenreyro, a member of the monetary policy committee, explains they have cut interest rates to record lows, launched a new scheme to encouraging lending, and announced another \u00a3200bn of QE.</p> <p>That could help the economy recover, she hopes.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A crucial aspect is that much of its economic impact should ultimately prove temporary: many businesses that were viable and jobs that were needed before Covid-19 will be so again after it passes.</p> <p>A key task for policy in the interim is to try to minimise those business failures and reduce job losses that would otherwise lead to persistent scarring effects. By doing so we want to prevent any lasting reduction in the supply capacity of the economy and help offset any persistent negative effects on demand.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland/status/1250783150348910594\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Silvana Tenreyro examines the impact of Covid-19 on the UK economy.

  "<p>For almost two centuries Who\u2019s Who has catalogued the aristocratic and highbrow \u201crecreations\u201d of Britain\u2019s elite, but many are now striving to convey a life more ordinary, it seems.</p> <p>Researchers examining entries in the establishment bible, have found a correlation between elites embracing the more common pursuits of football and pop music at the same time as rising inequality.</p> <p>As the top 1% of the population pulls economically further ahead from the rest, elites, it would appear, are keen to stress their \u201cordinariness\u201d as they become increasingly sensitive to public opinion, and afraid of being labelled \u201csnobbish, self-interested and out of touch\u201d.</p> <p>Academics analysed the recreations listed of more than 70,000 entrants in Who\u2019s Who since 1897, as well as the musical choices of more than 1,000 guests on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Desert Island Discs.</p> <p>Over the 120-year period, they found a significant shift from traditional aristocratic pursuits, such as hunting and opera, to more \u201ceveryman\u201d interests of family and pets. The trend was particularly marked in the past 30 years.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0003122420912941\">research</a> was conducted by Dr Sam Friedman, an associate professor at the department of sociology at the London School of Economics, and Dr Aaron Reeves, a senior research fellow at Oxford University\u2019s department of social policy and intervention. They found elites were more recently adopting a blend of the highbrow and ordinary, suggesting an attempt to find commonality with the rest of the population, while still signifying their eliteness.</p> <p>It was most clear from the 1990s onwards, said Friedman, \u201ccoinciding neatly with the continuing rise of the top 1%. Of course, this is only an association. Yet, we would speculate that these patterns may be connected.</p> <p>\u201cPut simply, as elites have pulled away economically, there is mounting evidence that they are increasingly insecure about their moral legitimacy, and increasingly sensitive to public concern they are snobbish, self-interested and out of touch.\u201d</p> <p>How elites presented their cultural lives had become a key PR battleground, he said. \u201cPerforming ordinariness may provide a very effective means of shoring up authenticity in an era of rising inequality.\u201d</p> <p>Friedman likened it to Boris Johnson declaring his hobby of making model buses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/boris-johnson-reveals-he-makes-models-of-buses-to-relax\">during</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/boris-johnson-reveals-he-makes-models-of-buses-to-relax\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/boris-johnson-reveals-he-makes-models-of-buses-to-relax\">last year\u2019s Conservative leadership campaign</a>, \u201cwhen he actually enjoys incredibly highbrow painting and Greek literature\u201d, which he chose not to talk about.</p> <p>Reeves said it mattered what people played on Desert Island Discs, which was an even more public performance of cultural identity. \u201cTony Blair famously convened a focus group \u2013 as he did for many things \u2013 to help him calculate what to play,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Examining Who\u2019s Who, researchers found three distinct historical periods. In the 19th century, landed gentry pursuits of hunting, shooting, polo and sailing were common, influenced by the \u201cseason\u201d in the elite social calendar.</p> <p>At the turn of the 20th century, as \u201cnouveau riche\u201d industrialists infiltrated high society, the elite turned to London-centric theatre, ballet, classical music, literature and opera, influenced in particular by the Bloomsbury Group, which included figures such as Virginia Woolf.</p> <p>The third phase began in the 1950s, when the art world legitimised popular cultural forms, alongside a generational decline in snobbery and deference, Friedman and Reeves said in their paper. That phase first reveals a rise in entries mentioning football, cinema, and mundane practices like spending time with family, friends and pets.</p> <p>Reeves said: \u201cThe move towards mundane and everyday leisure pursuits doesn\u2019t necessarily mean elites are actually becoming ordinary, of course.\u201dMore, it revealed how they wished to present themselves. Researchers found traditional aristocratic recreations, like horse-riding and polo, were still mentioned alongside the more commonplace.</p> <p>Elites were, perhaps, trying to forge a sense of commonality and connection, added Friedman. \u201cAnd the way they do that is to try to cultivate a cultural profile that they feel looks like the \u2018everyman\u2019.\u201d There was also a trend towards humour in listings, for example, \u201cloud music, strong cider\u201d.</p> <p>Who\u2019s Who, which has been published annually since 1849, was an \u201cunrivalled\u201d record from which to analyse how elites signalled their superior social position via the consumption of culture, the research states.</p> <p>Just 0.05% of the UK population was featured. Part of its appeal was its understanding of eliteness as not necessarily confined to the landed or wealthy. Half of entrants are included automatically on attaining prominent public positions, such as MPs, peers, FTSE 100 chief executives. The other half are chosen by a board based on prestige, influence or fame.</p> <p>The academics\u2019 paper From Aristocratic to Ordinary: Shifting Modes of Elite Distinction is published in<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/home/asr\"> American Sociological Review.</a></p>",

In addition to supplies, Dr Hod estimates that the university will need to build up an inventory of 400 units of plasma in its blood banks to support this study. A single Covid-19 survivor can provide enough plasma to treat two or three other patients.</p> <p>Once a national resource of convalescent plasma has been gathered, academic laboratories will need to work with industry partners to extract the antibodies so that they can create hyper-immune globulin, vials of purified antibodies, which are easy to ship worldwide (unlike plasma). This is already done with treatments for rabies, for example.</p> <p>\u201cIf we continue to have a supply, that might buy us time to develop new vaccines or new treatments [that can defeat the virus],\u201d he adds.</p> <p>Fortunately for researchers, the supply side of the equation has been solved by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/COVID19survivorcorps/\">Survivor Corps</a>, a growing grassroots movement of 32,000 Covid-19 patients and survivors. The group posts regular updates of blood centres accepting donations and links to clinical trials.

It wound up getting the attention of Congressman Tom Suozzi, who intervened to have her tested.</p> <p>\u201cI vowed from the beginning that if I was going to be the canary in the coalmine, I was going to be the loudest canary there was,\u201d says Diana.</p> <p>A lawyer-turned-photographer, she chronicled her journey to recovery through <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/03/20/coronavirus-diary-day-1-long-island-mom-describes-symptoms-testing-struggles/\">a video diary series with the New York Post</a>, covering everything from how to set up the perfect isolation room to a magic show her son performed outside her bedroom window.</p> <p>We need to take the fear out of all this, says Diana. To that end, she has recorded her experiences giving blood to Columbia, Vir Biotechnologies and numerous other initiatives, all in an effort to demystify the 32-minute procedure, which she described as painless.</p> <p>\u201cIt was one of the most satisfying moments of my entire life, including getting married and having children.

But the truth is: the country\u2019s capacity to test for coronavirus is being wasted. Meanwhile, NHS workers are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KailashChandOBE/status/1250096564078600192\">under-protected and under-tested</a>. On Wednesday alone, more than <a href=\"https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/\">700 deaths</a> were recorded in the UK due to Covid-19. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52278825\">One in five deaths</a> are now linked to coronavirus. These numbers are dreadful, and yet they are likely to be an underestimate: the government\u2019s figures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/care-homes-coronavirus-why-we-dont-know-true-uk-death-toll\">cover only hospital deaths</a>, but new data revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/uk-care-home-providers-report-521-coronavirus-deaths\">521</a> Covid-19 deaths in the past few weeks in the care homes of two leading service providers. Strikingly, these firms account for only 3% of all care homes. The true death rate in the UK\u2019s care homes, and in the country overall, could be much higher.</p> <p>Testing is a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-51916707/who-head-our-key-message-is-test-test-test\">crucial component</a> of any public health response to an epidemic, and a key way to reduce deaths. And in UK laboratories, we now have the capacity to test tens of thousands of samples. Yet, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/england-coronavirus-testing-has-not-risen-fast-enough-science-chief\">suggested</a> that the UK has not been increasing its testing capacity quickly enough. And Prof Chris Whitty, England\u2019s chief medical officer, said Germany \u2013 which can now test more than 500,000 people a week \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/uk-must-learn-from-german-response-to-covid-19-says-whitty\">got ahead</a>\u201d in its ability to test for coronavirus. Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public#history\">statistics from the Department of Health</a> show that while our cumulative deaths climbed from 4,900 on 5 April to almost 13,000 today, the number of tests carried out in the UK has stagnated at about 12,000.</p> <p>When health secretary Matt Hancock visited our Milton Keynes laboratory last Thursday, he avowed that our jobs were crucial, and thanked us for our service. Our workplace, where we test patient samples for the virus, has been called the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/health-secretary-launches-biggest-diagnostic-lab-network-in-british-history-to-test-for-coronavirus\">biggest diagnostic lab network in British history</a>\u201d, with capacity to process more than 5,000 swabs, eventually projected to reach 30,000 swabs per day. And yet at our testing centre on Tuesday this week, we processed just over 1,000 samples. The day before, the total was 1,300, and three days ago 1,800.</p> <p>Our shifts were meant to be excruciating 12-hour marathons. In reality, they are rather more like laid-back morning jogs. Dozens of academics and laboratory personnel from all over the UK languish in a hotel with nothing to do. Millions of pounds of equipment borrowed from universities and companies rests silently in the evening hours, when the noise of our collective toil should be deafening.</p> <p>The problem does not lie in the laboratories, or the personnel. The UK has an army of skilled researchers at its disposal. More than 1,200 scientists had volunteered their expertise in the fight against coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/19049\">in Cambridge alone</a> by early April. Dozens signed up to help in Milton Keynes. The equipment and reagents are all available, now that Thermo Fisher Scientific has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/us-firm-says-on-track-give-uk-100000-coronavirus-tests-day-thermo-fisher-scientific\">confirmed it will supply the UK</a> with all the testing kits it needs. And \u201cscale up\u201d has been the mantra at Milton Keynes since I arrived last Monday. We were promised 5,000 samples \u201cto begin with\u201d. We never saw those numbers. They told us we should prepare for a 24-hour operation, but we are done in four or five.</p> <p>Disappointment abounds \u2013 and understandably so: all the staff, volunteers and managers have mobilised in an unprecedented manner for the mission. They created a world-class Covid-19 diagnostic centre from scratch in a couple of weeks, with precise protocols, standard operating procedures and training expertise to go with it. The tests are accurate, quality control checks are run daily and improvements constantly implemented. The lab continues to scale up and expand, with new robots and automated procedures coming online every day. The expertise and dedication of the frontline staff and management is truly commendable. It is proof of the excellence of the UK bioscience sector.</p> <p>So, what is the problem? Where is the bottleneck? Maybe it is simply that fewer people were tested over the Easter weekend. But the virus does not respect holidays. Some days, we have been told that more than 4,000 swabs were offered, but people did not take advantage of them. Fine \u2013 but surely those swabs could be repurposed, and the spare capacity redirected? And even if test numbers do pick up today, or tomorrow, the rate of increase is far too slow for both the scale of this emergency and what our laboratories can handle</p> <p>We are all being let down by a government that may have decided testing is, after all, not that important, despite the successful examples set by South Korea and Germany. On 12 April, the United States performed 140,000 tests. Italy more than 48,000. Turkey 35,000. Germany is averaging 50,000 a day. In the UK, total tests numbered just short of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DHSCgovuk/status/1250416371453669377\">16,000</a> on Tuesday. Just in our lab, we could have easily done 8,000.

That means that absent a vaccine or effective coronavirus treatment, reopening should be gradual and only occur when the rate of new infections has slowed substantially, hospital capacity is sufficient, effective testing is in place and we are able to effectively trace and quarantine those who are infected or potentially infected.</p> <p>That, in turn, implies that a key way to reduce the length of the lockdown is through health investments \u2013 ventilators, personal protective equipment, hospital bed capacity \u2013 and through hiring a small army of contact tracers and testers.</p> <ul> <li><p>Heidi Shierholz is director of policy at the Economic Policy Institute and served as chief economist at the US Department of Labor</p></li> </ul> <h2>Robert Reich: \u2018The economy will only reopen when we feel safe\u2019</h2> <p>The US economy won\u2019t \u201creopen\u201d because the president says it should (even if he had the power, which he doesn\u2019t). It won\u2019t even reopen after most governors who have ordered it shut with \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders officially end those orders.</p> <p>The economy will fully reopen only when the vast majority of Americans feel it\u2019s safe to return to teeming workplaces, crowded shopping malls, packed airplanes, busy downtowns, thronged subways and buses, jam-packed sporting events and all the other places we swarmed before the pandemic.</p> <p>When will we feel safe enough? That will depend in part on testing and tracing sufficiently widespread that Americans see that the virus is under some degree of predictable control. It may ultimately depend on the development and dissemination of a vaccine to protect against it.</p> <p>This much is certain. Most won\u2019t feel safe as long as thousands continue to die each day from Covid-19. They may not feel safe even after deaths have \u201cpeaked\u201d and we\u2019re on the downslope of the horrifying curve.</p> <p>The worst outcome would be for Americans to feel goaded into returning to work earlier than is prudent because political leaders remove what little of the extra safety nets Americans have relied on during these frightening weeks \u2013 with the result that coronavirus cases and deaths surge once again.</p> <p>This would postpone indefinitely the reopening of the economy.

More information is necessary to make good decisions on when and how to open the economy. While we slowly improve our understanding of who <em>has</em> the virus, the goalposts are shifting toward the need to understand who has <em>had</em> the virus. <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/15/999600/what-is-serological-testing/\">Serology testing</a> tells us who has at least partial immunity, which both improves our ability to gauge how easily the virus will spread and also presents the possibility for governments to <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/10/immunity-certificates-covid-19-practical-ethical-conundrums/\">certify immunity</a>. Many countries have begun discussing issuing \u201cimmunity certificates\u201d as a pathway to returning to work.

Healthier people are less likely to be absent or voluntarily quit and are, no surprise, more productive and less likely to exhibit presenteeism \u2013 being physically at work but not able to concentrate. What is true for health in the workplace generally is also true for the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Workplaces struggling to control the virus face absence, turnover, possible collective action and productivity issues. Therefore, the only time to open up the economy is when there are sufficient testing and contact-tracing resources to map the disease (which at present there are not), and sufficient healthcare resources and preferably scientifically validated treatments to be able to cope with a flare-up of cases (which again there are currently not).</p> <p>Opening up the economy too soon and confronting an enormous rise in deaths will inevitably scare everyone and lead to worse economic dislocations and a longer period of restrained economic activity as people become more risk-averse. The cost-benefit analysis of opening too soon is highly asymmetric, even without considering the sanctity of human life. Moreover, I hope we learn something: public health systems and agencies starved for resources offer no slack or resilience in the face of suddenly appearing, new diseases. Governments around the world need to build health infrastructures that are adequately resourced and staffed to face the pandemics that are becoming much more frequent.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jeffrey Pfeffer is the Thomas D Dee II professor of organizational behavior at the graduate school of business at Stanford, and author of 15 books including Dying for a Paycheck</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Destitute migrants in the UK are continuing to sleep on the streets despite a promise from Boris Johnson that all of them would be given shelter during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Last month Johnson <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scotrefcouncil/status/1242820979535097857\">pledged</a> to provide all necessary accommodation and support for destitute migrants, including those with no recourse to public funds.</p> <p>But a range of organisations including <a href=\"https://www.crisis.org.uk/\">Crisis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pilc.org.uk/\">Public Interest Law Centre</a>, <a href=\"https://migrantsrights.org.uk/\">Migrants Rights Network</a> and Project 17 have said this promise has not been kept.</p> <p>They say many destitute migrants continue to sleep on the streets either because councils have turned them away when they try to access emergency support or because, in the absence of clear government guidance, they do not know how to go about getting this support.</p> <p>Migrant rough sleepers are often more hidden than other rough sleepers because of their fears of being picked up by immigration enforcement teams.</p> <p>The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government told the Guardian that more than 90% of rough sleepers \u201cknown to local authorities\u201d at the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis had been made offers of accommodation, although officials did not say how many were in accommodation. Many migrant rough sleepers are not known to local authorities.</p> <p>Migrant rough sleepers interviewed by the Guardian say they have been turned away when they tried to access the promised support and have had to remain on the streets.</p> <p>One 58-year-old refused asylum seeker from Nigeria, who has been trying to lodge a fresh asylum claim with the Home Office for the past 16 months, has been sleeping on the streets for several years. He said he often slept around London\u2019s Barbican Centre.</p> <p>\u201cI am struggling to get food because many charities I usually go to to get food are closed. I am surviving thanks to some of the people who live in the Barbican who are giving me food,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He added that after Johnson\u2019s announcement last month he approached a London council\u2019s homeless unit and asked for emergency housing. \u201cThey turned me away and said I wasn\u2019t eligible,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t explain to me why they couldn\u2019t support me.\u201d</p> <p>Public Interest Law Centre, Project 17 and Migrants Rights Network wrote to local authorities this week warning that migrant rough sleepers were still not receiving assistance.</p> <p>\u201cThe ongoing failure to provide appropriate support to all those who need it regardless of immigration status is not only a moral failure \u2026 it also poses a serious public health risk leaving migrants unable to socially distance and, where needed, self-isolate,\u201d the letter said.</p> <p>A migrant who has been granted leave to remain but is unable to work during the pandemic said he had contacted the jobcentre to try to get support but had got nowhere.</p> <p>\u201cI am forced to sleep outside at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cMy friend is letting me go to his house just to take showers. I\u2019m very frightened of catching Covid while I\u2019m sleeping outside. I sleep outside in a mask and gloves.\u201d</p> <p>Matthew Downie, Crisis\u2019s director of policy and external affairs, said: \u201cThe government made a commitment to house everyone sleeping rough, regardless of their immigration status, and put the onus on local authorities to make this happen. There has, however, been a lack of guidance on how this should be done. We know that there are people whose lives are still in danger, sleeping on our streets or trapped in crowded hostels and night shelters.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the housing ministry said: \u201cOver 90% of rough sleepers known to local authorities at the beginning of this crisis have now been made offers of safe accommodation, ensuring some of the most vulnerable in society are protected from the pandemic.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cIn these unsettling times, we will ensure the most vulnerable in our society receive the protection and funding they need and deserve. Even if an asylum claim is failed, we will provide accommodation for those who would otherwise be destitute and who are temporarily unable to leave the UK because of the ongoing travel restrictions.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The NHS is in a standoff with Apple and Google after the two tech firms refused to support the UK\u2019s plans to build an app that alerts users when they have been in contact with someone with coronavirus.</p> <p>Apple and Google are encouraging health services worldwide to build contact-tracing apps that operate in a decentralised way, allowing individuals to know when they\u2019ve been in contact with an infected person but preventing governments from using that data to build a picture of population movements in aggregate.</p> <p>But the policies, unveiled last week, apply only to apps that don\u2019t result in the creation of a centralised database of contacts. That means that if the NHS goes ahead with its original plans, its app would face severe limitations on its operation.</p> <p>The app would not work if the phone\u2019s screen was turned off or if an app other than the contact tracer was being used at the same time. It would require the screen to be active all the time, rapidly running down battery life, and would leave users\u2019 personal data at risk if their phone was lost or stolen while the app was in use.</p> <p>A spokesperson for NHSX \u2013 the the health service\u2019s digital transformation arm \u2013 denied claims of a \u201cstandoff\u201d, saying: \u201cThis suggestion is completely wrong. Everyone is in agreement that user privacy is paramount, and while our app is not dependent on the changes they are making, we believe they will be helpful and complementary.\u201d<strong> </strong></p> <p>The limitations mirror problems faced by Singapore, which released its contact-tracing app, TraceTogether, before Apple and Google announced their policies. The app, which has a three-star rating on Singapore\u2019s App Store, has been installed by just 12% of the population.</p> <p>\u201cThe important thing here is, if you want your iPhones to work with this in your country, then you\u2019ll need to effectively adhere to Apple\u2019s standard of privacy for the system,\u201d said Dr Michael Veale, a lecturer in digital rights and regulation at UCL.</p> <p>\u201cApple have said that the standard of privacy that they are demanding is a decentralised system. Otherwise, it will be very difficult to get iPhones to work with it without a workaround that will just stop people using it.\u201d</p> <p>The limits exist because modern smartphones tightly control what apps can do with technologies such as Bluetooth, in order to prevent infringements of privacy. On iPhones, for example, a normal app has strictly limited access to Bluetooth unless it is running in the \u201cforeground\u201d \u2013 meaning actively on screen and in use \u2013 in order to prevent apps from surreptitiously tracking users without consent.</p> <p>The NHS had been hoping those limits would be lifted for Covid-19 contact-tracing apps, according to a source with knowledge of the app development.</p> <p>On Friday in a joint announcement, Apple and Google announced their intention to do that, introducing a new set of tools that public health authorities could use from May to build apps that can perform contact tracing in the background.</p> <p>But the new tools, which come in the form of an API that lets developers code apps with special access to Bluetooth, strictly limit the information that public health authorities can gather. Most importantly, a public health authority cannot ask a phone to gather a list of every other phone it has been in contact with.</p> <p>Instead, it can only perform a much more limited version of contact tracing, which involves sending every phone in the system a list of other phones that have been reported as contagious, and asking them, in effect, \u201chave you seen this phone?\u201d said Veale.</p> <p>The limits will prevent the NHS from obtaining useful information about population flows in the aggregate, tracking \u201cnear misses\u201d or receiving information about contacts from people who have opted into the system but not recently checked their phones.</p> <p>On a press call to journalists on Tuesday evening, Google said those limits were in place because neither company wanted to provide functionality in their operating systems to allow for surveillance efforts that could be abused.</p>",
  "<p>The fear of infection has always been intimately related to the fear of foreigners. \u201cKEEP OUT THE GERMS\u201d, the Daily Mail declared in a front page editorial on 3 January 1962, as panic about a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-18365385\">smallpox outbreak</a> spread across Britain. By \u201cgerms,\u201d the Daily Mail really meant foreigners: the editorial singled out Pakistani migrants who arrived from the \u201cendemic home of the disease\u201d, where there was then a smallpox epidemic, and \u201cwalked in [to Britain] without any trouble and were at once a peril to the population\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-us-asian-americans-racism\">'Coughing while Asian': living in fear as racism feeds off coronavirus panic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That spring, the Conservative government passed the 1962 Commonwealth Immigrants Act, finally ending free movement within the Commonwealth and remaining colonies. The health scare surrounding \u201cimported\u201d smallpox \u2013 Britain believed that it had long left this disease behind \u2013 coincided with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/11/it-isnt-just-racism-that-should-bar-enoch-powell-from-a-blue-plaque\">Enoch Powell\u2019s stint as </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/11/it-isnt-just-racism-that-should-bar-enoch-powell-from-a-blue-plaque\">minister of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/11/it-isnt-just-racism-that-should-bar-enoch-powell-from-a-blue-plaque\">health</a>, and helped to nullify parliamentary opposition to the new legislation. As one Labour MP complained, the Conservative government had made border controls \u201ca matter of life and death\u201d, as if immigrants put the health of the nation at stake. If colonial subjects couldn\u2019t be ruled, it seemed, they were neither safe nor welcome.</p> <p>Today, the coronavirus pandemic poses a far more serious threat to national health than the smallpox epidemic, which led to fewer than 100 cases in Britain. Debate rages as to what our post-pandemic world will look like. Socialists, nationalists, internationalists, liberals \u2013 all see reason to believe, or hope, that the future belongs to them. For now, however, it\u2019s hard not to think we\u2019re living in a dystopian version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/23/labour-nationalism-working-class-support\">Blue Labour\u2019s Britain</a>: left on the economy, right on culture, a stronger state, tighter borders \u2013 we\u2019re all (locked) in this together.</p> <p>In many ways, the pandemic fits most neatly into nationalist narratives: there are few more powerful or reactionary forces in politics than fear, and this is surely the pandemic\u2019s most viral emotion. The outbreak of xenophobia accompanying the fear of infection has been well documented since coronavirus emerged. The disease was first portrayed as a distinctly \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\">Chinese virus</a>\u201d, originating in Wuhan, and people perceived as Asian were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-us-asian-americans-racism\">subjected to racist attacks</a> around the world. Yet there seems less acknowledgment that this divisive, hostile symptom of the outbreak will likely outlive the disease. In China, for example, where cases of infection have sharply declined, black people are being subjected to random testing and evicted from their homes over anxieties about \u201cimported coronavirus\u201d. Everywhere you look, as Susan Sontag observed in <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12216695-000-the-fatal-power-of-language-review-of-aids-and-its-metaphors-by-susan-sontag/\">Aids and Its Metaphors</a>, there is the same need \u201cto make a dreaded disease foreign\u201d.</p> <p>The link between \u201cgermophobia\u201d and xenophobia is a recurring theme in politics. The left has not been immune from this trope. In 1958, for example, when tuberculosis was the disease-du-jour, the Trades Union Council warned the Ministry of Labour against Indian and Pakistani immigration, drawing on classic xenophobic anxieties. Key among their concerns were \u201cthe poor health of these immigrants and the belief that many of them are carriers of contagious and infectious diseases\u201d.</p> <p>But a wealth of research suggests that not only is the fear of infection more pronounced on the right, but also \u2013 more worryingly \u2013 that political attitudes become more conservative and reactionary as fears of infection rise. Indeed, one of the primary causes of \u201cgermophobia\u201d is living in cultures that stress hygienic practices (for good reason, that accounts for much of the world right now). A <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21421934\">2011 study</a> conducted at Cornell University suggested that even standing people next to a hand sanitiser dispenser or asking them to wash their hands is enough to make them identify as more conservative. In another <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886912001055\">2012 study</a>, researchers from Hong Kong found that people who were shown scenes from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/apr/04/my-guilty-pleasure-outbreak\">Outbreak</a><em> </em>\u2013 a 1995 film set in the midst of an epidemic \u2013 became more conformist in their views, wanting to align themselves with a perceived majority. It\u2019s easy to see how, on a societal scale, this could feed into more xenophobia.</p> <p>At times, such studies about politics and germs stray into the dubious terrain of evolutionary psychology. Rather than acknowledging the political prejudices that could lead one to be hostile towards perceived \u201coutsiders\u201d, a fear of strangers is said to spring \u201cnaturally\u201d \u2013 apolitically, a-culturally \u2013 from the human aversion to infection. But as the anthropologist Mary Douglas showed in her 1966 book <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/coronavirus/2020/03/coronavirus-disease-dirt-racist-language-immigration\">Purity and Danger</a>,<em> </em>defining what counts as \u201cdirty\u201d (not to mention who counts as a \u201cstranger\u201d) is a cultural act: it is at least as much about identity formation \u2013 defining \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d \u2013 as it is about hygiene.</p> <p>The grim frequency with which dirt and disease are associated with \u201cdangerous\u201d outsiders speaks to the emotional force of this narrative. From portraying minorities as \u201cvermin\u201d to casting concerns about immigration as concerns about public health, the political expedience of this conflation has been affirmed again and again. According to a recently <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3560326\">published working paper</a>, the Republican party\u2019s weaponisation of the Ebola crisis in 2014 \u2013 stoking paranoia and blaming immigration \u2013 played an important role in their resounding victory in that year\u2019s midterm elections.</p> <p>None of this bodes well for our situation, where the fear of infection is already being mobilised to reactionary ends in countries such as Hungary, India, Israel and Algeria. \u201cWe are fighting a two-front war,\u201d Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n declared last month, shortly before imposing coronavirus laws that amount to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/01/viktor-orban-pandemic-power-grab-hungary\">de facto dictatorship</a>. \u201cOne front is called migration and the other one belongs to the coronavirus. There is a logical connection between the two as both spread with movement.\u201d</p> <p>In the US, Donald Trump \u2013 a self-described \u201c<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/germaphobe-trump-hates-people-coughing-and-sneezing-in-his-presence-2019-7?r=US&amp;IR=T\">germophobe</a>\u201d \u2013 plays the same blame game. Even as he downplays the crisis, his popularity in the polls remains strong. To almost every critic of his slow response, he points to how quickly he introduced a travel ban against China, and insists on calling the disease the \u201cChinese virus\u201d \u2013 ignoring that the US is on course to be the worst-affected industrialised country in the world.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s been here before. On the campaign trail in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/06/donald-trump-mexican-immigrants-tremendous-infectious-disease\">he warned </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/06/donald-trump-mexican-immigrants-tremendous-infectious-disease\">of</a> \u201ctremendous infectious disease \u2026 pouring across the border\u201d. Now, Trump says simply, \u201cwe need a wall more than ever\u201d \u2013 he was right all along. The belief that barbed wire, if we can only build it high enough, will \u201ckeep out the germs\u201d is an attractive placebo for reactionary fears. And it will take more than the pandemic finally passing for this illusion, and all its toxic consequences, to lift. </p> <p>\u2022 Samuel Earle is a writer based in London</p>",

People have been forced to accept a 10pm curfew. </p> <p>And it seems to have worked to protect the Romanian health system from a tsunami of cases. Despite big numbers of Romanian migrant workers returning from Spain and Italy at the height of the pandemic in southern Europe, the rate of Covid-19 infection and death in Romania has remained broadly under control.</p> <p>Until, that is, the imperatives of the asparagus supply chain kicked in. Pressed by German agriculture lobbies, the Berlin government asked the Romanian government to grant a bespoke exemption from the lockdown and <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2020/04/10/germany-flies-in-seasonal-workers-with-strict-coronavirus-precautions\">clear an airbridge for farm workers</a>.</p> <p>The Romanian government agreed, admitting that it had no income support system for this group of workers, who are usually invisible to the media unless as an object of class-driven scorn. So the asparagus imperative trumped the pandemic, even though Germany had earlier banned foreign workers and the Romanian lockdown was about to be prolonged for a further month.</p> <p>What followed was an epic stampede of thousands of workers to board low-cost flights specially chartered for the massive airbridge. Many had received their contracts on social media apps, others were raked in by able intermediaries, but all ended up crammed into the same nighttime bus rides to the airport. The <a href=\"https://www.romania-insider.com/coronavirus-romanian-seasonal-workers-fly-germany\">ensuing images</a> were shocking: a country in strict quarantine watched thousands streaming out of crammed busses into a small regional airport to board the planes.

But when the Romanian workers take the virus back home with them or when their backs break, the German health service won\u2019t have to look after them. German employers will send them back home before the 115-day exemption from social security contributions runs out.</p> <p>The burden of any treatment will fall on the Romanian health system, the same one that has lost doctors and nurses to Germany and that is never likely to see a cent of the revenue generated by the sale of the crops.</p> <p>Below the same radar of media and political attention, thousands of Romanian and Bulgarian women have headed to Austria\u2019s assisted living homes, because it turns out that rather than resource social care properly, Austria prefers to farm out the job to cheaper easterners.</p> <p>In many ways the asparagus cutters, salad pickers and care workers represent the most efficient form of labour in Europe: cheap, highly productive, untaxed even if humiliated and a potential public health hazard. Europe\u2019s political economy has created the post-communist universal soldier, capable of converting from farm labourer to caregiver to construction worker as the the season changes. Freedom of movement has morphed into migration for survival and even that privilege is reserved for the physically fit.</p> <p>At the end of the day the huddled masses from the planes heading to the fields of Germany or Italy can rely on neither their own country nor the European Union. This begs tough questions about what east Europeans have a right to expect after years of EU membership: is this it?</p> <p>Why can we not demand a different Europe and renegotiate the social contract with it? Why is it so hard to guarantee the safety and the dignity of cross-border workers rather than reducing them to a dehumanised \u201clabour supply\u201d accessible with an app? Why does even the western left withdraw into fantasies about protected labour regimes while millions of east European workers toil under their noses? Why is the movement of millions of people in and out of quarantines, doing essential but undervalued work, not a European issue?</p> <p>EU enlargement to the east gave millions of workers an opportunity to survive.

Meanwhile, Siddharth Varadarajan, the well-known journalist and a founder-editor of the respected investigative online portal <a href=\"https://thewire.in/\">the Wire</a>,<em> </em>faces prosecution in an unrelated case. While locking down its vast population from coronavirus, why is India seeking to lock up dissident intellectuals and intimidate journalists?</p> <p>The three men have been accused of outrages ranging from assassination plots to promoting \u201cenmity, hatred or illwill among classes\u201d \u2014 allegations that have been widely criticised as politically motivated. But their apparent common crime is one that underlies the harassment and intimidation of scores of other journalists, writers, academics and human rights campaigners in India. They have criticised the actions of the hardline Hindu nationalist dispensation that rules India today, as well as the culture of divisive bigotry that it has fostered widely in civil society.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The last six years of Modi\u2019s government have seen an alarming crackdown on campus dissidents as well as journalists and writers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Navlakha is a longstanding critic of state and army atrocities in the disputed region of Kashmir, which has faced a disgraceful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/23/kashmir-city-srinagar-india-lockdown-calls-protest-march\">lockdown since August</a> last year and continues to experience unconstitutional \u2014 and, in corona-ridden times, dangerous \u2014 limits on internet access. He is accused, along with respected figures like the poet Varavara Rao and trade unionist Sudha Bharadwaj, of <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/india-arrests-activist-anand-teltumbde-2018-dalit-event-200414112452191.html\">allegedly conspiring</a> in a plot against Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2018. Teltumbde, related by marriage to India\u2019s towering Dalit leader and constitution-drafter, Babasaheb Ambedkar, has been <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-52279301\">remanded in custody</a> in the context of violence in the town of Bhima Koregain in 2018. Ironically, Teltumbde has written in the past about how the Indian state seeks to \u201cdiscredit and eliminate individuals it deems a threat to its apparatus.\u201d</p> <p>Varadarajan, whose platform the Wire has previously fallen foul of powerful and wealthy figures with strong connections to the government, faces a different set of charges. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, there have been strong moves in the Indian media and sections of the ruling dispensation to pin blame for the spread of the virus on Muslim communities. Yogi Adityanath, a fundamentalist Hindu cleric turned politician with a good line in inflammatory speech, is the chief minister of India\u2019s largest state, Uttar Pradesh, where tensions have been rising. Although the Wire misattributed a quote to him on its website, the erratum was quickly corrected and acknowledged.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Varadarajan now stands accused of a fantastical range of crimes, including disobeying an order of a public servant and creating or promoting enmity between classes. The real problem may be that the Wire <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/up-chief-minister-adityanath-shifts-ram-idol-amid-lockdown/article31160225.ece\">reported correctly</a> that Adityanath had attended a Hindu religious gathering after the national lockdown was declared on 24 March. This report came even as public feelings have been whipped up against Muslims because Tablighi Jamaat, a Muslim organisation, held an event prior to the lockdown where many attendees did get infected. The Wire has also noted that \u201cbelievers\u201d in more than one religious community have been late in adopting precautions against large gatherings.</p> <p>For a long time now, India has benefited from the title of world\u2019s largest democracy (meaning, in fact, the most populous democratic state). That grand moniker continues to lull the world into believing constitutional rights and freedoms thrive in that nation, when they are in fact under grave threat. Although the misuse of state powers to intimidate principled journalists and of religious divides to garner votes has occurred under other governments, including those of the current Congress opposition, there is little doubt that the last six years of Modi\u2019s government have seen an alarming crackdown on campus dissidents as well as journalists and writers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://cpj.org/data/killed/asia/india/?status=Killed&amp;motiveConfirmed%5B%5D=Confirmed&amp;type%5B%5D=Journalist&amp;cc_fips%5B%5D=IN&amp;start_year=1992&amp;end_year=2020&amp;group_by=location\">Fourteen journalists</a> have been killed in India since Modi\u2019s election in 2014. (In the 10 preceding years when the opposition was in power, 17 journalists were killed.) Journalists routinely face intimidation, legal proceedings and restrictions on accessing information. Female reporters deal with constant online harassment, including threats of sexual violence. Three prominent rationalists who have challenged Hindu orthodoxy have been murdered in recent years. A widely condemned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/18/india-clamps-down-against-citizenship-law-protests\">2019 Citizenship Amendment Act</a> promises fast-track citizenship to select religious minorities claiming asylum from neighbouring countries, conspicuously discriminating against Muslims.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-targeting-muslims-spread-in-india\">Coronavirus conspiracy theories targeting Muslims spread in India</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Donald Trump wrongly claims his government has \u201cabsolute power\u201d, we know from the case of Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who has seized sweeping <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">emergency powers</a> in Hungary, that the global lockdown against the virus can strengthen authoritarian forces if not strenuously guarded against. It will take a vigilant citizenry and media to stop that from happening. In India it is precisely dissident intellectuals like Teltumbde, journalists like Varadarajan and committed activists like Navlakha who are leading the defence of pluralism and democracy. It is of the utmost importance that the world speaks up for them and stands by them now. For, in doing so, we stand up for ourselves and a world we will want to see changed for the better after the pandemic, one in which we can all breathe more freely.</p> <p>\u2022 Priyamvada Gopal is an academic at Cambridge University and author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/insurgent-empire-9781784784126.html\">Insurgent Empire: Anticolonial Resistance and British Dissent</a> (Verso, 2019)</p> <p>\u2022 Salil Tripathi is a journalist, human rights campaigner and chair of the <a href=\"https://pen-international.org/who-we-are/committees/writers-in-prison\">Writers in Prison Committee of PEN International</a><br></p>",

In 2017 he pulled the United States out of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/oct/12/unesco-expresses-deep-regret-at-us-decision-to-leave-organisation-video\">UNESCO</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/jun/01/donald-trump-us-will-withdraw-from-paris-agreement-video\">Paris climate accord</a>.

Their true feelings are only revealed when their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/04/footage-appears-to-show-world-leaders-joking-about-trump-at-nato-summit\">private conversations</a> are accidentally overheard. This time it\u2019s different. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simoncoveney/status/1250348979595792392\">Simon Coveney</a>, the foreign minister of Ireland, a country with exceptionally close ties with the United States, described Trump\u2019s decision to cut funds to WHO as an \u201cindefensible decision, in midst of global pandemic. So many vulnerable populations rely on WHO \u2013 deliberately undermining funding and trust now is shocking.\u201d Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister was slightly more restrained, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeikoMaas/status/1250322386907357185\">tweeting</a> that: \u201cBlaming does not help. The virus knows no borders\u201d. In the UK, however, where ministers are still hoping for a post-Brexit trade deal, a Downing Street spokesman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/15/coronavirus-us-live-trump-decision-cut-who-funding-sparks-outrage-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5e9702b88f08213494be7188#block-5e9702b88f08213494be7188\">rejected an invitation</a> to join the condemnation, although they did voice support for the WHO.</p> <p>Why undermine the organisation that is at the forefront of responding to a pandemic? For Trump, this seems particularly illogical \u2013 the pandemic has already killed <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa/u-s-coronavirus-death-toll-tops-30000-new-yorkers-told-to-wear-masks-idUKKCN21X25I\">more than 30,000 Americans</a>. The answer is<strong> </strong>simple. In the midst of an election year, with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/trump-poll-numbers-dip-handling-coronavirus\">approval ratings</a> falling, Trump needs to find someone else to blame. Now that the daily White House briefings have taken on the role of campaign rallies in locked down America, nothing can be allowed to undermine the narrative that he is the saviour of the American people. Failings are the fault of others. Once it was the Mexicans <strong>(</strong>ironically, Mexico is now <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52053656\">restricting Americans from entering</a> the country<strong>)</strong>. Then it was China, whose political leaders Trump considers insufficiently obsequious. Now, he has redirected his ire at the WHO.</p> <p>It hardly needs to be said that Trump has justified his decision with claims that fail to withstand the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-trump-halts-funding-to-world-health-organization\">basic scrutiny</a>. He claims that the WHO was \u201cseverely mismanaging and covering up\u201d the early stages of the pandemic, thereby delaying the response by the United States. Yet the WHO had warned of person-to-person transmission as early as 23 January. Six days later, his economic adviser <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/donald-trump-coronavirus-memos-warning-peter-navarro\">warned</a> of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of American deaths. Trump ignored them both.</p> <p>The decision will clearly damage the WHO. First, there is the loss of funding. As the world\u2019s richest country, the United States contributes 40% of the WHO\u2019s core budget, although this only amounts to 20% of its total spending. The US also contributes the largest share to the remaining 80% of voluntary contributions.</p> <p>The US theoretically contributes roughly<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/world-health-organization-why-has-trump-suspended-funding\"> 10-15% of the WHO\u2019s budget</a> as its largest contributor. It\u2019s uncertain whether Trump can legally block payments to the WHO\u2019s core budget, as these are authorised by Congress<strong>,</strong> but he could stop those voluntary payments made by federal agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control.</p> <p>With a total contribution of a <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/trump-is-desperate-to-find-someone-to-blame-for-his-coronavirus-failings\">little under $900m</a>, roughly what the NHS spends in 36 hours, other countries could step up to the mark to replace at least some of this shortfall. However, the decision will likely have a disproportionate effect on areas where the United States has made substantial earmarked contributions, such as polio eradication. More importantly, this is a massive distraction for an organisation working flat out to tackle one of the most serious threats to the health of everyone, including Americans, in decades.</p> <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the weaknesses of individual leaders and international cooperation. In a world where Jair Bolsanaro can threaten the world by allowing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/21/jair-bolsonaro-accuses-ngos-setting-fire-amazon-rainforest\">Amazon</a> to burn<strong>,</strong> or Donald Trump can undermine those leading the response to a pandemic, the need for a new international order has never been more urgent.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>Martin McKee is professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and an adviser to the World Health Organization</p>",

  "<p>March was supposed to be a big month for James Hayes.</p> <p>He and other organizers with <a href=\"https://www.ohioansforraisingthewage.org/\">Ohioans for Raising the Wage</a> have been campaigning to gradually raise the state\u2019s minimum wage \u2013 currently $8.70 an hour \u2013 to $13. The organizers planned to be stationed at the polls throughout the state during the primary election to get voters , already in a civic mindset, to sign petitions to help them get the measure on the ballot. They need to gather <a href=\"https://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Legal/Ballot-Initiatives/Initiative-and-Referendum-Signature-Requirements\">442,958</a> signatures by 1 July to make that happen.</p> <p>But the Covid-19 pandemic waylaid the campaign. Ohio essentially canceled in-person voting for its primary, now at the end of April. Organizers have stopped collecting signatures to comply with state orders to avoid public contact \u2013 a strategy that these campaigns traditionally heavily rely on.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day we lose \u2026 the amount of volunteer hours and the resources goes up as well. It\u2019s really difficult,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cIt\u2019s heart-wrenching.\u201d Hayes and his group <a href=\"https://aboutblaw.com/PU7\">filed a lawsuit</a> in state court seeking to extend the deadline for collecting signatures.</p> <p>Ballot measures are a critical way of allowing activists to bypass partisan legislatures and allow voters to directly enact policies, something currently allowed in<a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/chart-of-the-initiative-states.aspx\"> some form in more than two dozen states</a>. They can be extremely expensive and take considerable organizing work to succeed.</p> <p>In recent years these efforts have been used to achieve sweeping expansions of democracy in the country, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/09/florida-amendment-4-felons-voting-rights-response-activists\">repealing</a> Florida\u2019s lifetime ban on felon voting, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/a/midterms-2018/ballot-initiatives\">expanding Medicaid</a>, and creating an independent redistricting commission in Michigan. The initiatives have been so successful that Republicans in several states have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/us/referendum-initiative-legislature-dakota.html\">tried</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/16/florida-amendment-4-ruling-voting-rights\">gut</a> them or<a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/12/after-voters-passed-progressive-ballot-initiatives-gop-legislatures-are-trying-to-kill-future-ones/\"> make it harder to get referendums </a>on the ballot.</p> <p>Now, those efforts could be in peril as organizers face fast-approaching deadlines to gather tens of thousands, in many cases hundreds of thousands, of signatures. If social isolation measures persist, and lawmakers don\u2019t ease restrictions, these measures won\u2019t be on the ballot in November, leaving voters without a chance to vote on crucial reforms like expanding voting, LGBTQ rights and limiting gerrymandering.</p> <p>Though state lawmakers are scrambling to find alternatives for people to vote in upcoming elections, there has been no parallel effort to make it easier for organizers to get measures on the ballot for November.</p> <p>While organizers in Ohio could try again next year, that\u2019s not an option for Andy Moore, the director of People Not Politicians, who is based in Oklahoma. After the governor declared a state of emergency there, the secretary of state <a href=\"https://www.examiner-enterprise.com/news/20200331/state-questions-unlikely-to-make-oklahoma-ballot\">paused</a> all signature collection efforts.</p> <p>People Not Politicians needs <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Signature_requirements_for_ballot_measures_in_Oklahoma\">177,958</a> signatures to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot that would strip Oklahoma lawmakers of their ability to draw electoral districts and instead give it to an independent commission evenly divided between Democrats, Republicans and Independents. Because redistricting takes place once every 10 years, and the next round is early next year, this is the last chance to reform the process for the next decade.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a free pass to politicians to gerrymander yet again,\u201d said Moore, whose group is still awaiting final approval to collect signatures. Once the measure is approved, they will have 90 days to collect the signatures. The effort has already had to cancel house parties and a planned 5K run in the shape of a gerrymandered district.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury of waiting until next year,\u201d said George Shelton, who is leading a similar anti-gerrymandering effort in Arkansas. Unable to work towards the<a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Signature_requirements_for_ballot_measures_in_Arkansas\"> 89,151 </a>signatures they need to make the ballot, organizers are educating people online about what they can do to fix gerrymandering. Shelton and organizers have until 3 July.</p> <p>Organizers are considering different options to combat this epic hurdle. They\u2019re looking for new ways to get people to sign petitions, and posing legal challenges seeking to force state officials to extend the deadline or lower the number of signatures they need to get, said Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, the executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, a group that works on progressive ballot initiatives.</p> <p>Moore also said officials should allow activists to gather signatures online. But that\u2019s currently not allowed in any state, said Amanda Zoch, who works on elections at the National Conference of State Legislatures. States have long required in-person, handwritten signatures for ballot signatures and tightly regulate who can collect them.</p> <p>A handful of efforts to allow voters to submit electronic signatures for referendums <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Electronic_petition_signature\">failed</a> in recent years. In California, one of the referendums stalled by Covid-19<a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/California_Electronic_Signatures_for_Initiative,_Referendum,_and_Recall_Initiative_(2020)\"> is an effort to create</a> a law to allow organizers to collect signatures for future referendums electronically.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a killer. We\u2019re done,\u201d said Michael Liddell, who organized the effort. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in even turning anything in. We\u2019re not going to make it.\u201d Some activists, he said, are requesting that California officials grant referendum organizers an extension to turn in signatures and let them collect signatures online.</p> <p>In Arizona, candidates can gather signatures online to qualify for the ballot, but organizers must still collect signatures in person to make a referendum appear on it. Activists <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=az+central&amp;oq=az+central&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l4j69i60l3.1236j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">filed lawsuits</a> in both state and federal court in recent weeks to be allowed to collect signatures online. Republicans in the state are opposing that request, <a href=\"https://tucson.com/news/state-and-regional/arizona-gop-urges-judge-to-reject-online-signatures-for-ballot-measures/article_8edf5b1d-b193-5b42-9708-ff13961b1b02.html\">citing the potential for fraud</a>.</p> <p>Some organizations are still forging ahead amid the Covid-19 outbreak.

In Michigan, organizers supporting a referendum to expand<a href=\"https://secure.everyaction.com/TsVTMVk1V0KDsfaSrRbYyA2?utm_source=ema_2020-03-18_covid19signaturegathering&amp;ms=ema_2020-03-18_covid19signaturegathering&amp;utm_campaign=covid19signaturegathering&amp;utm_medium=ema&amp;emci=43d33e39-4d69-ea11-a94c-00155d03b5dd&amp;emdi=ac74e709-5b69-ea11-a94c-00155d03b5dd&amp;ceid=2706163\"> LGBTQ protections</a> are allowing people to request petitions online that are then mailed to them to sign. Utah\u2019s Governor Gary Herbert, a Republican, <a href=\"https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/4/2/21203003/olympia-hills-referendum-approved-salt-lake-county-council-governor-gary-herbert-executive-order\">issued</a> an executive order allowing organizers to distribute petitions electronically, but is still requiring Utah voters to sign them by hand and mail them in.</p> <p>But those efforts may be not be enough. Gathering enough signatures to get a measure on the ballot, even when there isn\u2019t a pandemic, requires herculean levels of organizing and funding. Moore said he gave up a full-time job at the University of Oklahoma running its infectious disease clinic (the irony is not lost on him, he said) to do this work.</p> <p>\u201cAt this point, with this epidemic, I don\u2019t think anybody really knows what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said.</p>",

  "<p>Margaret Atwood, who has created dystopias from Gilead to the collapsed civilisation of Oryx and Crake, has spoken: our locked-down world might be \u201can unpleasant, frightening, disagreeable place you don\u2019t want to be\u201d, but it is not dystopian.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p089krk9\">Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live\u2019s Emma Barnett</a>, Atwood said that \u201ca dystopia, technically, is an arranged unpleasant society that you don\u2019t want to be living in. This one was not arranged. So people may be making arrangements that aren\u2019t too pleasant, but it\u2019s not a deliberate totalitarianism. It\u2019s not a deliberate arrangement.\u201d</p> <p>What it is, said Atwood, is \u201can emergency crisis\u201d. \u201cBeing in an unpleasant situation such as the blitz, that\u2019s not a dystopia. It\u2019s an unpleasant, frightening, disagreeable place you don\u2019t want to be, but it wasn\u2019t arranged by a government that is in control of you,\u201d said the author of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.</p> <p>Atwood compared the conspiracy theories about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/07/how-false-claims-about-5g-health-risks-spread-into-the-mainstream\">5G spreading the coronavirus</a> to reactions when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/12/inequality-pandemic-lockdown\">the plague hit Europe in the 14th century</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWhen there\u2019s an epidemic of panic, people long for something to blame, because if you can find the thing to blame, you can eliminate the threat,\u201d she said. \u201cSo during the Black Death the following people got blamed pretty much in this order: lepers, as they went from town to town; Gypsies, because they travelled around; Jews, for all of the usual reasons. And witches, you know about those witches? Just causing plagues all over the place. So if you could if you could destroy all those people then maybe you wouldn\u2019t have the plague. I guess the impulse is always to burn something.\u201d</p> <p>The conspiracies around 5G have led to phone masts being attacked and burned. \u201cAt least they\u2019re not burning people yet,\u201d said the two-time Booker prize winner.</p> <p>Atwood also criticised how politicians have been using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/donald-trump-boris-johnson-coronavirus\">warlike language to describe their approach to the pandemic</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI mean lucky old you if you\u2019ve got a good immune system and probably nice medical care. But because somebody doesn\u2019t come through, doesn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t a fighter. It\u2019s a \u2018blame the victim\u2019 kind of thing \u2013 they didn\u2019t fight hard. So I don\u2019t use that kind of language about it. It\u2019s not a war.\u201d</p> <p>She predicted that the crisis would lead to the world valuing health workers and universal healthcare a lot more. \u201cYou can see the kind of chaos that\u2019s going on south of the border,\u201d said the Canadian author. \u201cSome states just aren\u2019t getting support, and they don\u2019t have plans and things are really quite difficult there. Let us also not forget we\u2019ve had these alarms before, we even had plans for dealing with pandemics. And then when there wasn\u2019t a pandemic, they got put on the shelf and and a lot of countries just were not ready for this, which they could have been had they remembered.\u201d</p> <p>Atwood, whose partner Graeme Gibson died in September, said that life has been \u201cdifficult, ever since September, but I\u2019ve had some practice being alone.

That time period \u2013 known as the access period \u2013 will now be reduced to a minimum of one day. </strong></p> \n  <p>Importantly, employers will still need to meet the essential conditions required under the \u201cgenuine agreement\u201d test that is ultimately determined by the Fair Work Commission. This is a safeguard to ensure workers are able to make informed decisions about changes affecting the way they work. Employees will also still be able to vote down a proposed change to agreements.</p> \n  <p>These changes have also been time-bound and will revert to the usual 7 day period automatically in six months. Having listened to concerns raised by the ACTU, the Attorney-General has also determined to review the operation of the changes in two months to assess whether the system has been operating effectively without misuse. If substantial evidence were to emerge that the changes are not operating effectively, the time period can be altered again at that point of two-month review.</p> \n  <p>Importantly, the regulation change applies to all businesses with employees covered by EBA\u2019s, including those not eligible for JobKeeper payments.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThese changes are designed to enable companies to deal swiftly with urgent issues that are arising in their workplaces, such as health and safety issues associated with COVID-19,\u201d Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations, Christian Porter said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cFor example, businesses that have urgently needed to divide their workforce up into teams that rotate between working from home and in the office for social distancing reasons, haven\u2019t been able to quickly implement those changes due to the mandatory access period.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIn some cases, delays have been impractical and prevented employers from taking effective steps to improve the safety of their staff, or to ensure their businesses were able to function efficiently during these difficult and fast-changing times.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThese changes are only temporary and will expire in six months, in line with other changes to working arrangements that have been recently adopted, such as the amendments to the Fair Work Act that were necessary to facilitate the roll out of the $130 billion JobKeeper package and I intend to review the operation of the change two months after it becomes effective.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e97f4308f08cf571cdb1ed1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T05:59:32.208Z\">6.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The ACTU and <strong>Sally McManus</strong> is not:<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cSome employers have not stopped demanding rights be taken off working people. We saw some openly try to force changes to the Fair Work Act that would undermine people\u2019s job security and rights at work in the lead up to Jobkeeper becoming law, those attempts were opposed by the union movement and were rightly refused by all political parties.</p> \n  <p>\u201cHaving been denied a legislative pathway for their power grab those employers, who have not suffered serious downturn, have spent the last week lobbying the government to take away workers\u2019 rights via regulation, they should be condemned, and the Government should stop listening to them.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBy agreeing to these changes Christian Porter would be using his power to abolish rules that protect workers, their job security and their rights at work.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThese changes will allow employers to ram through reductions in pay and undermine job security.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe current rules ensure workers have adequate time to consider any proposal to change an enterprise agreement, to discuss this with their employer, other workers and to seek advice. This change effectively takes away all these rights leaving workers exposed to employers seeking to exploit the fear caused by the pandemic and to pressure workers into rushed agreements, locking out their access to advice.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe are already seeing widespread abuse of the JobKeeper system, prior to the pandemic Australian business had an enormous problem with wage theft. We know that, sadly, too many employers will exploit the system if there are no safeguards for working people.

from the Pacific, 68 shipments of PPE, 35 deployments to countries assisting Fiji with the testing capability, establishing Covid-19 isolation facilities in Timor-Leste, this is the same grade three there in the summer measles outbreak of last year, the polio outbreak in PNG in 2018 and they do work in the western Pacific on eliminating measles, rubella and tetanus, preventing diabetes and

In short, leaders emphasise the value of providing education within classroom settings, but acknowledge that it is up to state and territory governments and the non-government school sector to make operational decisions. <br></p> \n  <p>There is also a need for schools to offer teachers and staff a safe working environment.</p> \n  <p>The full list of principles is as follows:</p> \n  <p>1. Our schools are critical to the delivery of high quality education for students and to give our children the best possible start in life. Our education systems are based on the recognition that education is best delivered by professional teachers to students in the classroom on a school campus.</p> \n  <p>2. It is accepted that during the Covid-19 crisis, alternative flexible, remote delivery of education services may be needed.</p> \n  <p>3. Our schools must be healthy and safe environments for students, teachers and other staff to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of education to students.</p> \n  <p>4. State and territory governments and non-government sector authorities are responsible for managing and making operational decisions for their school systems respectively, subject to compliance with relevant funding agreements with the Commonwealth.</p> \n  <p>5. Decisions regarding the response to Covid-19 in the schooling sector must continue to be informed by expert, official, national and state-based public health and education advice, consistent with these national principles.</p> \n  <p>6. All students must continue to be supported by their school to ensure participation in quality education during the Covid-19 crisis.</p> \n  <p>7. The health advice consistently provided by the AHPPC is that attendance at a school campus for education represents a very low risk to students. <br></p> \n  <p>The advice also notes that appropriate practices must be employed at schools, like at other workplaces, to provide a safe working environment for school staff, including teachers, and that the specific AHPPC advice regarding school campuses should be followed.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e97e34c8f0895d83068ef2e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T04:48:48.444Z\">5.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Election promises need to be 'reconsidered'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is the first time <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> has admitted that the policies he took to the election can\u2019t stand up in a post-Covid Australia:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>They also highlighted, though, the need to make sure on the other side of the virus, as we make our road out, <strong>that any sense of business as usual when it comes to the policy framework we had at the election will need to be reconsidered on the other side.</strong> <br></p> \n   <p><strong>To make sure we can achieve growth that will be necessary for our economy to get people back into work, economy back on track, it will be a different world on the other side of the virus and there will be many challenges,</strong> and the national cabinet has a very good appreciation of this, and there has been some talk about its role on the other side of the virus, and that is a discussion for another day. <br></p> \n   <p>But between now and as we continue to work through the impact of the virus, the national cabinet will have on its agenda the types of things and policy measures take together, working at federal and state level to make sure we can give our economy every support and more importantly every freedom to be able to get on and see businesses grow on the other side.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T04:51:28.355Z\">at 5.51am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e97e3308f0895d83068ef2d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T04:47:05.897Z\">5.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Scott Morrison:</strong><br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Our intention has now been turning to the road out, having worked through the road in. <br></p> \n   <p>That road to recovery on the other side as well. <br></p> \n   <p>Importantly today at national cabinet we received quite extensive briefings from the governor of the Reserve Bank and the secretary of Treasury, Dr Kennedy. <br></p> \n   <p>At those briefings it was reinforced again to the national cabinet on a point that we strongly concur with the need to synchronise our health and economic responses to the virus.

the journalist <strong>Annika Smethurst</strong>\u2019s high court case, which found the warrant used to raid her home was invalid, but was split on what the AFP could do with the materials it seized.</p> \n  <p>(<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/15/high-court-rules-afp-warrant-for-raid-on-news-corp-journalists-home-was-invalid\">Paul Karp has covered the case here</a>.)</p> \n  <p>The Law Council of Australia has responded to the case outcome, rightly pointing out the issues with Australia\u2019s public interest journalism protections:<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Pauline Wright</strong><em>:</em><em><br></em></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Law Council remains concerned about the adequacy of public interest protections where warrants authorise investigative action involving journalists and media organisations, whether they are suspected of having committed an offence or whether they are simply third parties who may be in possession of information. </p> \n   <p><strong>The law continues to leave journalists and media organisations exposed to possible police investigation and prosecution. </strong></p> \n   <p>The Law Council believes that any similar case in the future could be avoided through law reform measures to protect and recognise the importance of public interest journalism and to incorporate greater accountability mechanisms. Protections might include contested hearings, the involvement of a Public Interest Advocate to test the warrant process and a requirement that warrants may only be issued by a judge of a superior court of record. </p> \n   <p>Australia\u2019s media is critical to holding government and its agencies accountable for their actions and scrutinising the exercise of power. Transparency and accountability lead to better decision-making and a stronger democracy that protects rights and freedoms and upholds the rule of law. This case is a reminder of the ongoing vulnerability of public interest journalism within the current legal framework. </p> \n   <p>We will continue to call for stronger protections to provide an essential balance in the face of the extensive powers Australia has given our law enforcement and security agencies. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T00:20:57.499Z\">at 1.20am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e979ca68f08ea7431f439f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/ben-butler\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T23:46:06.560Z\">12.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Shares in Virgin Australia have been suspended from trade as the grounded airline desperately seeks a bailout.<br></p> \n  <p>The stock went into a trading halt two days ago but has so far been unable to secure a lifeline amid furious political debate over whether it should be rescued by the government.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWhilst this consideration and these discussions have continued over the last two days including discussions which remain confidential and are incomplete, the company is not presently in a position to make an announcement to the market with respect to these matters,\u201d Virgin Australia told the exchange on Thursday morning.<br></p> \n  <p>As Guardian Australia has reported, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/virgin-australia-considers-going-into-administration-as-labor-calls-for-government-rescue\">options under consideration include putting the company into administration</a>.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T23:50:33.262Z\">at 12.50am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e979bdc8f08ea7431f439f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T23:45:38.701Z\">12.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Most of these seem legit to me.

Several times, the kind, aged bartender explained we were in a <em>nomihodai</em>. The problem was, we didn\u2019t know what that meant. We cautiously ordered one drink each and \u2013 on his insistence \u2013 a glass of sake. He was so hospitable and tried to serve us food and more drinks but, still uneasy, we politely declined.

This precipitated a mad rush to get him on the last night ferry to Islay, through the tail end of Hurricane Dorian.

It accused them of avoiding their obligations.</p> <p>Xingxing\u2019s account said she provided forensic and video evidence to police. She also alleged that a police officer put his hand on her neck to recreate one of her allegations against Bao during questioning, and that officers allowed Bao to be in the same room as her.</p> <p>Her story prompted countless women and girls to share stories of their own abuse and the failure of authorities to respond appropriately, and to question the lack of sex education for young people in the country.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know why sexual assault of minors occurs again and again?

The government should work with anti-harassment activists instead of silencing them,\u201d said the researcher Doriane Lau.</p> <p>\u201cIn general, we have seen the government taking steps to tackle the prevalence of sexual harassment in China, such as including sexual harassment protections in the amended Civil Code,\u201d Lau said.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, civil society groups and actors doing anti-sexual harassment activism continued to face severe persecution from the authorities.\u201d</p> <p>In its 2019 country report, Human Rights Watch said the Chinese government \u201cremains hostile to women\u2019s rights activism\u201d.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Pei Lin Wu</em></p>",
  "<p>Bill Shankly once remarked: \u201cSome people believe football is a matter of life and death. I am very disappointed with that attitude. I can assure you it is much, much more important than that.\u201d It is often quoted but, at a time when the world is battling to control a virus that has taken the lives of more than 100,000, it has never been more inapt.</p> <p>Heroes at a time of lockdown are not to be found on fields, courses or empty grounds but in hospitals, care homes, supermarkets, warehouses, or behind the wheel, risking their health, and lives, for a salary that takes the best-paid footballers in Britain a morning to earn.</p> <p>When life returns to, not what it was, but a time when the fear of an unseen enemy has gone - which will be when a vaccine is available - sport will be one of the many businesses picking up the pieces. In rugby, unions and clubs have been hit hard financially, with Australia having to make the most drastic cutbacks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/15/no-bailout-for-rugby-australia-as-world-rugby-warns-sanzaar-nations-of-domino-effect\">No bailout for Rugby Australia as World Rugby warns Sanzaar nations of domino effect</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Laurent Marti, the president of Bordeaux-B\u00e8gles, said this week: \u201cWe have to save French rugby, 80% of a club\u2019s expenditure is player salaries.\u201d That explains a problem for clubs in England and France: as income has steadily risen over the years, the gains have tended to be reflected in the salaries of players, with clubs effectively no better off than they were 20 years ago.</p> <p>Facilities have improved, but largely through borrowing. No club has been able to build up any reserves, which is why the effect of the lockdown was felt immediately as income all but dried up. There are three main strands to a club\u2019s turnover: television, sponsorship and attendances. All three will need to be rebuilt.</p> <p>Premier League football clubs may discover that the golden eggs laid by television will contain less precious metal in future, but the medium will remain reliant on a sport that is a driver for subscriptions. A question is, how many who currently pay will stop, either because their financial circumstances have changed or because they no longer think it is worth it? As one person said this week, after recovering from the virus, what seemed important before doesn\u2019t now.</p> <p>The sponsorship market is likely to take a hit, which will affect unions as well as clubs. Corporate packages will become a harder sell as companies cut their marketing budgets and sport becomes seen by many as a no-longer-affordable luxury. With Premiership clubs giving up 27% of their central income to CVC, in return for \u00a312.5m each last year which most used more to mop up debts than invest, the squeeze will be tight, with one forecaster predicting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/uk-economy-could-shrink-by-35-with-2m-job-losses-warns-obr\">UK economy could shrink by 35</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/uk-economy-could-shrink-by-35-with-2m-job-losses-warns-obr\">% by June</a>.</p> <p>Which leaves the supporters, loyal followers passing through the turnstiles who were largely taken for granted. How many clubs used their increased turnover to subsidise admission prices (other than for matches they were taking to bigger grounds like Twickenham or Wembley) or slow the frequency that kits changed?</p> <p>Rugby will need to re-engage with paying supporters, if not to the extent of football whose lavishly paid players have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/15/arsenal-players-reject-pay-cut-demand-wage-deferral\">held firm against pay cuts</a>, agreeing only to deferrals, despite recent weeks showing that football\u2019s model, where wages are generally far too high as a percentage of turnover, is unsustainable.</p> <p>They have come up with various arguments about pay cuts, including one where the exchequer would suffer, as if none of them has ever considered a tax avoidance scheme. Unlike rugby players, who are showing realism and responsibility, they are standing apart from those who pay to watch them, heroes no more.</p> <p>Season-ticket renewal will not be made without pause for thought. The question is not whether paying \u00a31,300 for 26 matches at the Emirates Stadium represents value for money but whether it is time to take a stand against a sport that despite massive revenue gains \u2013 Arsenal\u2019s annual turnover is \u00a3396m \u2013 demands more and more from fans: clubs now have three kits rather than two and change every season rather than every 24 months, for example.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/14/richmond-may-be-sustainable-model-for-the-future-of-championship-rugby\">Richmond may be sustainable model for the future of Championship rugby | Paul Rees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rugby is not there yet, but will unions still find a market for tickets priced well into three figures for international matches? The assumption seems to be that when the action resumes everything will pick up again, but one epidemiologist predicted this week that he did not see fans being able to go to sports events until a vaccine exists for coronavirus, which could be a year or more away.</p> <p>And, anyway, a number of supporters are likely to want to keep their distance for some time after the restrictions are lifted, with fears of a second Covid-19 outbreak. The longer they go without watching sport the greater the danger of them breaking the habit, never mind the financial question.</p> <p>The time off gives unions and clubs the chance to look at the way they operate. It is clear to those involved in the club game that it has to break the reliance on the backing of individuals, something the CVC deal was intended to address, and start living within budget.</p> <p>It would mean lowering the salary cap and trimming squads, ditching the Premiership Cup perhaps, and shortening the season. And considering whether the England squad should be contracted by the RFU while registered with clubs. That prospect would be anathema to owners who have invested hundreds of millions of pounds to elevate the club game, but this is a period when dreams must give way to reality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p><em><strong>This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

This is Naaman Zhou bringing you the main stories on Thursday 16 April.</p> \n<h2>Morrison lays out three conditions for restrictions to be lifted</h2> \n<p>The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said current restrictions would continue for at least four weeks but there are three conditions that need to be met before they are eased. They are: increased testing, better contact tracing (\u201clifted to an industrial capability\u201d) and the ability to lock down localised areas, similar to what happened in the Tasmanian north-west this week. Morrison also says some of the Coalition\u2019s election \u201cpolicy framework\u201d may not be able to be delivered once the crisis is over.</p> \n<h2>Stuart Robert claims app swaps phone numbers</h2> \n<p>The minister for government services, Stuart Robert, has said the government\u2019s proposed coronavirus tracking app <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshgnosis/status/1250636195253501952\">will work by swapping the mobile phone numbers </a>of people who are in close proximity.

Previously, if an employer moved to change an EBA, workers had seven days to consider it before voting to accept or reject.

  "<p>Downing Street needs to accelerate planning for exiting the coronavirus lockdown because contact tracing, testing and social distancing will be needed \u201cindefinitely\u201d until a vaccine is discovered, Prof Neil Ferguson, one of the leading epidemiologists advising the government, has said.</p> <p>Ferguson, whose team at Imperial College provided the modelling that led to the lockdown, said data suggested infections were coming down but life would not get back to normal quickly after the lockdown is eased.</p> <p>As ministers prepare to extend the lockdown for three weeks, attention is turning to what happens when it might be possible to ease the restrictions.</p> <p>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, expressed extreme frustration about being asked to explain the government\u2019s exit strategy in broadcast interviews on Wednesday, saying: \u201cEverybody wants to know what the future looks like. The question is how do we best get through the crisis and how do we get the numbers down.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe thing is this: how we communicate as government, as ministers, has a direct impact on the cases we have and the people who die. Because clarity of messaging that people need to stay at home ... that saves lives. This core messaging has a direct impact on how many people follow the guidelines. The scientists can say what they like, the commentators can say what they like, but we will do our best by dealing with this virus.\u201d</p> <p>Hancock said Ferguson \u201cadvises government, he is not in the government\u201d.</p> <p>Ferguson said he would like to see the government move faster to put a plan in place for what happens when measures are partially lifted, saying he did not see the same level of planning going on that was put into Brexit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/covid_curves-zip/giv-3902phwqmUrVj0tr/\" > <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/covid_curves-zip/giv-3902phwqmUrVj0tr/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Ferguson told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of discussion. I would like to see action accelerated. I don\u2019t have a deep insight about what\u2019s going on in government, but decisions need to be accelerated. We need to put in place an infrastructure, a command and control structure, a novel organisation.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m reminded we had a department for Brexit for government. That was a major national emergency and we are faced with something even larger than Brexit. And yet I don\u2019t quite see the evidence for that level of organisation. I\u2019d like to see measures accelerated.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian reported on Wednesday that there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/uk-government-has-no-exit-plan-for-covid-19-lockdown-say-sources\">no central plan for exiting the lockdown</a> yet, even though ministers have been floating ideas about which parts of the population might have restrictions lifted first \u2013 from younger people to the immune or different sectors of the economy.</p> <p>Ferguson said it was necessary to ease restrictions at the right time but added: \u201cWe will have to retain some level of social distancing indefinitely until we have a vaccine available.\u201d</p> <p>He said there now needed to be a \u201csingle-minded emphasis on scaling up testing and contact tracing\u201d.</p> <p>He argued that a huge infrastructure of testing and contact tracing would need to be in place in order for the lockdown to be lifted without further peaks, pointing to the model of South Korea, which has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/11/south-korea-beating-coronavirus-citizens-state-testing\">suppressing new outbreaks</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWithout that, our estimates show we have relatively little leeway. If we relax measures too much then we will see a resurgence in transmission,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Ferguson\u2019s remarks suggest he believes the UK should return to a strategy of containment, which was abandoned by No 10 and its chief scientific and medical advisers early in the epidemic, to the concern of public health experts.</p> <p>Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, is one of those who has been arguing for weeks that mass community testing and tracing is necessary, while the government was at that point insisting that a test for antibodies to prove immunity was the most important strategy. Since then, antibody tests have proved hard to develop with any accuracy.</p> <p>Ministers have been trying to ramp up testing since early March, with a target of 25,000 daily by mid-April and 100,000 daily by the end of the month. Hancock denied the existence of the 25,000 target on Wednesday but on Thursday he claimed the government had now reached capacity to do 25,000 tests a day with the help of new drive-through centres for NHS workers.</p>",
  "<p>In 1986, I was 15 and gorging myself on movies of every stripe, so why did I never see Top Gun? My subsequent admiration for Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State proves I\u2019m not immune to the magnetism of its director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/tony-scott\">Tony Scott</a>. And it can\u2019t be that I was averse to the glossy, pumped-up hedonism that was the stock-in-trade of the super-producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, since I\u2019d coughed up my hard-earned paper-round money to see Beverly Hills Cop twice the previous year. Most likely, the deal-breaker was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/tomcruise\">Tom Cruise</a>. He was too much like the jocks with their laminated skin and torch-beam teeth who flicked one another with towels in the PE changing rooms or mimed slap bass to Level 42 at the school disco. I could get all that for free any time; I didn\u2019t need to pay to watch it on screen.</p> <p>My resistance to Cruise weakened in the late 90s, around the time of Jerry Maguire and Eyes Wide Shut, so it was with something less than dread that I sat down recently for a first viewing of Top Gun. Cruise plays the trainee fighter pilot Pete Mitchell, known to anyone who loves him (and boy, does everyone love him) as Maverick. All the characters have nicknames. Maverick\u2019s best buddy is Goose (Anthony Edwards). His nemesis is Iceman (Val Kilmer). Even their superiors are called Viper (Tom Skerritt) and Jester (Michael Ironside). The US navy consultants listed in the end credits have nicknames, too, such as Rat, Bozo and Flex. The only ones who don\u2019t are women: Charlie (Kelly McGillis), the instructor who becomes Maverick\u2019s squeeze, and Carole (Meg Ryan), Goose\u2019s wife. Carole gets two scenes, larking around in the first one and then \u2013 sad face \u2013 grieving over her husband in the second. Should I have prefaced that plot-point with a spoiler alert? I don\u2019t think so. The moment you find out he has a family, this Goose is cooked.</p> <p>On a visual level, Top Gun has everything I would have expected from a film by one of the Scott brothers: smoke, ceiling fans, Venetian blinds. Not to mention an extreme hardware fetish. In lieu of narrative tension, there are shots of fighter planes scarring the sky. When Maverick has a dilemma to mull over, he rides his motorbike near some palm trees at sunset. To express her desire for him, Charlie zooms around in a convertible displaying a reckless disregard for traffic lights. Bogart and Bacall exchanged sizzling repartee, but this pair may as well be reading to one another from a manual. \u201cYou were in a 4G inverted dive with a MiG-28?\u201d Charlie gasps soon after meeting Maverick. She\u2019s thrilled to find a man who knows all about the thrust-to-weight ratio.</p> <p>There\u2019s a disastrous imbalance between the lead actors, and not only because, as Pauline Kael pointed out in her New Yorker review in June 1986, the \u201cstrapping\u201d McGillis is forever slouching, leaning or bending \u201cso she won\u2019t overpower\u201d her smaller co-star. Their skills aren\u2019t evenly matched either. When McGillis is called upon to appear besotted with this grinning bubble of pure ego, this pair of Ray-Bans on legs, the masquerade is as implausible as it is ridiculous. It\u2019s as if Rita Hayworth were making eyes at Joe Pasquale.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa_z57UatDY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xa_z57UatDY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It could be argued that Top Gun needs an actor as limited as Cruise was back then. A superior performer would certainly have been under-stretched by the vacuous script and the long sections where nothing happens of any consequence. Almost the entire movie is taken up by training exercises; as pulse-quickening spectacle goes, it\u2019s as compelling as Quidditch. Only in the final reel is there any high-stakes combat, when the young greenhorns are whisked away from their graduation ceremony (\u201cWe have a crisis situation!\u201d) for an emergency dogfight with Russia. A mere 15 minutes later, Maverick and his colleagues are whooping and punching the air. Like us, they know the film must be nearly over.</p> <p>The only surprise after all these years is how little inventiveness and imagination there can be in a movie that has been so influential. The soft-rock songs on the soundtrack keep emphasising how overheated everything is (\u201cThe further on the edge, the hotter the intensity,\u201d insists <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siwpn14IE7E\">Kenny Loggins on Danger Zone</a>), but few films are so listless and mechanical.</p> <p>I had also been misled by seeing <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111218/\">Sleep With Me</a>, the 1994 comedy in which Quentin Tarantino delivers a monologue (purloined from his Pulp Fiction co-writer Roger Avary) about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZF1LXL6OOsM\">the subtext of Top Gun</a>: \u201cIt\u2019s a story about a man\u2019s struggle with his own homosexuality.\u201d What\u2019s mysterious to me now is why everyone went wild for that Tarantino riff. Because make no mistake: there is no gay subtext to Top Gun. It\u2019s more the case that gayness is the very text itself, the only possible reading available. How else to explain the charged looks and sweaty, nose-to-nose flirting between Maverick and Iceman, the film\u2019s blatant lack of interest in Charlie and her life, or the script\u2019s obsession with anal imagery? (A representative sample: \u201cI\u2019d like to bust your butt but I can\u2019t\u201d; \u201cNail him, nail him!\u201d; \u201cStay on my wing, I\u2019ll take you all the way in\u201d; \u201cI want somebody\u2019s butt and I want it now!\u201d)</p> <p>Looking back, I don\u2019t feel any regret about giving Scott\u2019s film the swerve in 1986 and going instead to see the likes of Aliens, Mona Lisa, After Hours, Desert Hearts, Sid and Nancy, True Stories, Hannah and Her Sisters, Big Trouble in Little China and Jagged Edge. Each of those pictures did what Top Gun couldn\u2019t do: take my breath away.</p>",

Twelve-year-old Elle lives in a British town with her Nigerian grandmother; Mum died in a car crash and Dad left soon after. Elle is autistic, and can find ordinary life a bit tricky. She is a \u201cLeapling\u201d too, born on 29 February, and \u2013 last but definitely not least \u2013 she is one of the few such children who have \u201cThe Gift\u201d, an ability to leap through time.</p> <p>Elle is a pupil at Intercalary International, a school for kids with a variety of special needs, but things aren\u2019t going well for her. Learning to control The Gift is hard, and she is being bullied. She\u2019s looking forward to a school trip, though, a \u201cLeap\u201d to the HQ of the Time Squad in the year 2048. They are the guardians of chronology, an elite group of time travellers who stop criminals from changing the past and rupturing the space-time continuum.

  "<p>Race has always been a tricky subject for Kyle Larson. But, alas, we could not avoid it. He was the biracial Japanese-American phenom who hadn\u2019t just reached Nascar\u2019s highest rung but was being touted as the second coming of Hall of Famer Jeff Gordon \u2026 by Hall of Famer Jeff Gordon. And I am the rare black writer who covers motorsports on a national level. We have to go there.</p> <p>My first meeting with Larson was in the winter of 2014 at a dirt-track racing extravaganza in Tulsa, Oklahoma, called <a href=\"https://www.chilibowl.com/about/\">The Chili Bowl</a> \u2013 an event that definitely causes a chill if you happened to be one of the few non-whites attending for the first time. Larson forever struck me as a reluctant, though accommodating, trailblazer. On the one hand he has a fascinating family history: a mother whose parents were put in a Californian internment camp during the second world war. On the other hand, because of the horror of that experience and the urgency to assimilate afterward, Larson stays mum about that part of his biography.</p> <p>As for the rest, well, it was pretty white bread. To hear him tell it, he grew up no different than many Sacramento boys did in the 90s, inhaling burgers, not speaking Japanese and worshiping at the altar of Gordon. The idea that his own Gordon-esque ascent from dirt tracks to Nascar\u2019s upper echelon would make him a role model to Asian-American fans seemed to leave him as staggered as a blown tire at 200mph. \u201cGrowing up, I didn\u2019t think anything about being Japanese, or [that] I would even have to talk about it when I got older and higher into racing,\u201d he told me back in 2014.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/aug/28/notes-from-an-ungrateful-athlete-why-race-and-sports-matter-in-america\">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: what sports have taught me about race in America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And though he dutifully took on that responsibility \u2013 and the imprimatur of Nascar\u2019s PR-motivated <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_for_Diversity\">Drive for Diversity</a> program despite having little need for the publicity \u2013 it took people like Ryan Iwasaka, an LA-based corporate lawyer who led the effort to name Larson the Japanese Bar Association\u2019s trailblazer of the year, for Larson to appreciate the significance of his role as an agent for inclusion. The more outreach efforts increased, especially when Nascar toured on the West Coast, the more comfortable Larson seemed to be as the face of the sport that Nascar at least aspires to be. \u201cI do feel like I\u2019m making some sort of an impact,\u201d he told me last year.</p> <p>Of course all that went up in smoke on Sunday when Larson was caught calling <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotter_(auto_racing)\">his spotter</a>, a white person, the n-word during a virtual race last weekend. Things escalated quickly. By Monday, Larson was hit with indefinite suspensions from Nascar and his team, Chip Ganassi Racing, which was in full damage-control mode as Chevrolet, McDonald\u2019s, Credit One Bank and other major sponsors distanced themselves from their radioactive racer. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/14/kyle-larson-fired-after-nascar-driver-uses-n-word-during-virtual-race\">By Tuesday, Larson was out of a job</a>. This, after his brief social media apology tour on Monday where, among other things, Larson apologized to \u201cthe African American community\u201d and conceded \u201cthe damage is probably unrepairable\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KyleLarsonRacin/status/1249732388625752065\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/RPsp7ARIea\">pic.twitter.com/RPsp7ARIea</a></p>&mdash; Kyle Larson (@KyleLarsonRacin) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KyleLarsonRacin/status/1249732388625752065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 13, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>All the while Larson made Nascar a trending topic for all the wrong reasons at a time when there is little else to talk about in sports. Everyone from Stephen A Smith to Charlamagne Tha God to New York Mets pitcher Marcus Stroman (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/STR0/status/1250044580977938433\">who, apparently, is spoiling for a fight</a>) has registered an opinion on Larson\u2019s heel turn. That it couldn\u2019t have happened to not only a nicer guy, but also stock car racing\u2019s model minority, is a twist only the whitewashed world Nascar could offer.</p> <p>Still, let\u2019s be clear: Larson got what was coming to him. Not only is the 27-year-old far too smart for teenage gamer hate speech, but he\u2019s been in the racing game long enough to know the job doesn\u2019t stop when your entire industry moves into the virtual world. What\u2019s more, he just saw Bubba Wallace, the Cup series\u2019 resident black driver, lose sponsorship after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/06/bubba-wallace-quits-nascar-iracing-motorsports-bristol\">he quit an iRace</a> in frustration.

It gives Nascar too much credit for champions of inclusion when, last I checked, the sport still turns a blind eye to fans <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2017/08/19/confederate-flag-still-important-symbol-nascar-fans/583320001/\">who drape themselves in Dixie flags</a> and Maga hats and whose 40-odd car Cup grid is now down to three diversity program drivers \u2013 Wallace, Aric Almirola and Daniel Su\u00e1rez. It gives Ganassi Racing too much credit for severing ties when, last I checked, there was no Nascar racing going on and <a href=\"https://nascar.nbcsports.com/2019/12/04/kyle-larson-says-his-dirt-track-racing-will-be-key-to-next-contract/\">Larson\u2019s contract was set to expire anyway</a>. (\u201cI told Kyle he can come back from this,\u201d team owner Chip Ganassi told the Associated Press. \u201cHe can even come back from this with our team.\u201d) And it gives his sponsors too much credit for seeming principled when, last I checked, none of them pressure their on-track rivals to nurture drivers who aren\u2019t white male legacy kids. Or, more globally, to pressure their corporate neighbors to make their prejudicial practices in hiring \u2013 and pay and career advancement and lending and living \u2013 a thing of the past.</p> <p>That right there is the real privilege \u2013 the power to oppress, a power that Larson hints at with his use of the n-word but doesn\u2019t have anymore, if he ever had it all. Nascar may even have done Larson a favor by banishing him. More than any young driver Larson, who figured to be the prize of the offseason free-agent market, seemed like he could take or leave Nascar. When he finally did conquer the Chili Bowl earlier this year, after 13 tries he called it the biggest victory of his career, paying short shrift to his six career wins in Cup. He seemed like he would be perfectly happy racing out of the spotlight on dirt tracks and living a much smaller, much simpler life.</p> <p>Certainly, he\u2019s made enough money \u2013 an estimated $10m in 2018 alone \u2013 to make the downsize seamless. But the most disappointing part about Larson\u2019s fall from grace, the most stunning off-track crash I\u2019ve witnessed in my years on the Nascar beat, are the more odious, more bigoted elements of racing fandom coming forward to pledge their allegiance to a driver who looks for all the world like another white-passing Asian who\u2019s down for the cause.</p> <p>No doubt Larson is the biggest loser in all this. But mark my words: he\u2019ll recover. (To paraphrase the activist filmmaker Tariq Nasheed: Traffickers of white supremacy are <em>transferred</em>, not fired, only to return \u201crehabilitated.\u201d) Less certain is whether the progress Larson came to represent will ever get back on track.</p>",
  "<p>An American woman who travelled to the UK to help her heavily pregnant daughter has claimed she was told to go back to the US by border officials at Heathrow on the grounds that her journey was not \u201cessential\u201d.</p> <p>The 63-year-old woman, who had flown in from Washington DC on Monday, said she was reduced to tears by the hostile experience at passport control.</p> <p>\u201cI was so upset that I couldn\u2019t help but start crying,\u201d said Yoshie Rymar. \u201cThe agent told me to go to the ticketing counter to get a return ticket and go back to US.

He was irritated by my request to repeat his question.</p> <p>\u201cI explained how my daughter needed me because of her pregnancy and toddler. There was an agent next to him who was talking loud and my hearing was not so great, he was pretty irritated again.

  "<p>To a certain way of thinking, never has an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence\">independent Scotland</a> looked more desirable; to another way of thinking, never has it looked more unviable. Some people \u2013 since 2016, I\u2019ve sometimes been one of them \u2013 manage to hold both opinions: \u201cIt would be a good idea, if only \u2026\u201d But<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/13/the-power-and-the-story-global-battle-news-and-information-review-john-lloyd\"> John Lloyd,</a> a fine journalist with a long career at the Financial Times, has never been among the vacillators. In this book, he argues that Scotland\u2019s secession from the United Kingdom would certainly be damaging for what was left of it \u2013 England, Wales and Northern Ireland, supposing the last still existed \u2013 but nothing less than a disaster for Scotland itself. Economically, socially and culturally, secession would do it more harm than Brexit.</p> <p>The likely economic consequences are hard to deny. Scotland would be launched as a new nation using, as Lloyd says, \u201ca currency (sterling) of a state it has left and over which it has no control, and an application to join a European Union whose rules insist on its adoption of a currency (the euro) the SNP leaders do not wish to join\u201d. Scotland would be separated from its largest export market, which is the rest of the UK, by a hard customs border; there would be no equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/11/northernireland.northernireland\">the Belfast agreement</a>, an enforceable international treaty, to soften it.</p> <p>The<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/19/what-is-barnett-formula-how-work-scotland-wales-northern-ireland\"> Barnett formula</a> by which the Treasury allots a higher rate of per capita public expenditure in Scotland would go, and with it, by Lloyd\u2019s reckoning, an annual subsidy of between \u00a38bn and \u00a310bn that helps sustain Scotland\u2019s idea of itself as the last British redoubt of the welfare state: free university education, free medical prescriptions and free home care. Oil revenues aren\u2019t what they were, and they never will be again. Most forecasts, including those of the Scottish National Party, predict the need for cuts amounting to as much as a fifth in public spending unless taxes are raised significantly. In the short to medium term, an independent Scotland would inevitably face turbulence and economic decline. Lloyd writes in a memorable sentence that for the SNP\u2019s leaders \u201cthe prospect, for all their public confidence, must be, in reflective moments, terrifying.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae0024971bdf17642ea4d8045650178bb5e6ca4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae0024971bdf17642ea4d8045650178bb5e6ca4c/0_225_3500_2101/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Alex Salmond outside his home on the day of the Scottish independence referendum, 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Salmond outside his home on the day of the Scottish independence referendum, 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so it must \u2013 as terrifying, in fact, as the economic prospect that should have terrified Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and other members of the Tory groupuscule that has led the UK out of Europe. Just like Brexiters in the European referendum campaign, the most zealous Scottish nationalists write off these dire forecasts as \u201cproject fear\u201d. Forgetting that the original project fear contained warnings that proved well founded (don\u2019t trust in the constancy of oil revenues, for example), they march through Scottish cities turning their streets into a sea of white and blue, demanding a second referendum on independence \u2013 now!</p> <p>The author cuts them no slack. In his view, Scottish nationalism as a popular cause rests on fanciful assumptions of difference and moral superiority. \u201cA confident statement of long-term, deeply embedded difference between the English and the Scots in character, habits, and outlook is rarely possible, though the nationalists attempt to encourage it,\u201d he writes, citing the SNP leadership\u2019s stress on the openness of Scottish society to immigration, compared with the \u201cgrudging, even hostile attitudes\u201d that Scottish nationalists imply are those of the English, when England is the far more multicultural and diverse country. Likewise, the belief that Scotland is inherently more social democratic is hard to justify; the furthest that surveys of social attitudes will go is only that Scotland is \u201csomewhat\u201d more so. As for a greater attachment to European identity, similar surveys show that historically the EU hasn\u2019t excited the Scots any more than the English (more than a third of Scottish votes were for Brexit, after all), though that has changed since 2016. In other words, as the commentator Alex Massie recently wrote, \u201cScotland has more in common with the rest of the United Kingdom, even after Brexit, than it does with anywhere else on Earth.\u201d</p> <p>The SNP\u2019s two most successful leaders, Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon, always recognised this fact and took care to build the secessionist case on different grounds from cultural and social oppression, as summarised in the cry of \u201cFreedom!\u201d that rings out from the Mel Gibson/William Wallace character in <em>Braveheart</em>. Leery \u2013 and lacking the inspirational grievances \u2013 of \u201cheroic\u201d nationalism, they chose better governance and greater prosperity as their objectives, with Scotland imagined in Salmond\u2019s phrase as \u201cthe Saudia Arabia of renewable energy\u201d. Lloyd doubts that this reasoned, civic nationalism is what fuels the popular movement, which now \u201crelies heavily on a distrust, a dislike [of England], most strongly expressed by some of Scotland\u2019s most prominent writers, furthered by the nationalist leadership through a relentless depiction of the British political and governing class as chronically out of touch, London-centred and determined to impoverish Scotland with policies of austerity\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fd383d58e9930c6d9bd459cac3e7f32169c5a4ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd383d58e9930c6d9bd459cac3e7f32169c5a4ec/0_192_2387_1431/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Mel Gibson as William Wallace in Braveheart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mel Gibson as William Wallace in <em>Braveheart</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The writers he has in mind include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/oct/03/theobserver.uknews3\">Tom Nairn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/05/james-kelman-my-writing-day\">James Kelman</a>, the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/30/alasdair-gray-lanark-sarah-ditum-appreciation\">Alasdair Gray</a>, and the long-dead <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/25/hugh-macdiarmid-robert-burns-scots-vernacular-poetry-auld-lang-syne\">Hugh MacDiarmid</a>. Some prize quotations are summoned. Gray divided English people who came to live in Scotland into two categories: \u201csettlers\u201d, who have the same status as \u201cthe Italians who brought us fish and chips\u201d, and \u201ccolonists\u201d, who can \u201clook forward to a future back in England through promotion or by retirement\u201d. Kelman refused, and refuses, to read English (as opposed to any other country\u2019s) literature on the evidence-free grounds that: \u201cWhy would you want to read things that were treating you as an animal?\u201d Scottish attitudes towards England more generally are difficult to gauge, but if hostility towards it exists as a significant factor in Scottish politics then the tone and personnel of the present Westminster government seem unlikely to bring about any decrease.</p> <p>Which brings us to a paradox. A book that is severely critical of Scottish nationalism becomes kindness itself when it turns to English nationalism. The author berates the SNP on many fronts: that it has never properly engaged with the difficulties that independence will bring; that its social and economic policies post-independence are either vague or absent; that it perpetuates Scotland\u2019s proud but naive idea of itself as a nation of \u201cconfident globalists, well able to fend for themselves in the world\u2019s market place, requiring to be protected from no peoples other than the English\u201d.</p> <p>This is the author as a sceptical, scolding father figure. When he moves south a maternal side emerges, anxious to understand and forgive. The obvious similarities between nationalists north of the border and Brexiters south of it \u2013 their delusions as \u201cconfident globalists\u201d, their need for enemies (London, Brussels), and their economic recklessness \u2013 are never invoked. English nationalism, Lloyd writes, has been characterised as a rightwing endeavour with its psychological origins in English/British exceptionalism and the empire. All wrong. In fact, he says, the blame must go to \u201cthe Englishman\u2019s burden of the three Celtic statelets\u201d, which were never grateful enough to England for their subsidies. While Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland got their devolved assemblies, England continued to be powerless and \u201cenforcibly enfolded\u201d inside Britain and the Union flag. It felt ignored and resentful. By this logic, Scottish nationalism and not the Bruges Group forged the first link in Brexit\u2019s causal chain.</p> <p>He takes on the imperial argument with unusual literalness.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jacob-rees-mogg\"> Jacob Rees-Mogg</a> is described as \u201cin some ways the opposite of an imperialist\u201d because he believes in the free market \u2013 as though this division in 19th-century Britain was anywhere near as clear-cut. Every Rees-Mogg mannerism suggests the word \u201cempire\u201d: his drawling superiority; his idolisation of martial figures such as generals Gordon and Napier (who thought the best way to \u201cquieten\u201d a conquered country was \u201ca good thrashing first and great kindness afterwards\u201d). Lloyd quotes a speech by Rees-Mogg in praise of free trade, but even here the MP for North East Somerset can\u2019t help but sound imperial: \u201cBritain has been called on to be a shaper not only of our destiny but that of the whole world.\u201d And Brexit critics such as Fintan O\u2019Toole (to whom Lloyd takes especial exception) are, after all, not suggesting that Rees-Mogg and his colleagues want to march into Matabeleland with rifle, flag and drum, only that an emotional residue from Britain\u2019s era as the supreme power bloats their view of England\u2019s capability and destiny.</p> <p>Lloyd himself often reaches back to his upbringing in East Fife, in a fishing town that in the 1950s and 60s was far more \u201cScottish\u201d than it is now, though that identity, like most others, has never been a simple thing. His grandfather repaired fishing boats; his mother was a hairdresser; he never knew his English father; his Polish stepfather worked in the mines. He evokes life there more than half-a-century ago with a lively eye for the particular, to show how a distinctive local identity could flourish within a political culture that was unionist and led from London.</p> <p>His book is never better than when it attacks Scottish ideas of English oppression. Where it fails is its refusal to recognise that England has changed \u2013 from a stable and predictable neighbour into a volatile, abrasive and rather friendless country going who-knows-where. Lloyd suggests some form of federalism will hold the UK together, and wants future referendums to stipulate a majority of at least 60% before the status quo can be changed. Good ideas, probably: we know how divisive narrow majorities can be. But where are the federalists? And where is the SNP politician saintly enough to accept this higher bar when the Brexiters now in power were delighted to accept a much lower one? Forces great and small, the pandemic on the one hand and Salmond\u2019s trial on the other, have made the Union\u2019s future anyone\u2019s guess.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Should Auld Acquaintance Be Forgot: The Great Mistake of Scottish Independence is published by Polity (\u00a320).</em></p>",

A&amp;E chiefs are alarmed at an increase in the number of people dying at home, and not necessarily from coronavirus, but other conditions that need urgent treatment. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to go near hospital,\u201d said minutes of a meeting between London A&amp;E heads. \u201cAs a result salvageable conditions are not being treated.\u201d Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u201cIf patients are dying at home because they are fearful of seeking medical attention, or concerned about being a burden, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/15/sharp-rise-in-ill-patients-dying-at-home-since-coronavirus-outbreak\">then it is incredibly concerning</a>. We would reassure them that the NHS is here for them, and we will do whatever we can to keep them as safe as possible when they access care.\u201d</p> \n<p>South Korea, one of the countries worst hit early on by Covid-19, has managed to carry off a national election in which the left-leaning ruling party has overnight <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/south-koreas-ruling-party-wins-election-landslide-amid-coronavirus-outbreak\">recorded a landslide victory</a>. In the first big election of the coronavirus era, the political tide turned in President Moon Jae-in\u2019s favour over his government\u2019s rigorous handling of the outbreak. As of this morning confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide have passed 2 million, with at least 136,938 deaths recorded since the start of the outbreak. The US has reported more than 25,000 new cases, bringing total infections to more than 600,000 according to the CDC. Deaths rose by 2,330 to 24,582 in the latest count.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump has again questioned China\u2019s transparency over the coronavirus outbreak, casting doubt on the origins of the virus and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/16/trump-wades-further-into-china-covid-19-row-as-focus-turns-to-easing-lockdowns\">number of cases</a>, while signalling the US would soon join countries across Europe in easing its lockdown. \u201cDo you really believe those numbers in this vast country called China?\u201d the US president replied, when asked about the severity of the US death toll at a White House press briefing. \u201cWe report everything, we\u2019re reporting the cases and our reporting is good. We\u2019re reporting every death.\u201d Trump has said some US states may reopen before 1 May.</p> \n<p>Asia\u2019s economic growth this year will grind to a halt for the first time in 60 years, as the crisis takes an \u201cunprecedented\u201d toll on the region\u2019s service sector and major export destinations, the International Monetary Fund has said. G20 finance ministers have agreed to suspend poorer countries\u2019 debt payments. The measure will be in effect from 1 May until the end of the year as they prepare for increased spending on healthcare systems. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-live-news-cases-worldwide-top-2-million-trump-doubts-china-death-toll\">More at our live blog throughout the day</a>.</p> \n<p><em>There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice</a>.</em></p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Cough to court again \u2013 </strong>Charles and Diana Ingram will ask the court of appeal to overturn their convictions for cheating on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

The human rights lawyer Rhona Friedman told the Guardian she has taken on the case after becoming convinced the couple were the victims of a miscarriage of justice.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Truce government eludes Israel \u2013 </strong>Benny Gantz has failed to form a coalition government in Israel after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/israeli-opposition-leader-passes-deadline-to-form-government\">talks with Benjamin Netanyahu stalled</a>, pushing the country further towards an unprecedented fourth round of elections. But first comes a 21-day wait while MPs in the Knesset can vote to nominate any candidate to be prime minister. Netanyahu and Gantz have been discussing power-sharing options in which they would take turns as PM.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Brexit \u2013 yes you read that right \u2026 </strong>Live sport is still off but the EU and the UK government are poised to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/15/eu-and-uk-government-to-resume-post-brexit-talks-next-week\">resume their tournament of post-Brexit talks next week</a>. Attempts will be made via video link to thrash out trade and fishing rights. After Brexit day on 31 January, the EU and UK managed only one round of talks before coronavirus crashed them.

  "<p>With the pandemic keeping everyone inside just as spring brings good weather and longer days, many of us are missing simply wandering outdoors. Fortunately, there are video games offering beautiful landscapes where you can lose yourself in (virtual) nature. You\u2019re in good company if you do \u2013 as film and media professor Alenda Chang points out in her book, <a href=\"https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/playing-nature\">Playing Nature</a>: \u201cFor many people, the hours spent in game environments vastly outnumber those spent in wilderness areas\u201d, even without a public health crisis.</p> <p>Replaying favourite games for comfort is a trend now, and some are revisiting recent open-world adventures, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review-link-nintendo-switch\">Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review-a-stunning-but-barely-evolved-rpg-contradiction\">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>, and even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/mar/26/far-cry-5-review-playstation-4-xbox-one-pc-ubisoft\">Far Cry 5</a> with the guns put away.

  "<p>Netflix and Stan could be forced to spend a share of their revenue on Australian content, under a proposal being considered by the recently installed minister for communications, Paul Fletcher.</p> <p>On Wednesday Fletcher announced extra funding for regional news media to help it survive the coronavirus crisis \u2013 emergency-inspired measures which may be too little too late, given that the virus disruption has already pushed teetering businesses over the edge.</p> <p>But at the same time, Fletcher released an options paper examining the future of the screen industry, and that is a longer-term game.</p> <p>While the release was given extra piquancy by the fact so many Australians are presently slumped in front of the box, it is a welcome sign that Fletcher, who replaced Mitch Fifield in the portfolio in May last year, is thinking strategically about longer-term media policy.</p> <p>The options paper forms part of the government\u2019s response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/26/facebook-and-google-face-tighter-rules-in-australia-as-accc-releases-report\">ACCC digital platforms inquiry report</a> released last year and addresses one aspect of the legacy of decades in which Australia has not really had a media policy worthy of the name.</p> <p>Successive governments have instead focused mostly on internet and telecommunications, while reacting knee-jerk to the shouts of media barons \u2013 or freezing on the spot when those barons could not agree.</p> <p>This options paper gives some cause for hope that those days may be over.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/15/local-content-quotas-suspended-in-54m-package-for-australias-coronavirus-hit-media\">Local content quotas suspended in $54m package for Australia's coronavirus-hit media</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>What problems does this paper address?</h2> <p>In a nutshell, the traditional free-to-air broadcasters are in decline, with revenue, influence and viewer numbers bleeding to new platforms. Streaming services \u2013 the international behemoth Netflix and the locally owned Stan \u2013 are increasingly dominating viewing habits.</p> <p>Yet the traditional television broadcasters are loaded up with obligations, justified in previous times by the fact that they use a public asset, the broadcasting spectrum. These requirements have been out of date for at least a decade.</p> <p>Specifically, traditional broadcasters must make and screen minimum amounts of Australian content, with additional quotas for local drama, documentary and children\u2019s content. Netflix, Stan and the other streamers have no such obligations.</p> <p>It\u2019s clearly unfair, and as the options paper spells out, is now so burdensome that it threatens the future of Australian stories which \u201creflect who we are as a nation to ourselves and to the world ... The cultural significance of Australian content is not easily quantifiable, but it is highly recognisable.\u201d Three-quarters of Australians favour the government providing support to the Australian screen production industry, the paper says.</p> <p>Australian screen content also contributes $5.34bn to the economy, and has knock-on positive effects on tourism and exports.</p> <p>On the other side of the ledger, the government has traditionally provided both direct funding for Australian content and tax breaks for production.</p> <p>Netflix and Stan have invested in Australian productions \u2013 but not much and not many. Only 1.7% of Netflix\u2019s catalogue is Australian content, and even Stan\u2019s offering is only 9% Australian.</p> <p>Drama, documentary and children\u2019s programming is cheap to buy overseas \u2013 old foreign content can be imported for as little as $1,000 an hour, whereas making fresh programs costs between $500,000 to more than $1m an hour.</p> <p>The options paper makes it clear that if the market was allowed to rip without government-set local content obligations, we would see next to no Australian drama and no Australian children\u2019s content.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-closed-a-broken-hill-newspaper-but-the-community-fought-to-save-it\">Coronavirus closed a Broken Hill newspaper, but the community fought to save it</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>What to do?</h2> <p>The options paper lays out four possible models and invites comment.</p> <p>The first option is to do nothing.</p> <p>Option two is to make minimal changes and seek to persuade streaming services to make Australian content on a voluntary basis (good luck with that), with some fine tuning to the existing regulations and some extra pressure on the ABC and SBS.</p> <p>The third option \u2013 and the one that seems to me best suited for the times \u2013 is to put Netflix and Stan on the same footing as the traditional broadcasters.</p> <p>All providers would be obliged to invest a percentage of their Australian revenue into new Australian content. This could be done either by making their own content or through contributions to an Australian production fund to be overseen by the existing federal government funding agency, Screen Australia.</p> <p>There might also be extra tax breaks for children\u2019s content and feature films, with a points system weighted to encourage local production and use of Australian talent.</p> <p>There are some wriggles in here and some unanswered questions. For example, the ABC and SBS would be made to allocate funding specifically for Australian children\u2019s programming. But the options paper doesn\u2019t say whether this would be additional funding or whether the ABC would have to find it from its already challenged budget.</p> <p>So far, Fletcher has not addressed ABC funding \u2013 a bitterly contested matter given how much some of his colleagues hate the national broadcaster. He has not responded to pleas for cuts to be reversed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/03/bushfires-add-3m-to-abc-emergency-broadcasting-costs-as-coalition-cuts-funding\">reflecting the extra costs the ABC faced during the bushfire emergencies</a>. Instead, he has encouraged the ABC to sell its Ultimo offices.</p> <p>As it stands, if the ABC was faced with extra obligations for Australian children\u2019s content, it would mean money would be bled from other areas, and would also represent a reduction in ABC independence and control over its own budget \u2013 not good, at a time when journalism is so desperately challenged, as Fletcher\u2019s support for regional journalism acknowledges.</p> <p>The paper also doesn\u2019t address the issue of how Netflix\u2019s Australian revenue would be determined. As has been <a href=\"https://www.michaelwest.com.au/the-mist-netflix-accounting-fantasy-conceals-half-a-billion-dollars/\">reported elsewhere</a>, Netflix likes to pretend that its Australian operations don\u2019t really exist, thus avoiding tax.</p> <p>Finally, the last option in the paper is complete deregulation, which as the paper makes clear would spell the near death of Australian stories on our screen. It seems this is not the favoured path.</p> <p>It\u2019s a long way from an options paper to a media policy, but the evidence of strategic thought is welcome. What remains to be seen is how Fletcher will deal with the inevitable backlash, which this time will come not so much from the old media barons but from the new.</p>",

Blanche knew that a well-cut blazer could pull any look together, and that shoulder pads had a way of balancing things out \u2013 which is just as well, with hair so teased and bouffed. As the youngest of the group, the museum assistant was comfortable in casual looks, wearing jeans and giving sportswear a touch of luxe decades before athleisure became a thing.

Statement sweaters are serious business on today\u2019s catwalks and it\u2019s easy to imagine Rose (played by Betty White) in a cute Iceberg pullover or Ralph Lauren teddy bear knit. The circle of style has spun enough times that Rose\u2019s love of pussybows is also very of the moment, , while her penchant for a crisp knotted shirt is as timeless as tales of Earnest T Minkie and The Great Herring War.</p> <h2>Dorothy Zbornak</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6cebefbe6859c37663ba8acb965f7f22deb2cd7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cebefbe6859c37663ba8acb965f7f22deb2cd7e/351_278_1586_2065/768.jpg\" alt=\"Bea Arthur as Dorothy Zbornak\" width=\"768\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Queen of geometrics: Bea Arthur as Dorothy Zbornak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC/NBCUniversal via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dorothy\u2019s outfits were so directional that MC Escher could have designed them: everything cut on the bias, lines zig-zagging this way and that, origami necklines, trompe l\u2019oeil waistcoats \u2013 you never knew where to look and that may have been the point. Substitute teacher Dorothy was a no-nonsense character favouring tailored neutrals and layered looks with 20s-inspired drop-waists, duster coats and tunics with wide-legged palazzo pants \u2013 still a summer staple.

The bag actually belonged to the actor Estelle Getty, who used it for her audition and clearly nailed it.

  "<p>From the window of his home study, Gordon Brown looks out across the waters of the Firth of Forth, towards the ramparts of Edinburgh Castle. It is a precious glimpse of open horizons, in a world closing in.</p> <p>The former prime minister is holed up here hitting the phones in search of what he considers the missing piece in the coronavirus jigsaw: a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/26/gordon-brown-calls-for-global-government-to-tackle-coronavirus\">coordinated global pooling of resources against the pandemic</a> and accompanying recession.

That\u2019s when confidence comes back to the world economy and that\u2019s when people think things can be brought under control.\u201d Leading Britain through the 2008 banking crisis taught him, he says, that it is not just about money, but showing you have diagnosed and gripped the problem.</p> <p>Brown\u2019s fear is that while we struggle with the first wave of infection, the foundations for a second or third or fourth are being laid, as coronavirus hits developing countries terrifyingly ill-equipped to suppress it. Covid-19 is taking hold in countries with struggling health systems, where some lack running water to wash hands, and where the choice is between risking infection by going to work or going hungry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-rich-countries-poor-west-covid-19-developing-world\">This virus is ravaging rich countries.

The open letter they have signed calls for a global pledging conference where governments could collectively agree to fund the search for a vaccine, treatments, ventilators and personal protective equipment worldwide. Instead of competing for scarce stocks, Brown wants countries to cooperate in boosting supply for all. \u201cI\u2019ve got no doubt if there was greater global coordination you could solve many of the problems that we face in this country \u2013 but also other countries are facing \u2013 about the lack of test kits, the lack of protective clothing, the lack of ventilators.\u201d</p> <p>The letter also calls for a taskforce of the G20 group of powerful nations to agree assistance for developing countries, plus joint interventions to stop a global recession becoming a 1930s-style depression<strong>.</strong></p> <p>\u201cThe<strong> </strong>fear people have is that a liquidity crisis in companies becomes a solvency crisis, and a recession becomes a depression and that\u2019s what we have got to avoid,\u201d says Brown. \u201cAction can be taken to minimise the number of weeks and months the economy is closed down, or at least partially closed down, but the international action is important.\u201d The economic repercussions of the virus are, he thinks, \u201cbigger than the global financial crisis and there\u2019s no doubt that they are as big in some countries as the Great Depression\u201d.</p> <p>He flatly refuses to criticise Boris Johnson\u2019s handling of the epidemic, from shortages of protective clothing to the timing of lockdown. But isn\u2019t his letter tacit recognition that current leaders are failing? He sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t want to look back on what decisions have been made, I want to look forward to see what decisions could be made in the future. We aren\u2019t trying to criticise, we are trying to encourage.\u201d The convalescing prime minister, he insists, has his sympathy. \u201cI feel sorry for Boris Johnson, because at the moment, when the greatest call upon executive action is being made, he\u2019s found himself out of it. That must be very frustrating and very sad.\u201d Asked if he\u2019s in touch with Johnson, his stand-in, Dominic Raab, or Sunak, Brown says only that he\u2019s \u201ctalking to people who are in touch with the decision-making in government\u201d.</p> <p>Isn\u2019t he frustrated, lacking the power to do what he feels needs doing? A burst of laughter, which I suspect disguises a yes, rolls down the line. \u201cI\u2019ve got a few ideas that might be able to be helpful, but I\u2019m not claiming anything else.\u201d</p> <p>Yet this strikes closer to home than he cares to admit. It\u2019s when I ask how he is coping personally with lockdown that he momentarily falters. \u201cFor me it\u2019s uh \u2026 you know, we had to protect our son so we had to take action quite quickly.\u201d Gordon and Sarah Brown\u2019s son Fraser, 13, has the lung condition cystic fibrosis and government advice is to shield sufferers from the virus. It is a sensitive subject, the Browns guard the boys\u2019 privacy fiercely (they also have an older son, 16-year-old John). Brown doesn\u2019t want to discuss how this affects his political mission, but eventually says gruffly: \u201cWhat I do know is all of us have had to deal with a crisis at one point in our life, so you do feel whenever there\u2019s a crisis you have got to act quickly. That\u2019s what\u2019s motivating me at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>We are on safer ground discussing the books getting him through lockdown. He\u2019s just ordered the novelist Linda Grant\u2019s latest (he found her 2000 book When I Lived in Modern Times, the story of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/26/fiction.reviews\">Jew from </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/26/fiction.reviews\">the East End of London moving to what was then </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/26/fiction.reviews\">Palestine</a>, \u201camazing\u201d) and is ploughing through policy proposals to retrain people out of work during lockdown. At 68, he scoffs at the notion of retiring: \u201cNobody retires now!\u201d</p> <p>But nor does Brown crave a comeback. When he surfaced on the BBC\u2019s Today programme in March, a wave of nostalgia surged through Twitter and he got some \u201cvery generous\u201d messages from the public. But while Tony Blair remains a political player, Brown doesn\u2019t regret leaving London to live quietly in his old constituency of Dunfermline East after losing the 2010 election.</p> <p>\u201cI used to say my best advice is not to take my advice,\u201d he jokes. \u201cI\u2019ve not involved myself in business or anything else and I\u2019ve not interfered in the Labour party. I\u2019ve just tried to do what I can to help various causes. I don\u2019t think former leaders should claim any special privileges or insights. There may be occasions when your experience is of use but you should be modest enough to realise that you\u2019ve got a new group of leaders and it\u2019s their time.\u201d He has discussed his proposals with Labour\u2019s new leader, Keir Starmer, but<strong> </strong>\u201cit\u2019s up to him to decide what he wants to do. I wish him well. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/05/gordon-brown-backs-keir-starmer-for-labour-leader\">I think he\u2019s an excellent choice.</a>\u201d</p> <p>He tweeted that Starmer\u2019s was the team that could return Labour to power, so why does he think Starmer can succeed where Jeremy Corbyn failed? \u201cBecause Keir\u2019s very good,\u201d he begins, before spotting the trap and declining to discuss domestic politics.</p> <p>Why does he think countries have been initially slow to cooperate against coronavirus? \u201cIn the first few years after 2010 there was a sort of defensive nationalism \u2013 protectionism, tariffs, building walls, people putting import controls down. I think in the last year or two, it\u2019s been a more aggressive nationalism,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with an atmosphere that is a problem. But I think people have got to stop re-running the debate between globalists and nationalists. This is about saving lives.\u201d</p> <p>Brown reckons a moratorium on debt interest repayments owed by the poorest countries could, for example, release \u00a340bn for health and social protection. \u201cThat\u2019s almost a decision that if you made today, the countries could act on it tomorrow.\u201d But some will surely need IMF bailouts, reliant on richer countries\u2019 willingness to finance them.</p> <p>During the banking crisis, Brown was working 20-hour days, knowing that if his recapitalisation plan failed and banking collapsed then anarchy could follow. What advice can he give leaders operating now under similar pressure? \u201cFor me, it was a huge challenge. You know people didn\u2019t always agree with the way I did it ... but you\u2019ve got to quickly understand what\u2019s needed to be done, and then you\u2019ve got to mobilise every possible resource to do it. Some of the methods you use are controversial, but you\u2019ve got to take the widest possible view.\u201d</p> <p>His mistake, he suggests, was succeeding in emerging from recession, but failing to convey the case for running a fiscal deficit to do so. \u201cYou\u2019ve always got to be thinking of what happens next. In Britain at the moment we\u2019ve got to get out of the immediate crisis, but then you\u2019ve got this issue of which companies are going to survive after you\u2019ve solved the medical problem.\u201d</p> <p>This Gordon Brown is mellower than the rather defensive one I encountered in office, perhaps as a result of no longer being constantly attacked. If it hurts to see the Tories lauded for turning Keynesian overnight, it doesn\u2019t show.</p> <p>\u201cThe irony is that 10 years ago, the conventional wisdom was that running a deficit, as Keynes had argued in the 1930s, wasn\u2019t fashionable,\u201d he says philosophically. \u201cI think we were right then and I think people accept that we did the right thing, but we got penalised for it. Now there\u2019s a better understanding that if economic activity in your economy collapses then the only organisation that can come in is the government. To be honest, it\u2019s sad that what happened in 2010 led to austerity and everything else, because that was the inevitable consequence of not understanding that you had to run a fiscal deficit to deal with the problem.\u201d</p> <p>Brown won\u2019t say how the current bailouts should ultimately be paid for, but thinks one legacy of the virus may be greater aversion to risk. \u201cThere\u2019s climate change, there\u2019s cybersecurity issues, nuclear proliferation issues. People in this generation are going to be more aware that the balance of risk and security has to be examined and that will raise questions about what people expect of government.\u201d</p> <p>If anything, he thinks enforced separation under lockdown has encouraged such solidarity. \u201cBeing isolated, people realise the need to be connected, the importance they attach to friendship, the importance of acting as a community.<strong>\u201d</strong></p> <p>After years of separatist political movements, from Scottish independence to Brexit, is this crisis illustrating the dangers of separation?</p> <p>\u201cIt becomes a moment where we have got to make a choice,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we can\u2019t cooperate on this, then it doesn\u2019t say much about the world and I do think people in the end will.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>And so I leave him to his phone calls; cloistered from the world now, but forever looking out.</p>",
  "<p>It is only four months since Boris Johnson led the Conservative party to a historic victory. His 80-seat majority seemed to recast the electoral landscape for a generation. It also marked another milestone in Brexit\u2019s transformation of the Conservative party from the party of business to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/11/coronavirus-exposed-myth-british-exceptionalism\">party of the flag</a>. Today, that seems like another world.</p> <p>Everything has been upended by Covid-19. The business of government is wholly taken up with protecting public health, keeping the economy on life support and, in Johnson\u2019s own case, his personal survival. Today the national lockdown is expected to be extended into May. </p> <p>It seems likely that the Britain which eventually emerges from the coronavirus crisis will be a country of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/07/life-never-return-normal-coronavirus-shape-generation\">significantly different temper</a> from the Britain that went into it. Nobody can be certain about the degree of change. The possibility that the economy may <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/uk-economy-could-shrink-by-35-with-2m-job-losses-warns-obr\">shrink by a third</a>, with millions of job losses, is a reality check about a more enduringly difficult new normal. The post-pandemic Conservative party must adapt too. But in what ways?</p> <p>Future British politics will not shake down into a binary choice between the economy and public health. The need to restore both will be far messier than that. Political horizons will simultaneously be very wide \u2013 global issues of health, supply chains, travel, information and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/uk-spy-agencies-urge-china-rethink-once-covid-19-crisis-is-over\">Chinese power</a> will surge up the agenda \u2013 and very narrow: local issues about safe ways to work, earn, live and survive a future pandemic will matter more too. Politics will be more fragile, fearful and dynamic.</p> <p>While the pandemic and the lockdown hold sway, the official Conservative position is to ensure the least bad of all possibilities. The policy can be summed up by Rishi Sunak\u2019s comments this week. \u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-uk-live-news-lockdown-extended-peak-dominic-raab-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e95ec7f8f082c29014b0d77#block-5e95ec7f8f082c29014b0d77\">single most important thing</a> we can do for the health of our economy is to protect the health of our people,\u201d said the chancellor on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s not a case of choosing between the economy and public health.\u201d</p> <p>However, once discussion moves on to the so-called exit strategy and to the post-Covid future, as it is now beginning to do, this begins to change. The choices do not suddenly become absolute. Instead they become competing calculations of the balance of risk in the interaction between the economy and public health, as and when the pandemic wanes. That has to be one of the reasons why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/keir-starmer-calls-for-ministers-to-set-out-plans-to-end-coronavirus-lockdown\">Keir Starmer is pressing the government</a> to publish its strategy. He knows this will reveal faultlines and compromises that an opposition can exploit without appearing partisan or unpatriotic.</p> <p>There are some signs of those tensions already appearing within Conservative ranks. Sajid Javid, Sunak\u2019s more fiscally cautious predecessor, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/free-market-is-only-way-to-revive-our-economy-l8h066t75\">warned this week</a> against mortgaging the future, and said low taxes remained key to kickstarting the economic recovery. Theresa May and several of her ex-ministers, including Philip Hammond, believe something similar. But Johnson will want to go on spending, not reinventing austerity. So will the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who will press for a large programme of resilience measures in health and social care to guard against a future pandemic. The new Tory MPs from the former industrial areas will agree with them. So, at least for now, will Sunak.</p> <p>Where this process of change will eventually lead the Tory party is difficult to predict. Sunak\u2019s autumn budget \u2013 in which the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/17/theresa-may-conservative-tory-policy-older-people-pay-for-social-care\">social care agenda that was abandoned in 2017</a> will surely have to be a central focus \u2013 looms increasingly as a vital moment. But all this will surely generate a rather different party, and with rather different priorities, from the one that Johnson led to victory last December.</p> <p>Whether the Tory party successfully embraces the choices that will now face it depends overwhelmingly on Johnson himself. After 2019, the party is unusually dependent on the man at the top. The reshuffled cabinet consists mainly of minister of state-level players whom Johnson dominates from No 10. Its lack of depth has been cruelly exposed in the crisis. The party remains very much Johnson\u2019s own brand, held together by his inimitable personality and popularity.</p> <p>For as long as Johnson remains out of action, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/12/a-tudor-court-without-a-king-inside-no-10-as-raab-takes-the-reins\">important choices</a> about the party\u2019s direction are likely to be deferred. The party which, only a few weeks ago, Johnson and Dominic Cummings were building on the basis of Brexit and the anger of the left-behind is becoming less relevant by the day in the shadow of coronavirus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/coronavirus-had-made-the-bbcs-balancing-act-even-harder\">Coronavirus has made the BBC's balancing act even harder | Tom Mills</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The dissonance between the new realities and the recent past is now huge. Instead of the old contempt towards experts, competence and seriousness, there is now a craving for all three to help steer a safe course through the Covid-19 crisis. The idea that the government\u2019s post-pandemic priorities might include lighting fires under the BBC, the civil service and the universities therefore seems even more destructive now than before. The idea that Britain should be a Brexit buccaneer, turning its back resolutely against Europe and throwing itself into the arms of Donald Trump seems even more irresponsible.</p> <p>As one former minister put it to me this week: \u201cThe party that was being created in the wake of the election was a new one. It was based on a cultural backlash against liberalism and established elites at home and abroad. But that doesn\u2019t feel to me like what the country wants now. It doesn\u2019t want divisive politics. It doesn\u2019t want a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-culture-war-lockdown-economy\">culture war</a>. This feels like a moment to step away from a lot of that.\u201d Whether to take that step away will be very much Johnson\u2019s own decision. But it is a decision with momentous implications for the Tory party and for the whole of British party politics.</p> <p>\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p>",

We don\u2019t work that way.</p> <p>\u201cI was beginning to despair about the state of Australian journalism,\u201d Turnbull writes in A Bigger Picture.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/16/malcolm-turnbull-new-book-memoir-bigger-picture-scott-morrison\">\u2018Scott is a control freak\u2019: what Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s new book tells us about his relationship with Morrison</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t especially concerned about the political slant of one outlet or another, but more about the fact that newsrooms were shrinking and editorial standards were dropping to the loopy standards of the twittersphere. Gina Rinehart was threatening to buy Fairfax \u2013 no doubt so that its newspapers could emulate her own ultra-rightwing views.</p> <p>\u201cIn June 2012, I suggested to Alan Rusbridger, editor of the UK\u2019s Guardian, that he should establish an Australian edition. For a modest cost, he could start a digital-only edition. That would provide a good base from which to build. Alan was interested. We exchanged some rough numbers and he concluded he\u2019d need $20m of underwriting for three years \u2013 if it couldn\u2019t get to break-even in that time, it never would.</p> <p>\u201cGiven my political role, I could hardly participate myself, but I thought I knew someone who would. Graeme Wood had made hundreds of millions of dollars from an online travel booking business called Wotif. He was on the political left and had been generous in the past to the Greens. He\u2019d also recently funded a progressive free online newspaper called the Global Mail. It wasn\u2019t going to make it. So, I suggested to Graeme he drop the Global Mail and instead use his fortune to bankroll an Australian edition of the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cIts progressive politics suited him plus it was one of the greatest newspapers in the English language, nearly 200 years old and, unusually, wasn\u2019t controlled by any media mogul but rather an independent trust dedicated to \u2018quality, independent liberal journalism\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cOnce Graeme Wood was on board, I introduced Rusbridger to two seasoned Canberra political writers, Lenore Taylor and Katharine Murphy (AKA murpharoo). He sent his deputy, Kath Viner, to Australia to be the first editor. The (digital) paper exceeded expectations, broke even after a few years and Wood got all his money back. Clearly, my deal-making skills remained intact.\u201d</p> <p>Turnbull\u2019s recollection skips over a long and complicated process that followed those initial introductions, after which Turnbull had no further involvement as far as I know. I had some early conversations with Rusbridger about the Australian media landscape and then waited; first to hear from Rusbridger about whether his discussions with Wood had amounted to anything, then to meet Viner when she came to Australia, and then to find out whether she had appointed me to her team. It took almost a year.</p> <p>Rusbridger has also written about the process in his own memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/01/breaking-news-by-alan-rusbridger-review-the-remaking-of-journalism-and-why-it-matters-now\">Breaking News</a>, published two years ago.</p> <p>\u201cIn the autumn of 2012 I had a weekend call from a senior Australian politician. He planted the idea that we should think of starting an Australian edition of the website. The Murdoch domination of the Australian press scene was overwhelming, but it had been historically counterbalanced to some extent by the Fairfax titles, especially the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age. But the Fairfax group was at that moment in some danger of being taken over by Australia\u2019s richest person, an iron ore magnate named Gina Rinehart. In 2017, Forbes valued her personal wealth at $16bn: she could have financed Fairfax from her small change. The group\u2019s journalists feared she would turn the papers into cheerleaders for the mining industry. Suddenly Australia\u2019s media scene looked very unbalanced indeed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/14/guardian-australia-doubles-audience-to-become-fourth-most-popular-news-site-in-the-country\">Guardian Australia doubles audience to become fourth most popular news site in the country</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was a nice idea, but unaffordable, unless a philanthropist, concerned about media plurality, could be found to support the idea. Within weeks, such a figure emerged, Graeme Wood, a digital entrepreneur in his 60s who was passionate about the environment. He was willing to underwrite for the first few years. If we turned Guardian Australia into a going concern, we\u2019d pay him back. If not, he was happy to write the investment off. It was an interesting new model of financing journalism. Wood obviously had to understand he would have no say at all in the editorial stance of the operation. It appeared he did.\u201d</p> <p>For me, joining Guardian Australia was a career-defining leap into the unknown, from a job I loved at the then Fairfax papers to a digital startup that was at the time more hope and ideas than a reality.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jul/27/brutal-end-for-fairfax-media-changing-change-it-for-good\">As I\u2019ve written before</a>, my motivation was to introduce a new voice into one of the most concentrated media markets in the world, to help build a quality, independent news option in a media landscape that had already started to crumble.</p> <p>Even before we learned that Rusbridger and Wood were talking, Katharine Murphy and I had been thinking about ways we might start up a new online political publication, a conversation we paused to see what became of the idea of establishing the Guardian in Australia and whether we would have roles in it.</p> <p>Three years after Guardian Australia\u2019s 2013 launch I was appointed as editor. Four years later we have 11.6 million Australian readers and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/14/guardian-australia-doubles-audience-to-become-fourth-most-popular-news-site-in-the-country\">we are the fourth most read news site in the country</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s true that we often did not see eye to eye with Turnbull politically, but we agree with him that \u201cfacts and professional journalism still matter\u201d. We\u2019re determined to continue to provide our expanding readership with exactly that kind of reporting, and we\u2019re pleased he made those introductions eight years ago.</p> <p><br><br></p>",

  "<p>Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s new memoir, which is due to be published on Monday, is a sweeping account of events from his early childhood in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs to being forced out of the prime ministership in 2018. Given Turnbull\u2019s tumultuous exit from public life, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2019/jul/03/they-never-liked-him-is-scott-morrison-safe-australian-politics-live-podcast\">the history wars that have followed</a>, many readers will be interested in the former prime minister\u2019s reflections on Scott Morrison, the man who replaced him. Here are some of the standout passages from A Bigger Picture.</p> <h2>First meeting</h2> <p>Turnbull says his first encounter with Scott Morrison happened in 2001, when the then-businessman was mulling options to enter politics and Morrison was the state director of the Liberal party. Morrison, Turnbull says, wanted him to be the New South Wales party leader, and \u201chatched an ingenious idea in 2001 that involved a Liberal member of the Legislative Council retiring, my taking up the casual vacancy and then becoming leader of the opposition, running for a seat in the lower house at the next election, due in 2003\u201d. Turnbull wasn\u2019t interested in state politics and was bemused by the unconventional pathway to leadership that Morrison war-gamed with him. He was also concerned Labor would go after him for being wealthy \u2013 \u201can out-of-touch plutocrat\u201d. Morrison apparently had an answer, and spreadsheets, at the ready. \u201cWe\u2019ve been throwing your name into our polling in western Sydney. And you know what? The battlers like you,\u201d Morrison told him. \u201cThey admire your success; they reckon you\u2019re self-made \u2013 it\u2019s all about aspiration. Australians don\u2019t want class wars.\u201d According to this account, Morrison told Turnbull Kerry Chikarovski would make way for him if he signed up to the plan. But the \u201cMalcolm for Macquarie Street\u201d fizzled.</p> <h2>Morrison as a key player in federal Liberal leadership battles against Tony Abbott</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2019/jul/03/they-never-liked-him-is-scott-morrison-safe-australian-politics-live-podcast\">'They never liked him': Niki Savva on why Turnbull was knifed by his own side \u2013 Australian politics live podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Turnbull portrays the current prime minister as always ringside, either in person or through surrogates, during the corrosive leadership battles that erupted shortly after the Coalition came to power in 2013. Turnbull says Morrison began to \u201csniff out interest in removing Abbott\u201d as early as 2014, only a year after the Coalition\u2019s election victory, when the majority of colleagues were not countenancing a change.</p> <p>There was talk of moving Turnbull to Treasury to replace Joe Hockey after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/13/budget-2014-joe-hockey-delivers-deep-pain-for-little-gain\">the disaster of the 2014 budget</a>. \u201cI was careful to play no part in this. Abbott would never move me to treasurer,\u201d Turnbull says. \u201cAnd I felt I was being used as a stalking horse by others, especially Scott Morrison, to position themselves.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2557f924db2af10983ff0bfa120c144e6f0ca03c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2557f924db2af10983ff0bfa120c144e6f0ca03c/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Then immigration minister Scott Morrison listens to then communications minister Malcolm Turnbull during question time in February 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Then immigration minister Scott Morrison listens to then communications minister Malcolm Turnbull during question time in February 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Porritt/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Turnbull says the agitation persisted, and on 10 December, he had dinner with Morrison, who wanted to replace Abbott as party leader. \u201cIt was the first time he laid out, fairly comprehensively, his thinking on Abbott, who he felt would have to go by the middle of 2015 if his performance didn\u2019t improve. He said Hockey should go now and he was making the case to Abbott to replace him with me. He was closely in touch with the key figures at News [Corp], he told me, and said they were getting ready to dump Abbott. And he made it clear he saw himself as the successor.\u201d</p> <p>After the reshuffle at the end of that year that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/dec/21/tony-abbott-cabinet-reshuffle-moves-scott-morrison-out-of-immigration\">moved Morrison out of immigration and into social services</a>, Turnbull says Morrison was \u201cfurious\u201d and \u201cthis was the first time I recall him saying we will need to remove him before the budget\u201d. By 19 January, Turnbull says Morrison had a list of names who would support tipping Abbott out of the leadership. Morrison wanted the job, \u201cbut didn\u2019t want to be seen to challenge him. He felt the rightwing commentators (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/15/a-painful-morning-for-alan-jones-who-told-malcolm-turnbull-hed-never-be-pm\">by whom he meant Alan Jones</a> and Ray Hadley) would never support me\u201d. Morrison also, according to Turnbull, wanted to marginalise Julie Bishop, but later backed off that idea, and the three later agreed Turnbull would be the leader in the event the campaign to remove Abbott succeeded.</p> <p>Throughout this period, Turnbull notes \u201cMorrison was vocal in his support for Abbott and publicly denied discussing leadership issues with me. Of course, he\u2019d done so on many occasions, and every indication was that he\u2019d encouraged, if not masterminded, the [first] spill itself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8cfeb1c3d8d79a59a3aa547894fdad06415dfded\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cfeb1c3d8d79a59a3aa547894fdad06415dfded/0_300_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Abbott addresses the media for the last time as prime minister on 15 September 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Abbott addresses the media for the last time as prime minister on 15 September 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Round two: Morrison\u2019s role in Turnbull losing the prime ministership in 2018</h2> <p>Turnbull\u2019s ire is directly predominantly at Mathias Cormann and Peter Dutton <a href=\"https://meanjin.com.au/essays/prime-minister-disrupted/\">for the coup that terminated his prime ministership in 2018</a>, but he concludes after some equivocation (\u201cit\u2019s never possible to be 100% certain about these things\u201d) that Morrison \u201cwas playing a double game: professing public loyalty to me while at the same time allowing his supporters to undermine me. It was, of course, precisely what he\u2019d done in 2015 when he said he\u2019d voted for Abbott in the leadership ballot but worked closely with me to ensure his supporters voted against Abbott\u201d.</p> <p>Turnbull says he knew on the morning he spilled the leadership, \u201cwhile I was prepared to accept Morrison\u2019s assurances of continued loyalty, I knew that some of his supporters were starting to urge him to make a move himself\u201d. He says he was aware of the risks of tactical voting by Morrison supporters in the first ballot. Turnbull says Morrison sent him a note while the ballots were being distributed. \u201cThe note said: \u2018I don\u2019t know why we didn\u2019t discuss this. But that\u2019s your call. Turnbull is on my ballot.\u2019 I replied, \u2018Thanks! It\u2019s the right call. The room has to make up its mind.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Scott is a control freak and I\u2019d seen before ... how he\u2019d publicly vote one way while ensuring his supporters voted the other way</p> <footer> <cite>Malcolm Turnbull</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When the result <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/21/malcolm-turnbull-survives-leadership-contest-peter-dutton\">was 48 votes for Turnbull and 35 for Dutton</a>, \u201cI wondered whether some of Morrison\u2019s supporters had taken the chance and voted for Dutton, hoping they didn\u2019t accidentally deliver him a win. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/01/duttons-keystone-cops-and-morrisons-prayer-five-key-moments-from-niki-savvas-book\">Subsequent accounts of these events</a> indicate that Stuart Robert and Alex Hawke had organised about half-a-dozen of them to vote for Dutton \u2013 enough to lift his numbers up to a level that damaged me but didn\u2019t get Dutton over the line. If Morrison\u2019s friends had voted the way he said he did, the Dutton insurgency would have been utterly dead that morning.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea that they did that without his knowledge is fanciful. Scott is a control freak and I\u2019d seen before in the ballots in 2015 how he\u2019d publicly vote one way while ensuring his supporters voted the other way.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Love you mate\u2019</h2> <p>When it was clear he had no prospects of retaining the prime ministership, Turnbull actively encouraged Morrison\u2019s campaign. Turnbull says he lined up behind Morrison because he believed he was \u201ca responsible, safe pair of hands. But Dutton, were he to become prime minister, would run off to the right with a divisive, dog-whistling, anti-immigration agenda, written and directed by Sky News and 2GB, designed to throw red meat to the base. With no constraints, Dutton would do enormous damage to the social fabric of Australia. It\u2019s one thing having the tough cop handling border protection and counter-terrorism, but not at the head of our multicultural society\u201d.</p> <p>Turnbull also records the messages he exchanged with his successor after Morrison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2018/aug/24/liberal-spill-malcolm-turnbull-peter-dutton-scott-morrison-liberal-spill-politics-parliament-live?page=with:block-5b7fc123e4b0b69fd6c5528e\">was sworn in</a>. \u201cI messaged him,\u201d Turnbull says, \u201cCongratulations prime minister and good luck.\u201d According to Turnbull, Morrison replied the next morning. \u201cOnly you can know how I feel today, but I cannot begin to know how you feel. I loved working for and with you. I\u2019m really proud of what we did. And that is always how I will always feel and speak of it. I want you to know I am thinking about you a great deal and you know I pray for you. That doesn\u2019t change now. I don\u2019t know why all this happened, but now it has come upon me, you know I will be relying on my faith, friends and values to overcome and conquer what is ahead \u2026 Thank you for all you\u2019ve done for me. But above all as one PM to another, thank you for everything you did for our country. No one knows that contribution better than me.</p> <p>\u201cLove you mate.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b25e2e31490e71399234db24461d78873147a780\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b25e2e31490e71399234db24461d78873147a780/0_55_3454_2073/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Morrison pledges his loyalty to then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull at a press conference in the PM\u2019s courtyard on 22 August 2018, two days before he took the leadership.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott Morrison pledges his loyalty to then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull at a press conference in the PM\u2019s courtyard on 22 August 2018, two days before he took the leadership.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Morrison\u2019s negative views on marriage equality</h2> <p>Turnbull notes at one point in the memoir that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/22/same-sex-marriage-plebiscite-scott-morrison-says-he-faces-bigotry-too\">working to prevent the legalisation of same-sex marriage</a> was the most animated Morrison ever got during internal policy debates. Morrison, Turnbull says, wanted a constitutional amendment on the question. \u201cScott explained to me a few days later, \u2018I don\u2019t want gay marriage. And because referendums are almost always defeated, I think that\u2019s a good way to ensure it never happens.\u201d Morrison also ran interference on the issue. In the 2016 election, Turnbull says the issue of marriage equality was broadly neutralised until \u201cthis equilibrium was thrown out in the last crucial week of the campaign by Scott Morrison, who had been the principal advocate of a plebiscite\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cDuring an interview with Leigh Sales on 7.30 on Tuesday 28 June, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/29/scott-morrison-and-julie-bishop-will-not-confirm-they-will-vote-for-marriage-equality\">refused to say how he\u2019d vote if the plebiscite was carried</a> and this immediately raised concerns about the government\u2019s sincerity. Scott had a very sincerely held and viscerally intense opposition to same-sex marriage and could have said he\u2019d abstain, but I fear his troubled conscience was reserving the right to vote against it. Every other minister was then asked how they\u2019d vote; most sensibly said they\u2019d vote for legalisation if the plebiscite passed. A cautious answer from Julie Bishop was unreasonably portrayed as equivocal. She was a strong supporter of same-sex marriage despite a ferocious anti-same-sex-marriage element in her constituency, led by Margaret Court.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We\u2019ve got a treasurer problem\u2019</h2> <p>Turnbull recounts a number of instances in the memoir where he asserts Morrison was either leaking government discussions or front-running issues with trusted media surrogates during internal debates about tax reform and about budget measures. Turnbull says he had several \u201ctough discussions\u201d with Morrison about his behaviour. He says both he and the finance minister Mathias Cormann were \u201cat our wits\u2019 end as to how to manage Scott\u201d. He says Cormann said the government had \u201ca treasurer problem\u201d. In an exchange of messages between the two Turnbull says he replied: \u201c[Morrison] operates completely differently from us. We prefer to stay absolutely resolute on course until we decide to change. He wants to flag possible changes way in advance (why?) which reduces optionality and makes us look undecided. I can\u2019t work it out because it\u2019s so counter productive.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>[Scott Morrison] was brittle emotionally and easily offended.</p> <footer> <cite>Malcolm Turnbull</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cNothing is more corrosive of good government than policy consideration being front-run in the media,\u201d Turnbull says. \u201cI found it completely incomprehensible and couldn\u2019t see how anyone\u2019s interest or agenda was assisted. Scott adamantly denied any responsibility, but regrettably nobody believed him.</p> <p>\u201cI had no problem whatsoever with Scott\u2019s political pragmatism \u2013 he was, after all, a former state director of the party and looked at issues almost exclusively through a political prism. But working with him was difficult; so much of what we discussed or were thinking about found its way into the media.</p> <p>\u201cMany of my colleagues encouraged me, without success, to mistrust Scott and to see his briefings as malign, the calculated undermining and manoeuvring of a Machiavellian plotter. And yet we enjoyed a close working relationship. Despite Mathias\u2019s begging me to be selective in what I told him, I continued to be open with Scott. He seemed to me to be my most likely successor, and as far as I could I preferred to work with him as a trusted partner. Scott, like many politicians, wanted to keep himself constantly in the centre of things. That was the purpose, Mathias maintained, of Scott\u2019s constant stream of briefings, mostly to Simon Benson at News Corporation.\u201d</p> <h2>We have to make sure Scott is a success</h2> <p>Some of the more scathing commentary Turnbull makes about his successor is delivered through passing references to the prime minister. \u201cMathias and I agreed we had to make sure Scott was a success.</p> <p>\u201cWe had to recognise he was brittle emotionally and easily offended. At a practical level we both sought to ensure, as tactfully as possible, that he stayed out of negotiations with the Senate. He had a blustering manner that could easily be mistaken for bullying and was often counterproductive.\u201d</p> <h2>Relationships between Morrison, Dutton and Cormann</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bd1a8933bfae54d80de5d52d37a79e5a3ed2047\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bd1a8933bfae54d80de5d52d37a79e5a3ed2047/0_0_4456_2971/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mathias Cormann (left) and Peter Dutton emerge from the Liberal party room meeting on 24 August 2018, the day Scott Morrison was sworn in as Australia\u2019s 30th prime minister.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mathias Cormann and Peter Dutton emerge from the Liberal party room meeting on 24 August 2018, the day Scott Morrison was sworn in as Australia\u2019s 30th prime minister.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It should be clear from the preceding references that Turnbull narrates a hostile relationship between Cormann, the finance minister, and Morrison, then treasurer. Turnbull suggests that Cormann\u2019s strong support of Dutton during the leadership crisis in 2018 reflected two things \u2013 a close personal relationship between the two rightwingers, and Cormann\u2019s fixed dislike of Morrison.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mathias regarded Scott as emotional, narcissistic and untrustworthy and told me so regularly.</p> <footer> <cite>Malcolm Turnbull</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cMathias regarded Scott as emotional, narcissistic and untrustworthy and told me so regularly,\u201d Turnbull says.</p> <p>Turnbull says Dutton was also hostile to Morrison. \u201cOf course, if Mathias had a poor opinion of Scott, Dutton\u2019s dislike of him was even stronger,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Turnbull suggests the feelings were more or less mutual. Morrison for his part \u201cdidn\u2019t entirely trust Mathias, not because he saw Mathias as a rival for the leadership one day, but because he knew Mathias was close to Peter Dutton. Scott didn\u2019t trust Dutton at all and regarded him as deficient in all respects \u2013 character, intellect and political nous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWithin that troika,\u201d Turnbull says, \u201cit would be fair to say that each of them trusted me more than they trusted the other.\u201d</p> <p>Cormann\u2019s move against Turnbull clearly stung the most. Turnbull says he was \u201churt\u201d personally by the finance minister\u2019s decision to agitate on behalf of Dutton, because he thought there was a friendship that eclipsed the transactions of politics. Although he also quotes Cormann describing the move against him by Dutton as \u201cmadness, and it is terrorism \u2013 but you have to give in to it\u201d.</p> <p><em>\u2022 A Bigger Picture by Malcolm Turnbull <a href=\"https://www.hardiegrant.com/au/books/events-calendar/malcolm-turnbull-readings\">is published by Hardie Grant Books</a> (RRP $55).
