Mosques and holy sites would be kept closed at least until 4 May, but he urged Iranians to pray at home. The holy month of Ramadan starts on 23 April.</p> \n  <p>Tehran was gridlocked with traffic on Saturday when office employees were asked to return to work. Public transport, seen as a major transmitter of the virus, is unable to cope with the passenger traffic, making government commitments to implement smart distancing largely ineffectual. Traffic into Tehran was up 70% from traffic on the same day last year, Tehran police chief Mohammad Reza Mehmandar said.</p> \n  <p>Rouhani acknowledged the dilemma, but said the solution was for councils to purchase more buses, or bring back into use those that had broken down. Crowds also gathered outside banks on Saturday to purchase a SIM card required to access a government grant of 1m Iranian toman ($23). Pictures of the crowds were emblazoned on Iranian newspapers with reporters questioning government policy. As many as 600,000 made unemployed due to the lockdown had registered for the government grant, but living standards of the middle class are also sliding. </p> \n  <p>Health ministry figures on Saturday showed the number of new deaths had fallen to a record low of 73. The number of new infections was 1,374, part of a steady downward trend. But Tehran\u2019s mayor pointed to an Iranian parliament report saying the official figures undercounted the number of deaths caused by the virus due to the lack of effective testing in hospitals. Opposition sources produce figures for deaths that are as high as 30,000, more than six times the official figures.

  "<p>A recent lockdown clear-out prompted the discovery of a semi-skimmed and long-forgotten letter forwarded to me by my mother some years ago; a piece of correspondence she had chanced upon while doing some domestic decluttering of her own. It had been written by my uncle, a former professor of anatomy at the University of Galway, during his days doing the rounds at a Sydney hospital way back in 1978.</p> <p>Writing to my father on the flimsiest of airmail notepaper, with a neatness of hand that belied his profession, he revealed that he had been lucky enough to get talking to \u201ca very interesting character\u201d the previous evening. A legendary figure known in Australian rugby circles as the Bull, Aubrey Hodgson had been singing the praises of the Ireland lock Willie John McBride and the Welsh fly-half Barry John, two titans of the northern hemisphere game the former Wallabies forward, then aged 66, hugely admired.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/19/rugby-union-must-see-enforced-break-as-a-chance-to-hit-the-reset-button\">Rugby union must see enforced break as a chance to hit the reset button | Ugo Monye</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Upon being informed that my uncle had a five\u2011year\u2011old nephew back in Ireland who had been named after the Welshman in a fit of what is probably best described as optimistic but utterly misguided paternal delusion, Hodgson was handed a pen and scribbled a message to the boy.</p> <p>\u201cTo Barry John Glendenning,\u201d reads the message on the back of a Christmas card from the then president of the Irish Rugby Football Union. \u201cBe as great as John McBride the greatest of all Irish forwards. Please be as great. Aub Hodgson [The Bull].\u201d </p> <p>More than 40 years later, it was rather chastening to learn that it hadn\u2019t just been my old man who I had gone on to let down through a combination of bumbling ineptitude and cowardice on the rugby field.</p> <p>Subsequent research revealed that old Aub was indeed quite the fascinating character. A bit of a mad bastard, by all accounts. Described in my uncle\u2019s letter as \u201ca physical wreck now getting about on crutches and drinking like a fish but still enjoying life\u201d, he would die four years later. A stalwart of Manly rugby club in Sydney, first as a player then a coach, he was the recipient of an excellent send-off.</p> <p>In his book Inside the Wallabies, the Australian writer Greg Growden fondly recalls the standing ovation given to the Bull as his coffin disappeared behind the curtains at Sydney\u2019s Northern Suburbs crematorium. \u201cHe was forever surrounded by revellers who were charmed by his reminiscences, his outlandish behaviour, his vast football knowledge and his eagerness to be the ultimate host to any visiting player,\u201d he wrote.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/17/my-favourite-game-france-v-new-zealand-1999-rugby-union-world-cup\">My favourite game: France v New Zealand, 1999 Rugby World Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Born into a privileged background in 1912 and the only one of six brothers to be given the kind of name that makes a certain teak-toughness on the rugby field an absolute necessity, Hodgson won 11 caps for Australia. This deceptively low tally was nothing to do with any lack of ability on his part, but more a testament to the infrequency with which his country played. It didn\u2019t help that his international career was interrupted and ultimately ended by the outbreak of the second world war.</p> <p>The Australasian rugby writer and historian Spiro Zavos recalls Hodgson being \u201cas good as any contemporary player anywhere in the world at his peak in the 1930s\u201d, describing him as \u201ca snarler of a loose forward who terrorised opposition backs and sometimes his own with the fury and aggression of his play\u201d.</p> <p>One image from the archives shows him squaring up to the South Africa prop Harry Martin, who was looking for revenge following a number Hodgson had done on his semi-conscious teammate, the scrum-half Pierre de Villiers.</p> <p>A versatile back-row merchant who began life as a prop, Hodgson made his first Test appearance against South Africa at Durban in 1933 and his 11th and final one against New Zealand just over five years later. History suggests he could and should have made a lot more. A member of the Wallabies squad that disembarked at Southampton on 2 September 1939, he would certainly have got to test himself against northern-hemisphere opposition but for Britain\u2019s declaration of war against Germany the next day. Instead, his final duties as a an Australia player involved turning up for an audience with King George VI and a brief period spent filling sandbags before a fraught voyage home keeping a watchful eye out for U-boats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/17/rugby-australia-set-to-benefit-from-world-rugby-relief-fund\">Rugby Australia set to benefit from World Rugby relief fund</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hodgson volunteered for the Second Australian Imperial Force but his service was delayed by a broken leg sustained the next day while playing for Manly against Drummoyne. Despite announcing his retirement in 1944, he did not stay out of the game for long and excelled in state trials before Australia\u2019s 1946 tour of New Zealand. Surprisingly, he failed to make the squad.</p> <p>\u201cI heard he had the letters NTTA indelibly marked against his name \u2013 Never To Tour Again,\u201d wrote a fellow international, Professor Max Howell, in a memoir. \u201cI suspect the rumour was correct that somewhere and some time on tour he had overstepped the bounds of propriety.\u201d</p> <p>Although Hodgson had dirtied his bib, he remained much loved in his native land due in no small part to his reputation as a hell-raiser.

  "<p>The New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, has stepped up his campaign for increased federal funding for US cities during the coronavirus crisis, asking Donald Trump whether his administration was \u201cgoing to save New York City or are you telling New York City to drop dead?\u201d</p> <p>De Blasio\u2019s dramatic language came during his press conference on Sunday, after he warned last week that he planned to cut a further $2bn from the city\u2019s municipal services budget due to the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/493257-de-blasio-to-cut-2b-in-nyc-municipal-services-due-to-economic-fallout-of\">economic downturn</a>. He said the city was likely to lose at least $7.4bn in tax revenue over the current and next fiscal year.</p> <p>De Blasio has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/16/nyc-mayor-seeks-federal-aid-as-coronavirus-costs-new-york-7point4-billion-in-tax-revenue.html\">criticized the $2tn </a><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/16/nyc-mayor-seeks-federal-aid-as-coronavirus-costs-new-york-7point4-billion-in-tax-revenue.html\"> coronavirus relief package</a> that Trump signed last month, saying New York only received $1.4bn from the stimulus, compared with around $58bn for the airline industry. He has called for the next package, which congressional and administration leaders <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/19/pelosi-coronavirus-aid-package-194315\">say they are \u201cclose\u201d to reaching a deal on</a>, to include tens of billions for states, cities and municipalities.</p> <p>The mayor had harsh words for the president, claiming both he and the vice-president, Mike Pence, have ignored his overtures on the stimulus funds.</p> <p>On Sunday, De Blasio sent a message to the administration that echoed a New York newspaper headline during the city\u2019s bankruptcy crisis of the 1970s.</p> <p>\u201cThere was that famous Daily News cover that said \u2018Ford to City: Drop Dead,\u2019\u201d De Blasio said. \u201cSo my question is, Mr Trump, Mr President, are you going to save New York City or are you telling New York City to drop dead?

Cat got your tongue?\u201d De Blasio continued. \u201cYou\u2019re usually really talkative. You usually have an opinion on everything. How on earth do you not have an opinion on aid to American cities and states?\u201d</p> <p>The Daily News front page was published after Gerald Ford gave a speech in 1975, saying he would veto a federal bill that would have helped spare New York City from bankruptcy.</p> <p>Across many US cities and states the issue of budget deficits is becoming more pressing, as governors and administrators attempt to counter the economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Central bankers are seeking ways to revive a $4tn market for municipal bonds that allows states and cities to borrow funds for basic infrastructure spending such as schools, hospitals and highways.</p> <p>On Sunday, New Jersey\u2019s Democratic senator Bob Menendez and senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a Republican, proposed a $500bn fund for state and local governments as part of the next rescue package.</p> <p>Officials for New York state, which was already facing a multi-billion budget shortfall after losing hundreds of thousands of taxpayers to states with lower taxes, has already warned the state is facing a $10bn hole caused by the pandemic in its $177bn budget.</p> <p>During his address, De Blasio said he was consulting with counterparts in Miami and Denver on how to handle the approaching financial crisis. But De Blasio\u2019s invocation of an era when crime soared, rodents infested the streets, and entire neighborhoods were considered no-go was also pointed: Trump, raised in Queens, became a classic bridge-and-tunnel entrepreneur, venturing to Manhattan first to play and ultimately to seek a fortune.</p> <p>\u201cYou are failing to protect the very people you grew up around,\u201d the mayor told the president, and warned more broadly: \u201cIf cities can\u2019t function, how on earth do you have a national recovery?\u201d</p> <p>Nearly 14,000 New Yorkers have died since the state\u2019s first coronavirus case was reported on 1 March, according to state data. The state total doesn\u2019t include more than 4,000 New York City deaths that were attributed to the virus on death certificates but weren\u2019t confirmed by a lab test.</p> <p>New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, said states also need money from the federal government to ramp up testing.</p> <p>\u201cYou have the president saying 15 times, \u2018It\u2019s up to the governors, it\u2019s up to the governors, it\u2019s up to the governors.\u2019 And then they\u2019re going to pass a piece of legislation that gives you know what to states: zero, zilch, nada, niente,\u201d Cuomo said.</p> <p>Cuomo said 507 people died from Covid-19 in New York state on Saturday, down 33 from the previous day and by 271 since last Monday. Other indicators were going in the right direction, the governor said. Hospitalizations were down by more than 750, to 16,213.</p> <p>But Cuomo and De Blasio maintained their warnings that people in New York City and the rest of the state need to stay vigilant to curb the spread of the virus.</p>",

  "<p>European countries are diverging on how and when to reopen their shuttered societies, as Germany, the Czech Republic, Norway and others prepared to lift some restrictions on Monday while France and Spain ruled out any relaxation for several weeks.</p> \n<p>The confirmed coronavirus death toll in Europe approached 100,000 on Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">according to the Johns Hopkins University tally</a>, but infection rates continued to slow, heaping pressure on governments to start easing the economic and social burden of a weeks-long shutdown.</p> \n<p>Germany will permit small retail spaces to reopen from Monday alongside car dealerships, cycling stores and bookshops, though people will be urgently advised to wear masks while in public.</p> \n<p>Poland will reopen parks and forests from Monday, while children in Norway will return to kindergarten and open-air markets in the Czech Republic will be permitted to trade as part of a six-week strategy to gradually lift restrictions.</p> \n<p>In Spain, with nearly 200,000 confirmed cases and more than 20,000 deaths, authorities said at the weekend they would hold off on lifting one of Europe\u2019s tightest lockdowns.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have done the most difficult things and we have left the most extreme moments of the crisis behind with sacrifice and resilience, but these results are still not enough and still fragile,\u201d said the prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, in a televised address on Saturday evening.</p> \n<p>\u201cDespite the enormous progress that we have made, it is not possible for us to lift the confinement and move to a phase of scaling down [the restrictions].\u201d</p> \n<p>He said the restrictions would be loosened slightly to allow children time outside from 27 April. Spain\u2019s Covid-19 death toll rose by 410 on Sunday, the lowest daily increase since 22 March.</p> \n<p>French officials said on Sunday that although the virus appeared to be under control there, the country\u2019s strict lockdown would continue for at least another three weeks.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is an epidemic unique in France in modern history and it is not finished,\u201d said the prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe. \u201cWe are making progress against this epidemic. The situation is improving slowly but surely \u2026 but we are not out of the health crisis. To think the epidemic is behind us would be an error.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cOur lives after 11 May will not be exactly the same as before the lockdown. Not at once and probably not for a long time.\u201d More than 150,000 French people have tested positive for the virus and nearly 20,000 have died.</p> \n<p>Philippe said isolating positive cases, some degree of social distancing, an emphasis on washing hands, as well as \u201cmassive and quick testing\u201d of those showing symptoms of the virus and their contacts was likely to persist even if restrictions were eased in May.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/lockdownexit-zip/giv-3902bCjl9rqDI1iT/\" data-alt=\"lockdown\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/lockdownexit-zip/giv-3902bCjl9rqDI1iT/\">lockdown</a> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe have to learn to live with the virus,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see the population is not immunised \u2013 it may be one day, but today it is not, the circulation of the virus has been restrained. Nor will we have a vaccine before 2021 \u2026 and at this stage there is no treatment that has been shown to work. That leaves us one instrument: prevention.\u201d</p> \n<p>President Emmanuel Macron announced last week that schools would begin to open from 11 May, but Philippe said on Sunday they would do so gradually. He said the government was considering various options, including having half a class in rotation, or opening schools in areas where there have been few or no Covid-19 cases before others.</p> \n<p>After a week of slowing infection rates in Israel, the government there announced on Sunday it was easing the stringent quarantine measures in place for the past five weeks. It will allow the partial reopening of hardware, electronic and office supply stores, and group prayer outdoors \u2013 for up to 19 people, standing two metres apart \u2013 and extend the perimeter for exercise to 500 metres from a person\u2019s home.</p> \n<p>Preschools, schools, hairdressers and shopping malls will remain closed, and people will continue having to wear a mask in public spaces, with fines for non-compliance.</p> \n<p>The country of 9 million has had 158 casualties and about 13,000 cases. The relaxed measures will be trialled for a fortnight and tougher restrictions reinstated if the infection rate grows again.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/deaths-zip/giv-3902FWCT2OIqAoeH/\" data-alt=\"Deaths\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/deaths-zip/giv-3902FWCT2OIqAoeH/\">Deaths</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Maharashtra, India\u2019s worst-hit state with more than 3,600 confirmed cases among its population of 114 million, said some activity would be permitted in its least-affected areas while maintaining a strict lockdown in zones that have the most infections.</p> \n<p>South Korea reported only eight new coronavirus cases on Sunday and said it would loosen some of its social distancing restrictions.</p> \n<p>The prime minister, Chung Sye-kyun, said the government would consider opening public outdoor facilities and would relax guidelines on the circumstances in which sports facilities and restaurants can open.

Boston and Chicago are also emerging hot spots with recent surges in cases and deaths.</p> <p>\u201cThe administration I think is trying to ramp up testing, they are doing some things with respect to private labs,\u201d said Republican governor Larry Hogan of Maryland during a CNN interview. \u201cBut to try to push this off, to say the governors have plenty of testing and they should just get to work on testing, somehow we aren\u2019t doing our jobs, is just absolutely false.\u201d</p> <p>Several states, including Ohio, Texas and Florida, have said they aim to reopen parts of their economies, perhaps by 1 May or even sooner, but appeared to be staying cautious.</p> <p>The White House guidelines released late last week on reopening the economy recommend a state record 14 days of declining case numbers before gradually lifting restrictions. Yet in a series of tweets from Trump on Friday, the president called for the \u201cliberation\u201d of Minnesota, Michigan and Virginia, Democratic-led states with strict stay-at-home orders, and appeared to be the catalyst for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/stay-at-home-order-protest-lockdown-maryland-texas-ohio\">protests backed by right</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/stay-at-home-order-protest-lockdown-maryland-texas-ohio\">wing groups</a> in several places, including Texas, Maryland and Ohio.</p> <p>In his tweet on Friday the president <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251169987110330372\">claimed without evidence</a> that Virginia citizens\u2019 second amendment rights were \u201cunder siege\u201d after Northam signed into law <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/11/virginia-governor-ralph-northam-signs-bills\">tighter firearms restrictions</a> a week earlier.</p> <p>In Austin, the Texas state capital, protesters called on Trump to fire Dr Anthony Fauci, the leading US expert on infectious diseases, from his task force tackling the pandemic crisis.</p> <p>Washington governor Jay Inslee, a Democrat who on Friday blasted Trump\u2019s tweets as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/17/trump-liberate-tweets-coronavirus-stay-at-home-orders\">\u201cunhinged rantings\u201d</a>, and one of the most vocal critics of the president, reinforced his position on Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know any other way to characterize it,\u201d Inslee told host George Stephanopoulos on ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cTo have an American president encourage people to violate the law, I can\u2019t remember any time during my time in America where we have seen such a thing. And it is dangerous because it can inspire people to ignore things that actually can save their lives.</p> <p>\u201cIt is doubly frustrating to us governors because this is such a schizophrenia. The president is basically asking people, \u2018Please ignore Dr Fauci and Dr Birx [White House taskforce medical advisers], please ignore <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/03.16.20_coronavirus-guidance_8.5x11_315PM.pdf\">my own guidelines that I set forth</a>,\u2019 because those guidelines made very clear\u2026 that you cannot open up Michigan today, or Virginia, under those guidelines. You need to see a decline in the infections and fatalities. And that simply has not happened yet.\u201d</p> <p>Pence insisted in an interview aired on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday that the country had \u201csufficient capacity\u201d for any state to go to the phase one level.</p> <p>But Hogan and others said the issue was not as straightforward as Pence presented it.</p> <p>\u201cEvery governor in America has been pushing and fighting and clawing to get more tests, not only from the federal government, but from every private lab in America and from all across the world. It\u2019s not accurate to say there\u2019s plenty of testing out there, and the governors should just get it done.\u201d</p> <p>Hogan said he was sympathetic to the protesters. \u201cI\u2019m frustrated also,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to encourage demonstrations. To encourage people to go protest the plan that you just made recommendations on, it just doesn\u2019t make any sense. We\u2019re sending completely conflicting messages out to the governors and to the people, as if we should ignore federal policy and federal recommendations.\u201d</p> <p>Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, where some of the earliest protests took place last week, once again strongly defended strict lockdown restrictions in her state, the 10th largest by population but third highest in the nation in terms of Covid-19 deaths.</p> <p>\u201cMy stay-home order is one of the nation\u2019s more conservative but the fact of the matter is it\u2019s working. We are seeing the curve start to flatten and that means we\u2019re saving lives,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201c[But] I can tell you, we could double or even triple the number of tests if we had the swabs and reagents. That\u2019s precisely why it would really be incredibly helpful if the federal government would use the Defense Production Act to start making these swabs and reagents, so we can improve testing.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>Parliament\u2019s return this week is overdue. Since MPs left<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/uk-parliament-to-close-early-for-easter-amid-coronavirus-fears\" title=\"\"> Westminster</a> on 25 March, the country has been battered by the full force of the Covid-19 pandemic. More than 16,000 people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/18/uk-coronavirus-live-doctors-confirm-lack-of-ppe-amid-fears-supplies-may-run-out-this-weekend\" title=\"\">have died</a>. The health service has been stretched as never before. The economy has shuddered almost to a halt. Sweeping regulations have been introduced, affecting everyone. Normal life has been transformed. And the prime minister has been hospitalised.</p> <p>In such a crisis, parliament would normally have been <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/occasions/recallparliament/\" title=\"\">recalled</a> far earlier. It should have happened <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/31/mps-call-for-virtual-house-of-commons-amid-covid-19-early-recess\" title=\"\">this time too</a>. The virtual proceedings that are expected to start on Tuesday could have been agreed in late March and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/08/the-guardian-view-on-parliament-in-lockdown-time-for-a-virtual-recall\" title=\"\">implemented soon after</a>, as has happened in businesses the world over. Parliament\u2019s absence has instead meant that, for nearly a month, all crucial decisions have been taken by ministers and officials behind closed doors.</p> <p>During this time, ministers have governed mainly by press conference. Message management has been tightly controlled. In these circumstances, crucial issues of concern have often been brushed aside. These include casual prior preparation of the kind <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/coronavirus-38-days-when-britain-sleepwalked-into-disaster-hq3b9tlgh\" title=\"\">alleged</a> over the weekend, continuing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/nhs-frontline-staff-may-refuse-to-work-over-lack-of-coronavirus-ppe-says-union-unison\" title=\"\">shortages of personal protective equipment</a>, neglect of social care, reluctance to cooperate with European neighbours and, most recently, the terms of any exit strategy. Not surprisingly, this system suits ministers fine. But it fosters bad government, not good. Among other defects, it suggests ministers do not trust the public, that the cabinet is divided over next steps and that Britain is governed by incompetent or feeble leaders who are afraid to take decisions, especially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/no-10-denies-covid-19-lockdown-exit-plans-in-limbo-in-pms-absence\" title=\"\">in Boris Johnson\u2019s absence</a>.</p> <p>While public opinion still appears broadly in favour of the measures taken by the government, the attempt to frame the daily announcements as articulating a united and uncontroversial national effort is misleading. Ministers have been right to emphasise the scientific basis of their decisions, and correct to judge that the nation accepts the science-based need for strict measures. But ministers have simultaneously sought to brush aside too much that should also be decided rationally. It is increasingly obvious, for instance, that ministers are trying to co-opt the public\u2019s unified instincts against the pandemic into an acceptance of the government\u2019s reckless and irrational approach to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/the-guardian-view-on-covid-19-and-brexit-extend-the-transition\" title=\"\">Brexit transition</a>.</p> <p>The debates and questions that have surged through the country about Covid-19 policy are about to move back into Westminster. When they return on Tuesdaytomorrow, MPs will make their main proceedings in the Commons chamber <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2020/april1/hybrid-house-of-commons/\" title=\"\">virtual</a>, with around 170 MPs taking part in debates, of whom around 50 will be in the chamber, observing physical distancing, with up to another 120 participating virtually. This is sensible. It echoes the way parliaments in Ireland and Spain have done things. It also does something to protect against the mischievous charge that there is one law for MPs, who can go to work, and another for those who cannot.</p> <p>But it is <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/virtual-parliament\" title=\"\">not ideal</a>. Britain has 650 MPs, not 170. A fair way must be found to allow all MPs, with their multiple local and other concerns, to be heard. The danger with the new process is that it will be controlled by party whips. It is therefore particularly important in such times that Commons committees play a more prominent scrutiny role. It is also essential that parliament continues to take meaningful votes, by electronic means, on extending the lockdown, and systematically addresses the difficult issues raised by the way the lockdown is working, especially in economic and welfare policy. In dark days, parliamentary democracy must shine the strongest possible light on the questions that face us all.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 April 2020. Up to 120 MPs are able to participate in the proceedings remotely, not 70 as an earlier version said. This has been corrected.</p>",

On the plus side, Mick Jagger\u2019s taste in floral curtains is rather chic, and John Legend\u2019s house has the desert-modernism aesthetic down pat.

Stevie Wonder\u2019s medley of Bill Withers\u2019 Lean on Me with his own Love\u2019s in Need of Love Today is a robust double-helix of solidarity. The Rolling Stones\u2019 rendition of You Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want is superbly intimate, Jagger\u2019s big-hearted vocals juxtaposing perfectly with Keith Richards\u2019 Tom Waits-esque murmurs: stoicism and caution in a brotherly duet. Jennifer Lopez isn\u2019t generally thought of as a balladeer, but her performance of Barbra Streisand\u2019s People is Broadway-powerful, and its subject matter \u2013 humility in crisis \u2013 makes it perfectly chosen. Elton\u2019s performance of I\u2019m Still Standing is less good, delivered in the clipped \u201cclub style\u201d of Shooting Stars.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84d892b1b78c65e4b96986b63fe7884902681dd3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84d892b1b78c65e4b96986b63fe7884902681dd3/10_0_3750_2251/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clockwise from top left: Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood performing on One World: Together at Home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Getty Images for Global Citizen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Among the new generation, Billie Eilish is typically spellbinding. She picks out Sunny by Bobby Hebb, an infectiously joyful tune, but while the lyrics face forward into brightness and joy, the way Eilish performs it \u2013 using her sensual, high-frequency vibrato \u2013 acknowledges the pain that came before. Burna Boy\u2019s song African Giant \u2013 \u201cTell em Africa we done dying\u201d \u2013 deftly rebuts the narrative of desperate African strife that has dominated all-star benefit shows in the past, and Taylor Swift\u2019s moving performance of Soon You\u2019ll Get Better, originally written for her unwell mother, will no doubt have powerfully resonated with those whose family members are currently stricken. The line \u201cThis won\u2019t go back to normal, if it ever was\u201d, takes on a quiet political edge, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75c704cc211245ebbdbb62ffe6ba8c4b046ab18e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75c704cc211245ebbdbb62ffe6ba8c4b046ab18e/0_366_4844_2906/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Student watches show on screen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US student Abby Campbell works on homework via remote learning as she watches US singer Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas O\u2019Connell perform</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Campbell/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The BBC\u2019s package of the material slots it into a shiny-floor studio format ably presented by Clara Amfo, Claudia Winkleman and Dermot O\u2019Leary, the latter dressed to audition for a porn parody of the Steve Jobs documentary. The music takes a more soundtracking role with plenty of heartwarming montages of British health workers, bin men and more. There\u2019s also a wonderful sequence where Skip Marley plays his grandfather Bob\u2019s I Wanna Love You as a surprise first dance song for an NHS nurse who had her wedding cancelled because of the crisis \u2013 Richard E Grant plays best man, with Nadiya Hussain as cake provider.</p> <p>Paul McCartney\u2019s Lady Madonna is jazzily interpreted almost to the point of incoherence, but he and Tom Jones give evocative personal tributes to the NHS, with Jones remembering his own isolation at the hands of tuberculosis as a child. Michael Bubl\u00e9 \u2013 whose young son was treated for cancer in 2016 \u2013 delivers a rightly sentimental take on God Only Knows for health workers, but it\u2019s Little Mix who are the best of the Beeb exclusives with a perfectly harmonised version of Touch. Their melancholic take on a track that\u2019s about being ragingly horny hints at a painful side of self-isolation that only a pop song could address in this family-friendly format. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5825556af2c27d32804fbe535f130dff7249def8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5825556af2c27d32804fbe535f130dff7249def8/40_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taylor Swift at the piano\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taylor Swift performs Soon You\u2019ll Get Better.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Global Citizen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are striking moments across the six-hour preamble, too. Ellie Goulding\u2019s admission \u2013 \u201cI can get quite socially anxious, so you\u2019d think [lockdown] would be a breeze for me, but actually I\u2019m finding it really hard\u201d \u2013 is a moment of bracing candour amid the peace-and-love bromides, and the husk that develops around her voice as she pushes it into the red is one of pop\u2019s loveliest sounds. Kesha\u2019s ferocious-sounding cat sounds like it\u2019s keeping someone off camera well over two metres away; South African rapper Sho Madjozi flips her Good Over Here with lyrics castigating people breaking lockdown, and is one of the few moments of genuine fun.</p> <p>K-pop super-boyband SuperM are charming, indulging in lockdown pursuits like exercising, drawing, building a model ship and cooking some rubbish-looking bruschetta as they sing; the comment feed duly explodes into heart emojis. But it\u2019s Italian star Zucchero who steals the show, covering Everybody\u2019s Gotta Learn Sometimes on piano. The Korgis\u2019 song is about the loss of innocence at realising the sheer power of love, but in this context is charged with something even deeper: the pain of grief and the inevitability of death.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32730a4e326844dd1f58b152614c90df1d1c8066\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32730a4e326844dd1f58b152614c90df1d1c8066/0_0_4000_2659/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neighbours in Arlington, Virginia watch Eddie Vedder perform on One World: Together at Home.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neighbours in Arlington, Virginia watch Eddie Vedder perform on One World: Together at Home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although it\u2019s celebrating the work of the WHO, no one comes out to denounce Donald Trump\u2019s defunding of the organisation; Pearl Jam\u2019s Eddie Vedder edited out the government-bashing lyrics in his otherwise extremely powerful rendition of River Cross. Perhaps there is reticence to be seen to be politicising the crisis, despite it being so profoundly political. A cynical reading is that these performances are merely good PR, which of course they are; a more pointed criticism might be that for all the talk of it bringing people together, music is actually quite impotent in the face of such a devastating disease, and that awareness hardly needed to be raised about it. The situation is so grave for some that art will seem facile, even indulgent.</p> <p>But Gaga et al\u2019s intentions are ultimately noble, the performers are sincere, and their song choices channel poignancy, acknowledge tenacity and invite self-reflection. They also, meanwhile, show that the chief interior lighting choice for celebrities is the soulful application of candles.</p>",

We are told that this consignment is still stuck in Turkey with no certainty, at the time this comment was issued, on how many gowns, if any, will leave for the UK, when.</p> <p>\u201cBitter experience over the last few weeks has shown that until a consignment of gowns has landed, the boxes have been checked and the equipment tested, the NHS can\u2019t count on the gowns being available for use at the frontline.</p> <p>\u201cWe understand, for example, that a consignment of 200,000 gowns that arrived from China last week actually contained only 20,000 gowns. This follows previous instances of consignments of gowns being mislabelled and failing safety tests.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone is keen to move to a sustainable supply of gowns as soon as possible but NHS trusts need certainty. Given the current uncertainties over gown manufacture and supply, due to global shortages, we suggest that any future announcements on what gowns might be available for delivery, when, just focus on what we can be certain of.</p> <p>\u201cOn the current position in trusts, it is important to understand what \u2018running out of gowns\u2019 means. Usually it doesn\u2019t mean that no member of staff in that trust has access to a fluid repellent gown or higher levels of protection than a basic apron.</p> <p>\u201cTrusts tell us that they are adopting a number of different approaches to address current shortages.

  "<p>I am a retired consultant paediatrician. My beautiful, intelligent and brave son, daughter-in-law and niece are frontline junior doctors. One works in an ICU where, like around a third of staff, he does not have a respirator mask that fits, or adequate supplies of eye protection. Another is on a Covid-19 palliative care ward for the elderly, and the third works on long-stay psychiatric wards; both are caring for symptomatic patients who understand nothing of not having direct physical contact. They are told by managers not to make a fuss when they ask for FFP3 masks, long-sleeve gowns and visors.</p> <p>Over 50 NHS staff have now died from this infection. I think we will look back and see that it is not only the failure to stockpile equipment, the privatisation of NHS logistics, the dependency on importing foreign-made personal protective equipment, and the inability to rapidly repurpose local industry, but also the inadequacy of Public Health England recommendations in terms of protecting staff, that will have led to many avoidable deaths. I am staggered to read that some senior figures in NHS England regard PHE advice as \u201cexcessive\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/nhs-staff-to-be-asked-to-treat-coronavirus-patients-without-gowns\" title=\"\">NHS staff told \u2018wear aprons\u2019 as protective gowns run out</a>, 17 April).

It has done nothing but lie for weeks. PPE has been insufficient since this crisis began, as you are reporting on an almost daily basis. How many health professionals and social care workers have died already due to lack of adequate protection?</p> <p>You report that the government has ordered 400,000 gowns from Turkey. But you say the NHS needs 150,000 gowns a day, so this new order will last less than three days \u2013 if it exists, if it ever arrives. Then what? When will the next order be placed? Why isn\u2019t everyone shouting about this? The incompetence is stunning. Everyone must support an all-NHS strike. They have every right to protection.

The staff are heroic, having moved on-site, sleeping in a borrowed caravan and a tent two weeks at a time, 24/7, to minimise risk of the virus entering the care home. Despite this, the home now has two potential cases of Covid-19, but testing was only available when there were five or more suspected cases. There are 16 residents, so this meant that one-third had to show symptoms before this happens, if then. (Matt Hancock has since said testing will be made available for all care home staff and residents, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/16/social-care-an-afterthought-in-uk-coronavirus-response-says-leaked-letter\" title=\"\">no deadline has been given</a> for this to be implemented.)</p> <p>In addition, staff are wearing homemade face shields kindly produced by a local primary school on its 3D printer. Support from the community is invaluable, but it is no substitute for effective clinical PPE for frontline staff. The NHS has now grudgingly agreed to provide masks in addition to the usual gloves and flimsy aprons, but the lack of systematic testing for care staff and those in vulnerable communities is a disgrace. Coffey\u2019s words on being well prepared are meaningless unless action follows.<br><strong>Ann Jolly</strong><br><em>Emsworth, Hampshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 As the mistakes this government has made regarding the supply of PPE are becoming clearer by the day (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/uk-missed-three-chances-to-join-eu-scheme-to-bulk-buy-ppe\" title=\"\">UK missed three chances to join EU scheme to bulk-buy PPE</a>, 13 April), so too is the need for transparency, accountability and a proper apology.

  "<p>Only one in four patients is now seeing a GP face to face, with the vast majority getting care through telephone and video consultations, research shows.</p> <p>The \u201crevolution\u201d in how patients access family doctors \u2013 a direct result of the coronavirus \u2013 is revealed in figures collected by the Royal College of GPs.</p> <p>In the four weeks to 12 April, GPs in England undertook 25% less clinical activity than in the same period in 2019. That was due to a combination of factors including many patients staying at home and not seeking GP care at all and also family doctors either being ill themselves or self-isolating because someone in their household was displaying symptoms of the virus.</p> <p>Among patients who sought GP care in that time, only 26% came in to a surgery for an appointment while 71% had their consultation over the phone. That was an almost exact reversal of the patient access patterns seen a year earlier, when 71% attended and just 25% were dealt with remotely.</p> <p>The figures covering around 500 GP practices in England have been collected and shared with the Guardian by the college\u2019s research surveillance centre.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a very rapid and necessary revolution in the way care is delivered in general practice and the way GPs, our teams and our patients have adapted to this has been remarkable\u201d, said Prof Martin Marshall, the college\u2019s chair.</p> <p>Marshall hopes significant numbers of patients will continue to receive remote care once the coronavirus crisis is over, though he stressed that anyone wanting an in-person appointment or needing to receive one for a vaccination, for example, would continue to have one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/were-clearing-the-decks-a-gp-on-watching-the-coronavirus-pandemic-unfold\">'We're clearing the decks': a GP on watching the coronavirus pandemic unfold</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He also stressed that GP surgeries\u2019 recent dramatic expansion of telephone and video consultations may also encourage patients who are ill with non-Covid ailments to seek help that way rather than shun NHS services altogether. </p> <p>Doctors are increasingly concerned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/15/sharp-rise-in-ill-patients-dying-at-home-since-coronavirus-outbreak\">by patients risking their health</a> and even their lives by not seeing a GP, going to A&amp;E or dialling 999 when they develop symptoms such as pain or shortness of breath because they do not want to risk contracting coronavirus or add to NHS staff\u2019s burden.</p> <p>Marshall said too few GPs had secure access to patient records from home, which meant some who self-isolated because of the virus were unable to keep on working.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe are still facing barriers. Many GPs, for example, are telling us they are having technological difficulties with working remotely from home due to a lack of adequate hardware and software. This means that they can\u2019t undertake patient consultations if they are having to self-isolate but still well enough to work, and affects capacity across the rest of the service,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also imperative that we safeguard the technological advances we have made during the pandemic, so that we can continue to work in different ways in the best interests of patients when we eventually get Covid-19 under control. Having the technological capability to offer remote consultations, where appropriate, will be beneficial for general practice, the wider NHS and most importantly our patients.\u201d</p> <p>He wants ministers and NHS leaders to cover the cost of GP surgeries buying thousands of laptops for doctors and practice nurses so that they can talk to patients on the phone while using a VPN link to look at their medical records.</p> <p>Of the 50% of GPs who have not been working from home recently, 44% were unable to do so because they did not have a laptop, research for the college found.</p>",
  "<p>Courts must take care not to \u201coverreact in unprecedented times\u201d, a former director of public prosecutions has said, amid concerns that lengthy sentences being imposed during the coronavirus crisis could be excessive.</p> <p>With courts prioritising coronavirus-related prosecutions, Ken Macdonald QC said acts such as deliberately spitting at police officers or service workers was \u201cmore than a nuisance, it is deliberately dangerous and I\u2019m not surprised the courts are jailing the worst offenders in this category\u201d.</p> <p>But of lesser offences, he said: \u201cPrison isn\u2019t the places for nuisances, especially during a pandemic when confinement is so risky and difficult for the authorities to manage.

Those involving stiffer sentences inevitably attract more publicity. Precise charges and past convictions are not always reported.</p> <p>Magistrates and judges are in unfamiliar territory because not only they are working in difficult \u2013 and potentially hazardous \u2013 circumstances during the lockdown, but they are also enforcing new legislation, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/apr/16/tougher-penalties-assaults-emergency-workers-sentencing-\">Assaults on Emergency Workers Act 2018</a>, which increases penalties in such situations.</p> <p>Magistrate hearings during the pandemic are mainly being conducted by full-time district judges rather than lay magistrates. Some claim district judges are more \u201ccase-hardened\u201d than their part-time counterparts.</p> <p>John Bache, the chair of the Magistrates Association in England and Wales, said: \u201cIt is right that cases involving attempts or threats to deliberately transmit coronavirus are treated very seriously and the sentencing guideline on assault has recently been updated to make it clear that this should be considered as an aggravating factor.</p> <p>\u201cEach individual case is, however, always treated on its own merits and sentencers must also consider a range of other issues, including mitigating factors and the current conditions within the prison estate, before deciding on the appropriate sentence for the individual involved.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>A number of longer sentences have been imposed in the north-west. Thomas Sherrington, a criminal barrister at St John\u2019s Buildings chambers in Manchester, said: \u201cOn the face of it, 12 months for spitting is a lot \u2026 People are being dealt with harshly [but] you would probably say there\u2019s no chance of appealing to a court; there\u2019s a pandemic and people have been dying.\u201d</p> <p>James Mulholland QC, vice-chair of the Criminal Bar Association, said deterrent sentences may be necessary. He said: \u201cSentencing in the time of Covid-19 puts an added weight of responsibility on magistrates \u2026 [they need to respect] both the principle that the punishment should fit the crime, with the need to deter others from harmful antisocial activities, and that these do not outweigh the consideration of the individual circumstances and context of any single offence taken with an offender\u2019s previous history of offending or clean record.\u201d</p> <p>Rosalind Comyn, apolicy and campaigns officer at Liberty, which has published a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/advice_information/coronavirus-know-your-rights/\">know </a><a href=\"https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/advice_information/coronavirus-know-your-rights/\">your </a><a href=\"https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/advice_information/coronavirus-know-your-rights/\">rights</a>\u201d guide for the coronavirus lockdown, said: \u201cThe health and safety of everyone, including emergency service workers, is paramount. But that end will be better met if instead of prioritising enforcement and sanctions, the government focused on educating people and facilitating compliance to the new rules.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 April 2020 because an earlier version said that \u201cinterim guidance published by the Sentencing Council this month instructs judges to treat \u2018activity relating to transmission of Covid-19 \u2026 as an aggravating feature\u2019 of any offence\u201d. The relevant offence covered by this guidance is common assault.</p>",
  "<p>The Czech Republic is to take the first steps towards easing its coronavirus restrictions on Monday, after officials declared that the Covid-19 outbreak there had been brought under control.</p> <p>The country\u2019s coronavirus numbers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/lack-of-testing-raises-fears-of-coronavirus-surge-in-eastern-europe\">like those in most </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/lack-of-testing-raises-fears-of-coronavirus-surge-in-eastern-europe\">of central Europe</a>, are much lower than those further west, partly because of the early implementation of strict lockdown measures.</p> <p>Now the burning question for many central and eastern European countries is how fast to loosen the restrictions. Some policymakers believe that extreme caution is required to avoid undoing the positive work and provoking a fresh outbreak. Others point to the increasing economic costs of lockdown measures and say the low number of cases and deaths should allow a swift reopening, perhaps combined with continued closed borders to prevent the virus arriving from outside.</p> <p>\u201cThe numbers look good so far, but even the governments are not sure if there could be a surge ahead,\u201d said Milan Ni\u010d, an expert with the Berlin-based German Council for Foreign Relations.</p> <p>The Czech health minister, Adam Vojt\u011bch, announced last week that the country\u2019s tough approach had prevented the uncontrolled spread of the disease and justified a cautious lifting of restrictions. The five-stage plan will begin on Monday with farmers\u2019 markets, car dealerships and some other small businesses allowed to reopen for the first time since one of the earliest lockdowns in Europe was introduced on 12 March.</p> <p>In the final stage, tentatively scheduled for 8 June, all businesses would be allowed to reopen, including bars, cafes, restaurants and hotels. However, Vojt\u011bch warned people against being lulled into a sense of false security and said officials would reimpose restrictions if there was a sudden surge in cases.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/deaths-zip/giv-3902btA462ecNO6Z/\" data-alt=\"Czech and Slovak graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/deaths-zip/giv-3902btA462ecNO6Z/\">Czech and Slovak graphic</a> </figure>  <p>As of Sunday morning, the country had recorded 6,657 cases and 181 deaths. Neighbouring Slovakia had just 1,161 cases and 12 deaths, making it one of the least affected countries in Europe.</p> <p>There may be several reasons for the low numbers, but the decisive one seems to be a speedy move to enforce lockdown measures. Border closures and restrictions on movement and gatherings were introduced much earlier than in countries further west. A concerted effort to persuade citizens in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia to wear face masks may also have helped.</p> <p>There has been criticism of the slow pace of moves to ease the lockdown, particularly among those in the service and tourism sector.</p> <p>\u201cThe number of cases has dropped significantly, but still the government is talking about opening most stores only in June, with quite a few restrictions remaining through the summer, including travel bans and significant limits on tourism activity,\u201d said Tom\u00e1\u0161 Prouza, a former secretary for European affairs who now heads the Czech Confederation of Commerce and Tourism.</p> <p>In Slovakia, the prime minister, Igor Matovi\u010d, has faced criticism from within his government for the continued lockdown. Richard Sul\u00edk, the economy minister and leader of the pro-business junior coalition partner in the government, complained on Facebook, \u201cWe don\u2019t destroy our economy for the 800 people who die of flu every year\u201d, and questioned why the country was doing so over the much lower numbers for coronavirus.</p> <p>Matovi\u010d has promised to release a plan and timetable on Monday, but insisted that he would base it on the recommendations of epidemiologists, not economists.</p> <p>Ni\u010d said: \u201cAs countries with much higher infection rates start to discuss gradual relaxations, the paradox is that in central Europe, where the numbers are lower, we\u2019re likely to see a much more cautious exit from lockdown.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/lockdownexit-zip/giv-39027CibXYYhk7Gg/\" data-alt=\"lockdown graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/lockdownexit-zip/giv-39027CibXYYhk7Gg/\">lockdown graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Many countries in the region have imposed severe border restrictions and closed airports, and this may continue even after internal measures are relaxed.</p> <p>The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, said last week that reopening the country\u2019s borders was not a priority. This suggests there is little realistic hope of respite for the country\u2019s beleaguered tourism industry, which until the coronavirus crisis was preoccupied with mitigating the effects of an excess of foreign visitors to Prague. Babi\u0161 said the industry\u2019s focus should now switch to domestic tourism.</p> <p>Another part of the exit strategy is likely to involve masks. In both the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens have been obliged to wear masks for more than a month, with politicians leading by example. The newly elected Matovi\u010d gave one of his first press briefings in a mask in mid-March, and advised others to follow his lead. \u201cEven a home-sewn mask made from old bedsheets or a T-shirt is much better than not wearing any,\u201d he said. Television anchors have read the news in masks, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/czechs-get-to-work-making-masks-after-government-decree-coronavirus\">thousands of volunteers have sewn homemade masks</a> to distribute for free.</p> <p>Roman Prymula, the Czech deputy health minister and an epidemiologist, has warned that the face mask requirement is likely to remain in force throughout the warm summer months.</p> <p>Other countries have since followed suit: Poland, where there is talk of a gradual easing out of lockdown measures in the coming weeks, made mask-wearing outdoors compulsory last week. Austria and some regions of Germany have also ordered the wearing of masks in public places.</p>",
  "<p>As the death toll sadly continues to climb, it\u2019s clear Covid-19 spares no one. Young, old, rich, poor, northerner, southerner \u2013 everyone is at risk of catching, spreading and potentially succumbing to the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>However, this doesn\u2019t mean the impact of this crisis is being felt equally. More and more, the notion that this epidemic is some kind of \u201cgreat leveller\u201d is being exposed for what it is \u2013 a complete myth.</p> \n<p>Evidence is emerging of how black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities are being disproportionately affected. Despite making up only 14% of the population, one study has shown that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/bame-groups-hit-harder-covid-19-than-white-people-uk\">we account for </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/bame-groups-hit-harder-covid-19-than-white-people-uk\">a third</a> of critically ill coronavirus patients in our hospitals.</p> \n<p>The reasons behind this disparity are complex and varied. We know BAME people are more likely to be employed in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/uk-doctors-coronavirus-deaths-highlight-crucial-role-bame-medics\">frontline roles</a> \u2013 whether it\u2019s in the NHS, as care workers, shelf-stackers or bus drivers. In the NHS, for example, around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/24/windrush-nursing-top-jobs-programme-bme-nurses\">40% of doctors and 20% of nurses</a> are from BAME backgrounds. In London, <a href=\"https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/adult-social-care-workforce-data/Workforce-intelligence/documents/State-of-the-adult-social-care-sector/State-of-Report-2019.pdf\">67% of the adult social care workforce</a> are from BAME backgrounds. This exposure puts them at greater risk of catching the coronavirus in the first place.</p> \n<p>But one of the biggest underlying factors driving the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/why-know-how-many-bame-people-dying-coronavirus-data\">disproportionate number of deaths</a> in BAME communities is socioeconomic. It\u2019s an uncomfortable truth that people from ethnic minority backgrounds are overrepresented in poor, overcrowded accommodation, or households with multiple generations under one roof. And it\u2019s a fact that they are more likely to live in poverty or work in precarious and low-paid jobs. Many simply don\u2019t have the luxury of being able to work safely from home during the lockdown. All of this contributes to a BAME population with worse health than average, lower life expectancy and a greater prevalence of serious underlying health conditions, such as heart disease, asthma and diabetes.</p> \n<p>With what we already know about Covid-19 and how it attacks those with underlying health conditions, it\u2019s hardly a surprise that those from ethnic-minority backgrounds may be more likely to catch it and, it seems, die.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s by no means a revelation that there\u2019s a link between health and socioeconomic inequalities \u2013 certainly not for those who live these lives, or for all the charities, campaigners and organisations, including City Hall, that have been fighting these injustices for years. But one of the unexpected consequences of this crisis is that the depth of these inequalities is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-inequality-managers-zoom-cleaners-offices\">being laid bare</a> in such a stark fashion.</p> \n<p>Of course I welcome the government\u2019s announcement last week to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/inquiry-disproportionate-impact-coronavirus-bame\">launch a review</a> into why people from BAME backgrounds are being disproportionately affected by Covid-19. But I fear we already know the conclusions of the review, and what action is needed.</p> \n<p>What would be particularly useful right now is a commitment to routinely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/data-on-bame-deaths-from-covid-19-must-be-published-politicians-warn\">collect and publish data</a> on the demographics of everyone impacted by the coronavirus so that we can understand and act on these concerns. At the moment, we know the age and sex of everyone who contracts and tragically dies from the coronavirus, but we still have little additional reliable information, including about their ethnicity. If the information was collected and published in real time, it would help bring the true scale of the problem to light and provide more evidence about how to protect communities from the virus. Promises to provide this data in the future is not good enough \u2013 we need it to be collected and published right now. There simply is no good reason to wait.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"070e1ce7-43bd-462f-80b5-0be91d966238\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XPF35H9RLNE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There will inevitably be those who say that this has nothing to do with someone\u2019s ethnicity.

Welcome to television!</p> <h2>Droop</h2> <p>For this week\u2019s main challenge, the queens are tasked with creating and selling a unique product to sell for fictional drag lifestyle brand Droop (somewhere in Beverly Hills, Gwyneth Paltrow just threw a piece of organic seagrass at her television). It\u2019s supposed to be high-class and upper echelon. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how to spell echelon!\u201d says Heidi.</p> <p>Ru does a walkaround with health and fitness guru and \u201cbranding expert\u201d Bob Harper. We\u2019ve never seen him before but we wouldn\u2019t trust him to look after our house plants for a day, never mind help us sell a product. Actually maybe that\u2019s not fair. We like his shirt.</p> <p>Jan\u2019s product is called \u201cSure, Jan.\u201d 10/10. She expresses again that she was sad to see Brita go and Bob says \u201cit\u2019s not RuPaul\u2019s best friend\u2019s race!\u201d Shut up, Bob!</p> <p>There\u2019s a great detailed story behind Jackie Cox\u2019s magic carpet concept and we\u2019re looking forward to it \u2013 the first Farsi he saw spoken on TV was in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9L4NVc4HJo\">I Dream of Jeannie</a>, so this is something of a tribute. We can\u2019t remember the last time we saw a contestant go from <em>meh</em> to exciting so quickly.</p> <p>They only get 20 minutes each to shoot the commercial - in television terms, that is a ridiculously short amount of time. Usually commercial shoots take hours at least, often days. Gigi\u2019s concept is great but she\u2019s not giving very much. Whereas Jan is giving us a headache.

It was hilarious. \u201cHi \u2026 I\u2019m better than you!\u201d as an opening line is hard to beat. Amazing. Perhaps this is the difference between British humour and American humour. We like subtle and cutting, they like bold and brash. They might also be pretending it\u2019s bad because Gigi\u2019s done WAY too well this season, and it\u2019s never fun if there\u2019s a glaringly obvious winner from only halfway through.</p> <p>We\u2019re a bit worried about Chaka Khan.

This is at odds with the rest of the UK, where public funding has remained stable or increased.</p> <p>When it opened in 1982, four years after the first test tube baby, Louise Brown, was born in nearby Oldham, St Mary\u2019s was the UK\u2019s first fully NHS funded IVF unit. It now performs over 2,000 fertility treatments every year, including around 1,200 IVF cycles, and offers highly specialised fertility preservation for cancer patients. It is also a top research centre, which led on the use of ovarian reserve tests to guide ovarian stimulation, the development of stem cell lines from human embryos, and the effects of IVF on baby birth weights.</p> <p>The Manchester University NHS foundation trust (MFT) said no decisions had been made over the unit\u2019s future. But staff were briefed last month that the HFEA and local clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) had been told that all licensed treatment and research on the site may end by April 2021 if an alternative solution cannot be found.</p> <p>MFT, which runs the hospital, is also exploring options including redeploying services and some of its 107 staff \u2013 including many highly specialised roles \u2013 but confirmed to staff that closure was a possibility.</p> <p>The Guardian spoke to 10 members of staff at St Mary\u2019s aware of the mooted closure. One said they understood the matter to be settled: \u201cSt Mary\u2019s have taken a proposal to the MFT group board to discontinue the IVF service and the group board have said, \u2018Yes, OK.\u2019 How they discontinue it is what they need to decide next,\u201d they said.</p> <p>If the change goes ahead, CCGs, which fund fertility treatment, will have to pay private clinics to carry out IVF and other fertility services. But staff at St Mary\u2019s warn that the private sector will not be able to carry out some of the most specialised services currently offered by the NHS.</p> <p>\u201cWe offer highly specialised procedures in the NHS which private providers won\u2019t touch because they don\u2019t make money and are too difficult. For example, we aim to see women diagnosed with cancer within a week who want to freeze their eggs before they start chemotherapy. Many of these women are already very poorly and need really high quality anaesthetic care during egg collection, and that is just not available in the private sector because of the medical complications,\u201d said one source.</p> <p>They added: \u201cPrivate clinics are also unlikely to help patients with kidney problems or heart problems. But when they come to us, we can address these issues before they begin IVF: a huge advantage of being part of a multi-disciplinary NHS Trust. Those patients will be disadvantaged if this happens.\u201d</p> <p>They also expressed concerns about screening procedures in the private sector. In the NHS, anyone applying for fertility treatment undergoes a series of stringent checks, including an assessment of the welfare of the child: \u201cOur checks and ethics advisory committee often flag issues including prison sentences, a serious history of domestic violence, even people on the sex offender register. At private clinics they don\u2019t do anything like the same background checks.\u201d</p> <p>A number of separate proposals were put to MFT to try to save some or all of the clinic, including turning the service into a social enterprise and forming a partnership with a private provider, as is being proposed in Leeds.</p> <p>The deadline to apply to run the Leeds service was 23 March, the day the government announced the coronavirus lockdown in the UK. Shortly afterwards, clinics stopped all new treatments and the HFEA ordered private and NHS clinics to stop treating patients in the middle of an IVF cycle by 15 April.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the MFT, which runs St Mary\u2019s hospital, said no decision had been taken to shut the clinic permanently.</p> <p>They said: \u201cServices provided by the department of reproductive medicine at St Mary\u2019s hospital are regularly reviewed as part of a usual cycle to ensure that we continue to provide the best possible care and treatments for all our service users. No decisions have been made, therefore it would be inappropriate to provide any further detail before the outcome of any review has been finalised.\u201d</p> <p>The HFEA said it could not disclose informal discussions between clinics and inspectors.</p> <p>Many St Mary\u2019s staff are worried not just about their patients and their jobs, but the logistics of closing down the clinic. Moving thousands of sperm samples and embryos held in freezers, for use in both treatment and research, was a \u201cmind-boggling\u201d challenge, said one.</p> <p>One staff member said: \u201cAlthough possible relocation was mentioned, the fact that no viable alternative has been identified and that the cost was described as being too high left us thinking that this is not being explored and that closing the unit is the direction of travel. We are worried for our jobs but our biggest concern is for our patients, particularly those with the most complex needs who cannot be served elsewhere without high costs.\u201d</p> <p>IVF provision has been put under pressure, nationally, by NHS funding cuts over the past decade leading to a \u201cpostcode lottery\u201d of provision. Now only a minority of English CCGs offer the recommended three funded IVF cycles, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/29/ivf-cycles-restricted-england-nhs-advisers-ignored\">with some refusing to fund</a> any NHS fertility treatment at all.</p>",
  "<p>Many of the foreign doctors, nurses and care workers on the NHS frontline <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/nhs-staff-protection-doctor-ppe-coronavirus\">without adequate protection</a> are secretly struggling on another front, too. They cannot afford to pay the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/28/scrap-625-pound-surcharge-for-nhs-ovserseas-staff\">fees levied by the Home Office</a> to enable them to remain in the UK and continue their work. </p> <p>Often they fall into debt to pay the charges. Some of them simply leave the country once their permits are up for renewal, unable to find the money. The highest single fee they face is the immigration health surcharge, which must be paid in advance. So you have the spectacle of NHS staff <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/20/calls-scrap-plans-nhs-fee-foreign-staff-health-surcharge\">paying to use the NHS</a>, even though they already pay tax and national insurance contributions.</p> <p>British citizens unfamiliar with the Home Office\u2019s fee framework struggle to understand this when they hear of it for the first time. They\u2019re unable to grasp that there are NHS staff who are taxed twice to use the NHS. Surely I must mean people on visitor visas who don\u2019t work in the UK, they say? Surely the NHS surcharge is directed at them, to disincentivise health tourism?</p> <p>No. I do not mean <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/07/health-tourism-claims-distraction-from-nhs-real-problems\">\u201chealth tourists\u201d</a>. I mean NHS doctors, nurses and care workers from outside the EU who spend the years between visa renewals fretting, saving and borrowing to pay for the cost of their next permit. The sums are crippling, particularly for junior doctors in training and nurses whose salaries start at about \u00a323,000 and \u00a318,000 a year respectively. The NHS surcharge at the moment is <a href=\"https://www.freemovement.org.uk/what-is-the-immigration-health-surcharge/\">\u00a3400 a year</a>. There is no right of deferral, or ability to pay annually. It has to be paid in advance for the entire duration of an applicant\u2019s visa or residency permit.</p> <p>If an NHS worker has any family included on the residency permit, such as a spouse and children, the applicant has to pay the surcharge for them as well, again for the entire duration of the visa. So a family of four on a five-year work permit or limited leave to remain visa has to pay \u00a38000. The fee is to go up this October, <a href=\"https://www.freemovement.org.uk/immigration-health-surcharge-rising-to-624-in-october-2020/\">from \u00a3400 to \u00a3624</a>. That same family of four will then have to pay \u00a312,480. I don\u2019t know if there are many people in the UK, let alone junior doctors, nurses and care workers, who have that kind of money lying around.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-announces-health-surcharge\">surcharge was introduced</a>, like many of the more cynical and punitive features of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/27/hostile-environment-anatomy-of-a-policy-disaster\">hostile environment</a>, by the coalition government in 2015. The sums are set arbitrarily and rise randomly, and we are assured the yield is ploughed back into the NHS, although it\u2019s hard to find evidence of what it is actually used for. The policy was intended to crack down on medical tourism to make sure the \u201cimmigration system is fairer to British citizens and legitimate migrants\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/nhs-staff-to-be-asked-to-treat-coronavirus-patients-without-gowns\">NHS staff to be asked to treat coronavirus patients without gowns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The jargon masks the true nature of the victims of the legislation, while giving the impression that the measures target scheming <a href=\"https://keepournhspublic.com/health-tourism-fact-vs-fiction/\">illegal health tourists</a> who come to the UK to use the NHS and then disappear, costing the taxpayer millions. The surcharge is a fair one, the government claims, to be paid by all those who are \u201cnot ordinarily resident\u201d, a clever technicality that conjures up images of unemployed visitors, but in fact means the opposite. Tourists do not pay the charge, only overseas citizens<strong> </strong>working and studying in the UK do. </p> <p>\u201cNot ordinarily resident\u201d simply means \u201cwithout permanent residency\u201d. Those who fall into that category include a large number on work visas, low incomes and limited leave to remain, paying taxes, VAT and national insurance. Some, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/12/malaysia-gp-home-office-pushing-away-foreign-nhs-doctors\">Dr Siti Ibrahim</a>, a Yorkshire GP in training, have been educated in the UK and have spent decades living and working in the country.

With no exceptions, those I have heard from over the past few days, and who have been instructed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/31/nhs-staff-gagged-over-coronavirus-protective-equipment-shortages\">not to speak publicly</a> to the media about work conditions or PPE, were happy to work those extra shifts.</p> <p>With no exceptions, they all said they did not know where they were going to find the money to pay for their visa renewals when the NHS surcharge rises once again in October, when it will also be expanded to those from the EU. They cannot put their names to this anxiety, but they can be heard. There are <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7783/\">153,000 non-British workers in the NHS</a>.

Given repeated failings with \u2018VIP\u2019 practices in the industry, we will also shortly be consulting on additional requirements in this area.\u201d</p> <p>When Matt deposited \u00a38,000, the VIP manager phoned to ask for reassurance that he could afford the bets, noting they were \u201ca large chunk of your annual salary\u201d.</p> <p>But he appeared to accept Matt\u2019s verbal assurance that he had other work, and he dished out more free bets in return.</p> <p>In a telephone call, a recording of which was shared with the Guardian, the VIP manager said: \u201cI can tell them [MansionBet\u2019s responsible gambling department] he\u2019s received the settlement, he\u2019s managing it responsibly and he\u2019s got other work.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing is, we don\u2019t even want to do it but we have to do it because the UK gambling regulators make us do it.</p> <p>\u201cAs a thank you for clearing that up, there\u2019s a \u00a3100 free bet for you. I hate being intrusive but I\u2019ll always reward you if you give me proper answers.\u201d</p> <p>A few days later, the VIP manager asked Matt to write a review of MansionBet on Trustpilot, a website that consumers visit to see reviews of brands.</p> <p>Matt was rewarded with another free bet after saying he had left a \u201crave review\u201d.</p> <p>Transcripts of WhatsApp conversations show that the VIP manager also offered Matt incentives to deposit more money, saying: \u201cIf you deposit a further \u00a33,000, I would give you \u00a3500 in free bets.\u201d</p> <p>After handing out one bonus, he said: \u201cI hope that\u2019s lucky for you,\u201d but he later admitted: \u201cI tend to give bigger bonuses when you lose.\u201d</p> <p>Matt, whose name has been changed at his request, said: \u201cMansionBet knew I had been made redundant and could see my funds deteriorating every day and yet still allowed me to deposit sickening amounts of money.\u201d</p> <p>The Labour MP Carolyn Harris said: \u201cThis is not only exploitative but cruel, predatory and cynical. These cases grow in severity, yet the industry still protest that they behave responsibly.

  "<p>By late December last year, doctors in the central Chinese city of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/birth-of-a-pandemic-inside-the-first-weeks-of-the-coronavirus-outbreak-in-wuhan\">Wuhan </a>were starting to worry about patients quarantined in their hospitals suffering from an unusual type of pneumonia.</p> <p>As the mystery illness spread in one of China\u2019s major industrial hubs, some tried to warn their colleagues to take extra care at work, because the disease resembled Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), the deadly respiratory disease that had killed hundreds of people across the region in 2002-03<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/apr/21/china.sars\"> after a government cover-up</a>.</p> <p>One of those who tried to raise the alarm, though only among a few medical school classmates, was a 33-year-old Chinese ophthalmologist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/06/li-wenliang-coronavirus-whistleblower-doctor-profile\">Li Wenliang</a>. Seven people were in isolation at his hospital, he said, and the disease appeared to be a coronavirus, from the same family as Sars.</p> <p>In early January he was called in by police, reprimanded for \u201cspreading rumours online\u201d, and forced to sign a paper acknowledging his \u201cmisdemeanour\u201d and promising not to repeat it.</p> <p>Many early cases were linked to the city\u2019s Huanan seafood and fresh produce market, which also sold wildlife, suggesting that the first cases were contracted there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"530a63bd00148e7bdeaa4e6481f85167334f3ca0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/530a63bd00148e7bdeaa4e6481f85167334f3ca0/0_0_4000_2774/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Wuhan hygiene emergency response team leave the closed Huanan seafood wholesale market on 11 January 11.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"694\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Wuhan hygiene emergency response team leave the closed Huanan seafood wholesale market on 11 January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noel Celis/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scientists would discover the disease had probably originated in bats and had then passed through a second species \u2013 in all likelihood, but not certainly, pangolins, a type of scaly anteater \u2013 before infecting humans.</p> <p>But the infections were soon spreading directly between patients, so fast that on 23 January the government announced an unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan city and the surrounding Hubei province.</p> <p>Two weeks later, on 7 February, Li, who had contracted coronavirus himself, died in hospital from the condition about which he had tried to raise the alarm. He had no known underlying conditions and left behind a wife and young child.</p> <p>Li became the face of the mysterious new disease. The story of his death and pictures of him in a hospital bed wearing an oxygen mask made media headlines across the globe, including in the UK.</p> <p>The world, it seemed, was slowly becoming more aware of how lethal coronavirus could be, that it was not just another form of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-mixed-messages-idUSKBN2102GY\">flu </a>with fairly mild symptoms.</p> <p>But while UK scientists and medical researchers were becoming more concerned, and studying the evidence from China, those among them who were most worried were not getting their messages through to high places.</p> <h2>Distracted by Brexit and reshuffles</h2> <p>The Conservative government of Boris Johnson had other more immediate preoccupations at the start of this year.</p> <p>Johnson was still basking in his general election success last December. After he returned from a celebratory Caribbean holiday with his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, the political weather for the prime minister seemed to be set fair. It was honeymoon time.</p> <p>Three and a half years on from the Brexit referendum, the UK was finally about to leave the EU on 31 January. The fireworks and parties for the big night were being planned, the celebratory 50p coins minted.</p> <p>Minds were certainly not on a developing health emergency far away, as Johnson prepared to exploit the moment of the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union for all it was worth. \u201cI think there was some over-confidence,\u201d admitted one very senior Tory last week.</p> <p>The prime minister and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, wanted to make an early impression at home in other ways too, as domestic reformers. Cummings was waging a war on civil servants in Whitehall, throwing his weight around and deliberately upsetting the Westminster applecart.</p> <p>While he made the headlines, briefing about his iconoclastic ambitions, Johnson was preparing a big Cabinet reshuffle to assert his own authority in other areas now Brexit was done and dusted.</p> <p>With Labour effectively leaderless after its fourth consecutive election defeat, there was little opposition to trouble Johnson on any front at all \u2013 and certainly no-one of note asking tough questions about coronavirus.</p> <p>The prime minister duly recast his cabinet team on 13 February \u2013 five days after Li\u2019s death in Wuhan. He made big changes but unsurprisingly retained the hitherto safe pair of hands of Matt Hancock as his health secretary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4439fed8cacaafa0490d145e35714f188fc355a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4439fed8cacaafa0490d145e35714f188fc355a0/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaking about the EU on 3 February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson speaking about the EU on 3 February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a sign of where priorities lay \u2013 and the lack of concern that a potential crisis might be heading our way from the east \u2013 Hancock wasted no time <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthancock/status/1227981463192309760?lang=en\">recording a video of himself</a> grinning with delight on reshuffle day.</p> <p>He smacked his right fist into his left palm saying he could not wait to \u201cget cracking\u201d and that he relished the chance to deliver the Tories\u2019 manifesto promises, reform social care and improve life sciences. And lastly, in a more sombre voice, he spoke of \u201cdealing with coronavirus and keeping the public safe\u201d before adding, as the grin returned: \u201cNow let\u2019s get back to work!\u201d</p> <p>It is perhaps too early to conclude for sure that Johnson, Hancock and the government\u2019s entire team of scientific and medical advisers were caught asleep at the wheel. But the fact that Johnson and Hancock themselves, in common with much of the Downing Street staff, would go on to contract the virus or suffer symptoms, further suggests that people at the top had not been sufficiently on their guard.</p> <p>Now, 11 weeks on from the first cases being confirmed in the UK on 31 January \u2013 a period during which <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">more than 14,000 people</a> (and probably several thousands more once care home fatalities are counted) in the UK have died from Covid-19 \u2013 and with the country in lockdown, the economy facing prolonged recession as a result, schools closed, and no sign of an end in sight \u2013 hard questions have to be asked.</p> <p>We already know with some certainty that other countries, such as Germany, South Korea, Taiwan and New Zealand, will emerge from this crisis having performed far better than the UK. A few weeks ago the government\u2019s advisers crassly said that fewer than 20,000 deaths would be \u201ca very good result\u201d for the UK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/michael-gove-fails-to-deny-pm-missed-five-coronavirus-cobra-meetings\">Boris Johnson missed five coronavirus Cobra meetings, Michael Gove says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As we fast approach that grim tally, many experts now believe the UK may come out of this crisis, whenever that may be, with one of the worst records on fighting coronavirus of any European nation. Once the full tally is counted, few expect the number of deaths to be below 20,000.</p> <p>By contrast, on Friday, Germany was saying it thought it had brought coronavirus largely under control. It had had 3,868 deaths, less a third of the total in the UK (and Germany\u2019s population, at 83 million, is far higher), having conducted widespread testing for Covid-19 from early on, precisely as the UK has failed to do.</p> <p>How, then, did it come to this? How did coronavirus spread across the globe, prompting different responses in different countries? Did the UK simply fail to heed the warnings? Or did it just decide to take different decisions, while others settled on alternative actions to save lives?</p> <h2>The warnings grow louder</h2> <p>David Nabarro, professor of global health at Imperial College, London, and an envoy for the World Health Organization on Covid-19, says one thing is for sure. All governments were warned how serious the situation was likely to become as early as the end of January. Ignorance of the danger that was coming can be no excuse. Yet it would not be until late March \u2013 later than many other countries \u2013 that Johnson would announce a complete lockdown.</p> <p>\u201cWHO had been following the outbreak since the end of December and within a few weeks it called a meeting of its emergency committee to decide if this outbreak was a \u2018public health emergency of international concern\u2019,\u201d said Nabarro.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>WHO made it very clear \u2013 to every country in the world \u2013 that we were facing something very serious indeed</p> <footer> <cite>Prof David Nabarro, Imperial College, London</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat is the highest level of alert that WHO can issue, and it issued it on January 30. It made it very clear then \u2013 to every country in the world \u2013 that we were facing something very serious indeed.\u201d</p> <p>Well before the end of January, the WHO had been tracking the growing threat minutely: 14 January was a key day in the spread of the disease that would become known as Covid-19. The first case was confirmed outside China, with a woman hospitalised in Thailand.</p> <p>A WHO official warned then that it was possible that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-pneumonia-who-idUSKBN1ZD16J\">human-to-human transmission</a> had occurred in families of victims \u2013 a sign that the disease had potential to spread far and fast \u2013 and, inside China, officials were quietly <a href=\"https://apnews.com/68a9e1b91de4ffc166acd6012d82c2f9?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_medium=AP\">told to prepare for a pandemic</a>.</p> <p>There was little international attention on the day, though, because Beijing\u2019s dire warnings about a pandemic were made in secret, and a WHO spokesman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/14/case-of-mystery-coronavirus-found-outside-china-for-the-first-time-thailand\">rowed back from his colleague\u2019s claim</a>.</p> <p>Officially, China had not seen a new case of the coronavirus for over a week; the outbreak appeared to be fading. It took another six days for China to publicly acknowledge the gravity of the threat, time that scientists believed meant a further 3,000 people were infected.</p> <p>But on 20 January, officials announced more than 100 new cases and admitted the virus was spreading between humans, a red flag for concern to anyone who works on infectious diseases. The virus could no longer be contained by finding the animal source of the infection and destroying it.</p> <p>Two days later, the scale of the challenge was made clear to the general public when Beijing locked down millions of people. All transport into and out of the metropolis of Wuhan was cut off, an unprecedented modern quarantine that would come at huge human and economic cost.</p> <p>On 29 January, the UK would have its first two confirmed cases of the disease. There was little sense that China\u2019s dilemma and its approach \u2013 shut down life as we know it or watch the death toll spiral out of control \u2013 might have to be our nightmare within weeks.</p> <p>In early February, Donald Trump announced a ban on travellers who had passed through China in the previous 14 days. Europe began focused testing of people with symptoms and travel histories that linked them to the disease, but little else.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Johnson, it seemed, still had Brexit and free trade much more on his mind. Any hint of draconian action to fight coronavirus that might hurt the economy was the last thing he was entertaining.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-in-greenwich-3-february-2020\">speech on Brexit</a> in Greenwich on 3 February, he made clear his views on Wuhan-style lockdowns. \u201cWe are starting to hear some bizarre autarkic rhetoric,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen barriers are going up, and when there is a risk that new diseases such as coronavirus will trigger a panic and a desire for market segregation that go beyond what is medically rational to the point of doing real and unnecessary economic damage.</p> <p>\u201cThen, at that moment, humanity needs some government somewhere that is willing at least to make the case powerfully for freedom of exchange, some country ready to take off its Clark Kent spectacles and leap into the phone booth and emerge with its cloak flowing as the supercharged champion of the right of the populations of the Earth to buy and sell freely among each other.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Herd immunity\u2019: UK goes it alone</h2> <p>By early March it was abundantly clear to many academics and scientists that the approach being adopted by the UK was markedly different from those followed by other countries. From South Korea to Germany, governments had invested heavily in expanding testing capacity from the first weeks of the epidemic.</p> <p>Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore had brought in controls on travellers from infected regions and strict contact tracing to help understand who could have been exposed, inform them and require self isolation. Face masks became widespread in east Asia, long before it was recommended elsewhere.</p> <p>Testing and contact tracing has been at the heart of the approach advocated by the WHO, so that countries can establish how transmission chains were occurring, in order to break them<em>.</em></p> <p>Many also brought in some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-and-social-distancing-is-it-risky-to-go-to-the-pub-or-gym\" title=\"\">social distancing</a> measures, banning large gatherings, closing schools or extending holidays, and encouraged those who could do to work from home. None were as extreme as China\u2019s shutdown, or the European and American lockdowns that would follow.</p> <p>Writing in the Observer last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/britain-goes-it-alone-over-coronavirus-we-can-only-hope-the-gamble-pays-off\">Devi Sridhar</a>, chair of global public health at the University of Ediburgh, noted the distinct UK approach. \u201cRather than learning from other countries and following the WHO advice, which comes from experts with decades of experience in tackling outbreaks across the world, the UK has decided to follow its own path. This seems to accept that the virus is unstoppable and will probably become an annual, seasonal infection.</p> <p>\u201cThe plan, as explained by the chief science adviser, is to work towards \u2018herd immunity\u2019, which is to have the majority of the population contract the virus, develop antibodies and then become immune to it. This theory has been widely used to advocate for mass vaccination for measles, mumps and rubella. The thinking is that, if most of the population is vaccinated, a small percentage can go unvaccinated without cases emerging.\u201d</p> <p>It was not just the UK whose politicians and scientific advisers were, arguably, slow to act in the early stages. Others countries, including Spain and France, were caught out too, but it was Italy\u2019s tragedy that alerted Europe to the scale of the threat it faced.</p> <p>European governments and citizens were forced to reckon with the reality that in an age of global travel, the thousands of miles separating them from China meant almost nothing at all. Thousands of Britons were holidaying in Italy the week that it shut down. They were advised to go into self-quarantine on return, but were not registered by the health authorities, nor were their contacts tracked.</p> <p>Italy and the UK had both had had their first case a day apart at the end of January, but cases rose faster in Italy. The country may just have been unlucky that carriers of the disease flew to its northern cities and ski resorts rather than to other European capitals.</p> <p>Whatever the reason, cases and then deaths started climbing sharply in northern Italy in late February. Dozens of towns were locked down from the 21st, but in the rest of the country life carried on as normal.</p> <p>It was soon clear that the problem had not been contained. On 8 March, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, quarantined 16 million people across the north of the country, and the next day extended the lockdown to all of Italy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da874a2da80ade88d27d5e6cc500ded7835d54bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da874a2da80ade88d27d5e6cc500ded7835d54bf/0_0_4262_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Russian biological warfare troops, called in by the Italian authorities, disinfect the Pope John Paul I care home near Bergamo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"704\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russian biological warfare troops, called in by the Italian authorities, disinfect the Pope John Paul I care home near Bergamo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Russian Defence Ministry/TASS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The measures saved lives, but came too late for thousands of Italians. The death toll outstripped China, and the world looked on horrified as hospitals were overwhelmed, doctors forced to choose who should have a chance on a ventilator and who should die. On 11 March, the WHO declared a global pandemic. On 14 March, Spain went into lockdown, and three days later France did the same.</p> <p>But in the UK there appeared to be greater reluctance to act decisively with lockdowns: the banning of mass gatherings and the closure of pubs and restaurants. The government\u2019s scientific and behavioural science advisers were warning ministers that the public might react badly to draconian measures and would not tolerate them for long.</p> <p>In an apparent show of defiance against the lockdowners, Johnson and Symonds attended the England v Wales rugby match at Twickenham on 7 March. The Cheltenham Festival, attended over three days to 13 March by 250,000 racegoers, was allowed to go ahead.</p> <h2>Shutdown: Johnson changes tack</h2> <p>The tone was about to change. In a Downing Street press conference on 12 March, Johnson, who had said a few days before the first UK death that the disease was \u201clikely to spread a bit more\u201d suddenly became the deliverer of grave warnings.</p> <p>Previous talk by his advisers of avoiding lockdowns and developing \u201cherd immunity\u201d had been banished and replaced by a brutal honesty. \u201cI must level with you,\u201d Johnson told reporters. \u201cMore families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time.\u201d On 18 March \u2013 just days after Downing Street had suggested it was not on the cards \u2013 the government announced the closure of all schools until further noticed. Pubs and restaurants were ordered to shut on 20 March. The UK had come late into line.</p> <p>One former cabinet minister last week described the change of approach as a \u201cscreeching U-turn\u201d. Johnson and his ministers were now, even more than before, taking cover behind, and advice from, their scientific and medical advisers. Many of these advisers had become increasingly concerned that the UK had become out of step with other countries because of political resistance from ministers to measures that would hit the economy. The Observer has been told that at least two senior government advisers were on the brink of of quitting before Johnson switched his approach.</p> <p>The government has found itself unable to escape the consequences of a wider failure to prepare. As hospitals threatened to be overwhelmed before orders were given to massively expand capacity, ministers came under intense criticism over the lack of protective equipment for frontline NHS staff, over the lack of ventilators for patients in intensive care, and for a failure to test more widely for Covid-19, particularly among NHS workers.</p> <p>The lack of preparedness and instances of chaotic planning has shocked many in and outside the NHS.</p> <p>Last week, Dr Alison Pittard, the dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, the professional body for intensive care practitioners, said the minimum specifications for the government\u2019s own homegrown ventilator scheme would produce machines that would only treat patients \u201cfor a few hours\u201d. \u201cIf we had been told that that was the case\u2026 we\u2019d have said: \u2018Don\u2019t bother, you\u2019re wasting your time. That\u2019s of no use\u2019,\u201d she told the <em>Financial Times</em>.</p> <p>Last month the government missed an EU procurement deadline for ventilators because, minister said, an email went unnoticed. The NHS had said 30,000 more would be needed, Hancock reduced this to 18,000. Pittard said her faculty had been warning for years about a shortage of intensive care capacity and intensive care nurses in hospitals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"791815c54c476190b88004cd04d9024ea7189758\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/791815c54c476190b88004cd04d9024ea7189758/0_0_3920_2751/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson and partner Carrie Symonds with the England captain Owen Farrell at Twickenham on 7 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson and partner Carrie Symonds with the England captain Owen Farrell at Twickenham on 7 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Normally each intensive care patient would have one intensive care nurse in attendance all the time, she said. Now there was one nurse to six patients, although other staff had been redeployed to intensive care units to plug the gaps and the new system was working because of heroic efforts. Although she was reluctant to criticise the government, she said that if the faculty had been listened to, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t be starting from this place\u201d. Germany, she pointed out, has 29 intensive care beds per 100,000 people, compared with six in the UK.</p> <p>The Tory MP and former health minister Dan Poulter, who works part-time in the NHS, said that given the enormity of the challenge facing government \u201cit almost seems wrong to be critical\u201d.</p> <p>But he believes part of the problem is that insufficient advice has been sought from experienced NHS clinicians who would have warned of problems with PPE early on, of the shortage of ventilators and would have told ministers of the urgent need to test NHS staff.</p> <p>\u201cAn early over-reliance on academic modelling also resulted in a lack of experienced frontline NHS clinicians \u2013 in other words, the people who really understand the day-to-day challenges our hospitals and health service face \u2013 from feeding into the initial Covid-19 action plan,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has manifested itself amongst other things in the slowness of providing adequate PPE for frontline NHS staff and in the lack of virus testing for healthcare staff in the earlier part of the outbreak.\u201d</p> <h2>How the scientists reacted</h2> <p>When the investigations into the UK\u2019s response to Covid-19 come to be written, there is widespread recognition among experts that this lack of long-term strategic planning will be at the centre of it. So too should be the need to ensure that the views of experts are fed into government more efficiently and widely. The prospect of a previously unknown disease spreading catastrophically around the globe and infecting millions is, after all, not a new one.</p> <p>Indeed, many warnings have been given in the past about the viral dangers facing humanity. \u201cGiven the continual emergence of new pathogens ... and the ever-increasing connectedness of our world, there is a significant probability that a large and lethal pandemic will occur in our lifetime,\u201d Bill Gates predicted several years ago. \u201cAnd it will have the impact of a nuclear war,\u201d he warned, while urging nations to start stockpiling antiviral drugs and therapies. If only.</p> <p>For its part, the WHO prepared \u2013 several years ago \u2013 a list of viruses with no known treatments or vaccines, illnesses that could one day trigger that pandemic and kill hundreds of thousands. Prospective killers included nipah disease and lassa fever as well as an ailment it simply called \u201cdisease X\u201d \u2013 \u201ca serious international epidemic caused by a pathogen currently unknown\u201d.</p> <p>As to the most likely nature of that mysterious virus, most modelling assumed that disease X would be flu-like in behaviour, says Dr Josie Golding, the epidemics lead at the Wellcome Trust. After all, influenza had caused so many deadly global outbreaks in the past. As a result, a lot of investment went into making influenza vaccines in preparation, she says. \u201cBut have we been thinking about diseases other than influenza that might become pandemics? I don\u2019t think we have. There has been a real gap in our thinking.\u201d</p> <p>Then came the appearance of Covid-19 \u2013 caused not by a strain of influenza but by a coronavirus \u2013 in November. Initially, only a few cases were highlighted, a trend that began to change early this year with a rise in numbers of infected ill people.</p> <p>\u201cThe report that really grabbed my attention came out in mid-January,\u201d says epidemiologist Professor Mark Woolhouse at Edinburgh University. \u201cIt said 41 cases of this new respiratory illness had now been diagnosed in one small area of China, around Wuhan. And that set the alarm bells ringing for me.\u201d</p> <p>For Woolhouse, the cluster of cases in one place showed this was not a matter of a few people scattered around China picking up an occasional infection from an animal such as a bat or a chicken. \u201cForty-one cases in one small area at the same time could not be explained that way. People are not picking this up from animals, I realised. They are actually spreading it to each other. It was already heading out of control.\u201d</p> <p>Ewan Birney, head of the Cambridgeshire-based European Bioinformatics Institute, part of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory network, also noted the significance of the new disease at the time. \u201cI presumed, at first, that this one would also burn itself out, probably somewhere in Asia,\u201d he says.</p> <p>His reasoning was straightforward. The outbreak of Sars that appeared in 2003 in China was caused by a coronavirus and killed more than 10% of those it infected. \u201cIn fact, it killed or hospitalised so many of those it infected the chain of transmission from one person to others was cut. It was too lethal for its own good. So I thought this might happen with this new disease. But it turns out Covid-19 is much milder and incapacitates fewer individuals, so there is no cut in its transmission. When that became apparent \u2013 around mid-January \u2013 I became very worried.\u201d</p> <p>Then there was the infectiousness of the new virus. A person with Sars generally starts to display symptoms before they infect other people. That makes it much easier to contain. But this was not the case with Covid-19. Early data from China \u2013 again released in January \u2013 showed the virus was being spread from people who were displaying only the mildest symptoms, or in some cases no symptoms. This was making the condition very difficult to track, says virologist Professor Jonathan Ball of Nottingham University.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25977647596285090437cf9f7a40c96f7d171dab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25977647596285090437cf9f7a40c96f7d171dab/0_0_6048_4024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The County Oak Medical Centre in Brighton was closed on February 10 after a member of staff was infected with coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The County Oak Medical Centre in Brighton was closed on 10 February after a member of staff was infected with coronavirus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAt that point I realised this outbreak was going to be very serious,\u201d he added. \u201cI sent a tweet to a colleague in Australia. It simply said: \u2018This one is out of the bag properly\u2019. He sent one back agreeing with me.\u201d</p> <p>Around this time, Paul Nurse, Nobel laureate and head of the Francis Crick Institute, recalls attending a conference where he met Mark Walport, head of UK Research and Innovation, the organisation that funds a vast slice of British scientific research.</p> <p>\u201cHe had just received a text message from a colleague about the outbreak and we started to discuss the implications,\u201d Nurse recalls. \u201cIt did not take us long for us both to realise this was going to be very significant. It took another two or three weeks to confirm these worst fears \u2013 by mid-February.\u201d</p> <p>By this time, Birney had realised the virus had a real sting in its tail and could cause serious illness among the elderly and those with other underlying serious ailments. \u201cIt was half-term and I was on holiday with my parents. All I wanted to do was to get the holiday over and then get them back to their house in the country where they could keep themselves isolated.\u201d</p> <p>In February, sporadic cases of Covid-19 were appearing round the country, recalls Tom Wingfield, a clinician and infectious disease expert based at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. \u201cThese were cases that had been brought into the country, mainly from China or Italy. Then there was an outbreak in Brighton [and a number of other cases without foreign travel] and I realised that the virus had established itself in a community there. It was a turning point.\u201d</p> <p>Britain was still doing quite well in containing the disease by testing, tracing contact and setting up quarantine for those suspected of being infected with Covid-19 at this time. \u201cThen, in March, the government decided to abandon this approach and shift from containing the disease to delaying its progress,\u201d says Wingfield. \u201cI would really like to know why the decision to give up testing and contact tracing was taken.\u201d</p> <p>Many other researchers also question why the government took so long to react to their warnings. \u201cPart of the trouble was there were other virologists who were saying this was going to be like Sars or flu and there was not too much to worry about,\u201d says Ball. \u201cBut Sars happened in 2003. The world is much more connected now than it was then. More to the point, Covid-19 was also much more infectious than Sars. And so it started appearing in lots of other countries.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps some of us should have got up in front of BBC News and said you lot ought to be petrified because this is going to be a pandemic that will kill hundreds of thousands of people</p> <footer> <cite>Professor Jonathan Ball</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cPerhaps some of us should have got up in front of BBC News and said you lot ought to be petrified because this is going to be a pandemic that will kill hundreds of thousands of people,\u201d adds Ball. \u201cNone of us thought this was a particularly constructive thing to do, but maybe with hindsight we should have. If there had been more voices, maybe politicians would have taken this a bit more seriously.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is no question that we were insufficiently prepared,\u201d Nurse says. \u201cWe had been warned a few years ago when reports made it clear that the UK was not ready to combat a major flu pandemic and we did not take up that warning. As a result, we were caught out.\u201d</p> <p>He and many others say an inquiry into Britain\u2019s Covid-19 preparedness will have to be held at some point but stress that this should not be started until the crisis has been dealt with in the UK.</p> <p>Professor Ian Boyd, a former chief scientific adviser at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, agrees. \u201cThere is a great danger there will be a lot of looking back with the benefits of hindsight and poking fingers of blame,\u201d warns Boyd. \u201cBut when you are in the middle of things you have to make a lot of very hard 50-50 decisions, and sometimes you make the wrong call. On the other hand, there is no harm in making sure that we learn as many lessons as we can.\u201d</p> <h2>The lessons from the rest of the world \u2026</h2> <p>Boris Johnson, after his own brush with death at the hands of Covid-19, will presumably no longer take the gung-ho attitude to illness that he has always has. A former Tory minister said: \u201cIf Boris had any sense he would take control of the inquiry and lead it.\u201d</p> <p>One conclusion that experts are already drawing is that it was those countries close to China, with memories of Sars, or cultural ties to their neighbour, which were much faster to act in response to Covid-19. Perhaps most notable in its success was Taiwan. Closely linked by economic and cultural ties to mainland China, Taiwan could have been at high risk of a major Covid-19 epidemic. Tourists and business people travelled regularly back and forth.</p> <p>But helped perhaps by having an epidemiologist as vice-president, the government set up a gold standard regime of testing and contact tracing that means that nearly three months on from its first confirmed infection, it has registered fewer than 400 cases and six deaths.</p> <p>Taiwan\u2019s extensive testing and thorough contact tracing are precisely the kind of action that the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt is demanding before the UK lockdown is lifted. Hunt points out that it is one of the essential conditions set by the WHO to avoid a second wave resulting from an easing of restrictions.</p> <p>Hong Kong, which also suffered from the Sars crisis, also moved early to enforce quarantine and social distancing, as well as widespread mask wearing, and today has registered just over 1,000 cases and only four deaths.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f289aa48517f17149a8041ae814acba0d3acdc0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f289aa48517f17149a8041ae814acba0d3acdc0/0_0_2677_1785/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man in Wuhan on February 10, the 19th day of the transport lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man in Wuhan on 10 February, the 19th day of the transport lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In late February, South Korea looked like it was on a trajectory to disaster, with the highest number of confirmed cases outside China, and numbers rising rapidly. But after the country\u2019s first infection, the government met medical companies and urged them to start developing coronavirus test kits on a massive scale.</p> <p>The results were impressive. When the epidemic hit, it was ready to deploy largescale testing. Its measures allowed South Korea to become <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/world/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-flatten-curve.html\">the second country to flatten its coronavirus curve</a>, without the sweeping shutdowns of society and economic activity that China had pioneered and the west would be forced to adopt.</p> <p>China\u2019s experience should have provided a grim template for western countries to use to prepare. The speed with which Wuhan\u2019s crisis had intensified showed that a relatively advanced medical system could be swamped. Within three weeks there were over 64,000 people infected and 1,000 dead.</p> <p>The pleas for help from Wuhan\u2019s residents and doctors were to be echoed by those from Italy a few weeks later, and soon after the UK.</p> <p>Look back three months, and in China there were not enough tests to work out who had coronavirus, there was not enough protective equipment for medical staff treating patients, and then, soon, tragically there were not enough hospital beds and ventilators for sick patients. These are exactly the challenges faced by authorities from New York to Rome, London to Madrid.</p> <h2>\u2026 and the other country that didn\u2019t listen</h2> <p>If the UK has serious questions to answer, the country that so far has seen the worst of the outbreak, the United States, was slowest of all to act. Trump for months ignored, played down or lied about the threat posed by coronavirus, leaving individual states to act unilaterally as it became clear it had already taken hold on US soil.</p> <p>On 17 March parts of California issued \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders, effectively a lockdown. By the end of that week New York City had also shut down, along with a dozen states, and the majority of the rest of the country had put <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-state-by-state-guide-to-coronavirus-lockdowns-11584749351?mod=theme_coronavirus-ribbon\">some restrictions in place</a>. Only five states had few or no controls.</p> <p>There have now been nearly 700,000 confirmed cases in the US and over 33,000 deaths; actual numbers are likely to be higher for both. The economy has also been devastated, with more than 22 million out of work as businesses collapse or shrink under the strain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69e38a47cdc18de7145f38e0be39c788201f5258\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69e38a47cdc18de7145f38e0be39c788201f5258/0_0_3708_2472/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The US was slowest of all to act, but Donald Trump is ready to lift restrictions already.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The US was slowest of all to act, but Donald Trump is preparing to lift restrictions already.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Brandon/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump insists the US is turning a corner, and has tried to blame \u2013 among other targets \u2013 the WHO for failing to fully raise the alarm, and has stripped it of its US funding.</p> <p>There have certainly been questions about the organisation\u2019s strong praise for China and the exclusion of Taiwan, which may have contributed to the delay in recognising human-to-human transmission was occurring.

We have not received any claims yet [related to coronavirus] but we aware of some complaints about treatment of patients.</p> <p>\u201cThis could be a very great drain on healthcare resources. It would take money from frontline services. We want to have sensible debate about it. It\u2019s for society to decide whether it\u2019s proper in such wholly exceptional circumstances.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>She added: \u201cDoctors are having to work in very difficult circumstances. These are people who, very bravely, are working to the best of their ability. It should not be underestimated how distressing allegations of clinical negligence are for doctors.</p> <p>\u201c[Medical negligence] claims are already out of control. Awards are based on 1948 legislation which says that all future care will be [paid for as] private [medical care]. If we keep taking money out of the NHS we reduce its resources. It\u2019s a vicious circle.\u201d </p> <p>The Department of Health has said its emergency clinical negligence indemnity will cover healthcare workers. The Coronavirus Act 2020 introduced new indemnity powers. The department declined to comment on the calls for legal immunity.</p>",
  "<p>Just a couple of months ago we were inside the rugby bubble. The Six Nations was coming towards a conclusion and domestic competitions were in full swing all over the world. We were saturated by the sport and we were comfortable, and when that happens you can start to pick holes.</p> <p>Over the past few years, highlighting rugby\u2019s problems has become a popular thing to do. I admit I have been among the more vocal in that sense but it has become widespread. There is a temptation at the moment to just will rugby back, warts and all, because players will be desperate to play and fans desperate to see some action, but it is important to resist.</p> <p>As and when rugby does return we need to see it in its best light. This feels like a seminal moment, an opportunity to reset and reboot and we have to accept that change never happens spontaneously. You almost need a moment like this to be able to reflect, declutter and broaden your perspective as to where we\u2019re at, where we\u2019ve been and where we want to go.</p> <h2><strong>Apply the laws properly</strong></h2> <p>This is not the time to rip up the lawbook and start again but it is the time to start applying the laws properly. To name just a few issues, we should look at ruck entry, players going off their feet, box-kicking, reset scrums, players goading each other and backchat to referees. I would like to see rugby borrow from cricket where teams are fined for slow over-rates. It is in the lawbook that you need to set a scrum with 30 seconds, or a lineout within 30 seconds, or take a kick at goal within a certain amount of time. If those laws are flouted I want to see fines handed out \u2013 either financial or in terms of points. We\u2019re trying to protect our sport and make it as viewer-friendly as possible \u2013 that has to underpin every change rugby makes. We have seen that changing behaviours is possible. Sam Warburton\u2019s red card <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/15/wales-france-rugby-world-cup\" title=\"\">in the 2011 World Cup semi-final</a> is a good example and I believe Jared Payne\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/09/ulster-jared-payne-ban-saracens-alex-goode-heineken\" title=\"\">2014 sending-off against Saracens</a> in Europe is another. There are a few easy quick fixes that would make the game quicker, slicker and more attractive to viewers.</p> <h2><strong>Usher in a global calendar</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/17/my-favourite-game-france-v-new-zealand-1999-rugby-union-world-cup\">My favourite game: France v New Zealand, 1999 Rugby World Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A uniform global calendar that works for both hemispheres makes all the more sense in the current climate. Try explaining to someone who does not follow rugby just why we have a block of Premiership matches at the start of the season, then a couple of European fixtures and then a November series. I love watching the autumn internationals but at times like this you can take a step back, look at things with more perspective and ask why they exist. You have southern-hemisphere players at the end of their seasons and the north near the start of theirs \u2013 everyone is in a different mental and physical state. I\u2019d like to see a block of international matches grouped together where club competitions go on hold and I\u2019d like those Tests to be meaningful. At club level, let\u2019s introduce the Club World Championship. At a World Cup you have to play seven games if you want to win it and what better way to prepare players for that level of intensity than doing so with their clubs? The clubs would get better value out of knowing they have their players for an extended period of time. A Club World Championship <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/06/club-world-cup-to-be-put-forward-as-radical-new-rugby-union-competition\" title=\"\">has been</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/06/club-world-cup-to-be-put-forward-as-radical-new-rugby-union-competition\" title=\"\">mentioned</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/06/club-world-cup-to-be-put-forward-as-radical-new-rugby-union-competition\" title=\"\">before</a> but the reaction was lukewarm at best. </p> <h2><strong>Co</strong><strong>operate and compromise</strong></h2> <p>In order to achieve that, however, there must be greater cooperation and compromise among the unions, the league and all stakeholders. Put simply, we cannot afford not to. Every union is undergoing financial hardship to varying levels but the Rugby Football Union is the richest in the world and is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/16/world-rugby-sends-80m-coronavirus-relief-fund-to-national-unions-rugby-union\" title=\"\">expecting losses of \u00a350m</a>. All unions have to listen to one another, they have to hold hands \u2013 it almost feels like marriage counselling. The past 25 years, since professionalism was introduced, have been amazing, but we have to learn lessons to make the sport more economically sustainable. Let\u2019s look at the tier-two nations, who have always been in this situation. We\u2019re starting to understand their struggles. Fiji, Samoa or Tonga come up to Twickenham and get only \u00a350,000 for a game. Eyebrows are always raised but it then gets accepted and happens again. </p> <h2><strong>Work to keep clubs healthy</strong></h2> <p>The very first thing that must be addressed is the salary cap \u2013 that has to be reduced. The Premiership clubs made a collective loss of nearly \u00a350m last year and you cannot keep throwing money at debt. Moderating the salary cap would ensure the health of our clubs and a way to do that would be getting rid of the marquee players rule. If you have one player earning, say, \u00a3500,000 and he\u2019s a marquee but another player of similar ability who is not, that creates tension and drives up wages. I\u2019m sure players will read this and say: \u201cYou\u2019ve forgotten what it\u2019s like to be a player.\u201d I want every single player to be paid as much as they can in a sport which is absolutely brutal but the harsh reality is that I also want this sport to survive. Players are taking 25% wage cuts and the truth is that may well become the new norm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Time for central </strong><strong>contracts?</strong></h2> <p>Taking things a step further, this may finally be the time to introduce central contracts. I wouldn\u2019t say they are inevitable but I think a serious conversation about the issue is. It is a simple fact that in the current climate there will be major investors in our game who can help to bail out clubs and that comes with a cost. If the RFU provides financial help to the clubs they will want more control and a larger say and I think we are moving in the direction of central contracts. At the moment, clubs simply cannot afford to keep hold of their prized assets and I\u2019m not sure it is worth them doing so given the limited amount of time they have them for. The compensation that they get for producing world-class players through their academies is not enough. The owners would not like central contracts but their businesses will have been hit by the lockdown. Any reasonable way that the pressure can be relieved would be welcome.</p> <h2><strong>Put player welfare first</strong></h2> <p>None of the above can happen without the players and the most important aspect of rugby\u2019s return is their welfare. There are a huge number of games to be played and the cold, hard truth is that the players cannot be expected to fulfil all of the fixture backlog. The key is finding the middle ground where a return doesn\u2019t put a stress on the NHS, so it is inevitable that in the short-term rugby will be played behind closed doors. Ultimately, however, economics will play a big part in the return date because otherwise clubs will fold.</p>",
  "<p>People who feel trapped and lonely during the coronavirus lockdown must be swiftly identified and given the help they need, one of the experts leading the UK\u2019s assessment of the outbreak\u2019s psychological impact has said.</p> \n<p>Prof Rory O\u2019Connor, of the University of Glasgow\u2019s institute of health and wellbeing, has overseen what is believed to be the largest nationally representative survey of the adult population\u2019s response to the crisis.</p> \n<p>\u201cUnderstandably, the initial response was about the physical containment of the virus, but we need to now ensure that we are protecting people\u2019s mental health,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do know from an initial snapshot survey that people are reporting elevated levels of anxiety, depression and stress. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so urgent that we identify who is vulnerable so we can put measures in place.\u201d</p> \n<p>But he cautioned that, while much of the support offered was likely to be digital while physical distancing continues, we must still ensure those interventions have been properly trialled: \u201cOne of my concerns is that in our rush to be supportive there\u2019s this widespread rollout of digital technologies that are not evidence-based.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/urgent-studies-needed-mental-health-coronavirus-lockdown\">'Urgent studies needed' into mental health impact of coronavirus</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The survey of 3,077 UK adults recruited according to age, sex and socioeconomic background is being led by the University of Glasgow in collaboration with Samaritans and the Scottish Association for Mental Health.</p> \n<p>The survey is exploring new territory, O\u2019Connor said. \u201cWe know from research into Sars in China that there can be a mental health impact, but we don\u2019t know who is likely to be affected.\u201d</p> \n<p>With interim findings expected in the next few weeks, O\u2019Connor is hopeful that researchers can gain an impression of the impact of lockdown, along with indications about the groups of people who need immediate support.</p> \n<p>Central to this, said O\u2019Connor, was understanding what the factors are that predict feelings of loneliness and entrapment in some people but not others.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between people who are socially isolated and do feel lonely, and those who don\u2019t? If you look at the research on loneliness, it is such a strong predictor of death by physical causes as well as death by suicide.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnother factor to understand is that of entrapment. People feel trapped by mental pain, but in this current context they are feeling physical entrapment. What is the interface between lockdown measures and psychological entrapment? Again, we know entrapment is such an important predictor of depression and suicidal thoughts and behaviour.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As regards entrapment, for example, participants will be asked to rate on a sliding scale the extent to which the statements relate to them, such as \u201cI feel powerless to change things\u201d and \u201cI feel trapped inside myself\u201d.</p> \n<p>The respondents will be surveyed six times over six months, completing a range of questions covering their background, living arrangements, lifestyle factors such as drinking and exercise, mental health and wellbeing, their experience of Covid-19, financial issues, as well as any pre-existing health problems. They will also be asked about feelings of entrapment, loneliness and other psychological variables.</p> \n<p>O\u2019Connor was one of a group of experts who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/urgent-studies-needed-mental-health-coronavirus-lockdown\">wrote in the journal Lancet Psychiatry </a>last week highlighting the need for a thorough and coordinated programme of research into the potentially profound and long-lasting impact of both the virus itself and the experience of lockdown and other measures on the population\u2019s mental health.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>While the team will have a much clearer picture after six months, O\u2019Connor is certain that the economic consequences, already felt by so many, will have a significant effect. \u201cOur feeling is, if there is an impact, it will be much longer term: there will be a short-term impact, but it will really be when the economic consequences kick in.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe know this will have a disproportionate effect on people who are already vulnerable \u2013 that could be having pre-existing mental health problems, but it could also mean those who are feeling trapped, or those experiencing financial hardship. Now we are trying to get a sense of who we need to identify and then how they can best be protected.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>\u2022 In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a>.

  "<h2>Aglio, olio e peperoncino</h2> <p><strong>Giorgio Locatelli<br></strong><em>Three ingredients: spaghetti, chilli, parmigiano reggiano</em></p> <p>This is one of my favourite dishes. It\u2019s one of the first things you can teach your children to cook \u2013 if they are adventurous with strong flavours \u2013 and it will stand them in good stead for the rest of their lives, when money is short or cooking for a gang at university or after a late night.</p> <p>My wife, Plaxy, cooks this for us when we arrive in Puglia on the silly o\u2019clock flight, having been up since 3am. A cold crisp white wine, a bowl of green salad and a plate of aglio olio e peperoncino before a siesta, and all is well with the world.</p> <p>The spaghetti should be made with Italian grains because the roughness of the surface will catch the oil better. Parmigiano reggiano or grana padano are the two cheeses that work best in this dish (I would recommend a cheese aged for 16-24 months). Always buy cheese in pieces, never buy pre-grated. You can use a variety of chilli, even dried. Some people like the chilli hotter, Plaxy only eats it with habanero \u2013 it is really down to your own taste.</p> <p><em>Serves 4</em><strong><br>spaghetti</strong> 500g<br><strong>chilli</strong> 1<br><strong>garlic</strong> 4 cloves<br><strong>extra virgin olive oil</strong> 200ml<br><strong>parmigiano reggiano or grana padano</strong> for serving, grated</p> <p>Start cooking the spaghetti in plenty of boiling salted water, and slice your chilli (around a tablespoonful, or more if you prefer) and the cloves of garlic about a millimetre thick.</p> <p>Place a little of the olive oil, cold, in the pan. Put in your garlic, then keep taking the pan off the heat and adding a little more cold oil, then returning it to the heat so that you don\u2019t burn the garlic.</p> <p>Once all the oil is in, you can let the garlic begin to take on a little bit of colour and put in your chopped chilli. Let it cook very briefly, stirring it into the garlic, then pull the pan from the heat and stir in a couple of spoonfuls of the cooking water from the pasta \u2013 take care, as it may spit.</p> <p>When the pasta is cooked but still al dente, lift it out and drain it, but keep back the cooking water.</p> <p>Toss the pasta really well through the oil, garlic and chilli, adding a little more cooking water from the pasta if it is too dry, as you want the garlicky hot oil to really cling to the spaghetti, and serve straightaway. Finish with some grated parmesan or grana padano.<br><em>Adapted from Made at Home by Giorgio Locatelli</em></p> <h2>Channa dal with wild garlic puree</h2> <p><strong>Ravinder Bhogal<br></strong><em>Three ingredients: wild garlic, lemon, channa dhal</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd078ce8828ddf117a848103e3014dfb46bb68a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd078ce8828ddf117a848103e3014dfb46bb68a0/0_136_1253_751/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ravinder Bhogal\u2019s channa dal with wild garlic puree.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ravinder Bhogal\u2019s channa dal with wild garlic puree.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Madhur Jaffrey calls dal \u201cLSD\u201d \u2013 life-saving dal \u2013 and I quite agree. It is cheap, nutritious, substantial and versatile and can be cooked with myriad ingredients, so it never gets boring. Channa dal is creamy, earthy and, cooked on its own, rather bland, so it lends itself particularly well to the grassy wild garlic we have growing in abundance every spring. If you can\u2019t get hold of wild garlic, use any herbs you have to hand \u2013 coriander, parsley, chervil or dill all add a vernal freshness too. I love the subtle flavour of it at the beginning of the season \u2013 like garlic without the fangs. Once the lentils have cooked, roughly mash, beat in a little cold butter and a zip of lemon, and finish with the wild garlic puree. You\u2019ll have a pool of something in a bowl that is nothing short of glorious.</p> <p><em>Serves 4<br>For the wild garlic puree</em><br><strong>wild garlic</strong> 100g, or mixed fresh herbs such as coriander, parsley, chervil or dill<br><strong>rapeseed oil</strong> 6 tbsp <br><strong>sea salt and pepper<br></strong><strong>lemon </strong>juice of \u00bd (reserve the other half for the dal)</p> <p><em>For the dal</em><br><strong>unsalted butter </strong>40g <br><strong>rapeseed oil </strong>1 tbsp<br><strong>whole cumin seeds</strong> 2 heaped tsp<br><strong>chilli flakes</strong> \u00bd tsp<br><strong>garlic</strong> 3 fat cloves, finely sliced<br><strong>lemon </strong>zest of 1<br><strong>channa dal or split yellow peas</strong> 250g, washed well<br><strong>ground turmeric</strong> 1 tsp <br><strong>sea salt and pepper</strong> to taste</p> <p>Begin by making the puree. Roughly chop the wild garlic or fresh herbs. If your wild garlic is flowering and you are feeling fancy, reserve some so you can add a pretty garnish later. Put into a blender along with the rapeseed oil and blitz until you have a smooth puree. Stir in the lemon juice and seasoning. Empty into a bowl and set aside.</p> <p>Heat 15g of the butter in a large saucepan and add a little oil to stop it burning. Sizzle the cumin and chilli flakes along with the sliced garlic and lemon zest until fragrant. Sprinkle in the turmeric and 1.2 litres of water, along with the channa dal and bring to a boil. At this point you could also add half a tin of tomatoes or some fresh skinned and pureed tomatoes if you like.</p> <p>Turn the heat to low and then simmer partially covered for around 45 minutes until the lentils are soft and creamy. For speedier cooking, invest in a pressure cooker. I don\u2019t know an Indian housewife who doesn\u2019t own one. If you want it thin and soupy feel free to add more water, but I like mine a little more robust.</p> <p>Season with salt and pepper and roughly mash. Beat in the remaining butter and squeeze in the juice from the leftover lemon. To serve, dish out into bowls and top with a dollop of wild garlic puree and any reserved flowers. Eat on its own like a soup or serve with rice or hot puffs of chapati. I really enjoy it with a little cheese toastie to dip in it.<br><em>Ravinder Bhogal is chef-founder of Jikoni</em></p> <h2><strong>Crispy chicken thighs, spinach and goat\u2019s cheese</strong></h2> <p><strong>Anna Haugh<br></strong><em>Three ingredients: chicken thighs, baby spinach, goat\u2019s cheese</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8d3fcc84f729ddf8dddb18524406c852cc262d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8d3fcc84f729ddf8dddb18524406c852cc262d9/491_1515_5306_5306/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Haugh\u2019s crispy chicken thighs, spinach and goat\u2019s cheese.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Haugh\u2019s crispy chicken thighs, spinach and goat\u2019s cheese.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here is a recipe that is so simple and tasty that you might do the chicken dance with delight. I\u2019m a leg girl \u2013 chicken legs and thighs have the best flavour in my opinion, as they are juicy and delicious. The brown meat, as it is referred to, has more flavour than the chicken breast but mysteriously is less popular.</p> <p>This is healthy fast food \u2013 or it\u2019s what fast food should be. Goat\u2019s cheese is easier to digest than cow\u2019s cheese and I love the slightly sour zing you get from a good one: it complements the spinach puree excellently and gives much more depth of flavour to the dish, not to mention the calcium and bundles of other good vitamins. The spinach is packed with vitamin K \u2013 trust me, your bones will thank you for this.</p> <p><em>Serves 2<br></em><strong>cooking oil </strong>1 tsp<br><strong>chicken thighs</strong> 4<br><strong>salt and pepper</strong> to season<br><strong>butter </strong>20g<strong><br>salt</strong> a good pinch<br><strong>baby spinach</strong> 200g<br><br><strong>sugar</strong> a pinch<br><strong>goat\u2019s cheese </strong>80g</p> <p>Place a frying pan on a medium heat and pour in your cooking oil. Season your chicken thighs with salt and pepper, place in the pan and cook until the skin becomes crispy. This will take around 10 minutes.</p> <p>While your chicken cooks, in a medium pot, put the butter, a good pinch of salt and most of your spinach (keep a handful to garnish). When the spinach wilts down (this is super quick) pop into a blender and blitz. You might need to add a drop of water to make the puree liquid enough.</p> <p>Your chicken should almost be done.

I\u2019ve always been a fan of surf and turf. Not a huge steak with a few limp prawns skewered and plonked on top but the complex union of flavours between sea and earth. On the surface of things, creatures from the deep aren\u2019t the obvious partner to marry with meat and poultry but think about the multitude of combinations of pork and shrimp, beef and anchovy, cockles and bacon, lamb stew punctuated with seaweed, to name but a few. Salt marsh lamb is prized for its flavour \u2013 achieved by its diet of samphire, sea beat and sorrel after grazing close to beaches and estuaries. I prefer Barnsley chops or lamb loin chops as they are generally cut a little thicker than best end chops but both are quick and easy to cook. The garnish goes equally well with braised shoulder or shanks or a roasted leg. This dish can also be easily replicated on the barbecue if you\u2019re so inclined. Bottarga is available online but you can toss some chopped anchovies through the broccoli instead and the dish will be just as delicious.</p> <p><em>Serves 4<br></em><strong>Barnsley chops</strong> (sometimes known as lamb loin chops) 4, preferably with a decent layer of fat<br><strong>salt and pepper</strong> to season<br><strong>purple sprouting broccoli</strong> a good handful per person<br><strong>bottarga</strong> a good thumb-sized piece or<br><strong>salted anchovies</strong> 1 small tin, room temperature<br><strong>unsalted butter</strong> 150g, plus a knob for cooking the chops (around 25g)<br><strong>chilli flakes </strong>1-2 tsp <br><strong>sumac</strong> 1 tsp<br><strong>oil</strong> for cooking</p> <p>Take the lamb chops out of the fridge about 40 minutes before you want to cook them. Season the lamb at this point too.</p> <p>First blanch the broccoli. To do this, bring a pot of water to the boil, season with a pinch of salt and throw in the broccoli. While it is cooking, fill a large bowl with iced water. Boil the broccoli till just tender. Drain it through a colander then shock in a waiting bowl of ice water. If you don\u2019t have any ice to hand, place the bowl of water under a running cold tap for a couple of minutes till the broccoli is cool. Return to the colander to drain for a further few minutes. Ensure it\u2019s as dry as possible, as water will cause the broccoli to spit when it comes into contact with the hot oil. When drained, refrigerate till needed.</p> <p>To bring the dish together, melt the 150g of butter and keep it in a resting tray. Remove the broccoli from the fridge, making sure it\u2019s as dry as can be. Get your frying pan hot before you cook the chops, especially if you want to achieve decent caramelisation which is where you can really accentuate the flavour of this lamb. When the pan is hot, rub the chops all over with a glug of oil. Carefully lay the chops in the pan - fat-side down - to render some of that lovely fat. If the pan doesn\u2019t make a satisfying sizzle when you put your chops in, it\u2019s not hot enough. When the fat has rendered and each side of the lamb chop has a pleasing golden hue, I like to add a good knob of butter as it helps with the caramelisation I mentioned, but this is optional.</p> <p>How long your chops take to cook depends on their thickness. Obviously if your chops are on the thin side, a minute or two on either side in a hot pan and a decent warm rest will do it. Thicker chops will take a little longer and you might want to reduce the heat slightly while frying, about 3-4 minutes on each side. Lamb chops are best served medium-rare. You can gauge this by pressing your finger against the eye of meat in the chop. If it is soft it\u2019s probably under. If it\u2019s super firm it\u2019s probably over so aim for somewhere in the middle. Remember you can always cook a chop a bit more to get it to where you want it but you can never uncook something. Rest for a further 5 minutes in the tray of melted butter, and add the chilli flakes.</p> <p>While the lamb is resting, wipe out the frying pan and get it hot again. Add a glug of oil and chuck in the broccoli. Allow the broccoli to char and blacken in parts. When the broccoli is done, turn off the heat. Place a chop on each plate and add the broccoli to the resting tray. Toss the broccoli with the chilli butter and add the sumac. The citrus properties of sumac will give the dish a nice hit of acidity.</p> <p>Place the broccoli beside the chop and grate a generous amount of bottarga, or put 3-4 whole anchovy fillets, if using, over the broccoli and a few turns of black pepper from the mill. Serve with a large glass of chilled red or white wine and sharp knives to negotiate the chop with.<br><em>Lee Tiernan is chef</em><em>-owner of Black Axe Mangal</em></p> <h2>Rhubarb, orange and ricotta</h2> <p><strong>Jeremy Lee<br></strong><em>Three ingredients: rhubarb, orange, ricotta</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11f36dd69984c59f2e586b0575d5fdedc1cd6c7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11f36dd69984c59f2e586b0575d5fdedc1cd6c7c/109_92_1102_845/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Lee\u2019s rhubarb, orange and ricotta.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"767\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Lee\u2019s rhubarb, orange and ricotta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This beautiful trinity is the very spirit of winning simplicity. The pairing of orange and rhubarb is one we adore, the colour and flavour equally beguiling. Made with blood oranges when the rhubarb stems are coloured a deep scarlet, the appearance and flavour become otherworldly, not to mention striking. When the rhubarb is spooned over ricotta beaten with olive oil, the rich savour of the cheese is sweetened by the delightful vanilla-infused orange and rhubarb syrup that forms in the pan when the rhubarb is cooked. Modest and moreish, this makes for an excellent breakfast as well as an elegant pudding for lunch and, of course, dinner.</p> <p><em>Serves 6<br>For the compote</em><br><strong>rhubarb</strong> 750g <br><strong>caster sugar</strong> 100g <br><strong>orange</strong> 1 small, zest finely grated then juiced<br><strong>vanilla pod</strong> 1, split and scraped</p> <p><em>For the ricotta</em><br><strong>ricotta</strong> 250g<br><strong>best olive oil</strong> 2 dsp</p> <p>Wash the rhubarb well and dry.

  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/imf\">International Monetary Fund</a> was eerily quiet this week. Normally, the IMF\u2019s two buildings in Washington DC would have been full of finance ministers and central bank governors gathered together to discuss the state of the global economy. This year, the meeting was a virtual yet still an important one: the most significant since the financial crisis.</p> <p>Piecing together the story of the spring meetings of the IMF is a bit like peeling the skin off an onion, with the health emergency caused by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19</a> pandemic the outer layer. Since it was created at the 1944 Bretton Woods conference, the IMF has seen many crises, but nothing like this one. Never before has it needed advice from epidemiologists to do the predictions for its flagship publication: the <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2020/04/14/weo-april-2020\">World Economic Outlook.</a></p> <p>One layer down from the health emergency was an economic emergency. Dealing with Covid-19 has involved extreme measures that have meant businesses have been shut and workers left idle. The WEO forecast that the global economy will shrink by 3% this year \u2013 an assessment not based on the latest data and so likely to prove optimistic.</p> <p>Country-specific data provides a better picture. Britain\u2019s Office for Budget Responsibility says that if the lockdown goes on for the whole of the second quarter, gross domestic product <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/uk-economy-could-shrink-by-35-with-2m-job-losses-warns-obr\">will shrink by 35%</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/china-economy-shrinks-record-wuhan-covid-19-death-toll-rises-50-percent\">China reported its fastest rate of economic decline</a> in more than half a century, while the unemployment numbers from the US were a horror show. In four weeks, the number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/16/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economic-toll-jobless\">jobless claims has reached 22m</a> \u2013 erasing all the employment gains in the 11 years since the global financial crisis.</p> <p>The biggest falls in activity will be seen this year in the countries with the highest number of virus infections: the rich, developed part of the world in the main. But the impact has also been severe on emerging market and low-income countries, which are intrinsically more vulnerable. In the past few weeks, the IMF has received calls for help from 102 countries, more than half its membership.</p> <p>So the third layer of the onion was the policy response: the IMF gave its approval to the decision by central banks to turn on the money taps and to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/15/spend-what-you-can-to-fight-covid-19-imf-tells-member-states\">$8tn (\u00a36.4tn) of stimulus </a>provided by finance ministries. Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF\u2019s managing director, said she had $1tn of financial firepower at her disposal and was prepared to use it. She also successfully rattled the tin for some emergency programmes, with the UK among those countries that responded. Creditor countries agreed to suspend debt payments from more than 70 of the world\u2019s poorest countries for six months.</p> <p>Even so, the multilateral response was less impressive than it might have been. Calls for the IMF to sell some of its gold reserves \u2013 which have soared in value in recent weeks \u2013 to pay for a more generous package went unheeded. Nor did Georgieva press the case she made last month for the go-ahead to issue a new tranche of special drawing rights (SDRs) \u2013 reserve assets that the IMF can create and distribute to its members.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/will-coronavirus-shock-the-global-economy-into-long-term-thinking-\">Will coronavirus shock the global economy into long-term thinking?| Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was not 2009, when the international community came together with a coordinated response to the financial crisis.

The reason Georgieva went quiet about SDRs was because the idea ran into opposition from the US, which can veto any proposal coming out of the IMF that it doesn\u2019t like. Removing another layer of skin exposes a much weaker form of internationalism. What last week\u2019s meeting needed was a progressive narrative around which countries could rally and a willingness of the US to fulfil the leadership role it has had since 1945.</p> <p>Neither was much in evidence, because America has a different agenda. Covid-19 has highlighted and accelerated a struggle for global hegemony between the US and China: the final layer of the onion.</p> <p>For the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union \u2013 and probably longer than that \u2013 the US faces a rival that Washington knows is a real threat. The Soviet Union never managed to provide its citizens with the living standards found in the west; China, courtesy of decades of rapid growth, has <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphjennings/2018/02/04/why-tens-of-millions-remain-poor-in-china-despite-fast-growing-wealth/\">virtually eradicated extreme poverty</a> and made consumer goods available to millions.</p> <p>A new cold war is raging. Trump\u2019s objection to the IMF\u2019s SDR plan was that some of the reserves would find their way into the hands of regimes he didn\u2019t like: those in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-imf-worldbank-sdrs/u-s-opposition-seen-stalling-major-imf-liquidity-boost-idUSKCN21X0L8\">Teh</a><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-imf-worldbank-sdrs/u-s-opposition-seen-stalling-major-imf-liquidity-boost-idUSKCN21X0L8\">ran and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 Beijing</a>. The WHO\u2019s mistake was to take at face value the lies told in the initial stages of Covid-19 by the Chinese government, when the spread of the pandemic outside China could have been prevented.</p> <p>The Chinese seem to be up for the fight. Beijing says, wrongly, that the virus was imported from the US, and will exploit to the full the propaganda value of its economy starting its recovery before that of its geopolitical rival. China is developing a new digital currency in the hope that the hegemony of the US dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency will be challenged and views itself being at the cutting edge of artificial intelligence as a means of cementing authoritarian control.</p> <p>The US is right to be worried. It is, though, too glib to say that the 21st century will be China\u2019s just as the 20th was America\u2019s. The US has been written off many times and always found a way to reinvent itself. The struggle will be long and hard.</p>",
  "<p>A prominent Chinese human rights lawyer barred from returning home after his prison release two weeks ago has been prohibited from reuniting with his family after a 14-day quarantine period.</p> <p>Wang Quanzhang\u2019s wife and rights groups fear authorities are using the coronavirus pandemic as a pretext to hold him indefinitely under de facto house arrest.</p> <p>Wang, a lawyer who lives in Beijing, had taken on politically sensitive cases and defended activists and members of the banned religious group Falun Gong. Released on 4 April after serving four and a half years for subversion, he was taken to his hometown of Jinan, 250 miles (400km) south of Beijing, for compulsory quarantine.</p> <p>But even though authorities told him he would be freed after 14 days, he has been barred from returning to Beijing, his wife, Li Wenzu, said on Sunday. \u201cToday is the 15th day and he still can\u2019t return to Beijing,\u201d she said. \u201cI really cannot accept this.\u201d</p> <p>Li said that during the past two weeks, Wang was only able to hold phone conversations with her under the supervision of police, who controlled the content and length of his communications. In their conversations over the past two weeks, she said Wang had said her online postings \u201cwere causing him trouble\u201d and ordered her to delete them.</p> <p>She said Wang called her on Saturday, saying he was unable to go home because he had \u201cjust come out and needed to get used to (everything)\u201d. She questioned whether he was speaking of his own accord. \u201cThis is not the Wang Quanzhang I knew,\u201d she said. \u201cThe pain is like a knife stabbing into my bleeding heart.\u201d</p> <p>Wang was detained <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/31/families-of-chinas-disappeared-say-country-is-a-place-of-fear-and-panic\">in August 2015</a>. After being held incommunicado for three and a half years he was sentenced in January 2019 on the blanket charge of \u201csubversion of state power\u201d. He was one of more than 300 lawyers and activists detained in crackdowns that started in July 2015. He was the last lawyer of the group to be convicted.</p> <p>Francine Chan, the executive director of Hong Kong-based China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group, said: \u201cThe harassment, surveillance and effective house arrest of Wang Quanzhang after his \u2018release\u2019 vividly illustrate China\u2019s use of the pandemic to extend Wang\u2019s imprisonment in violation of Chinese and international law.\u201d</p> <p>Chinese rights activists are often released from prison into de facto house arrest or enforced restriction to their native village, where they remain for years. This is a practice dubbed \u201cnon-release release\u201d by rights groups.</p> <p>Another lawyer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/21/chinese-human-rights-lawyer-jiang-tianyong-jailed\">Jiang Tianyong</a>, who was released on 28 February 2019, is still under house arrest in his hometown in rural Henan and has been denied proper medical care.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch\u2019s China researcher, Yaqiu Wang, called Wang Quanzhang\u2019s continued detention \u201ca complete travesty of justice\u201d and said the Chinese government seemed determined to silence Wang indefinitely.</p> <p>William Nee, a China researcher at Amnesty International, said Wang\u2019s case showed the suppression of the lawyer community \u201ccombined with the Communist party\u2019s systematic use of incommunicado detention, torture and ill-treatment, harassment of family members, show trials and post-release surveillance has given the international community a clear warning of what to expect under China\u2019s understanding of \u2018rule by law\u2019\u201d.<br></p>",
  "<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been asked \u2013 and we\u2019ve asked ourselves \u2013 why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance-thursday\">Covid-19</a> seems to be impacting Princess so heavily.\u201d Thus spoke Jan Swartz, president of Princess Cruises, in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC1jVkY9hqE\">video posted</a> on social media in mid-March. She looks sad-eyed and baffled into the camera: \u201cWe don\u2019t really know.\u201d Perhaps, she muses, the problem is something to do with the \u201cdiverse mix of people onboard our ships\u201d and is \u201cbeing magnified by our core values to respect, protect and connect the world\u201d. She implores her \u201cguests\u201d with a \u201csimple request\u201d: \u201cWe ask you to book a future Princess cruise to your dream destination \u2026 as a symbol to the world that the things that connect us are stronger than those that divide us.\u201d </p> <p>Her company does seem to have been terribly unlucky. Their <a href=\"https://www.ship-technology.com/news/covid-19-diamond-princess-cruise-ship-eighth-death/\">Diamond Princess</a>, quarantined off Yokohama, which suffered over 700 infections and eight deaths among its passengers and crew, was a conspicuous early victim of the pandemic, its global fame growing on wry-turning-to-desperate postings from its passengers. The Ruby Princess, from which 2,700 passengers disembarked in Sydney on March 19, became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/criminal-investigation-launched-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-disaster\">single largest source of Covid-19 cases in Australia</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/from-paradise-to-coronavirus-the-grand-princess-and-the-cruise-from-hell\">Grand Princess</a> was stuck outside San Francisco, its passengers confined to their cabins, after an outbreak in early March. Something similar happened to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/coral-princess-cruise-ship-docks-florida-coronavirus-pandemic\">Coral Princess</a> in early April, off the coast of Florida. And this to say nothing of the <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/tourism-cruises/article240761311.html\">Caribbean Princess</a>, which has twice this year had to end cruises early, due to hundreds falling ill from a quite different infection, the vomiting bug norovirus.</p> <p>But not everyone is yet convinced that all of Princess\u2019s misadventures are purely bad luck. New South Wales police have launched a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess, to see whether its owners were \u201ctransparent in contextualising the true patient and crew health conditions relevant to Covid-19\u201d. They are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/criminal-investigation-launched-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-disaster\">suspected of lying</a>, in other words, about conditions on the ship. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-cruiseship-law/passengers-sue-over-coronavirus-hit-grand-princess-cruise-ship-idUSKBN20W30T\">Legal actions</a> have sprung up from unhappy \u201cguests\u201d of the Grand Princess, their trips-of-a-lifetime wrecked by allegedly inadequate screening procedures. Professor Kentaro Iwata, a Japanese expert on infectious diseases who went on to the Diamond Princess, described the onboard response to the virus as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/02/scientist-decries-completely-chaotic-conditions-cruise-ship-japan-quarantined-after#\">completely chaotic</a>\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a53e45a0502b247b90ec7290a5fd7ec3f7cf45e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a53e45a0502b247b90ec7290a5fd7ec3f7cf45e8/220_0_3280_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Princess Cruises president, Jan Swartz, greets passengers from the Diamond Princess as they disembark after their quarantine on 20 February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Princess Cruises president, Jan Swartz, greets passengers from the Diamond Princess as they disembark after their quarantine on 20 February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Princess Cruises/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Princess is not alone in its troubles. It is one of several lines owned by Carnival Corporation, a giant and aggressive company, which as long ago as 1996 was reported by David Foster Wallace, in an <a href=\"https://harpers.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/HarpersMagazine-1996-01-0007859.pdf\">epic article</a> on the cruise experience, to be nicknamed \u201cCarnivore\u201d. Carnival\u2019s roughly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_cruise_lines\">40% share of the market</a> also includes the Holland America line, which owns the Zaandam, which had to travel up the west coast of South America with sick and dying passengers on board, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/07/zaandam-onboard-the-coronavirus-hit-cruise-ship\">Chile closed its ports</a>. Other ships, both owned by Carnival and not, have had outbreaks of disease or been denied permission to enter ports. All new cruises have now been suspended, with some provisionally scheduled to <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/articles/cruise-lines-suspending-operations-over-coronavirus/\">restart in May</a>.</p> <p>A rather obvious question is whether Covid-19 is simply an act of God, or whether its impact on their passengers, crew and host ports has been magnified by the practices of cruise companies. They vigorously push back against this suggestion: a spokesman for Carnival tells me that \u201cthe cruise industry took action before most other industries on land took actions\u201d, that \u201ccruise ships are social gathering places, but no less risky than any other social gathering venue\u201d, and asks \u201cwhen was the last time you were asked to fill out a health record before being allowed to enter a concert?\u201d In the case of the Diamond Princess, say Princess Cruises, they were following instructions from the Japanese health authorities.</p> <p>Trust on this question, on the other hand, is not improved by reports that some cruise-line salespeople (not Carnival), in mid-March, were being instructed to talk punters out of their concerns about Covid-19, for example claiming that the coronavirus could not survive in tropical climates and that therefore it was a good time to visit the Caribbean. Trust is further weakened by the cruise industry\u2019s long history of environmental and safety lapses, and their special skill at minimising the consequences to themselves.</p> <p>A bigger question is whether the virus will dent, deflect or alter what has been a phenomenon of our times, the many-times multiplication of ship sizes, of passenger numbers and of profits, generated by an industry that manufactures its own version of reality, then shapes the places that its ships visit in the image of that reality. Cruises, as Wallace put it, serve that \u201cpart of me that craves pampering and passive pleasure: the dissatisfied-infant part of me, the part that always and indiscriminately <em>wants</em>\u201d. Cruises are founded on fantasy, which means the removal from view of anything irksome or demanding of difficult choices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b9a1dd891f550306dbe490afdfde8ca614f95a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b9a1dd891f550306dbe490afdfde8ca614f95a5/0_46_1407_844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Medics transport a body from the MS Zaandam, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 2 April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medics transport a body from the MS Zaandam, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 2 April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SMG/Zuma Press/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cruise companies have been growing at least since the 1980s, with a 7.2% compounded <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemicallef/2020/01/20/state-of-the-cruise-industry-smooth-sailing-into-the-2020s/#46c597465fa2\">rate of revenue growth</a> from 2010 to 2019. Their ships, which were generally under 50,000 tons until the mid-90s, have become beasts of 220,000 tons and more. Alongside the growth in quantity has gone an ever-advancing science of customer experience, of investment in ice rinks, climbing walls, spas and casinos, in decking out ships like Vegas resorts, a process that reached some kind of apogee with the 5.260-passenger <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/news/venice-themed-cruise-ship-with-its-own-st-marks-square-built-for-chinese/\">Costa Venezia</a>. Aimed at the Asian market, this Venice-themed ship comes<strong> </strong>complete with gondola rides and a version of the Piazza San Marco. For cruising is above all an entertainment and hospitality industry, albeit grafted on to the serious engineering needed to keep large ships afloat.</p> <p>All of which might be good, clean fun, if the growth of cruises weren\u2019t accompanied by reports of pollution spills, outbreaks of disease, accidents, mistreatment of workers and sexual assaults and other crimes. If these reports don\u2019t change much over the decades it is because the cruise lines don\u2019t change much, either. They can spend lavishly on lobbying and campaign contributions to friendly politicians, and hire lawyers to see off the lawsuits when things go wrong. Their business being offshore, cruise lines are free to choose the countries where they register their ships and incorporate their business, which means places like Panama, the Bahamas or Bermuda, where they can <a href=\"https://thehustle.co/the-economics-of-cruise-ships/\">pay low taxes and get an easy ride</a> on labour rights, and on health, safety and environmental regulations.</p> <p>\u201cThey only change when they have to,\u201d says Ross Klein, a sociology professor at Memorial University in Newfoundland, whose website <a href=\"http://cruisejunkie.com/\">cruisejunkie.com</a> chronicles the mishaps of the cruise business. And nobody much makes them change. There is<strong> </strong>a trade body, the <a href=\"https://cruising.org/\">Cruise Lines International Association</a> (CLIA), which promotes the business and in theory upholds standards. \u201cThey will tell you that they have mandatory regulations and that they meet or exceed international regulations,\u201d says Klein. \u201cWell, we asked CLIA\u2019s senior vice-president what happens when a company violates these regulations: nothing. Perhaps a stern talking-to, but otherwise nothing.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's not just the filth and damage that ships emit, but the superficial interaction that cruise ships generate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cruise companies\u2019 aversion to responsibility can be seen in a legendary court filing following the \u201c<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/17/travel/carnival-cruise-triumph-problems/index.html\">poop cruise</a>\u201d of 2013, in which failing generators on the Carnival Triumph caused a backup of raw sewage into the passenger areas. Carnivals\u2019 lawyers, CNN reported, said that the \u201cticket contract makes absolutely no guarantee for safe passage, a seaworthy vessel, adequate and wholesome food, and sanitary and safe living conditions.\u201d Equally striking was the legal outcome to the 2012 wreck of the Costa Concordia, when the party atmosphere of cruises mixed fatally with questions of navigation: the owner Costa Crociere (another part of the Carnival empire), with the help of a plea bargain and \u20ac1m fine, and despite <a href=\"https://lloydslist.maritimeintelligence.informa.com/LL1120956/Marine-professionals-call-for-jailed-Costa-Concordia-masters-case-to-be-reviewed\">clear failings</a> on its part, was freed of any management and operational responsibility.</p> <p>Or you could take another incident that befell the ever unfortunate Princess Cruise lines, when the Caribbean Princess was found to have been dumping oily waste in the sea off southern England. In 2017 a Florida court found that the Caribbean and four more Princesses had been engaging in <a href=\"https://www.cruiselawnews.com/2016/12/articles/pollution/deliberate-dumping-coverup-and-lies-doj-fines-princess-cruises-40000000/\">illegal practices</a>, issued a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/cruise-line-ordered-pay-40-million-illegal-dumping-oil-contaminated-waste-and-falsifying\">record fine of $40m</a> and put the company on probation for five years. President Jan Swartz performed a hand-wring to camera, as she has over Covid-19, to say that \u201cwe are very sorry for the actions of our employees\u201d and that \u201cthe marine environment is incredibly important to us\u201d.</p> <p>Princess ships then continued to pollute, for example by depositing faecal coliform in Alaskan waters. In 2019 they were <a href=\"http://www.cruisejunkie.com/envirofines.html\">fined a further $20m</a>. If a combined penalty of $60m sounds like a lot, it is as Klein points out a small portion of the $3bn or so <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/carnival-corporation--plc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-record-full-year-earnings-300769295.html\">annual profits</a> of Princess\u2019s owner, Carnival. \u201cTo them, that\u2019s just a cost of doing business,\u201d he says.</p> <p>And you have <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-55238-z\">Venice</a>, the actual city rather than the theme versions, where for years what are effectively multistorey hotels have been looming over its historic architecture, their mighty parps competing with church bells, their diesel<strong> </strong>smoke polluting the air, damaging the ecology of the lagoon and, say protesters, the foundations of buildings with the water they displace, and discharging thousands-strong fluxes of tourists on highly managed six-hour trinket-and-selfie binges in the city. Then, last summer, the 65,000-ton MSC Opera, its engine failing, crunched into a moored tourist boat like a boot on to a bug. There were miraculously no deaths, but the crash made the cruise industry\u2019s previous assurances of safety sound hollow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfedb9ea2f3b77a87f3c724bd0547e33d3b2229d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfedb9ea2f3b77a87f3c724bd0547e33d3b2229d/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cruise ship passing by the San Marco Square in the Giudecca canal, Venice, 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cruise ship passing by the San Marco Square in the Giudecca canal, Venice, 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-49276730\">excited reports</a> last year that large ships would be banned from the city, nothing definite has been decided. At most, larger ships will be displaced to other ports in the Venetian lagoon, which would involve new environmental impacts. Among <a href=\"https://skift.com/2019/08/19/venices-big-money-conundrum-to-solving-its-cruise-ship-crisis/\">the complications</a> in finding a solution is the fact that Carnival, Royal Caribbean and other big cruise companies are shareholders of the company that owns Venice\u2019s maritime port.</p> <p>The issue is not just about the filth and damage that ships emit into Venetian air and water, but of the superficial interaction that cruise ships generate between passengers and their host city. Eleonora Sovrani, of the local campaign group <a href=\"https://weareherevenice.org/\">We Are Here Venice</a>, argues that the cruises\u2019 \u201cguests\u201d \u2013 on their brief visits, following itineraries proposed by the ships, visiting outlets suggested by them \u2013 never leave the cruise \u201cbubble\u201d. The city is forced \u201cto change its aspect to answer expectations of the cruise companies,\u201d she says, in what is a form of \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d.</p> <p>What goes for Venice now goes for many other places in the world. In pre-virus Sydney, successive ships would be moored near the considerably smaller Opera House, almost permanently blocking certain views, while others would be waiting their turn out in the bay. Cruises have shown increasing enthusiasm for invading the Arctic and Antarctic, their paths eased by the melting of globally warmed ice, with many thousands of gawpers descending on tiny Inuit settlements. In New Zealand, Princess Cruises \u2013 hello, my old friend \u2013 were obliged to apologise for their crassness, after some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/02/cruise-company-apologises-after-staff-pose-as-maori-for-traditional-welcome\">non-Maori men</a> with DIY skirts and scribbles on their face were hired to perform an am-dram version of a traditional Maori welcome to passengers on the Golden Princess.</p> <p>To all these points<strong> </strong>the cruise industry naturally has its responses. <a href=\"https://cruising.org/about-the-industry/policy-priorities/public-health-and-medical/nororvirus-on-cruise-ships\">They make claims</a> about health, safety and the environment, which for the reasons given by Ross Klein should be treated sceptically. They say, for example, that <a href=\"https://cruising.org/about-the-industry/policy-priorities/public-health-and-medical/nororvirus-on-cruise-ships\">norovirus is rare</a> on cruise ships, using data from the US <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. The CDC, however, is only able to obtain information on ships that visit US ports, so can\u2019t give global statistics, which limits the usefulness of any conclusions that might be drawn.</p> <p>Cruise companies argue that they create employment, which they do, for everyone from officers to crew to waiters to beauticians and standup comedians. They say that they bring revenue to their host cities, which they also do, though Klein and others <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261517717302418\">dispute the level of benefits</a> claimed by the companies</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cadfe9b58d82b8aef0dc2f894c71122cf32b0a28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cadfe9b58d82b8aef0dc2f894c71122cf32b0a28/0_65_5760_3458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The bar and dancefloor of the Costa Fortuna, owned by the Carnival corporation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The bar and dancefloor of the Costa Fortuna, owned by the Carnival corporation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frans Lemmens/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since cruise passengers sleep on their ships and also tend to eat and drink on them, their benefit to local hotels, restaurants and bars is limited. Those shore-based traders to whom the ships direct their passengers generally have to pay a handsome cut for the privilege. Cruise lines also acquire interests in terminals and retail outlets, such that even more income is whisked away from their host ports. Just supposing that the tourist dollar were not so relentlessly hoovered up by cruises, might it not be generating other, maybe more rewarding jobs in businesses that don\u2019t have the same breaks on taxes and regulations?</p> <p>The cruise companies\u2019 strongest argument is that their customers love their product. Which, mostly, they do. Even some who endured the Covid-cursed cruises say they will go back to the ships when they can. And to sail the seas and see the world is, indeed, a great thing. But perhaps cruise passengers would have an even better time if there weren\u2019t a nagging feeling that the management might not be totally on top of novel or familiar viruses on their ship, or that the excretions and eructations of their big white ships are trashing the beauties they are paying to see.</p> <p>And claims of passenger satisfaction and revenue-generation should not invalidate the wishes of host cities for basic respect or the argument that the quality of interaction between tourists and locals is as important as the quantity. As Sovrani puts it, cruises should adapt to cities, not the other way round. Again, cruise passengers might have a better time if they were not thrust into the cogs of an engine of exploitation.</p> <p>Much, of course, depends on what happens in the world to come after the virus, which not so long ago was barely a blip on the radar. <em>Forbes</em> magazine, on January 20, could see only \u201c<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemicallef/2020/01/20/state-of-the-cruise-industry-smooth-sailing-into-the-2020s/#36bb9cc065fa\">smooth sailing</a> into the 2020s\u201d. In February CNN quoted various experts saying it was <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/cruise-safety-coronavirus/index.html\">still OK to cruise</a>. The <a href=\"https://cruisedialogue2020.org/\">Cruise Dialogue conference</a> met in Cartagena, Colombia, also in February, asking its industry delegates and speakers \u201chow best to accommodate the seemingly unstoppable growth of cruise activities?\u201d Almost no one mentioned the virus.</p> <p>The Zaandam set off on its disastrous voyage on 7 March (when, as Klein points out, a number of ships had already been turned away from ports). On the previous day there was the first talk of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/06/white-house-could-seek-timely-targeted-aid-us-industries-hurt-by-coronavirus-outbreak-top-adviser-says/\">federal help</a> for the cruise industry, an idea that seemed open to doubt, given the cruise companies\u2019 exotic registrations: if they don\u2019t pay US taxes, how could they receive US subsidies? Even <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/489788-cruise-lines-excluded-from-coronavirus-stimulus-bill\">President Trump</a>, who notwithstanding those pesky Panamanian and Bahamian flags called cruises \u201ca great US business\u201d, acknowledged the problem, before saying that \u201cwe\u2019re going to try and work something out\u201d. Which, not least because Carnival\u2019s chairman Micky Arison is a friend and backer of Trump, the company having been a sponsor of <em>The Apprentice</em>, you can be sure he will try very hard to do.</p> <p>\u201cThe infantile part of me,\u201d wrote David Foster Wallace, \u201cis by its very nature insatiable.\u201d However much gratification and pampering it will receive, it \u201cwill simply adjust its desires upward until it once again levels out at its homeostasis of terrible dissatisfaction.\u201d He could as well have been describing the cruise business as its customer experience. Now, though, it is time for cruises to grow up: if the industry has been based on the outsourcing of reality, reality has come back to bite it. A CLIA spokeswoman tells me that they \u201caim to do our part to protect the sanctity of the destinations we visit so that they can remain a vibrant place to live and visit for generations to come\u201d. Let\u2019s hope so: if it wants public money and public trust, the cruise business should accept the public responsibilities it has been so good at shirking.</p>",
  "<p>Have we never seen Michael Jordan like this before, or is it simply that we forgot? Anyone who lived through the Chicago Bulls\u2019 domination of the NBA during the 1990s \u2013 even, like me, as a kid \u2013 can probably still recall the broad outlines of Jordan\u2019s talent, the qualities that made him such an exceptional athlete: the elasticity; the hang time; the spectacular dunks, ludicrous switch-hands layups, and clutch buzzer-beaters; the raw power. Jordan reigned at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man\">\u201cthe end of history\u201d</a>, in that curious decade between the fall of the Berlin Wall and 9/11, and for all his ability with a ball in his hand he\u2019s always seemed a little remote, a little above it all. He was the perfect athlete, in a sense, for the decade that fancied itself post-political. In an era that thought it had figured it all out, Jordan was the player who actually had.</p> <p>And yet. As The Last Dance, the 10-part documentary whose first episodes <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29044827/an-all-access-michael-jordan-documentary-how-last-dance-was-made-possible\">premiere on ESPN in the US on Sunday</a> (with the worldwide releases for each on Netflix the following day), shows, he was so much more. Yes, Jordan was gloriously, unironically macho. Yes, his body worked like a Swiss army knife, limbs cutting through the air in all directions at one moment then snapping back into a streamlined cylinder the next. Yes, he was capable of outrageous things on the court. But he was also a bully, a wrecking ball, the owner of a volcanic will to win, a man of almost unbearable intensity. However much joy Jordan gave to millions throughout his career, and will surely give to millions more with the release of this banquet of a documentary, it\u2019s hard to escape the feeling that being him \u2013 occupying that body, harnessing that talent, channelling that unrelenting drive to be the best \u2013 must have been incredibly hard. The Last Dance is nominally about Jordan\u2019s last season with the Bulls, but flashbacks give us the full, luxurious history of His Airness, and what we\u2019re really offered by the end of it all is a study in sympathy. The man who emerges from these 10 hours of pure 90s nostalgia is heroic, preposterous, demanding, difficult, and sometimes outright tyrannical - and somehow only even more appealing for all his flaws. He cared about one thing, and one thing only: winning. Once you understand the singularity of Jordan\u2019s focus, everything else about him makes sense.</p> <p>The Last Dance takes its title from the name of the dossier that Bulls coach Phil Jackson, in a typically canny bit of marketing, handed to every player ahead of the 1997-98 season. Jordan had progressed from a promising but coltish No 3 pick in the 1984 draft to the NBA\u2019s first authentic international superstar; his rise paralleled, or rather propelled, the global rise of the league. But by 1997, five titles to the good, it had become clear that Jordan\u2019s Bulls had only one season left in them. Longtime general manager Jerry Krause had signaled that Chicago\u2019s team of champions would be broken up at the conclusion of the season. Jackson, the man who convinced Jordan, in the late 1980s, to set his ego aside and trust in the transformational beauty of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_offense\">the triangle offense</a>, was also to be shown the door. We all know how the story ends \u2013 Jordan led the Bulls to a second three-peat, before riding off into the sunset \u2013 but what happens along the way is all the pleasure of this spectacle. A TV crew followed the Bulls around for the duration of the season, and the footage they recorded \u2013 footage that has never been aired until now \u2013 forms the backbone of The Last Dance. We see Jordan coping with Scottie Pippen\u2019s back injury \u2013 the Bulls lieutenant ended up being out of action for the first 35 games of the season \u2013 and the ongoing discord between Pippen and management. We see him trying to keep the playing group together during the periodic disappearances and brain fades of an agreeably demented Dennis Rodman. We see him bickering with Steve Kerr, of all people.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9Z9JtNcCWY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N9Z9JtNcCWY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Most of all, though, we see Michael Jordan angry. If there\u2019s one theme that emerges most emphatically from The Last Dance it\u2019s the sheer force of Jordan\u2019s personality, the rage that drove him on. Repeatedly throughout his career, Jordan used slights against his greatness as motivation to obliterate all before him. He decided to destroy the Portland Trail Blazers in the 1992 finals because he didn\u2019t like comparisons suggesting he and Clyde Drexler were on the same level. He and Pippen resolved to gang up on Toni Kukoc in the first game the Dream Team played against Croatia at the 1992 Olympics because Krause, a regular punching bag, thought Kukoc was a good player who would improve the Bulls roster. He <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_offense\">punched Kerr in the face</a> in preseason ahead of the 1995-96 campaign, ahead of his first season back after 18 months away playing baseball, because \u201cwe were shit when I got back\u201d and a point needed to be made.</p> <p>To watch Jordan reflect on these incidents now, ensconced in the armchair of his spacious, beachy home, settled into a thick middle age, cocktail tumbler by his side, chuckling fondly as the filmmakers hand him a tablet and he watches the footage, say, of Gary Payton reflecting on his efforts to stop Jordan in the 1996 finals, it can all seem a little ridiculous that he ever took things so seriously.</p> <p>But if The Last Dance proves that Jordan was not exactly popular with his teammates, it also reminds us how magnetic his personality was, how charismatic and funny he could be, of the cult that quickly grew up around him. Repeatedly we see him goofing around in practice, bantering back and forth with the press, or on the Bulls\u2019 private jet, cigar in mouth (the sheer amount of tobacco smoked during The Last Dance would be enough to give most people lung cancer), gently teasing his entourage. The respect of his rivals is unmistakable. In the summer of 1995, as he prepared for his first full season back post-retirement, Jordan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/15/space-jam-20th-anniversary-michael-jordan\">was contracted to shoot Space Jam</a>. He asked Warner Brothers to build him a facility to practice in during the shoot, and the studio duly complied by creating the Jordan Dome, a custom-built indoor full-size basketball court and training gym. From 7am to 7pm, Jordan shot the film. Then, for three hours after shooting wrapped each night, he played pick-up games with a roster of the NBA\u2019s best, all of whom traveled to LA to be close to him: Patrick Ewing, Reggie Miller, Dennis Rodman. \u201cThose were the best games,\u201d Miller recalls with boyish wonder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9f5fe82ac2bd974a7be115723bebe05dd939396\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9f5fe82ac2bd974a7be115723bebe05dd939396/0_0_2589_1828/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Jordan celebrates his second NBA title in 1992\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Jordan celebrates his second NBA title in 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Swart/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The series deals sensitively with <a href=\"http://graphics.chicagotribune.com/james-jordan-murder/index.html\">the murder of Jordan\u2019s father</a> and the other, darker chapters of his career: his gambling habit and lack of engagement in popular politics. Jordan\u2019s apolitical character \u2013 \u201cRepublicans buy sneakers too,\u201d he <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2016/07/did-michael-jordan-really-say-republicans-buy-sneakers-too.html\">reportedly said</a> after refusing to endorse North Carolina Democrat Harvey Gantt in his 1990 Senate race against the notorious racist Jesse Helms \u2013 has often been cited against him in the interminable debate over whether he or LeBron James deserves the title of greatest basketballer ever. Where LeBron is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/16/lebron-james-china-hong-kong-comments-nba\">fully committed to his role as a public figure</a> and unafraid to take polarizing stances on political issues, Jordan mostly shied away from anything that would alienate segments of his enormous, bipartisan fanbase. The Last Dance does not avoid pressing Jordan on these issues, though his answers are mostly unsatisfying; he claims he could not endorse Gantt because he \u201cdidn\u2019t know the guy\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear that his priorities lay elsewhere: in making money, gambling (how strange that era\u2019s moral panic over Jordan\u2019s love of a bet appears today), and above all, winning. That focus on making money and doing all the talking on the court \u2013 which, on the evidence here, his teammates evidently shared \u2013 made Jordan the archetype of the modern athlete. Jordan was not so much an individual as an industry, and he set the template for the generations of athletic gods that followed: the endorsements, the clothing lines, the cultural tie-ins and carefully managed media spots. But the curation of his image was designed, very obviously to Jordan\u2019s mind, in pursuit of a single objective: being the best. Winning was the real aim, and everything else had to serve it. If Jordan did have any politics, any consciousness of racial or economic injustice, it was sublimated into the overwhelming fury that consumed him the moment he stepped on the court.</p> <p>The most moving scenes in The Last Dance show Jordan in the moments after clinching his first and fourth titles. In 1991 we see him in the dressing room next to his dad, face pressed to the Larry O\u2019Brien trophy, crying a torrent of tears, and for a second we\u2019re there with him, living the extraordinary catharsis of that first ring. In 1996, his first title back after the 18-month hiatus in baseball, he\u2019s back in the dressing room, clutching a ball, face down on the floor, his body convulsing as the tears flow untrammeled once again. These are the only moments in the documentary where we see 90s-era Jordan in any mode other than those of the training ground shit-talker, the on-court destroyer, the cigar-chomping GOAT; the only time he\u2019s not braggadocio on legs. It\u2019s fitting that the athlete perhaps best known in popular culture today for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crying_Jordan\">\u201ccrying Jordan\u201d</a> meme should be reintroduced to us in this way. Myths and misperceptions swirled around Jordan throughout his career: that he was selfish, wasn\u2019t a team player, only cared about getting rich. To see the footage of him after those 1991 and 1996 titles, that Ferrari of a body heaving with uncontrollable tears, possessed by the release of victory, is to understand who Michael Jordan really was: as pure a competitive animal as professional sport has ever seen.</p>",

One, in New South Wales, was <strong>a 94-year-old man</strong>. He was a resident at the <strong>Newmarch House aged care facility</strong> in western Sydney. It is the second death from the aged care facility after a significant outbreak. There are now 39 cases from the facility, including 13 staff. <strong>A man in his 80s from Victoria also died overnight</strong>.</li> \n   <li>The foreign minister, <strong>Marise Payne</strong>, has called for an independent global investigation into the spread of Covid-19. Payne says she does not think the <strong>World Health Organisation</strong> should run the investigation, saying she shares some of the concerns expressed by the US about the agency\u2019s handling of the pandemic. Payne was also reluctant to answer questions about whether she \u201ctrusts\u201d China in terms of its response to the virus during an interview with the ABC.<br></li> \n   <li>The federal health minister, <strong>Greg Hunt</strong>, said elective surgery and IVF could resume sooner than previously expected, thanks to an increase in PPE equipment available to Australia\u2019s healthcare system. <strong>H</strong><strong>unt also took a swipe at the WHO</strong>, saying its response to the crisis \u201cdidn\u2019t help the world\u201d.</li> \n   <li>The New South Wales health minister, <strong>Brad Hazzard</strong>, announced anyone who spat on a worker could receive a $5,000 fine. It\u2019s an expansion of a previous decision to allow the fines for people who spat on health workers or police.</li> \n   <li>Hazzard also said NSW had avoided some 700 deaths, based on projections during the peak of the outbreak.</li> \n   <li>Beaches in some parts of the Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs will reopen from Monday.

Payne says she does not think the World Health Organisation should run the investigation, saying she shares some of the concerns expressed by the US about the agencies handling of the pandemic. Payne was also reluctant to answer questions about whether she \u201ctrusts\u201d China in terms of its response to the virus during an interview with the ABC.</li> \n   <li>The federal health minister, <strong>Greg Hunt</strong>, said elective surgery and IVF could resume sooner than previously expected, thanks to an increase in PPE equipment available to Australia\u2019s healthcare system. <strong>H</strong><strong>unt also took a swipe at the WHO</strong>, saying its response to the crisis \u201cdidn\u2019t help the world\u201d.</li> \n   <li>The New South Wales health minister, <strong>Brad Hazzard</strong>, announced anyone who spat on a worker could receive a $5,000 fine. It\u2019s an expansion of a previous decision to allow the fines for people who spat on health workers or police.</li> \n   <li>Hazzard also said NSW had avoided some 700 deaths, based on projections during the peak of the outbreak.</li> \n   <li>Beaches in some parts of the Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs will re-open from Monday.

But this means that we are ready, we stand ready if this virus does start to afflict a large number of people. As you know, we\u2019re coming into our winter flu season.

For my part, I was glued to season two, and this third, gaffered by Suzanne Heathcote, is so far a pi\u00f1ata of surprises. The very least of which is Eve\u2019s survival after the Rome shooting; the main one, of course, Kenny\u2019s shock death.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec22cb865929e4a959fdafa9643c1ef8f8fa9730\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec22cb865929e4a959fdafa9643c1ef8f8fa9730/0_0_4242_2828/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sandra Oh in series 3 of Killing Eve.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sandra Oh in series 3 of Killing Eve.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Sid Gentle</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We mourn sweet clever Kenny but will be vouchsafed little time in which to do so. There is a new impetus to this, in that Fiona Shaw\u2019s MI6 renegade and, reluctantly, brave Eve, and a new batch of quirky bloggers are out, in their conflicting ways, to exact a kind of vengeance. Meanwhile, Villanelle is still wearing clothes that even I would think of slaughtering for. Still throwing tuning forks into the back of people\u2019s heads.</p> <p>Villanelle is joined now by Harriet Walter as Dasha, a sublime ex-gymnast spymaster who, along with Fiona Shaw, will get many of the best lines. Says Dasha, having just deposited a baby in a Mediterranean litter bin, to Villanelle, who is sulking at having to go back to London and all that awaits (chiefly, of course, Eve): \u201cLondon!

Ostensibly \u201cjust\u201d the tale of a London PR firm putting out celebrity fires by ruinously squalid, deeply giggly and trenchantly cynical means, it rises above most drama-comedies by the means of the occasional, carefully rationed, impassioned monologue. In praise of homemakers, say, organising the shit out of all orbiting lives yet being denied a presence in any workplace; against celebrity culture, or inverted snobbery. Paquin and Okonedo notwithstanding, Lydia Wilson\u2019s perfectly flawed Eve is a bitchy goddess sent to delight, tempt and infuriate, but above all to mirror humanity, and is slowly coming into her own. The best underhyped thing on the box.<br><br>We\u2019ve been rather blessed in this fourth week of isolation. We also got the end of <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m000gpql/the-nest\">The Nest</a></strong>, which has gripped and made a coming star of young Mirren Mack, and reminded me just how nuanced an actor is Shirley Henderson, able to turn from ingenue to vamp to bully with a curl of the lip. The door has been left squeakingly open for a second series, because there are still unanswered questions. How will Kaya cope? How is the genetic makeup of baby Grace/Neve still an unfathomable mystery?

Yet if there\u2019s something Jones can provenly do it is spring surprises, make you forgive characters, and so I trust and am in for the haul.</p>",
  "<p>The first thing I do each morning is open the back door and sniff the air. It contains a surprising amount of information. Recently, it has become a little warmer. It still has a bite, but it lacks the viscosity it had in the coldest months. Now, it carries the scent of leaves and flowers, of turned earth. It is suddenly full of birdsong.</p> <p>I\u2019ve spent my whole life falling in and out of isolation \u2013 and this is one of the tricks I\u2019ve learned. Living as an undiagnosed autistic woman until I was nearly 40, I\u2019ve regularly suffered mental and physical crashes that drag me outside of life for a while. By trying to be like everyone else, I\u2019ve pushed myself too far, too often.</p> <p>Every three years, give or take \u2013 and I\u2019m not convinced I\u2019ve broken the cycle yet \u2013 anxiety has engulfed me, or I\u2019ve become so exhausted that my body has gone on strike. Whatever the cause, the outside world recedes for a season.</p> <p>I\u2019ve lived through periods of continuous panic, when the machinations of my own mind have stood in the way of doing anything of much significance. But there are minor gestures I can make, which take little effort and give me something pleasurable. Sniffing the air is just one of them. I can find buttons to sew on, for example, and the result is always satisfying. I can usually find something to pickle, and then to give away.</p> <p>At the moment, I\u2019m flowing my nervous energies into growing things. Every day, I water my plants (the ones that want watering \u2013 I\u2019m learning to neglect my cactus). Geraniums, for some reason, are particularly rewarding on this front. They seem to offer an endless cycle of renewal that demands my assistance. Every few days, the one on my windowsill produces a desiccated flower or a yellow leaf that I can ease off the stem and feel like I\u2019m carrying out an act of nurture. It\u2019s a strange kind of harvest, but it pleases me. I am given the gift of making things tidy again.</p> <p>These times out of life have an emotional quality all of their own, a heady mix of intensity and drift. My attention is entirely unmoored. Right now, I have boundless capacity for reading newspaper websites, for assessing the contents of my larder and tidying my house, but an utter aversion to the book I\u2019m supposed to be writing. I am hypervigilant, driven towards the practicalities of sustaining life. Everything else seems flimsy in comparison.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These confined days are a heady mix of intensity and drift</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In these moments, I think of the author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/sep/16/classics\" title=\"\">Jean Rhys</a>, whose magnetic attraction to tumult found her living above a pub in Maidstone in 1951. Her husband, Max, was in the nearby prison for larceny, and Jean had rolled from one form of trouble to another for so long that it seemed like she wouldn\u2019t recognise peace if she stumbled over it. By now, she was a known drunk and a fighter, with a spell in Holloway behind her.</p> <p>While lodging in Maidstone to be close to Max, Jean\u2019s world shrank \u2013 and it seemed to comfort her. Her attention shifted to an appreciation of her simple surroundings. She admired the row of black elephants on the mantelpiece, the plate of red apples on the table and the flowers that her landlady brought to her room. \u201cSo you see, what more can I want?\u201d she said. For the first time in years, she stopped drinking (although she was \u201csaving up for a real debauch some time\u201d). \u201cI go about in a sort of dream, I suppose,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>I recognise that dream state well: the shifted priorities, the uncanny calm amid chaos, and the way that the minutiae become unexpectedly luminous. It was here that Rhys finally began to write the story she had yearned to tell about the first Mrs Rochester, the madwoman in the attic in <em>Jane Eyre</em>. It was a long time since she had been able to write at all. Her early literary promise seemed to have dissolved. But here, in the most straightened of circumstances, she was able to find a new perspective, and, most of all, she had time.</p> <p>It\u2019s tempting to claim that this period in exile gave birth to her enduring classic, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/jul/15/book-beach-wide-sargasso-sea-jean-rhys\" title=\"\">The </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/jul/15/book-beach-wide-sargasso-sea-jean-rhys\" title=\"\">Wide Sargasso Sea</a></em>. But that would be a gross overstatement: Rhys signed a contract for the book six years later and only delivered the manuscript nine years after that. Her masterpiece was 15 years away from that little room with its flowers and elephants, and there was certainly more tumult to come. But for all its trauma, Rhys\u2019s time in Maidstone was something of a relief. The worst had happened. Everything stopped for a while. And in that space, she could think differently.</p> <p>Not all of us find peace in the times when life stands still, though. Isolation can leave us pacing like a caged tiger, measuring the dimensions of the rooms that contain us. These are often moments when the ego cries out, when we feel sidelined or ignored. This moment of mass confinement sees many of us grappling with a sudden sense of irrelevance, of being restrained from succeeding. We are urged to think of the bigger picture, and we do, but that does nothing to soothe the sense that our life\u2019s work \u2013 the sum total of our ambition \u2013 is now considered petty.</p> <p>Isolation is not just time alone. It\u2019s also a personal U-turn, a seismic shift in identity that undermines our very sense of self. Being busy \u2013 being part of the brisk congress of daily life \u2013 is our code for being important, needed, wanted.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Being busy makes us skim over life like a stone on still water</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In less interesting times, we will meet acquaintances on the street and tell each other how busy we are, what a rush we\u2019re in, how fast life is. In fallow periods, time opens up, and we read it as an insult. The outside world does not require us. We are surplus stock, just another human body. The shame of it hangs over us, an unspeakable thing. But there is unpicking to be done here, because the pace at which we live is so often destructive. Being busy makes us skim over life like a stone on still water. In quieter times, we can feel the presence of all the things we miss in our hurry. We begin to notice the cobwebs that have formed in forgotten corners, the gardens that are overrun with weeds.</p> <p>After I left my academic job two years ago, I realised that my sense of importance was only relevant in that very specific microcosm, and that the extra financial rewards of a salaried job were mostly squandered on fuelling my headlong pursuit of work itself. The takeaways and expensive groceries; the costly services that preserved my time. I was a whole industry of my own, a republic formed to make me believe I was important.</p> <p>There is pleasure not just in small things, but in being small. When my health failed and it all fell away, I was relieved to drop the illusion. That doesn\u2019t mean it was easy. That doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t painful and full of paranoia and regret.</p> <p>It felt like that moment of waking and watching a dream recede, incrementally remembering what is real and what is not. I had believed that I was the pin holding everything together, but it turned out that I wasn\u2019t. To know that at the time was agony. To know it now is a liberation. I\u2019m not that important in the scheme of things. That leaves me free to walk away from things that do more harm than good.</p> <p>Often we resist change for so long that everything has to collapse before we can welcome it in. But that\u2019s not to say that crises \u2013 and certainly not pandemics \u2013 are some kind of divine intervention to make us mend our ways. Change comes because we live within a system governed by entropy. Change comes because our sense of control is an illusion.</p> <p>As writer and philosopher Alan Watts says, we cannot be happy until we find a way to accept that our life is riddled with insecurity. For as long as we want it to be fair, we suffer. Change invites us to surrender. And if we refuse, it carries on regardless.</p> <p>My standard response to a crisis like this is to burn shoe leather. If I can walk until I\u2019m exhausted, I can usually wear out the anxious part of my brain, too. This time around, I\u2019m not allowed even that luxury. I\u2019m embracing change yet again, pounding on my exercise bike in front of the TV, following ridiculous workout videos on YouTube, dancing to old records. I\u2019m not enjoying these things exactly, but they park my sense of dislocation for a while. Meanwhile, I\u2019m waiting to see what the change will bring me.</p> <p><em>Wintering: How I Learned to Flourish When Life Became Frozen by Katherine May (Rider, \u00a314.99).

  "<p><br>The French used to be mad about the <em>cure de sommeil</em> \u2013 the sleep cure. Dr Jakob Klaesi of Bern invented it. Drugged, you pass out for days or even weeks. Then, cautiously, you are woken up. You are supposed to find you feel quite differently about things.</p> <p>Politicians insist that lockdown under coronavirus is like the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-51936760/coronavirus-we-must-act-like-any-wartime-government\">experience of wartime</a>. It\u2019s not \u2013 except in one way, which I\u2019ll come to. It\u2019s so quiet, for one thing. War is noisy. Sirens, soldiers tramping past singing, Luftwaffe engines in the night sky.</p> <p>These lockdown weeks are more like induced sleep. Nine out of 10 of us see and hear nothing of the nurses and doctors, the bus drivers and key workers. We learn of their bravery and their deaths only by radio, from a screen or a newspaper left by a boy in a mask. For most people, life is on hold. A trance descends, soothed by birdsong, a dog barking, an ambulance in the distance.</p> <p>What happens when it\u2019s over? European literature has a genre of \u201cthe landscape after the battle\u201d \u2013 the ruins, the hunger and cold, the search for family survivors. The landscape after the plague will be unfamiliar, but not like that.</p> <p>In the first place, emerging from isolation \u2013 waking up \u2013 must be handled carefully. It\u2019s the <em>phase de sevrage</em>, weaning the patient from sleep. \u201cThis prolonged dive into the world of dream can allow a patient to exercise their fantasies, perhaps to discover the links between them,\u201d warns a French doctor. \u201cHarmful after-effects are possible, provoking in some patients paroxysms of depressive anxiety.\u201d</p> <p>The fantasies and anxieties are already with us. And here one comparison with wartime does work. The longer the virus emergency lasts, the more the memory of the pre-virus world begins to grow unreal, unconvincing. It was like that in the Second World War. \u201cPeacetime\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Was there really a Britain, only a few years ago, when you could buy as many sweeties as you wanted? A time when the work of millions of men and women wasn\u2019t wanted, when the poor couldn\u2019t afford a doctor, when middle-class families had servants they could sack when Madam was in a bad temper? It wasn\u2019t just working-class people who began to ask: \u201cCould we really have lived like that? This war\u2019s changed everything. Pity, in some ways, but it couldn\u2019t go on.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"056d292a5dcebb394aa0d3185e9734684e514a59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/056d292a5dcebb394aa0d3185e9734684e514a59/0_557_5031_3020/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A doctor checks a young boy\u2019s tonsils, December 1935.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Was there really a Britain, only a few years ago, when, outside the schools medical service, the poor couldn\u2019t afford a doctor?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daily Herald Archive/SSPL via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, unmistakably, there\u2019s a feeling that \u201cthings will never be the same after it\u2019s over\u201d and \u201cwe can\u2019t go back to all that\u201d.</p> <p>Can\u2019t we, just? Some of those who govern us can imagine only restoring \u201ctheir\u201d Britain, disfigured by inequalities. They will exploit the real and moving solidarity shown in these pandemic months, as they confront the colossal debts left by rescue spending. They will impose another \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together\u201d campaign of savage austerity at the expense of social services and the poor.</p> <p>And yet, just as in 1945, voices are starting to say \u201cnever again\u201d. As in: never again \u201causterity\u201d, which leaves people helpless in an emergency. Never again the emaciation of the welfare state, and the NHS above all. Come to that, never again neoliberalism. But who will do the politics of \u201cnever again\u201d when we open our eyes? Or are these hopes just \u201cprolonged dives into the world of dream\u201d, pathetic fantasies dissolving into \u201cparoxysms of depressive anxiety\u201d as Britain wakes from its corona coma?</p> <p>The landscape will look different. Mass unemployment, as hundreds of firms go bust in spite of government loans, made much worse if the suicidal idiocy of a no-deal Brexit really happens at the end of this year. Concentration of wealth and power in fewer hands, as big companies cannibalise what\u2019s left of smaller enterprises. Bankruptcies devastating those charities and funds that maintained so much welfare and research as public spending withered under austerity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30d627995e29e2efea715ca6c65304ec9ac2c4ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30d627995e29e2efea715ca6c65304ec9ac2c4ab/0_345_2475_1485/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Londoners queue outside a butcher\u2019s shop in 1947.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Never again?

Neoliberalism is dead, but Boris Johnson\u2019s own path away from it leads to a UK version of European neopopulism: a powerful nationalist state, insular and xenophobic, harsh on human rights, big spender on the welfare of the \u201cleft-behind\u201d masses. Rishi Sunak\u2019s discovery of billions for business rescue, like the cities\u2019 discovery of millions to house their rough sleepers, shows what was always possible. Debt and deficit soar but \u2013 turning Tory orthodoxy inside out \u2013 they seem not so lethal after all. And a dose of moderate inflation? Why not?</p> <p>The state is back. A liberating thought for Labour under Keir Starmer. But a strong British state in the 2020s \u2013 what will that smell like? The historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-edgerton\">David Edgerton</a>, asking himself: \u201cWhen was Britain?\u201d, answers: not in the high days of empire, not even in 1940, but in the postwar decades after 1945. Then Britain became a strictly centralised and planned state. Almost self-sufficient (\u201cExport or Die!\u201d), it was industrialised as never before or since. Operated by Tories as well as Labour, this \u201ceconomic nationalism\u201d only broke down in the 1980s, says Edgerton. In came free-market dogma, the shrinking of the state and devolution wrenching open the faultlines of the United Kingdom.</p> <p>That \u201cstrong Britain\u201d left its peoples healthier, safer, better educated and more equal. But there\u2019s no way back to it. The industrial economy is over. Dragging Scotland and Wales back under Whitehall control \u2013 forget it! Johnson\u2019s \u201cstrong Britain\u201d may amount only to England weakly imitating the repressive populism of Poland or Hungary.</p> <p>Yet a great emergency, like this shared time of pestilence, leaves people sensing their own power, aware that they can act without waiting for yesterday\u2019s leaders. When we finally wake up from the long sleep cure, there is a chance to make those \u201cnever agains\u201d more than a fading dream. A chance \u2013 but lasting only for a few months of creative confusion as we all stand up again and look around. \u201cRise like lions after slumber,\u201d said Shelley. There is plenty to do, but we have to do it fast.</p> <p>\u2022 Neal Ascherson is a journalist and writer</p>",
  "<p>For many of us in self-isolation, it can feel like the coronavirus has put the world on hold as we wait for release from our temporary imprisonment. But increasing numbers of people are using the time to build their skillset, with an upsurge in enrolments on online learning platforms such as edX, FutureLearn and Coursera, which offer \u201cmassive open online courses\u201d \u2013 or Moocs.</p> <p>Coursera, for instance, has seen an eightfold increase in enrolments for social science, personal development, arts and humanities courses since the start of the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d says the company\u2019s chief product officer, Shravan Goli. (In late March, its <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being?\">Science of Well Being</a> course saw 500,000 new enrolments in a single weekend.)</p> <p>Devoting some of our quarantine time to self-education makes sense. Besides helping to bolster your career during this economic uncertainty, learning a new skill can give you a sense of control that will help cope with anxiety engendered by the epidemic.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.jameswallman.com/author\">James Wallman</a> says in his book <em>Time and How to Spend It</em>, personal growth is central to many psychological theories of long-term happiness. So although an hour listening to a lecture may not be as enticing as the instant gratification of reality TV or social media, it will lead to greater life-satisfaction in the long term. \u201cYou could say that humans are like bicycles: if you\u2019re not heading towards something you fall over,\u201d Wallman says. And when we are social distancing, online courses are one of the best ways to do that.</p> <h2><strong>What do the courses involve?</strong></h2> <p>The specifics vary from platform to platform, though many follow the same basic model. With the larger platforms such as edX, Coursera, and FutureLearn, you can choose university-affiliated courses \u2013 so you know you are being taught by experts in the field. The courses are of varying lengths \u2013 from a few hours to a regular, weekly commitment over several months \u2013 and typically involve video lectures, reading texts and regular tests to check your memory and understanding of the syllabus.</p> <p>In many cases enrolment is free, but may have to pay to get a certificate verifying that you have completed the course.</p> <h2><strong>What should I look for in a course?</strong></h2> <p>You might be tempted to sign up to the courses with the most prestigious instructors, but that would be a mistake, says James Murphy, who used Moocs to prepare a master\u2019s degree while he was housebound with an illness. \u201cInstitutional affiliations aren\u2019t always a good guide to quality,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Many of the platforms offer user reviews where you can gauge other learners\u2019 enjoyment and satisfaction with the course, but nothing beats trying it for yourself, says Murphy, who is now an associate lecturer at the Open University. \u201cI think the best advice is to sign up and see if you like it \u2013 there\u2019s no reason to stick with one you dislike if the delivery isn\u2019t engaging. You can usually tell in the first hour if you\u2019ll enjoy the course or not.\u201d</p> <p>If you are hoping for professional development and considering the cost of the certificate, you might want to check whether employers recognise the qualification. Coursera\u2019s Goli points out that about 30 companies now accept the <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support\">Google-affiliated course on IT management</a>, for instance. The reviews can guide you on this, as can the course descriptions, which sometimes include statistics from student surveys about the professional benefits that came from the experience.</p> <p>It\u2019s also important to pick a course of the right difficulty \u2013 something just beyond your comfort-zone \u2013 engaging enough to occupy your mind, but not so ambitious that it\u2019s frustrating. That way, you\u2019ll achieve the \u201cflow state\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019ll lose track of time,\u201d says Wallman \u2013 and the deep concentration will feel much more rewarding than simply scrolling through social media.</p> <h2><strong>How can I stay motivated?</strong></h2> <p>Even if you have chosen a course that is perfectly suited to your goals, you may find your initial enthusiasm evaporates and your discipline trails off. \u201cLack of routine and time is often the biggest hurdle,\u201d says writer and regular Mooc user Bianca Barratt. Her advice is to try to set up a schedule and \u201ctreat it like a physical class you\u2019ve signed up for. Show up when you say you will, make an effort with the class exercises and homework and complete the course in full.\u201d</p> <p>Another good strategy, according to Anant Agarwal, the founder and CEO of edX, is to find a \u201cstudy buddy or form a bigger learning group, so that they can motivate each other and enjoy the course together\u201d. You might make a pact with people you already know, or you could connect with people from the discussion forums that accompany the course. Like your classmates at a traditional school or university, you can help each other to understand the difficult material, and the feeling of accountability might spur you on when you find distractions drawing you away from your goal.</p> <h2><strong>What do I do after completing the course?</strong></h2> <p>For some, this may be just the start of the journey \u2013 furnishing you with a greater confidence to learn and the motivation to take it further. If you find that you\u2019re hooked, many of the platforms also provide accredited bachelors and master\u2019s degrees from selected universities, though this will be more expensive.</p> <p>For others, the completion of a single course will be enough. But whatever your goals, the quest to learn a new skill or discipline may be the perfect distraction from the frustrations of self-isolation \u2013 allowing you to connect with new people and transforming this period into a time of enlightenment and self-discovery.</p> <h2><strong>The next step \u2013 seven Moocs to expand your mind</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn\">Learning How to Learn</a></strong><br><em>McMaster University, University of California San Diego, via Coursera</em><br>With more than 2 million enrolments, this short course is a natural place to start your journey, offering the mental tools for you to master any new subject.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/big-bang\">From the Big Bang to Dark Energy</a> </strong><br><em>University of Tokyo, via Coursera</em><br>Physicist Hitoshi Murayama examines the biggest question of all \u2013 the origins of the universe.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/rhetoric-art-of-persuasive-writing-public-speaking\">Rhetoric: The Art of Persuasive Writing and Public Speaking</a></strong><br><em>Harvard University, via edX</em><br>Professor James Engell will help you to polish your communication skills in this eight-week course.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/science-cooking-from-haute-cuisine-to-soft-matter\">Science and Cooking</a></strong><br><em>Harvard University, via edX</em><br>Physicists, chemists and restaurant chefs explore the transformation of food in the kitchen.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/screenwriting\">An Introduction to Screenwriting</a></strong><strong> </strong><br><em>University of East Anglia, via FutureLearn</em><br>If your mind is fizzing with inspiration for a Netflix mini-series, this course \u2013 from UEA\u2019s prestigious creative writing programme \u2013 will help you translate it to the screen.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking\">Introduction to Mathematical Thinking</a></strong><br><em>Stanford University, via Coursera</em><br>Not for the fainthearted but more than 200,000 learners have taken this journey through the basics of mathematical logic and proof.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/science-of-meditation\">Buddhism and Modern Psychology</a></strong><br><em>Princeton University, via Coursera</em><br>Bestselling author Robert Wright examines what modern psychology can learn from ancient teachings.</p>",
  "<p>Crisis reveals character. Under the intense stress test imposed by the coronavirus, Britons are getting an education about themselves and the institutions that define their country. Some of the lessons are cheering, some are worrying and some are disturbing.</p> <p>Start at the very top. This country still looks to the Queen to be its comforting national figurehead, the anchor point in a sea of uncertainty. The job of monarch is nothing like as risky as that of a frontline health worker, a royal castle is not such a bad place to spend lockdown and she has had seven decades of practice to become pitch-perfect at being the reassuring great-grandmother of the nation. She does it extremely well. The Queen\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52176208\">\u201cwe will meet again\u201d broadcast</a>, invoking wartime solidarity more subtly and authentically than politicians straining to channel Churchill, was watched live by <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/almost-24m-tune-in-queen-s-address-a4407876.html\">24 million people</a>.</p> <p>Most watched it on the BBC. Before the crisis, Auntie was being threatened with a beating by elements of the government. Hoodlums in the Downing Street gang put it about that the BBC was going to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/08/we-wont-let-dominic-cummings-whack-the-bbc\">\u201cwhacked\u201d</a> and Number 10 ordered a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/15/boris-johnson-threatens-bbc-with-two-pronged-attack\">ministerial boycott</a> of the <em>Today</em> programme. That sounds even more puerile now than it did then. The nation has once again turned to the BBC in a crisis as its central source of reliable information. Viewing figures are up by more than a third on this time last year. Most Tories I speak to think that the threat to the corporation from the Johnson regime is much diminished.</p> <p>The army is another battered national institution that has received a boost. British fondness for a plucky old soldier has expressed itself in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-capt-tom-moore-raises-12m-nhs-completes-garden-walk\">millions in donations</a> raised by Captain Tom Moore, the 99-year-old Second World War veteran doing laps of his garden to raise money for health charities. The modern army, scarred by its humiliations on the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq, has not done much recent fighting in foreign fields and had been struggling to justify itself to ministers. So the military were delighted to be asked to help set up the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/01/we-drew-up-the-plan-over-a-brew-inside-operation-nightingale\">Nightingale emergency hospitals</a> and give logistical support such as transporting oxygen supplies. This has been a reminder of the contribution they can make to battles at home. \u201cThe army is good in a crisis,\u201d remarks one senior Tory. \u201cYou set them a task and they get on and do it.\u201d That will strengthen the hand of the generals when the postponed strategic defence review considers allocating future resources.</p> <p>Of all the institutions being stress tested by this crisis, the NHS wears the brightest halo. The former Tory chancellor <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2018/07/04/brits-still-love-nhs-they-are-nervous-about-its-fu\">Nigel Lawson</a> once remarked, with a whiff of derision, that \u201cthe NHS is the closest thing the English people have to a religion\u201d. Faith in it and worship of it, expressed by the weekly street congregations to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-people-across-the-uk-play-music-and-clap-for-carers-video\">clap for carers</a>, have become more passionate. On his release from hospital, and after thanking the doctors and nurses who saved his life, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-boris-johnson-nhs-hospital-video\">Boris Johnson</a> called the NHS \u201cthe beating heart of this country... the best of this country\u201d. </p> <p>A cold-eyed assessment of the health service\u2019s performance would be less poetic. Some of its achievements have been hugely impressive. So much so that even Labour politicians, whose usual default is to say that the NHS has been wrecked by years of Tory underspending, are full of praise. Hospitals have reorganised themselves with remarkable speed to deal with this novel enemy. The dedication of the staff has been awesome. Bureaucracy was swiftly swept aside to allow retired health workers to return to the service. In other respects, the NHS is not always flattered by international comparisons. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/uk-must-learn-from-german-response-to-covid-19-says-whitty\">openly acknowledged</a> that Britain has things to learn from Germany. The health service is still struggling to muster adequate supplies of key equipment and ramp up testing to the levels required. But even where it is judged to have underperformed, the public is not going to blame the service and its staff. That will be laid at the door of political mismanagement, bureaucratic bungling and lack of resources.</p> <p>I make one confident prediction about the health service - it can expect to be a big winner of future spending rounds. Mr Johnson has told the nation that he owes his life to the NHS. For so long as he is prime minister, it will be pretty much impossible for his government to refuse the health service almost anything that it asks for.</p> <p>The Bank of England and the Treasury, both applying critical lessons learned during the financial crisis, took quick and decisive action to try to contain the damage done to the economy. The stock of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/12/rishi-sunak-dilemma-over-how-to-pay-for-his-coronavirus-spending\">Rishi Sunak</a>, an assured public performer who exhibits some flair as a phrase-maker, has so soared that many colleagues have marked up the chancellor as the next Tory leader. That observation comes with a big but. \u201cThis is the easy bit for him when he can be the cavalry riding to the rescue,\u201d comments one Tory colleague. \u201cThe hard part comes later when Rishi has to find the money to pay for all his emergency measures.\u201d</p> <p>The crisis has found other institutions wanting. We have been reminded of the perils of concentrating a huge amount of power among a tiny number of people at Number 10. Early mistakes came about because the prime minister and his circle were captured by assumptions about the disease and the public that proved to be wrong. They were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/15/boris-johnson-reacted-too-slowly-to-covid-19-says-ex-scientific-adviser\">slow to announce a lockdown</a> in part because Number 10 faultily assumed that many Britons would disobey. \u201cWe had that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51917562\">weird period</a> when Boris was telling people not to go to the pub, but letting the pubs stay open,\u201d observes one former cabinet minister. \u201cThis is because the people around Boris at Number 10 are in the small minority of this country who are natural hooligans, people who won\u2019t be told what to do.\u201d</p> <p>A cabinet with more experience and confidence might have challenged the Number 10 view. But this cabinet was appointed not to question the prime minister, but to be supplicants to him. \u201cBoris\u2019s problem is that he appointed a cabinet of yes-men,\u201d says one senior Tory. This is not quite right because he also appointed some yes-women. Dominic Raab has not made any evident errors during his period as a facsimile prime minister, but then again he has not been empowered to make any big decisions either. The crisis has underlined the dangers of having a very dominant prime minister surrounded by a weak and neophyte cabinet.</p> <p>At the height of a national emergency without any modern precedent, many of the necessary checks and balances on government are not functioning. Even before parliament was shut down at the end of March, it was not impressive as an invigilator of the executive. The science select committee and the health committee have done useful work gathering evidence. The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt is among the select minority of MPs who have distinguished themselves by getting on the government\u2019s case about the sluggish pace of some of its responses. Parliament as a collective hasn\u2019t had much influence on the course of events. The prime minister has simply ignored the Commons. Whereas Tony Blair felt obliged to regularly explain himself to MPs during the Iraq war, and Gordon Brown did the same during the financial crisis, Mr Johnson has not once made a full statement direct to the Commons about the coronavirus crisis. He ought to do so as soon as his health permits.</p> <p>Parliament will return to work this week in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/13/hybrid-virtual-parliament-plans-to-be-put-to-mps-next-week\">a hybrid form</a>, with up to 50 MPs present in the chamber and another 120 able to contribute remotely at any one time. There are grounds for being sceptical about whether an e-parliament will be very effective at holding the government to account. As we\u2019ve seen from the video news conferences mounted by Number 10, the format makes it much easier for ministers to bat away questions they don\u2019t want to answer. Let\u2019s hope MPs can make it work and that the resumed parliament is virtual only in the technical sense. Ministers have taken extraordinary powers to control people\u2019s lives and that requires constant scrutiny. We also need more ministerial explanation and accountability for the choices they are making.</p> <p>Every crisis is an opportunity. From the NHS to the monarch, the BBC to the army, several of our institutions are reminding the nation why they are essential to Britain. The challenge before parliament, which is supposed to be the beating heart of our democracy, is to demonstrate that it can do the same.</p> <p>\u2022<em> </em>Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

Here's how to do it | Adrian Chiles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clemence Gossett, the founder and co-owner of <a href=\"https://thegourmandiseschool.com/who-we-are/instructors/clemence-gossett/\">The Gourmandise School</a> in Santa Monica, California, says she was initially surprised by the turn to bread \u2013 she initially thought that people prefer making cakes and cookies. But she surmises that people have been attracted to bread baking not just because of its practicality as a grocery staple, but because of its meditative qualities during challenging times.</p> <p>Rolling, kneading and mixing all have a calming quality, forcing you to be in the moment and not stuck mentally in the future or past. That may help bakers manage the uncertain emotions. \u201cI think that there is this desire for people to express themselves and it\u2019s really hard to do that when you can\u2019t communicate and have this back and forth with others,\u201d says Gossett. \u201cWe have lost that in a way. There\u2019s this wonderful tangibility with baking and lets you work out emotions and express yourself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02748698ebc33ec7983aaaa30b432e1c4595d9fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02748698ebc33ec7983aaaa30b432e1c4595d9fd/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Queries about bread and yeast have surged on Google.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Queries about bread and yeast have surged on Google.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some studies show that baking is connected to positive feelings. Psychologists have started exploring cooking and baking as a therapeutic tool to help people dealing with things like depression and anxiety, and a 2016 study, published in the <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760.2016.1257049\">Journal of Positive Psychology</a>, suggests that people who frequently take a turn at small, creative projects report feeling more relaxed and happier.</p> <p>That makes sense to Gossett \u2013 her cooking school offers a class that combines <a href=\"https://thegourmandiseschool.com/pietherapy/\">therapy and pie-baking</a>. The class creates a space for people to work on anxiety, particularly perfectionism, using the simple, delicious experience of learning how to make pies.</p> <p>Ken Forkish, the owner of Ken\u2019s Artisan Bakery in Portland, Oregon, and author of the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Flour-Water-Salt-Yeast-Fundamentals/dp/160774273X\">Flour Water Salt Yeast</a>, says that people are also looking to make their own bread at home because trips to the grocery store have become riddled with stress.<em> </em>\u201cPeople want to have fresh bread while avoiding the grocery store as much as possible,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got time on your hands, and maybe you have wanted to learn to bake bread and now you have the time to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Time is a necessary ingredient for bread, Forkish adds, and that extra time at home has prompted bakers to attempt things they may not have before \u2013 such as sourdough, which can take days to produce. Professional bakers are turning to social media to demystify the process, and amateur bakers are posting their homemade experiments. The bakers at Tartine Bakery in San Francisco, which helped kickstart the global sourdough craze, have posted <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B--Ih4ghyry/\">instructional videos on making sourdough starter and their signature sourdough loaves </a>which have been viewed tens of thousands of times.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B-5MBczBu10/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

The school also has a hotline and email address where people can reach out; she said the response has been overwhelming \u2013 running the hotline has become a full-time job, answering questions about which ingredients can be substituted or what meals to make with a random assortment of food in the fridge and pantry. Gossett is even doing FaceTime calls to coach people through their baking challenges.</p> <p>Gossett thinks the pandemic has prompted a shift in how people view baking as a part of their days.<strong> </strong>\u201cInstead of asking: how can I make this fit in my schedule, it\u2019s more about how can I make myself available to learn this new process.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It was just a few days after the ban on visits to his mother\u2019s nursing home in the Swedish city of Uppsala, on 3 April, that Magnus Bondesson started to get worried.<br><br>\u201cThey [the home] opened up for Skype calls and that\u2019s when I saw two employees. I didn\u2019t see any masks and they didn\u2019t have gloves on,\u201d says Bondesson, a start-up founder and app developer.<br><br>\u201cWhen I called again a few days later I questioned the person helping out, asking why they didn\u2019t use face masks, and he said they were just following the guidelines.\u201d<br><br>That same week there were numerous reports in Sweden\u2019s national news media about just how badly the country\u2019s nursing homes were starting to be hit by the coronavirus, with hundreds of cases confirmed at homes in Stockholm, the worst affected region, and infections in homes across the country.</p> <p>Since then pressure has mounted on the government to explain how, despite a stated aim of protecting the elderly from the risks of Covid-19, a third of fatalities have been people living in care homes.</p> <p>Last week, as figures released by the Public Health Agency of Sweden indicated that 1,333 people had now died of coronavirus, the country\u2019s normally unflappable state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell admitted that the situation in care homes was worrying. <br><br>\u201cThis is our big problem area,\u201d said Tegnell, the brains behind the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/sweden-coronavirus-death-toll-reaches-1000\">relatively light-touch strategy,</a> which has seen it ask, rather than order, people to avoid non-essential travel, work from home and stay indoors if they are over 70 or are feeling ill. <br><br>The same day prime minister Stefan L\u00f6fven said that the country faced a \u201cserious situation\u201d in its old people\u2019s homes, announced efforts to step up protections, and ordered the country\u2019s health inspectorate to investigate.<br><br>Lena Einhorn, a virologist who has been one of the leading domestic critics of Sweden\u2019s coronavirus policy, told the <em>Observer</em> that the government and the health agency were still resisting the most obvious explanations.<br><br>\u201cThey have to admit that it\u2019s a huge failure, since they have said the whole time that their main aim has been to protect the elderly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what is really strange is that they still do not acknowledge the likely route. They say it\u2019s very unfortunate, that they are investigating, and that it\u2019s a matter of the training personnel, but they will not acknowledge that presymptomatic or asymptomatic spread is a factor.\u201d<br><br>The agency\u2019s advice to those managing and working at nursing homes, like its policy towards coronavirus in general, has been based on its judgment that the \u201cspread from those without symptoms is responsible for a very limited share\u201d of those who get infected.<br><br>Its advice to the care workers and nurses looking after older people such as Bondesson\u2019s 69-year-old mother is that they should not wear protective masks or use other protective equipment unless they are dealing with a resident in the home they have reason to suspect is infected.<br><br>Otherwise the central protective measure in place is that staff should stay home if they detect any symptoms in themselves.<br><br>\u201cWhere I\u2019m working we don\u2019t have face masks at all, and we are working with the most vulnerable people of all,\u201d said one care home worker, who wanted to remain anonymous. \u201cWe don\u2019t have hand sanitiser, just soap. That\u2019s it. Everybody\u2019s concerned about it. We are all worried.\u201d<br><br>\u201cThe worst thing is that it is us, the staff, who are taking the infection in to the elderly,\u201d complained one nurse to Swedish public broadcaster SVT. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that more of them haven\u2019t been infected. It\u2019s a scandal.\u201d<br><br>Einhorn was one of 22 researchers who on Tuesday called for Sweden\u2019s politicians to break with the country\u2019s tradition of entrusting policy to its expert agencies, and to seize control of Sweden\u2019s coronavirus strategy from the agency.</p> <p>She argues that the reason why Sweden has a much higher number of cases in care homes than in Norway and Finland is not because of the homes themselves, but because of Sweden\u2019s decision to keep schools and kindergartens open, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/as-the-rest-of-europe-lives-under-lockdown-sweden-keeps-calm-and-carries-on\">not to shut restaurants or bars</a>.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s not like it goes from one old age home to another. It comes in separately to all of these old age homes, so there\u2019s no way it can be all be attributed to the personnel going in and working when they are sick. There\u2019s a basic system fault in their recommendations. There\u2019s no other explanation for it.\u201d</p> <p><br>Tegnell\u2019s colleague AnnaSara Carnahan on Friday told Sveriges Radio that the number of deaths reported from old people\u2019s homes was \u201cprobably an underestimate\u201d, as regional health infectious diseases units were reporting that many elderly who died were not being tested.<br><br>Bondesson\u2019s mother, who has dementia, is worried, he says. \u201cShe is aware of most things that you talk about, it\u2019s just that she might have bad short-term memory, on and off,\u201d he said. \u201cShe had also been questioning the lack of face masks. She thinks it\u2019s really sad to have to be there constantly for weeks and not to know when it\u2019s going to end.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>I\u2019ve been thinking about memories, and about what on earth will remain from this time. On one level I feel a bit superstitious even entertaining the thought of after: it seems presumptuous. But when others talk about what might come next, it gives me a fillip of optimism, so I\u2019ve decided to allow myself to consider it, occasionally. Live dangerously with me: let\u2019s tempt fate for a minute and ask what we\u2019ll remember of the Great Confinement.</p> <p>For many of us, this is one of the most momentous events of our lifetimes, as memorable as 9/11, perhaps. For me, it far outstrips the weird, three-day terrorist lockdown I lived through in Brussels in 2015 and any number of my personal dramas.</p> <p>The Second World War had Mass Observation, the social research project created in 1937 for which thousands of volunteers wrote diaries and answered questionnaires. The 480 diarists who recorded their war as part of the endeavour created a fascinating archive of daily life under the same, but different constraints: rationing, blackout, lost loved ones and long swathes of uncertainty. Some diarists became breakout stars: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/dec/03/features.review\">Nella Last</a> was a wife and mother in heavily bombed Barrow-in-Furness, dealing with the daily grind of scarce food and danger, whilst increasingly frustrated with the straitjacket of conventional 1940s marriage. Jean Lucy Pratt, whose funny, wistful diaries were published as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/05/notable-woman-jean-lucey-pratt-review\">A Notable Woman</a></em>, wrote her war \u2013 beautifully \u2013 as a backdrop to the more immediate dramas of her love life, losing her virginity in 1941 as significant as the Blitz in its own way.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The week has lost its punctuation: without Friday-night pizza here, what even is Friday?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Social media is our mass observation. Imagine the future PhD theses on virality in the age of the virus that will be teased out of an unwieldy archive of bread jokes, park picnic outrage and WhatsApp threads explaining Discord to grandparents. I bet there will be a few on the tiger as the lockdown\u2019s breakout cultural artefact. Or how about \u201cBackground in the foreground: Zoom and domestic aspiration in the 2020 pandemic\u201d?</p> <p>But apart from mass records and the occasional meticulous diary keeper (I\u2019m hoping David Sedaris and Alan Bennett have us covered), what will the rest of us remember? Will it just be a mood, the sensation of a beautiful spring exploding around us as we grappled with fear and grief and boredom? There will be birthdays and anniversaries; moments when something was supposed to happen but didn\u2019t, but mainly days elide into one another. The week has lost its punctuation: my son thought Saturday was Tuesday and without Friday-night pizza here, what even is Friday?</p> <p>I know my short-term memory is shot to pieces: I paid for the same TV series twice on different platforms this week; my inbox is littered with draft emails I\u2019m certain I\u2019ve sent. In hypothermia the body directs blood to protect vital organs and away from extremities; it feels as if my brain is doing something similar now. I can work, more or less, but I can\u2019t remember whether I\u2019ve brushed my teeth.</p> <p>Synapses fried with listless scrolling, the weekly shop has become more baffling than quantum mechanics: finally allowed into the Co-op, I drift in confusion, list forgotten in pocket, past butter and cereal, leaving with two chocolate fudge cakes and another multipack of Twixes to join my inadvertent stockpile. \u201cWhere\u2019s the kitchen roll?\u201d asks my husband and I can only proffer jam tarts. What memories can a mind in this state possibly be forming?</p> <p>I know what I\u2019ll definitely remember this week, though: the abandoned lamb I discovered on my daily walk. A pathetic bag of bones, cold, tiny and alone. I waited and checked, I\u2019m not a lambing rookie. Night was falling, so I scooped it up, tucked it into my jacket and headed home. It was silent and floppy, wiry head nodding with the rhythm of my steps, thimble-sized hooves tucked beneath it. I wondered if it was even alive: the difference between life and death seems marginal in something so small and new. It was still breathing when I got home, so the nearly-18-year-old became chief lamb monitor, persuading it to suckle from a pierced washing up glove finger and arranging it on hot water bottles.</p> <p>Meanwhile, I drove around looking for professional assistance. As a townie in the country, the spectre of Bill Forsyth\u2019s wonderful <em>Local Hero</em> is unavoidable when you\u2019re dithering around with a broken animal: the bit where Mac, the US oil exec tells an impassive Highland pub landlord \u201cWe have an injured rabbit also\u201d. Eventually I found someone to take our lamb in and dropped it off, tucked in an old cushion cover. Revived by my son\u2019s ministrations, it was bleating indignantly and trying to stand: a hopeful moment in a dark time.</p> <p>I\u2019ll remember it because it was a strange and magical, but also because at the same time our next-door neighbour was dying. A lovely, vital man, not particularly old or vulnerable, incomprehensibly gone. The moment the pandemic becomes personal will be fixed in many of our minds: the more abstract it remains, the luckier we are.</p> <p><em>Follow Emma on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BelgianWaffling?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@BelgianWaffling</a></em></p>",
  "<p>The break in play caused by coronavirus might appear a curious time for the International Cricket Council to be reminding players of their duty to report corrupt approaches, but a sport that sits dormant is still vulnerable. The illegal gambling market on the Asian subcontinent has no live action at present and when play resumes there will be an appetite among bookmakers and punters to make up for lost time. What chance a spike in nefarious activity as a knock-on effect?</p> <p>This threat is something that anti-corruption units around the world are wary of, not least with cricketers, like many of us, on their mobile phones more than usual during the lockdown.

In recent times two high-profile suspensions from cricket, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/29/bangladesh-captain-shakib-al-hasan-two-year-cricket-corruption-ban\">Bangladesh\u2019s superstar all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/26/sanath-jayasuriya-banned-corruption-investigation-cricket-two-years\">Sanath Jayasuriya, the former Sri Lanka opener turned national selector</a>, serve as a reminder of the consequences for not doing so.</p> <p>That both bans were triggered by failure to report, as well as a refusal to cooperate in the case of Jayasuriya, is noteworthy. Since Alex Marshall, the former British chief constable, took charge of the ICC\u2019s anti-corruption unit in 2017, there has been a clear shift towards this side of the problem, as well as increased efforts to disrupt corruptors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39e64e8b73cf6432daa41acb1cd8918d1e46adfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39e64e8b73cf6432daa41acb1cd8918d1e46adfc/0_269_4107_2464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shakib Al Hasan is serving a two-year ban for failing to report corrupt approaches\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shakib Al Hasan is serving a two-year ban for failing to report corrupt approaches</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Munir Uz Zaman/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It makes sense, too. Demonstrating definitively that games or passages of play are fixed remains labyrinthine work, even if there has been recent successes in exposing schemes in the Pakistan Super League (2017) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/25/gulam-bodi-banned-20-years-ram-slam\">South Africa\u2019s Ram Slam T20 (2016)</a>.</p> <p>But now armed with the technology to trace communications \u2013 to the point that even the information on a deliberately damaged sim card can be recovered \u2013 it has become easier for investigators to prove an approach has not been escalated, so we are seeing the bans this commands \u2013 six months to five years \u2013 being dispensed more regularly.</p> <p>James Pyemont, the ECB\u2019s head of integrity, says: \u201cThat offence [failure to report] is a standalone one but it is also a way of trying to identify and catch corruption early. There are many reasons why that\u2019s a sensible approach. From a historical look at match-fixing in cricket, there are always opportunities for intervention and prevention before that corrupt event happens, so it\u2019s working in that space and seeking to be proactive rather than reactive.\u201d</p> <p>The ECB is understood to have seen the number of approaches being reported roughly double in the past two years. The figures, not disclosed, are said to remain relatively low overall, however, and the increase is not necessarily viewed as a sign of more activity.</p> <p>Rather they say the feedback from the Professional Cricketers\u2019 Association is that trust in the process has gone up, as well as awareness given education programmes that include seminars, online modules and contact with their local anti-corruption officer.</p> <p>English cricket is taking a more bespoke approach, too, recognising that different players require different messaging at different times, be it the academy graduate starting their career or the seasoned pro heading off to play in a domestic Twenty20 competition overseas.</p> <p>The T20 leagues have opened up new commercial opportunities but also a fresh avenue for fixers. As well as lavish gifts and fictional sponsorship deals, a new method of approach is to promise a player they will be signed in a draft. The ECB says it will happily investigate any offers that feel remotely suspicious, even if simply to provide peace of mind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pyemont adds: \u201cWe are trying to work in the background and it\u2019s a balance of how much headspace we can occupy with players. We don\u2019t want them to be paranoid but we also want them to recognise if something is not right and pass that headache on to us. We want to be a drum beat in the back of their minds.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also very clear that if they make a mistake in this area, it can be very difficult to come back from. So we want to work in support but there are severe consequences that can be career changing or even life changing.\u201d</p> <p>In short, there has never been an easier time for players to report an approach, nor a more punitive time if they don\u2019t. The sport is on hold but the drum continues to beat.</p>",

Now I believe they will not only return but be properly restored.</p> <p>There are concerns about the regime in Saudi Arabia and things over there are certainly very different to life in Europe, but the Saudis are in partnership with Reuben Brothers and Amanda Staveley so the board will be balanced.

It sounds as if communication between supporters and the club will improve dramatically.</p> <p>It bodes exceedingly well for supporters as well as everyone working at the club. I\u2019m sure the players will see it as good news. This is a chance for Newcastle to become a seriously big club again.</p> <h2><strong>Miles Starforth, Newcastle United correspondent for the Shields Gazette, one of the north east\u2019s leading evening newspapers</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve lost count of the number of \u201ctakeovers\u201d I\u2019ve covered! The first came just a year or so after Mike Ashley bought Newcastle and these takeover bids, more recently labelled \u201cfakeovers\u201d, have punctuated his tenure.</p> <p>This deal though is done, as I understand it, and it\u2019s all down to the Premier League\u2019s owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test. I expect it to go through, it\u2019s just a case of how quickly.</p> <p>Obviously, the most important story right now is the coronavirus pandemic but this is massive news for Newcastle United.</p> <p>The ethical/human rights aspects of a Saudi funded takeover have been on my mind, and I think there\u2019s an awareness on Tyneside of the issues raised by Amnesty International. That said, the overwhelming majority of supporters have welcomed the proposed deal \u2013 and the end of the Mike Ashley era. </p> <p>Now, there\u2019s hope, at last. This club has been relegated twice on Mike Ashley\u2019s watch. Fans disillusioned with Ashley\u2019s ownership have been walking away. Ambition and hope will bring them back.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9166c0b1504f077243a3b95650ad713276249186\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9166c0b1504f077243a3b95650ad713276249186/0_0_2967_1779/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Newcastle fans have regularly protested against Mike Ashley\u2019s ownership of the club\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Newcastle fans have regularly protested against Mike Ashley\u2019s ownership of the club.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Alex Hurst, chair of the Newcastle United Supporters Trust and editor of the fanzine True Faith:</strong></h2> <p>If \u2013 and it\u2019s still an if \u2013 this takeover happens then it will bring back hope to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, in the north-east.</p> <p>For too long, Newcastle has existed for the benefit of one man and that won\u2019t be the case with the new owners. As supporters, what we want to see from them is the club being run in a sustainable, transparent and ambitious manner. We aren\u2019t demanding we win trophies, or win the Champions League, and we appreciate they might not be able to provide us with a \u201cManchester City effect\u201d, but what we do want is a firm sense that we have our club back and that it\u2019s again going in the right direction.</p> <p>The involvement of Saudi Arabian wealth in the takeover is not a concern right now and ultimately any new owners will be judged like all owners are judged \u2013 by how they treat the fans and how they run the football club. Getting those two things right is the most important thing.</p> <h2><strong>Jos\u00e9 Enrique, Newcastle left-back from 2007 to 2011</strong></h2> <p>I have nothing against Mike Ashley \u2013 he is a nice guy and when I was at Newcastle he was always good to me. But for sure it is the right time for him to leave the club.</p> <p>Change is needed because Newcastle are not where they should be. They are a top club who should be in the top six and have a top manager. The current manager, Steve Bruce, has done a good job but he is not Rafa Ben\u00edtez, who was at Liverpool and Real Madrid and had won things. He left because he was not given the money and control he needed to do his job properly, which was a big shame for Newcastle.</p> <p>It looks like the new owners will give the manager \u2013 whoever that is \u2013 money to spend. That is needed just to make sure Newcastle stay in the Premier League because if you look at clubs like Aston Villa, they are spending \u00a3100m just to survive. The new owners need to go beyond that to ensure Newcastle are competing for the top six and even higher.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5ee5948d96b2168ee87212ec2b37173873fe3ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5ee5948d96b2168ee87212ec2b37173873fe3ae/0_176_2600_1732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jose Enrique in action for Newcastle in 2008\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jose Enrique in action for Newcastle in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Thompson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Spain people ask me: \u201cWhat is happening with Newcastle?\u201d \u2013 they know here that they are a big club who should be doing better.

It looks like we finally have that once more. There\u2019s obviously a worry that access to a bottomless pit of money will dilute the essence of the club, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t thrilled about the prospect of becoming one of the game\u2019s elite players again.</p> <p>I also understand the misgivings regarding sportswashing, but I\u2019m willing to give the Saudi PIF the benefit of the doubt and hope that their involvement in this project hints at a willingness to change and modernise.</p> <h2><strong>Jacque Talbot, freelance journalist and writer for the fanzine True Faith</strong></h2> <p>Many people have decried the potential takeover but, as supporters, we\u2019re allowed to be glad that Mike Ashley is going while recognising that our club\u2019s money will, in part, stem from a regime that\u2019s fallen foul of human rights atrocities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/15/newcastle-expect-green-light-saudi-takeover-despite-amnesty-misgivings\">Newcastle expect green light for Saudi takeover despite Amnesty misgivings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It may be terrible to say, but having boundless sums of money really is the nature of the beast now; if you don\u2019t like foreign investment having an influence in football then the elite game is not for you. And our club has been deprived of any sort of investment or ambition for far too long.</p> <p>It\u2019s therefore refreshing to hear that the potential new owners are willing to spend on new players, and will almost certainly break our transfer record more than once doing so. What\u2019s more key is that they will also oversee the regeneration of the city, something that was hugely overlooked \u2013 even, arguably, hampered \u2013 by Ashley.</p>",

The flight is still showing as confirmed with no way to claim a refund. I can\u2019t access the online help centre \u2013 the phone number just cuts you off. How can I get my money back?</strong></p> <p><em><strong>SG, London</strong></em></p> <p>Apply directly to the airline because that\u2019s who your contract is with when you buy flights through a third-party booking platform. Airlines are prone to batting passengers back to the agent they booked through, but hold your ground. \u201cThe law is clear that the refund must be provided by the airline that was going to operate the flight and not the company that sold the flight,\u201d says Coby Benson of Bott and Co. \u201cIf an airline cancels a flight they are obliged to provide a full refund within seven days, or a free replacement flight at a later date (subject to availability). If passengers are not given the option of a refund then they should telephone customer services or put their request in writing, keeping copies.\u201d</p> <p>If the airline is offering refunds, you\u2019re lucky. The travel industry has ripped up the rule book, so far with impunity, in the wake of coronavirus and most carriers are now only offering credit notes to be used for future bookings.</p> <h2><strong>Who pays for my son working from home?</strong></h2> <p><strong>My son, who normally does not live with me, has moved back in, to \u201cwork from home\u201d because he doesn\u2019t have broadband at his house. Am I entitled to some sort of payment from his employer for providing internet, electricity, heating and facilities? I feel I am supporting an international telecoms company whose office overheads are now minimised. Apparently, staff have been told they will not be compensated because they are not paying travel costs.</strong></p> <p><em><strong>RH, Bolsover, Derbyshire</strong></em></p> <p>If the employer can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, pay expenses to its employees you don\u2019t have much hope there, although employers are allowed to pay staff \u00a36 a week tax free to those obliged to work from home during lockdown.</p> <p>However, HMRC has said it will consider claims from employees whose bosses won\u2019t contribute. It\u2019s nothing to get excited about. Your son can claim tax relief on \u00a36 a week, worth \u00a31.20 - \u00a32.40 a week depending on his tax rate. If he tried to claim any more than that, he\u2019d have to provide evidence. The internet is a non starter, though, since you\u2019re paying for it anyway.</p> <p>Should your son wish to return home, he could claim the cost from his employer of taking out a broadband contract if it was specifically for work. Hopefully, he\u2019ll then pass on the riches to you.</p> <h2><strong>Can I return a coat when the shop reopens?</strong></h2> <p><strong>I bought a coat back in the good old days of last month when high streets were open. It doesn\u2019t sit well on me and I meant to return it, but had to self isolate for 14 days, during which time stores were ordered to close. What happens to the right to return during lockdown?</strong></p> <p><em><strong>AD, Tunbridge Wells</strong></em></p> <p>For starters there is no statutory right to return unless the item is faulty or not as described. Refunds for a change-of heart or a mistaken size are offered as goodwill by retailers to keep shoppers coming back.</p> <p>That said, if returns were offered at the time of purchase, the option forms part of your contract with the retailer. Stores are still allowing customers to return unwanted stuff, but most have changed their policies.</p> <p>High street names are mostly requiring customers to wait until stores reopen. John Lewis, for instance, will honour returns for store purchases made on, or after, 18 February 2020 for up to 35 days after lockdown ends, although it will allow a further grace period for customers who have been self isolating.</p> <p>M&amp;S has extended its deadline to 90 days until further notice and will accept postal returns, while ShoeZone is allowing its customers 12 months. Shops are also extending the expiry date of gift cards by up to two years.</p> <h2><strong>How to prevent losing money paid for a package holiday?</strong></h2> <p><strong>I have a package holiday to Croatia booked with TUI for departure on 27 June. I have paid \u00a3400 deposit but the final payment of \u00a33,297.96 is now due. I am apprehensive about making this payment when it seems highly unlikely that this holiday will take place.</strong></p> <p><strong>If I were to pay in full, I would receive a full monetary refund and not just a voucher against any future TUI holiday. But if I fail to settle the final sum, TUI will cancel the holiday and my initial deposit will not be refunded. Telephone contact is proving practically impossible with excessive wait times of hours, not minutes, and it seems there is no way to make electronic contact via the TUI website.</strong></p> <p><em><strong>ET, Northwich</strong></em></p> <p>Since your holiday has not been cancelled (not yet, anyway) you\u2019d be unwise to withhold payment at this stage. If you failed to pay up, you are likely to be in breach of contract and would indeed risk forfeiting the deposit, or even being sued for loss of revenue, according to Aman Johal, director of Your Lawyers.</p> <p>You\u2019d have no chance of claiming on any travel insurance, either, if you were the one to cancel. TUI, which has only cancelled holidays due before mid May, is, however, offering holidaymakers with departure dates before 30 June to rebook for a later date without charge. The due date for the balance would then move, too.</p> <p>Otherwise, TUI says, holidays after 15 May are currently due to go ahead as normal and the balance must be paid. Following criticism, it has agreed to refund customers whose holidays are cancelled, but some tour operators are insisting on credit notes in the hope the government will amend the rules.</p> <p>Currently, Package Travel Regulations which govern any trip where two or more components are booked together, require a refund to be issued within 14 days if a tour operator cancels a trip. ABTA is lobbying ministers to extend the refund deadline to 31 July and to protect credit notes issued in lieu of cash.</p> <p>Meanwhile, it\u2019s taken matters into its own hands. Until recently ABTA\u2019s website promised any credit notes that are not redeemed by the end of July can be swapped for a refund; now it states that refunds can be claimed after they expire. It says: \u201cRefund credit notes should include an expiry date which is based on the travel company\u2019s financial protection arrangements. The coronavirus pandemic is an unprecedented, evolving situation and ABTA originally gave a 31 July deadline to provide some much needed structure. ABTA will contact any ABTA member if it regards the company\u2019s actions as being in breach of its Code of Conduct,\u201d ABTA says.</p>",

  "<p>A major British city should be used to trial mass testing as a way out of the coronavirus lockdown, according to a group of leading epidemiologists and public health experts.</p> <p>They warn that simply using periods of mass lockdowns and relaxations to control the virus could lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people before a vaccine becomes available \u201cwith the most disadvantaged groups experiencing the greatest suffering\u201d.</p> <p>Instead, the group states that one or more cities with a population of 200,000 to 300,000 \u2013 about a dozen ranging in size from Aberdeen to Bradford \u2013 should be used to trial a mass-testing programme.

Now the mining industry is trying to cut its payments to the fund that supports those affected.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier for us to get sick because of lung damage. We get colds easier. We pick up germs easier. It\u2019s something we deal with all of the time. But the Covid-19 has it doubled up on us,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cIt\u2019s made it that much worse.\u201d</p> <p>Robinson currently has an upper respiratory infection, which he develops a few times a year due to black lung. The last few years he spent in the mines before retiring, he regularly ate cough drops to try to alleviate his breathing issues. He tries to stay active, but finds himself increasingly short of breath and struggling to get air as his black lung progresses.</p> <p>It took several years for Robinson\u2019s federal black lung benefits claim to be accepted, and he\u2019s still going through court processes that will decide if he continues receiving his benefits for life, despite being diagnosed with the disease.</p> <p>While miners with black lung struggle during the pandemic, the coal industry is seeking to use the crisis to its advantage, cutting payouts to the federal black lung funds. Last month the National Mining Association <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/08/coal-black-lung-coronavirus/\">asked</a> Congress to decrease the excise tax that coal companies pay toward the fund by 55%. The federal black lung program, which pays out benefits to former coal miners diagnosed with the condition , has already faced financial problems in recent years in part due to coal companies filing for bankruptcy and <a href=\"https://www.kentucky.com/news/state/kentucky/article240666801.html\">shifting</a> millions of dollars in liabilities onto taxpayers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It scares the living daylights out of me.

They\u2019ll pat you on the back, give you \u2018attaboys\u2019 as long as you\u2019re working seven days a week, 12 to 14 hours a day, but once you get sick, then you\u2019re nobody. You made them millions but they don\u2019t want to do anything for you.\u201d</p> <p>Coal miners are also experiencing concerns over contracting Covid-19 while struggling with layoffs as some mines shut down because of the pandemic.</p> <p>Cy Robinette, a heavy equipment mechanic at a coal mine in Florence, Kentucky, for 30 years, was recently laid off due to the pandemic and hasn\u2019t been able to file a claim for unemployment benefits yet because of the state website\u2019s technical difficulties.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody is quarantined, there is no work to buy our food and to pay our bills. We\u2019re panicking over where our next meal is going to come from, how long this is going to last,\u201d said Robinette. \u201cIf we get this virus, we will die due to having black lung issues. We won\u2019t last but days or hours, but if it takes working and taking a chance catching the virus so it shall be. It has me at the end of my rope. I don\u2019t know what else I can do just to support my family. I feel like a failure that I can\u2019t work now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"98cd350c863d82976b014bd8762f672111d07477\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98cd350c863d82976b014bd8762f672111d07477/0_0_4200_2800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Bevins Branch Mine in Phelps, Kentucky, operates with about 100 miners.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bevins Branch Mine in Phelps, Kentucky, operates with about 100 miners.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Swensen/Jeff Swensen for The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At least <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/updates/upd-07-20-18.html\">one in 10</a> US coal miners who worked in mines for 25 years or more are diagnosed with black lung.

The 72-year-old was diagnosed with black lung in 1984.

I\u2019ve already got infected lungs, I don\u2019t want anything on top of it,\u201d said Bounds.</p> <p>He worked 48 to 54 hours a week underground in conditions, Bounds said, where the coal smog was sometimes so thick he couldn\u2019t see his hand in front of his face, even with his headlamp on.</p> <p>\u201cThere were a lot of times in the winter months that I wouldn\u2019t see daylight. I would go in before daylight and come in after dark,\u201d said Bounds. \u201cWhen I was diagnosed in 1984 with black lung, it was just a mild case and you always think you can fight this thing and make it better, but instead it gets worse.\u201d</p> <p>Black lung clinics across Appalachia have shut down due to coronavirus, with doctors insisting patients stay at home and conduct check-ups by phone or internet. New claims for federal black lung benefits and state exams have been put on hold.</p> <p>\u201cThis extra impairment would be enough to kill them which is why we\u2019re trying to be so careful in not having them in the clinic and encouraging them to stay at home, stay away from people so they don\u2019t get it because it would be much more difficult for someone like that to recuperate, if it\u2019s even possible,\u201d said Debbi Wills, a black lung clinic coordinator in West Virginia.</p> <p>Danny Fouts, a retired coal miner in Beaver, Kentucky who worked in the mines for 23 years and now suffers from black lung disease, has shifted his regular medical check-ups to phone or Skype.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been afraid of anything in my life. This is one time I\u2019m really worried about something,\u201d said Fouts. \u201cIf it\u2019s not my immediate family, I don\u2019t want them knocking on my door, I don\u2019t care who it is.

  "<p>Frank Herfort, a German photographer, has been working on a series of pictures he calls \u201cRussian fairytales\u201d for the past 15 years. He grew up in Leipzig and spent his childhood under communism, then his teens, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, under capitalism; he was fascinated to see familiar streetscapes colonised by advertising hoardings. His career has reflected that dichotomy. He has worked as a commercial photographer to fund an enduring fascination with the post-Soviet atmospheres of the east. When fellow art students relocated to London or Berlin after graduating, he settled in Moscow and began making photographs of the city\u2019s interiors, taking his Hasselblad camera into waiting rooms and tiled hotel lobbies and curious bars, alive to juxtaposition and surreal comedy.</p> <p>This picture was taken in the meadows on the banks of the River Moscow, on the fringe of the 850th anniversary park. The contrast in scale and tone between the picnicking mother and her toddler and the vast, foreboding architecture of the electricity pylons is typical of Herfort\u2019s work. He is drawn to scenes in which people innocently inhabit places slightly beyond their understanding, as if they have been dropped there from a different time and place altogether.</p> <p>There is something about what he calls the \u201cchaos and the lightness and good-naturedness of ordinary Russians\u201d that he tries to frame in different ways. The contrasts between the pictures he takes are as important as the contrasts within them. \u201cI was always interested in shooting single photographs,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich show worlds and stories in one image.\u201d He finds the classical reportage style, where you photograph 30 images of a story in series, too repetitive. \u201cI think you can skip the before, after and in between. This is for me photography, the art of using just one frame.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.kerberverlag.com/en/1809/frank-herfort\">Russian Fairytales by Frank Herfort</a> will be published by Kerber Verlag (\u00a336) later this spring</em></p>",

Professor Neil Mortensen, from the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said surgeons should not risk their health if fluid-repellent gowns or coveralls could not be used. \u201cWe are deeply disturbed by this latest change to personal protective equipment (PPE) guidance, which was issued without consulting expert medical bodies,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter weeks of working with PHE and our sister medical royal colleges to get PPE guidance right, this risks confusion and variation in practice across the country.\u201d</p> <p>Health unions warned that staff could begin to refuse to work if they felt the new guidelines put them at serious risk of contracting the coronavirus.

For all its many positives \u2013 who doesn\u2019t like mismatched furniture and a bowl of artisanal pork scratchings? \u2013 it\u2019s not been universally popular. Even the word \u201cgastropub\u201d infuriates some. Rob Shaw, the restaurateur behind brilliant stalwarts such as the <a href=\"http://www.anchorandhopepub.co.uk/\">Anchor and Hope</a> in London and Oxford\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.magdalenarms.co.uk/\">Magdalen Arms</a>, told me he found it \u201ccringe-worthy\u201d. Having raised boys through their teenage years, thus spending many meal times being told that most things I do are \u201ccringe-worthy\u201d, including breathing, I feel a certain fellowship with anything dismissed in such a way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d55609d0dcf11c6735d9c6c8bf53fe6b9c931166\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d55609d0dcf11c6735d9c6c8bf53fe6b9c931166/0_227_4796_2877/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Serious attention from the guide books\u2019: the Harwood Arms in Fulham, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Serious attention from the guide books\u2019: the Harwood Arms in Fulham, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I asked for a definition of the term from Ed Beddington, editor of pub trade journal the<em> Morning Advertiser</em>, which runs the 50 Best Gastropubs awards. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a pub that focuses heavily on food, but where you can still get a pint.\u201d That certainly describes the Eagle, even though it looked nothing like a standard London boozer. \u201cNowhere else had blackboard menus on the walls,\u201d says Tom Norrington-Davies, one of only three chefs to have run the kitchen there. \u201cThere were bare floorboards, no flock wallpaper, and it served a steak sandwich.\u201d Indeed it did: the <em>Guardian</em> was sustained by that extremely good value Portuguese-inspired bife ana: rump marinated in red wine, garlic and chilli, grilled and stuffed inside a crusty roll.</p> <p>Some insist the Eagle wasn\u2019t the first food pub. They point to places like the <a href=\"https://www.thewalnuttreeinn.com/\">Walnut Tree</a> near Monmouth where Franco Taruschio cooked boisterous rustic Italian dishes from 1963 until the early 1990s. But he had full waiter service. At the Eagle you placed your order at the crowded bar, elbow to rib, and marvelled at the staff\u2019s ability to find you in your corner of the crammed room.</p> <p>The Eagle\u2019s midwife was a change in the law, forcing the mega-breweries to divest themselves of a slab of their tied properties. Pubs suddenly became cheap. Here, then, was a business model: low rents, bare-bone fit-outs mostly involving a sander, and booze sales to subsidise the kitchen. Quickly, it caught on. These were indeed the braised lamb shank years. And the pork belly years. And the sausages in onion gravy years. Once humble, perhaps overlooked, ingredients got loving care and attention. Supermarkets would eventually launch gastropub ready-meal ranges based upon them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8fac4753633660a664ef92af290b74e06378bbde\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fac4753633660a664ef92af290b74e06378bbde/0_291_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Proper grub: oxtail, beef skirt and real ale suet pudding with olive oil mash and seasonal vegetables at the Cartford Inn, Little Eccleston, Lancashire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Proper grub: oxtail, beef skirt and real ale suet pudding with olive oil mash and seasonal vegetables at the Cartford Inn, Little Eccleston, Lancashire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The result was a very British kind of culture war: people who loved their old boozers complained that they were being cleansed from them by culinary gentrification that also made once cheap ingredients expensive. Meanwhile, middle-class tossers like me who\u2019d never felt especially comfortable in the saloon bar gave thanks that there was now a ready source of wasabi peas and over-oaked Chilean chardonnay.</p> <p>As ever, something more complex was going on. In 1999, self-taught chef Stephen Harris took over a blocky old pub overlooking the sea near Whitstable, called the <a href=\"http://thesportsmanseasalter.co.uk/\">Sportsman</a>. \u201cI was just a chef looking for somewhere to cook,\u201d he says now. A pub turned out to be a great idea. \u201cPersonally, I love eating out and everything that goes with it, but I think a lot of British people are inherently suspicious of restaurants with their fancy waiters and all that. The pub setting allows people to come in, have a pint and see what they think before committing.\u201d</p> <p>It also focused Harris\u2019s thoughts. \u201cI started out doing brushed-up country cooking.\u201d It was asparagus soup with a soft-boiled egg and soldiers, followed by braised pork belly stuffed with black pudding. \u201cI wanted to progress and refine, but I was aware of it being a pub. It was a constant tightrope walk.\u201d In 2005, he launched a tasting menu, complete with an intense crab risotto and a rhubarb and elderflower sorbet made from ingredients growing just outside the back door. In 2008, the Sportsman won a Michelin star. \u201cThe tasting menu was justified by everything coming from nearby,\u201d Harris says. \u201cIt was a pub serving its purpose as a local.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e2dfb470761128fc655c56464409dfe215e8b14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e2dfb470761128fc655c56464409dfe215e8b14/0_334_5120_3073/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It was a pub serving its purpose as a local\u2019: the Sportsman in Seasalter, Kent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was a pub serving its purpose as a local\u2019: the Sportsman in Seasalter, Kent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other pubs got serious attention from the guides: there was the <a href=\"https://angelhetton.co.uk/\">Angel at Hetton</a> and in London the <a href=\"https://harwoodarms.com/\">Harwood Arms</a> with its look-at-me venison scotch eggs. But for most food pubs the ambitions have always remained more modest. Outside of urban areas, Britain\u2019s gastropubs have become the equivalent of France\u2019s country inns, a source of reliable, unchallenging food: a terrine or risotto to start; a sea bass or pork belly dish for mains; a chocolate fondant, a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e or a lemon tart to finish. This, now, is Britain\u2019s standard menu. Elsewhere, the pub has simply become a vessel for great food. At one point, a bunch of central London pubs installed Thai chefs. Both west London and Birmingham have seen the rise of Desi pubs, offering stonking tandoori grills, curries and roti.</p> <p>But, like the Harwood Arms\u2019s scotch egg, there\u2019s always a place for traditional pub food, re-engineered to be so much better than the originals. At Lancashire\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thecartfordinn.co.uk/\">Cartford Inn</a> I swooned over their oxtail, beef skirt and suet pudding and declared it the exemplar of a style that should be called, with Wildean wit, Gravy Moderne. Something similar has long been going on at the <a href=\"https://www.parkersarms.co.uk/\">Parker\u2019s Arms</a> near Clitheroe, where chef Stosie Madi makes a killer black pudding sausage roll and, to finish, a wet nelly tart with custard on the side. Yes. And please. In short, the gastropub is now whatever we want it to be. As Stephen Harris says, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you serve, as long as you do it well.\u201d And the Eagle\u2019s bife ana steak sandwich? That has survived these past 29 years. As has the marriage. Who doesn\u2019t love a bit of continuity?</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p><br>Many gastropubs are now running food take-away and delivery services.

  "<p>Covid-19 has changed how we interact as a society. But it is harder to know what the repercussions will be for international trade. The prospectus for Brexit was based, in part, on the trading opportunities waiting to be seized by \u201cglobal Britain\u201d. How does Covid-19 change the balance of risks and opportunities that face us?</p> <p>The impact of the pandemic on international trade is likely to outlive the health crisis. According to the World Trade Organization, world trade may fall by 32% this year. To put this into context, trade fell 40% in the first three years of the 1930s Great Depression. This time, the fall in trade is self-induced, to save lives. But the contagiousness of Covid-19 exposes vulnerabilities in the trading system.</p> <p>Economies, like societies, are complex networks of direct and indirect relationships. We may be fairly confident in the health of our immediate trading partners, but as important is the health of the partners they trade with. Covid-19 causes deep problems. Supply chains locate production across the world to maximise efficiency. Unsurprisingly, the WTO expects trade to fall more in sectors with complex value chains.</p> <p>Equally, the movement of people is fundamental to how we trade services. We have to set up a shop, attract students or locate management. Eight out of 10 UK jobs are in the services sector. Services account for about half our total trade. Yet travel restrictions now apply in 150 countries. They are likely to be lifted slowly, as some nations control the pandemic more quickly than others. Early signs are not encouraging. JP Morgan\u2019s global purchasing managers index shows the fall in services export orders much greater than for manufactured goods.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The contagiousness of Covid-19 exposes vulnerabilities in the trading system</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Our ability to specialise creates the gains from trade, but it has also created a vulnerability. The WTO rules permit temporary export prohibitions to relieve critical shortages. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/trade-symptoms-pandemic\">40 nations</a> have introduced export restrictions on medical equipment. Trade specialist Simon Evenett calls these <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SimonEvenett/status/1246793589050540033\">sicken-thy-neighbour</a> policies. What will this do for trust and reciprocation after the heath crisis has passed?</p> <p>The impact of the pandemic on global trade, in other words, might well be longer term. Beata Javorcik, the chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, has pointed out that resilience will in future be a key concern for businesses, which might imply some degree of reshoring and potentially moving away from holding near-zero inventories so as to hedge against the possibility of future disruptions to supply chains. The chief executive of Bosch has expressed concern about the future of the company\u2019s supply chain.</p> <p>In times of economic hardship, the temptation to turn inwards and play the nationalism card has proved too tempting.</p> <p>Which brings us to Brexit. The transition period agreed in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/24/sombre-eu-leaders-sign-brexit-withdrawal-agreement\">EU withdrawal agreement</a> and passed by parliament in January provides for frictionless access to the European market and its trading partners until 31 December. This is why leaving the EU has changed relatively little on the ground. The government has until 30 June to decide whether to request and pass legislation allowing an extension of the transition period by one or two years, or leave the single market and customs union by year end, with or without a trade deal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In times of economic hardship, the temptation to turn inwards and play the nationalism card has proved too tempting</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some argue that the pandemic strengthens the case to end transition, to free us to sign new free trade agreements around the world in order to revive our recuperating economy. This requires us to rediscover our competitive spirit and reach a mutually favourable agreement with the US and the other nations that will follow.</p> <p>However, these arguments are unpersuasive. Essentially, they amount to sacrificing our existing trading relationship with the EU, accounting for about half our total trade, for hypothetical and problematic future deals with the US and others in very short order. Given the uncertainty about the future of world trade, this would be a risky moment to make trade with by far our biggest trading partner more difficult, while pinning our hopes on being able to increase trade with the rest of the world.</p> <p>The disruption caused by the pandemic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/brexit-uk-plan-to-secure-trade-deal-by-december-is-fantasy-says-eu\">makes it unlikely</a> that a comprehensive free trade agreement between the UK and EU can be secured before the transition period ends. Surely, under such circumstances, it makes sense to take advantage of the opportunity to extend afforded us by the withdrawal agreement? This certainly seems to be the view of the British public: twice as many think the prime minister should amend his 31 December deadline than do not. Of course, there is a political rationale for the government to fulfil its promise to deliver the end of transition on time. Yet, given what the pandemic has done \u2013 and may yet do - to the global economy, there\u2019s an equally strong, if not stronger, practical one for reconsidering.</p> <p>\u2022 Anand Menon is director of <a href=\"https://ukandeu.ac.uk/\">The UK in a Changing Europe</a></p> <p>\u2022 Angus Armstrong is director of the <a href=\"https://www.rebuildingmacroeconomics.ac.uk/about-us\">Rebuilding Macroeconomics</a> network, NIESR</p>",

We need an overhaul of these standards that must recognise the adverse health effects of lack of space and crowding, including the spread of infectious diseases, unintentional injuries and mental ill health.</p> <p>Prof Gabriel Scally, quoted in the article, is right: the housing market has led to the modern equivalent of the Victorian slums that the new diseases will just love.

Along with many others who have regarded Johnson\u2019s elevation with concern for the future of this country, I am glad that he is recovering from his brush with Covid-19. But his attitude to illness, and the sense of invulnerability with which he appears to have been imbued, would help to explain the cavalier way in which he conducted himself immediately before his positive test for the virus, engaging widely with people from whom a safe distance should have been kept.</p> <p>Further, his attitude must have some bearing on the question of why the government seems to have been slow to appreciate the seriousness of the virus, disregarding the lessons we should have learned from the example offered by other countries.<br><strong>Christopher Martin</strong><br>Bristol<br></p> <p>\u201cThe reaction of the world\u2019s most notable billionaires has been commendable,\u201d you say (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/12/treasury-bank-of-england-ways-and-means-facility-debt-mountain\" title=\"\">Austerity is out of the question: the wealthiest must help pay for this crisis</a>\u201d, Business leader).

The wealthiest must indeed share the cost of the crisis according to their means but far better they are made to do this through a fair and progressive tax system to which everyone contributes and which incorporates harsh penalties for serial avoiders.

I volunteer as a reading helper with Coram Beanstalk, which provides one-to-one literacy support, in a primary school and often suggest to the children that they ask their parents to turn on the television subtitles at home, as this helps with their reading. This also benefits children from families whose first language is not English.</p> <p>My wife and I are both deaf and always use subtitled TV at home. Our two hearing daughters have grown up to accept this as normal and they often continue to use subtitles from habit now they are in their twenties, even though they do not need them.</p> <p>The lockdown has highlighted the need to use all possible tools to improve literacy.
