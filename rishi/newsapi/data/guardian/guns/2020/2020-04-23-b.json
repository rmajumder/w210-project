Research shows that remittances help alleviate poverty in lower- and middle-income (LCMI) countries, and are linked with reductions in malnutrition, child labour, and missed school in disadvantaged households.<br><br>The dramatic fall will be felt sharply after a record $554bn was sent to LMICs in remittances in 2019 - overtaking foreign investment for the first time. The latter is predicted to drop by a whopping 35% next year, which means the decline in weekly or monthly money transfers to struggling families in countries such as Guatemala, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, and Ukraine will hit communities hard. The unprecedented crash in crude oil prices will also add to the woes.<br><br>The biggest falls are expected in Europe and Central Asia (27.5%), followed by Sub-Saharan Africa (23.1%), South Asia (22.1%), the Middle East and North Africa (19.6%), Latin America and the Caribbean (19.3%), and East Asia and the Pacific (13%).<br><br>On the bright-ish side, the World Bank reckons that remittances will recover slightly by 2021, to rise by an estimated 5.6% to $470 billion. But - and there are a lot of buts - this depends on how the pandemic evolves across the globe during the rest of the year, and the measures implemented to mitigate the spread of the virus. Also, remittance flows are typically counter-cyclical, as migrant workers tend to send more money to their families in times of crisis and hardship back home. But, this pandemic is truly global, and so is the economic fall-out.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T19:49:17.299Z\">at 8.49pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea1ec508f08eb2f433f562f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jasonburke\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T19:34:25.542Z\">8.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jason Burke</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s Africa correspondent, has written this dispatch on how <strong>South Africa</strong> will begin to ease its lockdown:</p> \n  <p>South Africa\u2019s president <strong>Cyril Ramaphosa</strong> spoke to the nation for the second time in three days on Thursday night, giving 56 million people the good news that the very strict lockdown that they have endured for nearly month would be lifted at the end of the month, but undoubtedly disappointing some by making it very clear that changes to the lives of many would not be substantial.</p> \n  <p>So far South Africa, which has been praised for its pro-active strategy of screening and testing to contain the Covid-19 virus, has nearly 4,000 confirmed cases and has suffered 75 deaths.

But from May 1st South Africa will move to level four, which will allow \u201csome activity to resume subject to extreme precautions\u201d. </p> \n  <p>Few further details were immediately available though Ramaphosa mentioned the phased reopening of schools. The country\u2019s borders will remain shut however. Level three would allow some social activities, but even level two would mean a continuing ban on religious services, sporting events, concerts, cinema and similar gatherings. </p> \n  <p>Ramaphosa stressed the risk of a new surge of infections, and though the president did not mention the coming winter, experts have repeatedly warned that the month ahead are likely to be difficult. Very significant restrictions look set to remain in place for six months at least. </p> \n  <p>\u201cLet us stay strong and united,\u201d Ramaphosa, a popular leader who took power in 2018 and won an election last year, said. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T19:37:04.367Z\">at 8.37pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea1e3698f08eb2f433f55eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T19:24:41.881Z\">8.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Dubai</strong> has become the latest city to ease lockdown restrictions, announcing that cafes and restaurants are to reopen with a maximum capacity of 30 per cent. </p> \n  <p>Reuters reports public transportation services, including the subway, will resume from 26 April.

And amid a global pandemic, this year\u2019s month of fasting and reflection for the world\u2019s Muslims will be very different, writes <strong>Martin Chulov</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s Middle East editor.</p> \n  <p>Normally a sociable time, where abstaining from food and water during daylight hours gives way to sumptuous meals and gatherings at dusk, the 2020 rituals have been modified to fit public health directives that urge people to maintain a distance from each other while the coronavirus remains active. </p> \n  <p>Mosques will remain closed to evening prayers and feasting will become a more intimate affair, within the confines of family homes. Large public banquets, provided by authorities, or benefactors, have been outlawed in much of the Islamic world, where curfews and lockdowns remain rigidly enforced.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a06a0dd4eff7e5113090a2a67612eabcec73d27e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a06a0dd4eff7e5113090a2a67612eabcec73d27e/0_0_2691_1815/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man uses a monocular during a gathering on the roof of Al Musariin mosque in Jakarta, Indonesia, to watch for the moon to mark the first day of Ramadan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man uses a monocular during a gathering on the roof of Al Musariin mosque in Jakarta, Indonesia, to watch for the moon to mark the first day of Ramadan</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Willy Kurniawan/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Ahead of the fast there was even discussion about whether going without sustenance for much of the day may have an effect on immunity \u2013 and hence people\u2019s capacity to fight off Covid-19. However, with no clarity about whether this is the case, and evidence to support the contrary \u2013 that fasting may in fact be beneficial \u2013 the premise of this year\u2019s Ramadan remains unchanged.</p> \n  <p>\u201cMuslim religious authorities around the world are advocating wide restrictions on gatherings, in or out of mosques, as a result of the corona pandemic,\u201d said Dr HA Hellyer, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cThe mosques will remain virtually closed; the usual charity meal tables will be absent from the streets; and the frequent family socialising associated with Ramadan will be suspended.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Ramadan under lockdown is the antithesis of the festival. But, as Covid-19 took hold in the lead up to the fast, religious authorities and governments remained determined to ban congregational activities \u2013 a move that could deny the impoverished more than the chance to socialise. Charity is also an important part of the month, with cash, food and other donations regularly given to those with few means to afford them.</p> \n  <p>Mosques across the Middle East and north Africa \u2013 in Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Jordan, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 have largely been shuttered throughout the crisis and will not offer shelter or seclusion to those fasting this year. </p> \n  <p>Some regional states have amended their curfew times to make it easier for people to shop during fasting hours. Coronavirus has even taken a toll on traditional Ramadan TV fare, with social distancing disrupting filming in the run-up, leaving shows unfinished. Clerical bodies, meanwhile, have encouraged people to embrace this year\u2019s restrictions by focusing on close family members.</p> \n  <p>In a statement earlier this month, Egypt\u2019s Grand Mufti, Shawki Allam, said: \u201cWe must look to the positive aspects during these exceptional times that have compelled many people to be quarantined in their homes and turn this into an opportunity for bonding and forgiveness and restoring the spirit of serenity and cooperation.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T12:59:57.722Z\">at 1.59pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea180ea8f08a1178d5b0551\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T12:02:56.601Z\">1.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In most of the world, medical staff have been lauded as heroes for their response to the coronavirus pandemic.

He also said that children or adolescents with a fever or symptoms consistent with the coronavirus should stay at home in quarantine.</p> \n  <p>The deputy prime minister also asked children in Spain to forgive the confusion the government had caused on Tuesday after it said children would be allowed out only to accompany a parent to buy food or medicine. A huge public outcry resulted in a u-turn within hours, and the government insisting that children would have more room to roam.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI want to say sorry because over the past few days and hours, the government hasn\u2019t been as clear as it could have been when it came to explaining how you\u2019ll be allowed to go out for walks with your families from Sunday,\u201d said Iglesias. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI know this confinement hasn\u2019t been at all easy for you - you\u2019ve had to stop going to school and seeing your teachers and friends.

The bracken, which smothers competitors, has already started growing again, and would have been cut back this week.</p> <p>Himalayan balsam is also a concern. The ecologically damaging flower can grow up to a height of three metres (10ft) in one spring and summer season. But annual \u201cbalsam bashing\u201d events by staff and volunteers have been halted.</p> <p>Five years of intensive work to clear brambles and scrub from two historic wildflower meadows at Cwm Colhuw nature reserve in Wales could now be undone. A spokesperson said: \u201cIf no management is continued on this site then very quickly, within 12 months, we will see scrub and brambles taking over once again and a decline of wildlife.\u201d</p> <p>Precious heathland in Surrey reserves cannot be grazed, due to social distancing and movement restrictions. Managed grazing by livestock can benefit heathland, creating a mosaic of differing habitats. Without that complexity various creatures will be put at risk, including birds such as the nightjar and woodlark, and reptiles including smooth snakes and sand lizards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02a69102a45fbe5bcab38ce5efd44c65eec1face\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02a69102a45fbe5bcab38ce5efd44c65eec1face/0_23_5349_3209/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nesting gannets on Alderney.

Oprah Winfrey given free rein over whatever form and content she likes. And now Captain America in Defending Jacob. The Apple TV+ policy of securing big names for splashy projects to highlight the new streaming platform\u2019s presence in an overcrowded market shows no sign of faltering.</p> <p>A heavily bearded Chris Evans has set aside his shield (and razor) to play assistant district attorney and devoted family man Andy Barber. He has, in the manner of all standard American TV crime series, an implausibly muscular frame beneath his expensive suit, a noble mien and a thin, loving wife (Michelle Dockery) with mandated wife-length hair (below the shoulder, stopping just short of lower-mid-back) and a sweetly caring job that embeds her deeply in their community (running a charity residential centre for traumatised children).</p> <p>You can be sure they would both socially distance responsibly in a pandemic. Their son Jacob (Jaeden Martell) stops gaming when told, keeps on top of his homework and, if he nurtures a passion for The Catcher in the Rye and slightly fancies himself a Holden Caulfield \u2013 well, he\u2019s young. You just have to wait these things out.</p> <p>But the story opens with Andy facing indictment by a grand jury. \u201cI believe in the system,\u201d he insists. \u201cI just want the truth to come out.\u201d</p> <p>The Barbers\u2019 perfect life, it turns out, has been upended by the arrest of Jacob for the murder of Ben Rifkin, a fellow student at his high school who was stabbed in nearby woods. What began as apparent mudslinging on social media \u2013 \u201cEveryone knows you did it,\u201d runs a post; \u201cYou have a knife. I\u2019ve seen it\u201d \u2013 was transformed into something quite different with the discovery of Jacob\u2019s fingerprint on the label of the sweatshirt Ben was wearing when he died.</p> <p>Before the print was discovered, however, Andy found and disposed of the knife that Jacob did indeed own. Just to have, the boy tells his parents. Just to be cool. They are shocked and disappointed, but that doesn\u2019t mean they contemplate that he could be the killer. Questions of the son\u2019s guilt and the father\u2019s complicity (given a further twist by Andy\u2019s own troubled childhood and a floating anxiety about the sins of the one being visited on the other) thicken the dramatic stew nicely, even if it does feel like one we\u2019ve been served many times before.</p> <p>The script needs more seasoning. People say things such as: \u201cDon\u2019t you dare shut me out right now!\u201d and \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you wouldn\u2019t do for him?\u201d in between giving brave nods to cop and lawyer friends who are Just Doing Their Jobs as the machinery of the law clanks into motion around them.</p> <p>What does mark Defending Jacob out, as the eight-episode series wears on, is its detailed, intimate portrayal of a family under pressure, as the parents become pariahs in the town and doubts about Jacob\u2019s innocence erode their resilience from within. At times, it becomes as much a mood piece as a thriller. Dockery brings out Laurie\u2019s inherent brittleness as she wrestles with potential outcomes and realises that the supposedly unconditional love of a mother for her child might be tested to the utmost.</p> <p>Martell treads such a fine line between ordinary teenage reserve and possibly sociopathic detachment that you cannot guess which way the plot will jump. And Evans is great as the lawyer who can hardly believe what is happening to him \u2013 and still less the fact that he cannot right it by sheer brute force of brainpower and will. Arguably, Evans\u2019 star wattage has tended to be a little dimmer than others in his cohort (he\u2019s outshone by most of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/25/guardians-of-the-galaxy-chris-pratt\">the other Chrisses\u2019</a> charisma for a start) and it\u2019s always made sense that he was cast as Marvel\u2019s blandest superhero, but on the small screen his star quality is compressed and he becomes that much more compelling. Or it may just be the beard.</p> <p>Approached as a crime drama, Defending Jacob might seem a little slow and underbaked, but as an ensemble character piece it hits the mark.

A guide to your video-conferencing options</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI am proud to reach this step in our 90-day plan, but this is just the beginning,\u201d Eric Yuan, the company\u2019s chief executive officer, said in a call on Wednesday. \u201cWe will earn our customers\u2019 trust and deliver them happiness with our unwavering focus on providing the most secure platform.\u201d</p> <p>Zoom has struggled to meet security needs as the platform has scaled up its user base to unprecedented levels in recent months.</p> <p>Since the coronavirus lockdown, Zoom\u2019s daily active users shot up from around 10 million to 300 million as people use the platform for happy hours, work meetings, support groups and even funerals.</p> <p>Users struggled with persistent \u201cZoom-bombing\u201d, a new kind of attack in which bad actors enter video meetings and shout slurs and threats in an attempt to disrupt them. Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings were targeted in particular.</p> <p>Zoom 5.0 will allow hosts to \u201creport a user\u201d to Zoom with a new security button and the app now defaults users to a \u201cwaiting room\u201d feature, which requires participants to be approved to enter a meeting. All meetings will now require a password to enter.</p> <p>Zoom also added a new encryption standard, called AES 256-bit GCM encryption, <a href=\"https://proprivacy.com/guides/aes-encryption\">which is considered</a> the \u201cgold standard\u201d of encryption and is used by the US government to secure data.</p> <p>The change will help prevent meetings from being hijacked by hackers, said Thomas Hatch, the co-founder and chief technology officer of Utah-based software firm <a href=\"http://www.saltstack.com/\">SaltStack</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe encryption that has been introduced improves the liability that existed before where video conferences could be hijacked out of line,\u201d he said. \u201cThis adds a much better layer of privacy that was not present before.\u201d</p> <p>In addition to Zoom bombing concerns, the app had also received criticism over major bugs in recent months, including <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/don-reisinger/zoom-bug-gives-hackers-full-control-over-computers.html\">one that would allow</a> a hacker to take full control over the user\u2019s computer. To address these concerns, Zoom has <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/zoom-to-revamp-bug-bounty-program-bring-in-more-security-experts/\">beefed up</a> its bug bounty program, incentivizing security professionals to alert them to bugs before hackers can exploit them.</p> <p>In a call on Wednesday, Yuan reiterated that Zoom will not sell user data. Zoom had been forced to change its policies around data sale after a story from Motherboard at Vice revealed Zoom <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/k7e599/zoom-ios-app-sends-data-to-facebook-even-if-you-dont-have-a-facebook-account\">sends data</a> from users of its iOS app to Facebook for advertising purposes, even if the user does not have a Facebook account.</p> <p>Zoom is not the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/08/zoom-privacy-video-chat-alternatives\">only video conferencing</a> platform, but it is easily one of the most popular. That is largely because of how easy it is to use, said Hank Schless, a senior manager at tech security firm <a href=\"https://www.lookout.com/\">Lookout</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe widespread use of conferencing solutions like Zoom shows how people are OK with putting convenience ahead of security,\u201d he said. \u201cZoom got a lot of attention because users were not turning on many of its security settings. Despite that, they continue to log in every day because they assume the likelihood of being a victim is too low to affect them.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 24 April 2020 to clarify that Zoom\u2019s new encryption standard is not encrypted end-to-end.</p></li> </ul>",

In other cases, the test centre, which is about 12 miles south-west of central London, was unable to ring through with the diagnosis because of a failure to record correct phone numbers.</p> \n<p>In an email written in early April, and seen by the Guardian, the chief executive of Epsom hospital said: \u201cDeloitte who have been commissioned by the Department of Health directly for this are not running this as well as we would like \u2026 [We] are asking whether we can take over the running of the Chessington centre because we really need it to work much better than it is.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is understood that the request to remove the firm was made in the first week of April, but that it was set aside after performance improved.</p> \n<p>The Department for Health said late Thursday that 49 people had experienced delays, and 39 had now received their results. The ministry said it would continue to investigate the remainder and offer any workers still waiting a new test.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are also implementing further processes within the department to ensure rapid investigation of outstanding test results that are not provided to those tested within 48 hours,\u201d a spokesman said.</p> \n<p>However, Epsom hospital stopped sending staff to Chessington 10 days ago after finding a more convenient alternative, it said. Staff are now swabbed at work and the samples sent to the laboratory at St George\u2019s hospital, south London for analysis.</p> \n<p>Epsom could soon be able to do the analysis itself, having ordered four machines made by <a href=\"https://pharmafield.co.uk/healthcare/rapid-covid-19-diagnostic-test-to-be-deployed-in-hospitals/\">a company spun out from Cambridge University</a>, which can complete the process in 90 minutes.</p> \n<p>The Chessington centre\u2019s problems appear not to have been entirely resolved. A paramedic for the south-east coast ambulance service, who asked not to be named, said he had been tested along with a group of colleagues on 3 April. They were still waiting to hear from Chessington.</p> \n<p>\u201cNone of us from my place of work, tested on that Friday, have had our results,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were told our samples were taken to a lab in Southampton. It\u2019s three weeks since the test and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever going to get the result. No one\u2019s been in touch other than my managers to say they\u2019re chasing it.\u201d</p> \n<p>The paramedic questioned the involvement of Deloitte, which specialises in management consultancy, tax and accounting but has little experience in running public services. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what is essentially an accountancy company can bring to this.\u201d</p> \n<p>A doctor at Epsom hospital, who was among the first to be tested at the end of March while self-isolating at home with symptoms, said she was still waiting to hear; after making enquiries she was told Deloitte could only release information to the person being tested, and not the organisation referring them. She has since been tested by her hospital. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Get%20in%20touch&amp;description=Do%20you%20have%20information%20about%20this%20story%3F%20Email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Ajuliette.garside%40theguardian.com%22%3Ejuliette.garside%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20Signal%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447584640566%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20%2B44%207584%20640566.%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"The Guardian is investigating how the UK government prepared for \u2013 and is responding to \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic.

But it\u2019s much more convenient for our staff to be swabbed [at the] Epsom and St Helier sites, and for us to send the swabs to St George\u2019s for testing. This means our staff don\u2019t have to travel to Chessington and also means the facility has more capacity for other parts of the health and care system.\u201d</p> \n<p>Normally, government contracts over a certain value are advertised publicly and awarded after a competitive tender.</p> \n<p>However, it is understood that the health department appointed Deloitte without competition, under an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/procurement-policy-note-0120-responding-to-covid-19\">obscure piece of legislation introduced in 2015</a> which ministries have been told they can use during the pandemic to avoid lengthy tendering processes.</p> \n<p>A Deloitte spokesman said: \u201cDeloitte, alongside many other public and private sector partners, is supporting DHSC (the Department of Health and Social Care) to help accelerate and scale testing capacity for the national Covid-19 testing programme.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Remdesivir, a drug thought to be one of the best prospects for treating Covid-19, failed to have any effect in the first full trial, it has been revealed.</p> \n<p>The drug is in short supply globally because of the excitement it has generated. It is one of the drugs Donald Trump claimed was \u201cpromising\u201d.</p> \n<p>In a \u201cgold standard\u201d trial of 237 patients, some of whom received remdesivir while others did not, the drug did not work. </p> \n<p>News of the failure was posted on a World Health Organization clinical trials database, but later removed. A WHO spokesman said it had been uploaded too soon by accident.</p> \n<p>\u201cA draft document was provided by the authors to WHO and inadvertently posted on the website and taken down as soon as the mistake was noticed. The manuscript is undergoing peer review and we are waiting for a final version before WHO comments,\u201d said Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesperson.</p> \n<p>The drug, made by the US company Gilead Sciences, is an antiviral that was trialled in Ebola, but which failed to show benefits in Africa.</p> \n<p>In the race for drugs that might work against Covid-19, many doctors have given remdesivir to patients on \u201ccompassionate grounds\u201d without waiting for trials. Because of the interest in it, the world\u2019s biggest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/world-biggest-drug-trial-covid-19-uk\">trial of possible treatments for Covid-19 </a>at Oxford has not been able to include it, because researchers could not obtain supplies.</p> \n<p>The trial of the drug in China, on patients with severe Covid-19 symptoms, may give some doctors pause. Gilead, however, claimed there were still signs that it could be useful, possibly in patients with milder versions of disease.</p> \n<p>In the trial, 158 patients were randomly assigned to be given remdesivir, while 79 others had standard care with a placebo instead. There was no difference between the groups with respect to recovery time. Just under 14% of those on remdesivir died, compared with nearly 13% of those not taking the treatment.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn this study of hospitalised adult patients with severe Covid-19, [which] was terminated prematurely, remdesivir was not associated with clinical or virological benefits,\u201d said the report on the WHO website.</p> \n<p>The report added: \u201cRemdesivir was stopped early in 18 (11.6%) patients because of adverse effects, compared with 4 (5.1%) in the control group.\u201d There were no details in the short report of the side effects.</p> \n<p>Just a week ago, it emerged that researchers in Chicago were excited by the results of a Gilead-run trial of remdesivir in 125 patients. Nearly all those people were discharged within a week, <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/16/early-peek-at-data-on-gilead-coronavirus-drug-suggests-patients-are-responding-to-treatment/\">according to STAT News</a>, which follows the pharmaceutical industry. However, there was no placebo group, which meant researchers could not be sure that it was the drug that made the difference, and not something else.</p> \n<p>Remdesivir is one of a handful of drugs that have been enthusiastically backed by doctors and politicians as potential cures for Covid-19. There has also been a rush to give patients hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic version of the antimalarial chloroquine. That has led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/vital-drug-people-lupus-coronavirus-covid-19-link-hydroxychloroquine\">shortages for people who need to take it for lupus</a>, a disease that affects the immune system.</p> \n<p>Scientists who want to see proper trials conducted are likely to point to the remdesivir trial failure as strong evidence of the dangers of giving out even tested drugs on compassionate grounds for a disease that is so novel.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qV7R2iYVXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 April 2020.

Some of the details include: crucial behaviours such physical distancing and hand-washing will remain essential; those most at risk will continue to be shielded; workplaces and education settings would need to be redesigned to enable proper physical distancing; restrictions could be lifted and then re-imposed at short notice; and restrictions are likely to be lifted in stages. The priority, it says, is minimising overall harm. The report earned <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> praise from the likes of <strong>George</strong> <strong>Osborne</strong>, the former Tory chancellor, who said the UK government should \u201ctreat the public like adults\u201d by adopting the same approach. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a7b32ef7-ef5f-45ef-ab0b-ba210ae4dbb2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FKcS4PNAko0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-testing-to-be-offered-to-england-key-workers-and-families\">Essential workers will be able to book their own free tests online from Friday</a>, Matt Hancock announced.</strong> The health secretary said key workers will be able to go on the gov.uk website to book tests for themselves and their relatives, the whole process will be free and the results will be sent out by text. He added that anyone unable to go online can book through their employer.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK government is introducing a contact tracing app and is also recruiting 18,000 people to work on manual contact tracing.</strong> Hancock said this figure would include 3,000 clinicians and the 18,000 workers would be trained over the coming weeks. The former Tory health secretary <strong>Jeremy </strong><strong>Hunt</strong>, who has led calls for the implementation of a mass contact tracing programme, said the announcement signalled \u201ca clear exit route from the lockdown\u201d. </li> \n   <li><strong>48 mobile laboratories are planned to be up and running to help the testing effort by the end of the month, the lobby briefing heard.</strong> The PM\u2019s spokesman said there are four already operating as well as 28 drive-through testing centres. The plan is for this to be extended to 48 by the end of April and for each testing centre to have a mobile lab attached to it. </li> \n   <li><strong>Around a quarter of firms may have halted trading since the lockdown, findings from an ONS survey suggested.</strong> But only 0.3% said they had permanently ceased trading. Since the lockdown was announced on 23 March, 82% of firms surveyed in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector said they had temporarily stopped trading. Among businesses still trading, 93% said turnover was lower than normal, and 60% said they had sufficient financial resources available. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>And that\u2019s it for today.

Physical distancing, hand hygiene, and other critical behaviours will be essential in each sector. We will engage with experts in each sector to understand the practical consequences, for example, of what physical distancing would mean for schools and education, transport, business, and recreation. The capacity of business and industry to innovate to find different ways to function will be critical here.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>It says those most at risk will continue to have to be shielded.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Some form of continued shielding to protect those who are most at risk will almost certainly be required as restrictions are lifted.

These are likely to include the easing of restrictions in a phased manner, opening up different parts of the economy sector by sector, considering different restrictions in different areas dependent on how the pandemic is progressing, and considering options for different groups of the population \u2013 as is currently the case with those shielded for clinical reasons. It may be that restrictions on some outdoor activity are eased before those on indoor activities - however, all of this will be evidence led.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>It says restrictions could be lifted, but then re-imposed.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Our plans to respond and recover must take account of the possibility of a cycle of lifting and re-imposing restrictions. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>According to some of the briefing coming out of No 10, this is one option London is particularly keen to avoid.

Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Fifty mobile laboratories are planned to help the coronavirus testing effort, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said</strong>. He said four mobile laboratories were already operating, including in Teesside, the Isle of Wight and Salford. There are 28 drive-through testing centres already open, and the government wants to extend that to 50 by the end of the month. The spokesman said the plan was for every testing centre to have a mobile laboratory attached to it. He also said that Amazon was being used to deliver testing kits to some people who needed them at home.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that there was still a \u201cgreat deal more to do\u201d on testing. </strong>The capacity for testing has reached 48,273 tests a day, he said. But the latest daily figure for the number of tests carried out (in the 24-hour period up to 9am yesterday) is 22,814 tests. The number of people tested in that period was just 13,522. (Some people need to be tested twice.) The spokesman said that 111,637 NHS and care workers and their relatives in total have been tested - up more than 10,000 on the previous day\u2019s total. The government is committed to getting the number of tests carried out up to 100,000 a day by the end of this month.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman confirmed reports saying that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-test-immunity-antibodies-government-study-covid-19-matt-hancock-ons-a9479416.html\">the government is recruiting 20,000 households to take part in antibody testing</a> to establish how widespread coronavirus infection has been in the population.</strong> Eventually the study aims to cover 300,000 people over the course of year, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>No 10 played down the prospect of an early announcement about a new policy on wearing masks.</strong> The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said that Sage, the scientific advisory group for emergencies, has finalised its latest advice, but the recommendation has only just gone to ministers and they will review it before a decision is announced. A formal announcement now seems unlikely before the end of the week.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the NHS England staff absence rate linked to coronavirus was now 4.2% for doctors and 8.3% for nurses, down from 4.4% and 8.4% respectively the previous day, and 6.6% and 9.5% respectively on 4 April.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson spoke to Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, yesterday, the spokesman said.</strong> And Johnson also had an audience with the Queen by telephone. The spokesman said that Johnson continued to receive regular updates on government business. But he was still not doing government work, the spokesman claimed.

26-page document (pdf) </a>summarises the Scottish government\u2019s approach as follows:</p> \n  <p><strong>Suppress</strong> the virus through compliance with physical distancing and hygiene measures, ensuring that the reproduction number remains below 1 and that the NHS remains within capacity.</p> \n  <p><strong>Care</strong> for those who need it, whether infected by the virus or not.</p> \n  <p><strong>Support</strong> people, business and organisations affected by the crisis.</p> \n  <p><strong>Recover </strong>to a new normal, carefully easing restrictions when safe to do so while maintaining necessary measures and ensuring that transmission remains controlled, supported by developments in medicine and technology.</p> \n  <p><strong>Protect </strong>against this and future pandemics, including through effective testing, contact tracing and isolation.</p> \n  <p><strong>Renew</strong> the country, building a fairer and more sustainable economy and society.</p> \n  <p>It warns the public to expect a cycle of lifting and re-imposing restrictions, with the possibility of restrictions being re-imposed quickly if transmission suddenly escalates; talks about the urgent need to redesign workplaces and education settings to allow for proper social distancing; the need for \u201cunprecedented levels of support and compliance from the whole population\u201d.</p> \n  <p>It also concludes that<strong> </strong>now is not the right time to relax restrictions, but that<strong> </strong>over the next few weeks, based on the evidence and expert advice, options will be considered that include the easing of restrictions in a phased manner, for example easing restrictions on some outdoor activity before those on indoor activities, as well as tailoring options to specific geographies and sectors, or parts of the rural economy, or those able to work outdoors.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

While opinion among experts around the world is divided, Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said there is no research to support wearing a mask if you\u2019re fit and well. </p> \n  <p>Marshall echoes the advice from the World Health Organization, which said there is little evidence that wearing a mask in the community <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/face-masks-cannot-stop-healthy-people-getting-covid-19-says-who\">prevented healthy people from picking up respiratory infections</a> including Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>Marshall said it would however make sense for someone to wear a mask if they are \u201ccoughing and spluttering\u201d. He added people can chose to cover their faces with a bandanna to stop the spread of coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The scientific advisory group on emergencies (Sage) is expected to discuss the usage of masks in a meeting on Thursday. It follows a decision by all German states to make face masks compulsory when travelling on public transport and going to the shops to combat the spread of coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>Marshall told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There\u2019s no research evidence to support wearing masks if you are basically fit and well, indeed if people wear masks there\u2019s a risk they play around with it, they play with their eyes more and maybe you\u2019re even at a higher risk of picking up an infection.</p> \n   <p>However, it is common sense that if they are coughing and spluttering then it makes complete sense to wear masks in order to protect other people.<br></p> \n   <p>I think the guidance that we\u2019re expecting to hear is that the wearing of face masks is a voluntary activity not mandated and it certainly makes a lot of sense to focus limited resources that we have at the moment on those who have greatest need and that\u2019s the health professionals.<br></p> \n   <p>This sophisticated kit is likely to be more rigorous, more useful, but actually it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to wear a bandanna around your mouth or whatever, that will work, it won\u2019t be quite as good but it will be good enough.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/public-can-choose-scarves-instead-of-masks-say-uk-scientists\">Public can choose scarves instead of masks, say UK scientists</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin and will be manning the liveblog until Andrew and Lucy come on later this morning.

  "<p>New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, has angrily slammed as \u201cirresponsible, reckless\u201d and \u201cone of the really dumb ideas of all time\u201d Senate leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s suggestion that states struggling to cope with the coronavirus should be able to file for bankruptcy rather than seek financial aid from the federal government.</p> <p>During an <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/22/mitch-mcconnell-bankruptcy-route-201008\">interview</a> yesterday, McConnell said: \u201cI would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route. It saves some cities. And there\u2019s no good reason for it not to be available. My guess is their first choice would be for the federal government to borrow money from future generations to send it down to them now so they don\u2019t have to do that. That\u2019s not something I\u2019m going to be in favor of.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/us-coronavirus-outbreak-tennessee-kentucky\">Two states: one Democrat, one Republican. Two very different outcomes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cuomo, who has repeatedly demanded that Congress provide more funding for states to cover the costs of the coronavirus crisis, said McConnell\u2019s suggestion was \u201cone of the really dumb ideas of all time\u201d.</p> <p>The governor, a Democrat, warned that states declaring bankruptcies could cause \u201ca collapse of this national economy\u201d.</p> <p>Cuomo also lambasted McConnell, the Republican senator from Kentucky, for suggesting relief money for states would represent a bailout for Democratic states, which have generally been harder hit by the virus.</p> <p>\u201cIf there\u2019s ever a time for humanity and decency, now\u2019s the time,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cHow irresponsible and how reckless.\u201d</p> <p>States do not have the right to declare bankruptcy under US law, and legislative changes would be needed to allow that. Declaring bankruptcy generally affords certain powers and protections during financial restructuring.</p> <p>Cuomo not only dismissed the idea, he noted that New York produces much more revenue for the federal government than Kentucky does.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s your state that is living on the money that we generate,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cYour state is being bailed out, not my state.\u201d</p> <p>New York quickly became the center of the US outbreak of coronavirus, following the earliest known cases and deaths on the west coast, in California and Washington.</p> <p>Cuomo has spent several weeks in his daily briefings asking the federal government to help with critical medical supplies that individual states were not in a position to stockpile or acquire overnight, especially ventilators, and has lately pleaded for money to fund widespread testing for the disease and levels of immunity.</p> <p>Meanwhile evidence is emerging that far more New Yorkers have had the coronavirus than the number confirmed by lab tests.</p> <p>A state survey of around 3,000 people found that 13.9% had antibodies, suggesting they had been exposed to the virus, Cuomo said, warning results were preliminary.</p> <p>New York City\u2019s health commissioner, Dr Oxiris Barbot, said as many as a million people in New York City, out of a population of 8.4 million, may have been exposed to the coronavirus.</p> <p>More than 263,000 people in the city have tested positive for the virus, \u201cbut that really is, I think, the tip of the iceberg\u201d, Barbot said.</p> <p><em>The Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>",
  "<p>The public has been urged not to buy medical face masks so that stocks can be preserved for the NHS, following scientists\u2019 advice to the government saying cloth coverings could be worn to stem the spread of coronavirus.</p> <p>The advice from Arco, one of the UK\u2019s leading distributors of personal protective equipment (PPE), which supplies the NHS and other frontline services, came amid fears of stockpiling by anxious members of the public. Arco said that medical masks should be kept for key workers in clinical settings.</p> <p>Sage, the UK\u2019s scientific advisory group on emergencies, met on Tuesday to discuss the benefits of face masks for the public, after health authorities in countries, including the US, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html\">recommended </a>the use of homemade versions, including scarves.</p> <p>Sage\u2019s advice has now been sent to the health secretary for consideration, with a decision likely to be announced next week.</p> <p>The advisory group has been split over how effective coverings can be in blocking transmission of thevirus, due to a lack of peer-reviewed research.</p> <p>Speaking on Thursday, the government\u2019schief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, who chairs Sage, described the evidence of the benefits of face masks as \u201cquite variable and quite weak\u201d.</p> <p>Arco said the demand for masks was unprecedented and that it was providing advice to customers to ensure that it only issued the higher grade of PPE where necessary.</p> <p>The company\u2019s marketing director, Adam Young, said it was sourcing limited supplies of medical masks. \u201cThe Type IIR and the FFP2s are most suitable for clinical use and as supply is limited we would recommend that the public does not use these, in order to protect stocks for those in clinical situations.</p> <p>\u201cWe are managing our supply chain to ensure that protective equipment reaches those that need it most, and is not diverted from health care and frontline responders. As such, we are unable to supply products direct to members of the public.\u201d</p> <p>Disposable face masks that claim to meet World Health Organization specifications for protection against coronavirus can be bought with ease online, from businesses including UK Meds. The online pharmacy tells customers that FFP2 face masks are available \u201cwhile stocks last\u201d and cost \u00a39.45 each.</p> <p>One source with knowledge of the Sage recommendations summarised the advice as: \u201cKeep medical masks for the NHS and other key workers, but there may be some small marginal benefit for some people under some small set of circumstances to wear a cloth mask.\u201d</p> <p>They said the advice was cautious because of the importance of preserving medical masks for NHS and care workers. It is understood that the advice does not go into detail about the circumstances in which coverings may be useful, but that this could include travel on public transport, in small enclosed shops, and in other places where physical distancing is difficult.</p> <p>As uncertainty over the UK\u2019s policy continued, businesses specialising in face masks designed to protect users against air pollution and pollen, traffic exhaust fumes when cycling and dust produced through DIY projects have reported a sharp rise in sales.</p> <p>Christopher Dobbing founded the Cambridge Mask Company when he lived in China, after seeing children fall ill through air pollution. The masks, which include an air filter, sell for about \u00a325 and can be worn for 200 to 300 hours, or three to six months. They are designed for personal use and are not suitable for use in clinical settings.</p> <p>Dobbing said: \u201cWe\u2019re completely sold out until August now. Our sales are about 12 times higher than normal and that\u2019s with a 10-week wait to get a mask. We would expect it to be 20 to 30 times higher if we actually had the stock.\u201d</p> <p>The company has seen three big spikes in sales since the start of the year. The first was from China and Hong Kong when the disease began to spread late January. The second was from Europe when it hit Spain and Italy in March, and the third was when the Centres for Disease Control changed its guidance in <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html\">the US earlier this month</a>. Germany\u2019s announcement on Wednesday that people should wear masks on public transport prompted another surge.</p> <p>After consideration by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, the advice from Sage will be discussed by the Covid-19 committee \u2013 which besides Hancock includes the first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove. It may subsequently be considered by a wider Cobra meeting as well.</p> <p>A Downing Street spokesman said: \u201cThey have finalised their advice. Ministers will now be reviewing this to decide on any further action that might be needed.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Experts have voiced growing frustration over the UK government\u2019s claim that it is \u201cfollowing the science\u201d, saying the refrain is being used to abdicate responsibility for political decisions.</p> \n<p>They also raised concerns that the views of public health experts were being overlooked, with disproportionate weight given to the views of modellers.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs a scientist, I hope I never again hear the phrase \u2018based on the best science and evidence\u2019 spoken by a politician,\u201d Prof Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, told the Guardian. \u201cThis phrase has become basically meaningless and used to explain anything and everything.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government has repeatedly said it is being \u201cled by the science\u201d on decisions ranging from banning mass gatherings to closing schools, the use of face masks and, most recently, the prospects of lifting the lockdown.</p> \n<p>However, Sridhar and others argued that scientific views on these topics could be wide-ranging and dependent on a scientist\u2019s field of expertise.</p> \n<p>The diversity of scientific views was apparent in March when case numbers were rising rapidly but the government chose not to ban mass gatherings or introduce wide-reaching physical distancing.</p> \n<p>\u201cWorld Health Organization advice, and what we\u2019ve learned from lots of previous outbreaks in low- and middle-income countries, is that the faster you move at the start, the better, because it\u2019s exponential growth,\u201d Sridhar said. \u201cIn public health, a test, trace and isolate campaign would\u2019ve been where your mind first went.\u201d</p> \n<p>Instead, she said, the government appeared to be basing policy on the presumption of a binary choice between two scenarios, played out in computer models, of either eradicating the virus or it becoming endemic.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"694eca0f-6d8c-491d-b329-2be5c5bcc847\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZYXGxByRUwE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Prof Mark Woolhouse, an infectious diseases epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh, said modelling had had a disproportionate influence. \u201cI do think scientific advice is driven far too much by epidemiology \u2013 and I\u2019m an epidemiologist.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re not talking about in the same formal, quantitative way are the economic costs, the social costs, the psychological costs of being under lockdown,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand that the government is being advised by economists, psychiatrists and others, but we\u2019re not seeing what that science is telling them. I find that very puzzling.\u201d</p> \n<p>Woolhouse said that while it was understandable that saving lives was the top priority, the idea of doing this at any cost was naive.</p> \n<p>\u201cWith any disease there is a trade-off. Public health is largely about that trade-off. What\u2019s happening here is that both sides of the equation are so enormous and so damaging that the routine public health challenge of balancing costs and benefits is thrown into incredibly stark relief. Yet that balance has to be found.\u201d</p> \n<p>Others expressed concern about the lack of transparency around the evidence affecting decision-making. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who sits on Sage [the government\u2019s scientific advisory group for emergencies], we see very little of the papers that go to Sage,\u201d said Prof Sheila Bird, the former programme leader of the Medical Research Council\u2019s biostatistics unit at the University of Cambridge. \u201cThat scientific underpinning is not evident.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sridhar said the failure to fully consider the perspectives of experts beyond epidemiology may have contributed to misguided decisions. Models appear not to have factored in the role of hospital staff shortages, which may have diverted attention from the urgent need for adequate personal protective equipment, she said.</p> \n<p>The concept of shielding the most vulnerable \u201clooks beautiful\u201d in models, she said, but in reality care homes are facing major outbreaks and multigenerational households are struggling to isolate the vulnerable. \u201cYou can\u2019t take these people out of the system and isolate them as if they were a data point on a graph,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a real problem if you have a collection of people from the same background, the same field, the same institutions; that can lead to blindspots and groupthink,\u201d Sridhar added. \u201cDiversity is clearly important for better decision-making.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Some fear the prominence given to science in supporting political decisions risks burdening scientists with unrealistic expectations and could ultimately erode trust in their expertise.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government isn\u2019t using expertise simply to validate claims, it also appears to be using it as an insurance policy,\u201d Prof Christina Boswell, a political scientist at the University of Edinburgh, <a href=\"https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/covid19perspectives/2020/04/14/the-return-of-the-expert-by-professor-christina-boswell/\">wrote </a><a href=\"https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/covid19perspectives/2020/04/14/the-return-of-the-expert-by-professor-christina-boswell/\">this week</a>. \u201cIf things go wrong \u2013 and the curve gets too steep \u2013 it will be the scientific advice that is to blame.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Who\u2019s who: the experts</h2> \n<p><strong>Prof Chris Whitty: the truthteller<br></strong>Chief medical officers have a tradition of speaking their mind, often to the chagrin of governments. Whitty, however, has appeared to be in perfect harmony with the UK government at the Downing Street briefings on Covid-19. The reality is probably that ministers are in step with him \u2013 or even a step behind. On Wednesday, Whitty, a practising NHS consultant physician, told a starker truth than politicians have dared: that physial distancing needs to be in place until at least the end of the year.</p> \n<p><strong>Sir Patrick Vallance: the political naif<br></strong>Vallance has had a career in medicine at University College London and St George\u2019s, University of London, researching vascular biology and endothelial cell physiology, and also in the pharmaceutical industry. From 2012 to 2018, he was president of research and development at GlaxoSmithKline, where, unusually for the industry, he advocated greater openness about innovation and partnerships with other companies.</p> \n<p>He left to become the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, but is not an instinctive politician. He was partly blamed for the government\u2019s flirtation with the notion of herd immunity, saying in March that the strategy was to reduce the peak, not suppress it completely. \u201cAlso, because the vast majority of people get a mild illness, to build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease.\u201d Afterwards it was denied he meant herd immunity should be the goal; it was simply an outcome.</p> \n<p><strong>Neil Ferguson: the workaholic<br></strong>Ferguson leads the modelling behind the UK response through the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, which he founded with colleagues at Imperial College. He has a long history in modelling epidemics, originally with Roy Anderson\u2019s unit at Oxford University, where they worked on BSE, vCJD, foot and mouth, Sars and swine flu \u2013 sometimes attracting controversy.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"952914849a306d5757dbb8d1e5a70d3df48b7bc5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/952914849a306d5757dbb8d1e5a70d3df48b7bc5/81_1_970_582/500.jpg\" alt=\"Neil Ferguson.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Ferguson is a mathematician, an epidemiologist and a workaholic who, before the lockdown, moved seamlessly between Downing Street, university and press briefings.

Like her boss, Whitty, she is independent-minded, and she warned at the end of March that the lockdown could last for six months or longer. She also suggested couples living separately could \u201ctest the strength of their relationship\u201d during the lockdown by moving in together.</p> \n<p><strong>Prof Jonathan Van-Tam: the flu expert</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5777c380cd8d31a70d84df8db1cf8f8c544ddab3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5777c380cd8d31a70d84df8db1cf8f8c544ddab3/267_136_1987_1191/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Van-Tam\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Jonathan Stafford Nguyen Van-Tam is a widely published expert on influenza and the vaccines and antiviral drugs used to treat it.

  "<p>If there is a simple way of showing how out of step this government is with the rest of the world on coronavirus, it can be found in the gap last week between the <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/04/16/five-things-uk-needs-achieve-government-lifts-lockdown-12567349/\" title=\"\">five criteria</a> that Dominic Raab said the country must fulfil before the lockdown was lifted and <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/who-releases-six-criteria-uk-21869213\" title=\"\">the six tests</a> the World Health Organization set.

On one side we have those who believe that testing, tracing and the isolating of infected individuals is needed to defeat coronavirus. In this camp are public health experts such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/10/lift-lockdown-uk-east-asia-coronavirus-pandemic\" title=\"\">Anthony Costello</a> of University College London and <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/former-health-secretary-jeremy-hunt-urges-ministers-to-get-a-move-on-with-coronavirus-contact-tracing\" title=\"\">Jeremy Hunt</a>, the former health secretary.</p> <p>They have facts on their side. South Korea registered its first 10 deaths of patients with Covid-19 by 25 February, and by following the WHO\u2019s advice Seoul had suppressed the epidemic within 22 days. Prof Costello <a href=\"https://twitter.com/globalhlthtwit/status/1253016111853056003\" title=\"\">says</a> that by the time the UK had recorded its first 10 deaths, by 13 March, the government had stopped all testing and contact-tracing in the community. How has that gone? South Korea sees 17 new cases daily, while the UK records 5,000. These numbers convinced the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/uk-to-start-coronavirus-contact-tracing-again\" title=\"\">health secretary, Matt Hancock</a>, who on Thursday outlined his \u201ctest, track and trace\u201d strategy, which would start \u201cas the new number of cases begins to fall\u201d.</p> <p>On the other side are those who believed the UK ought to go it alone \u2013 with a response determined by mathematical models and control measures while waiting for the silver bullet of a vaccine. In this camp appeared to be Mr Raab, the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and his deputy, Jenny Harries, who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/10DowningStreet/status/1245019023827521539\" title=\"\">condescendingly</a> claimed South Korea\u2019s outbreak was atypical and akin to controlling that found in a single care home.

  "<p>The biggest assessment of global insect abundances to date shows a worrying drop of almost 25% in the last 30 years, with accelerating declines in Europe that shocked scientists.</p> <p>The analysis combined 166 long-term surveys from almost 1,700 sites and found that some species were bucking the overall downward trend. In particular, freshwater insects have been increasing by 11% each decade following action to clean up polluted rivers and lakes. However, this group represent only about 10% of insect species and do not pollinate crops.</p> <p>Researchers said insects remained critically understudied in many regions, with little or no data from South America, south Asia and Africa. Rapid destruction of wild habitats in these places for farming and urbanisation is likely to be significantly reducing insect populations, they said.</p> <p>Insects are by far the most varied and abundant animals, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/21/human-race-just-001-of-all-life-but-has-destroyed-over-80-of-wild-mammals-study\">outweighing humanity by 17 times</a>, and are essential to the ecosystems humanity depends upon. They pollinate plants, are food for other creatures and recycle nature\u2019s waste.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/10/plummeting-insect-numbers-threaten-collapse-of-nature\">previous largest assessment</a>, based on 73 studies, led scientists to warn of \u201ccatastrophic consequences for the survival of mankind\u201d if insect losses were not halted. Its estimated rate of decline was more than double that in the new study. Other experts estimate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/13/insect-apocalypse-poses-risk-to-all-life-on-earth-conservationists-warn\">50% of insects have been lost</a> in the last 50 years.</p> <p>Recent analyses from some locations have found collapses in insect abundance, such as 75% in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/18/warning-of-ecological-armageddon-after-dramatic-plunge-in-insect-numbers\">Germany</a> and 98% in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/15/insect-collapse-we-are-destroying-our-life-support-systems\">Puerto Rico</a>. The new, much broader study found a lower rate of losses. However, Roel van Klink, of the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research in Leipzig, who led the research, said: \u201cThis 24% is definitely something to be concerned about. It\u2019s a quarter less than when I was a kid. One thing people should always remember is that we really depend on insects for our food.\u201d</p> <p>The research, <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aax9931\">published in the journal Science</a>, also examined how the rate of loss was changing over time. \u201cEurope seems to be getting worse now \u2013 that is striking and shocking. But why that is, we don\u2019t know,\u201d said van Klink. In North America, the declines are flattening off, but at a low level.</p> <p>Elsewhere, data is much more sparse. \u201cBut we know from our results that the expansion of cities is bad for insects because every place used to be more natural habitat \u2013 it is not rocket science,\u201d said van Klink. \u201cThis is happening in east Asia and Africa at a rapid rate. In South America, there is the destruction of the Amazon. There\u2019s absolutely no question this is bad for insects and all the other animals there. But we just don\u2019t have the data.\u201d</p> <p>Van Klink said the research showed that insects were faring only slightly better in nature reserves than outside protected areas. \u201cWe found that very striking and a bit shocking \u2013 it means something\u2019s going wrong there.\u201d</p> <p>Losses of insects are driven by habitat destruction, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/29/pesticides-damage-survival-of-bee-colonies-landmark-study-shows\">pesticides</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/22/light-pollution-insect-apocalypse\">light pollution</a>. The impact of the climate crisis was not clear in the research, despite <a href=\"https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cobi.13477\">obvious local examples</a>. Van Klink said changes in heat and rain could harm some species while boosting others, even in the same location.</p> <p>But he highlighted another study showing that rising carbon dioxide levels are reducing the nutrients in plants and <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/117/13/7271\">significantly cutting grasshopper abundances</a> on prairies in Kansas, US. \u201dThat is absolutely shocking, because that could be happening all over the world.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Dave Goulson, of the University of Sussex, who was not involved in the new analysis, said: \u201cPeople should be as concerned as ever about insects. It is great news that some aquatic insects seem to be increasing, probably from a very low level. But the bulk of insects are terrestrial and this new study confirms what was already clear: they have been declining for many decades.\u201d</p> <p>Matt Shardlow, the head of the conservation charity Buglife, said: \u201cMany insect species are threatened with extinction and this study shows insect abundance is also declining at an unsustainable rate. While the estimate in this study is lower than some, it is still very steep. Massive abundance declines in flying insects remains a developing ecological disaster.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abb6861\">comment article in Science</a>, Maria Dornelas, of the University of St Andrews, and Gergana Daskalova, of the University of Edinburgh, said the new study was the largest and most complete meta-analysis to date. \u201cEmbracing nuance allows us to balance accurate reporting of worrying losses with hopeful examples of wins,\u201d they said.</p> <p>Van Klink said: \u201cWe definitely have a lot of reason for concern, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too late. The increase in freshwater species makes us at least hopeful that if we put the right legislation in place, we can reverse these trends.\u201d</p>",

For anyone working from home rather than their usual shared workplace, the once wholly unremarkable act of gossiping over Friday drinks or around the proverbial water cooler seems like a lost privilege from another era, one that most of us would happily buy a full round of champagne for the whole team to recapture.</p> <p>\u201cDownloading with colleagues is the thing I miss most about normal life,\u201d says one friend. \u201cWe would have banter running literally all day.

A good whinge about a third party is \u2013 contrary to what the snark narcs would have you believe \u2013 a very normal part of being human.</p> <p>\u201cGossip has a positive function in that it brings people together,\u201d Jetten says. \u201cIf you and someone else agree that a certain behaviour you\u2019ve witnessed is problematic or antisocial then it helps to clarify norms. And it also strengthens your bonds because you then have a shared understanding of reality with someone else.\u201d</p> <p>Not only has physical distancing thrown a spanner in gossip\u2019s works, but the gravity of coronavirus also seemed to have dampened our urge to snipe and snitch about life\u2019s usual mundanities.

But what do you angst over when no one\u2019s been caught kissing someone they shouldn\u2019t, no one\u2019s having a juicy first date, and you can\u2019t whinge about Lionel from marketing\u2019s bad breath because you aren\u2019t anywhere near it?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m getting constant screenshots ...  \u2018check out this person, I think they\u2019re smoking something'</p> <footer> <cite>Salvatore Malatesta</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some of us turned to politics; former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull must have been delighted to release his spicy tell-all, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/20/malcolm-turnbull-on-donald-trump-you-dont-suck-up-to-bullies\">A Bigger Picture</a> on 20 April, when he could count on our rapt attention. It shot to the top of the Amazon book sales charts, probably fuelled by our apparent longing for scandal and intrigue.</p> <p>But for most of us, our main gossip source, beyond <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/26/your-place-or-mine-coronavirus-forces-couples-to-choose\">who\u2019s-moved-in-with-who</a>, is transgressions we find online. \u201cThere\u2019s enormous screenshotting going on.

That most combative of social media platforms, Twitter, enjoyed a<a href=\"https://adage.com/article/digital/twitter-says-ad-revenue-significantly-affected-coronavirus/2245901\"> 23% jump in usage</a> in the first quarter of 2020 as people searched for real-time news about the virus, but flame wars and partisan punch-ups inevitably followed, perhaps made worse because we have so few other outlets.</p> <p>The latter in particular, says Jetten, is entirely understandable. \u201cThere\u2019s an obsession with rule-breakers at the moment because we\u2019re getting very clear guidance from the government about what we\u2019re allowed to do, and we\u2019re all trying to enforce those norms,\u201d she says. \u201cIt feels bigger when it reaches more people over social media \u2013 usually gossip is more subtle and one on one.\u201d</p>",

Shopping in physical stores, recreational activities, personal services, and a long list of other types of spending have been sharply reduced.</p> <p>As a result, the businesses that normally provide these goods and services have sharply reduced activity, or shut down entirely. Absent any policy response, most of the employees of these businesses would lose their jobs, and face a dramatic reduction in income. In contrast, those working in sectors whose output is still in demand, for example food retail and online businesses, face no reduction in income at all or even experience increased income.</p> <p>But they are still unable or unwilling to consume goods and services that require social contact, so they end up with a large involuntary increase in savings. </p> </blockquote> <p>But there is some good news....

One of the main problems is that the distinction between leadership and management has been blurred. Leaders give clear direction and inspire their followers; managers perform the function of implementing the plan.</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s bumbling, hands-off approach to a world completely beyond his understanding, let alone his ability to control, is relatively benign, until a crisis arrives. When disaster struck, his incompetence became swiftly apparent, and yet his cabinet are compounding the disaster by being worse than him. A poor leader may at a pinch be bailed out by a sound management team; but when both are rotten there is no cure.</p> <p>The closest Johnson will get to Churchill is to be remembered as the man who presided over a time when never in the field of British politics was so much unnecessary suffering bestowed on so many by political poltroons with so few morals.<br><strong>Matt Minshall</strong><br><em>Batz-Sur-Mer, Brittany, France</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/20/the-guardian-view-on-brexit-trade-talks-folly-and-distraction\" title=\"\">editorial</a> (20 April) says: \u201cTo plough on needlessly with a [Brexit] timetable that has clearly been overwhelmed by events would be feckless and irresponsible.\u201d Isn\u2019t our difficulty that these seem to be the very qualities that the anti-state cabinet members and their advisers intend with their disruption agenda?</p> <p>As Polly Toynbee also points out, all the evidence is that \u201cour government is singularly unsuited to this task and unfit for purpose\u201d.</p> <p>They have failed to concentrate on the demands being put upon them, and have made numerous errors of judgment that others easily see were dangerously wrong. There is still the suspicion that the \u201cherd immunity\u201d proposal, and rejection of EU collaboration on procurement, were driven by ideology instead of human needs.

Critically, in 1915 those fighting in the first world war were being severely let down by their political masters in terms of the correct type, quality and quantity of a key weapon in that battle.</p> <p>Strong political leadership and radical new policies in terms of production were required. The prime minister proved not to be the man to lead the country through that crisis. Initially forced into a coalition government, he was increasingly sidelined in strategic decision-making, and eventually replaced by the man who had the enterprise and the determination to win the war.

It is a format far removed from the norm, where prime ministers and presidents hole up in the modern oak and glass Europa building in Brussels for the best part of 24 hours, and political rows and textual wrangles are accompanied by gourmet dinners and fine wine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BarendLeyts/status/1253310769762050049\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Fourth <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EUCO?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#EUCO</a> videoconference of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eucopresident?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@eucopresident</a> on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> has started now with exchange of views with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EP_President?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@EP_President</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EU27?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#EU27</a> leaders are joined by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vonderleyen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@vonderleyen</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lagarde?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Lagarde</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mariofcenteno?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@mariofcenteno</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JosepBorrellF?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JosepBorrellF</a> <br><br>Stay tuned for more <a href=\"https://t.co/QhoUli99Sw\">pic.twitter.com/QhoUli99Sw</a></p>&mdash; Barend Leyts (@BarendLeyts) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarendLeyts/status/1253310769762050049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 23, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>A virtual summit means none of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/15/lonely-theresa-may-video-at-eu-summit-is-brexit-in-a-nutshell\">air kissing and back-slapping</a> that usually happens when leaders get together in person.

It\u2019s a different story at the European parliament, which has been running virtually since the pandemic took hold. One recent meeting between the parliament\u2019s civil liberties committee and two Greek ministers showed how painful video-conferencing can be. \u201cSe\u00f1or Chrisocho\u00efdis, are you there? Can you speak please,\u201d the committee\u2019s Spanish vice-chair, Maite Pagazaurtund\u00faa, asked Mich\u00e1lis Chrisocho\u00efdis, the Greek minister for citizen protection, who was due on the line. \u201cPlease just press the button, that way you can speak. Press the button and then you can speak please.\u201d The problem was not immediately resolved. \u201cPlease press the speak button and try again.\u201d</p> <p>Meeting by video conference poses more than just technical problems. Luuk van Middelaar, a former adviser to the European council president and a scholar of EU crises, thinks the format makes it impossible to build trust in difficult moments. \u201cThe recipe of EU decision-making at summit level is that [leaders] are meeting in person. They can look each other in the eye, they can speak <em>de vive voix</em> [personally]. It\u2019s not about states meeting, it\u2019s about people meeting,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Current insiders tend to agree. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can work something out in the margins of the council \u2013 and that is where the real music plays,\u201d one EU diplomat said. \u201cSome of the leaders, some of the advisers get together and try to sketch a way forward, but this is not possible in a video conference, at least not in the same way.\u201d</p> <p>When things get difficult at a regular summit, leaders and their most trusted advisers gather around tables in small groups or huddle in corridors, searching for common ground or writing and rewriting text \u2013 diplomatic heavy lifting captured in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/23/brexit-eu-takes-back-control-brussels-corridor-viral-photo\">a rare photograph</a> in March 2019.</p> <p>Some sources think it will be near impossible to agree one of the most contentious items on the EU agenda, the next seven-year budget, without a face-to-face meeting. The exercise will involve reconciling spenders with savers in the middle of a major economic downturn. </p> <p>\u201cWhen you talk about this huge negotiation, it is going to be difficult to do this by video conference,\u201d a senior official said. \u201cAt one point, in the endgame, maybe a physical meeting will be needed.\u201d </p> <p>But for now, leaders will have to dial in for compromise.</p>",
  "<p>The UK\u2019s manufacturing and services industries suffered the biggest slump on record this month, according to figures released on Thursday, as a Bank of England policymaker warned Britain\u2019s economy was on course to suffer the deepest recession in several hundred years.</p> <p> </p> <p>Gertjan Vlieghe, a member of the BoE\u2019s interest-rate setting committee, said the UK was heading for a squeeze on incomes that was unprecedented in its speed and severity.</p> <p>In a health check of the UK economy ahead of the monetary policy committee\u2019s next meeting in May, he said: \u201cBased on the early indicators, and based on the experience in other countries that were hit somewhat earlier than the UK, it seems that we are experiencing an economic contraction that is faster and deeper than anything we have seen in the past century, or possibly several centuries.\u201d</p> <p>Britain is expected to enter a recession in the first half of the year after large parts of the economy were forced to shut and workers stay at home as part of efforts to tackle the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> <p>Data firm IHS Markit said its UK composite purchasing managers index (PMI), which tracks activity across the services and manufacturing sectors, slumped to just 12.9 for April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/24/global-recession-economy-services-factories-covid-19-uk-eurozone-japan-us-markets-business-live?page=with:block-5e79b8ad8f08e46329cb4b64\">down from 36</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/24/global-recession-economy-services-factories-covid-19-uk-eurozone-japan-us-markets-business-live?page=with:block-5e79b8ad8f08e46329cb4b64\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/24/global-recession-economy-services-factories-covid-19-uk-eurozone-japan-us-markets-business-live?page=with:block-5e79b8ad8f08e46329cb4b64\">in March</a> and a record since the survey began in the 90s.

  "<p>Coronavirus lockdown restrictions may be lifted earlier in Northern Ireland than in the rest of the UK, the first minister, Arlene Foster, has said, as it emerged that extra critical care capacity is not expected to be needed during the first wave of the pandemic.</p> <p>The death rate in Northern Ireland is half that of England, and the projected death toll from coronavirus in Northern Ireland was revised down this week to 1,500. Earlier modelling had suggested a worst-case scenario of 15,000 deaths.</p> <p>The health minster, Robin Swann, said on Thursday: \u201cFor the time being our latest data modelling indicates that further critical care capacity will not be required during the first wave of transmission in Northern Ireland.\u201d</p> <p>A virologist at Queen\u2019s University Belfast has put the lower than expected death toll down to Northern Ireland\u2019s low population density compared with other parts of the UK.</p> <p>There have been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/healthdpt/status/1253335979403776000\">263 deaths</a> in Northern Ireland to date, a rate of 14 deaths per 100,000 population, compared with England\u2019s 30 deaths per 100,000, based on the latest daily figures on hospital deaths published by NHS England.</p> <p>The three smaller UK nations all recorded their first deaths later than England, which may mean the disease began circulating later, while less urbanisation in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland could also be a contributory factor.</p> <p>But Swann warned against complacency in any moves to ease the clampdown on social, business, travel and other activities over the next few weeks.</p> <p>Foster said lockdown measures would be eased when scientific and public health criteria were met and she would give no timetables or dates.</p> <p>Foster told Cool FM radio on Thursday that any lifting of the lockdown would have to be \u201cset down and agreed\u201d with both the power-sharing Northern Ireland executive and the government in London.</p> <p>\u201cAnd because of that, you could well see different parts of the United Kingdom move in different time to other parts, because it will be criteria-led,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do I mean by that? We will have to look at the amount of admissions to hospital, the admissions to intensive care units, the number of deaths we have, what it means for us in terms of the science.\u201d</p> <p>Northern Ireland\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Michael McBride, said local health officials had recorded a flattening of the Covid-19 infection curve in the region.</p> <p>Dr Lindsay Broadbent, a virologist and research fellow at the Wellcome/Wolfson Institute for Experimental Medicine at Queen\u2019s University of Belfast, said there were some grounds for optimism that aspects of the local lockdown could be lifted.</p> <p>\u201cThere may be regional differences to ending the lockdown across the UK and Ireland.

Another factor was that \u201cstricter measures may have been in place longer than somewhere like London.\u201d All of Northern Ireland has been in lockdown since 17 March.</p> <p>Swann, appeared more sceptical about lifting restrictions compared with the first minister. He said it was too early for his department to confirm that the number of Covid-19 deaths had peaked in the region.</p> <p>\u201cWhile there are grounds for hope that the outbreak can be brought under control, the outbreak has not reached a point where some of the measures can be relaxed,\u201d he said.</p> <p>One of the most controversial measures of Northern Ireland\u2019s lockdown has been the closure of all cemeteries. Members of the public unable to visit loved ones\u2019 graves have complained that while cemetery gates are locked, large queues snake outside off-licences, which remain open.</p> <p>The Northern Ireland executive remains split over cemetery closures, with Sinn F\u00e9in in favour of keeping them closed while the Ulster Unionists have argued they could be reopened with strict distancing measures.</p>",

They\u2019re already used to working for a mummified corpse,\u201d Bee added next to a photo of Fox News\u2019 owner, Rupert Murdoch.</p> <p>\u201cAs scary as it is to hear these idiots dismiss people\u2019s lives, it\u2019s really terrifying that elected officials are saying it too,\u201d Bee continued. And no one is saying that louder, more \u201call-caps\u201d, than Trump, who last week said that America \u201cwants to be open\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAh, yes, \u2018America wants to be open\u2019,\u201d Bee said. \u201cThe \u2018she was asking for it\u2019 of coronavirus relief measures.\u201d</p> <p>Bee acknowledged that for many Americans, \u201cit\u2019s understandable to feel angry and upset\u201d, especially since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/23/us-unemployment-claims-benefits-coronavirus\">26</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/23/us-unemployment-claims-benefits-coronavirus\"> million people are now out of work</a>. \u201cBut reopening the economy prematurely could backfire and lead to another shutdown. We\u2019re not facing a choice between saving lives or saving the economy. The simple fact is, the economy is people.

You can tweet all you want, but it\u2019s hard to capture people\u2019s hearts and minds when they\u2019re worried about their hearts and lungs.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have Bill Barr redact the virus or call Ukraine to get dirt on Hunter Virus, or get Mitch McConnell to have 51 Republicans vote that there is no virus,\u201d he continued, addressing Trump. \u201cYou can\u2019t even pay the virus $130,000 to stay quiet, which is too bad, because this virus is definitely spanking your ass.

But there is something more worrying at play, too \u2013 people who need us <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/27/fears-seriously-ill-a-and-e-numbers-drop-coronavirus-nhs\">are not coming in</a>.</p> <p>In normal times, you get used to the mix of patients who flow through the swinging doors of A&amp;E. They come with problems relating to one of a few chronic diseases: diabetes, COPD or sickle cell anaemia. Then there\u2019s the elderly \u2013 falling over, forgetting, or attending with care and social needs<strong>.</strong> There are patients who have had too much, or not enough, of their legal and illegal drugs of choice. </p> <p>Then there are the more typical emergencies: wounds needing sutures, tummies needing surgeons, hearts needing cardiologists, a broad range of infections needing our drugs. A few weeks ago, a single entity displaced most of the above. A&amp;E became a subspecialty, a Covid-19 ward. Those anxious days are behind us now, but we have not seen a return to normal.</p> <p>In the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52361519\">week ending 10 April</a> there were around 18,500 deaths in England and Wales \u2013 about 8,000 more than could be expected at this time of the year. Only 6,200 of those deaths has been attributed to Covid-19. So what of the rest? Some could be due to undiagnosed infection, a theory that marries well with the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/apr/03/why-has-the-uk-lagged-behind-in-testing-for-the-coronavirus\">Britain has failed</a> to implement widespread testing, but there are corollaries to any outbreak and we are beginning, in this tumbleweed-week, to sense their cost.</p> <p>I am worried that people who need us are not coming in, scared that hospitals are vectors for infection rather than cure. This was brought home the other day when my mum felt an intense pain in her lower leg and required my cajoling, via phone, to attend A&amp;E, where she discovered that she\u2019d snapped her achilles tendon.</p> <p>Patients are tarrying when their chest pain kicks in, when they experience a sudden facial droop, or fall, or bleed, or faint. There is little reason to believe lockdown alone is shifting the numbers; it is more likely that the small tragedies of life are still playing out, out of sight, out of mind, only breaching the surface every now and then when we squint at statistics. </p> <p>If this is the eye of the storm, the wind will pick up again soon. And then we might be dealing with a surge of patients who haven\u2019t been able to attend their GP or regular clinic in months, whose operations have been cancelled and scans delayed, whose chronic diseases have flared.</p> <p>I have sympathy with the instinct to steer clear. Despite the use of personal protective equipment, segregated wards, obsessive handwashing and the stringent infection control measures rolled out when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/18/what-is-the-superbug-la-mrsa-cc398-and-why-is-it-spreading-on-farms\">MRSA</a> was public enemy No 1, Covid-19 has been transmitted in hospital settings. Doctors are trying hard not to admit anyone without Covid-19, because our typical hospitalised patients \u2013 elderly and with overlapping disease \u2013 are particularly vulnerable to the virus.</p> <p>But we can\u2019t put our vulnerable people in germ-free bubbles. So, like much of medicine, this involves a delicate balance: we need to ensure that patients are admitted when they need to be, and at the same time we need to protect others by sending them home.</p> <p>But to do this, we need to see you first, and the balance is getting skewed before we can make such a judgment. So if you need us now, get in touch. We\u2019re here for you, waiting patiently, unrushed, game-faced. Please don\u2019t let fear turn to harm. The virus will cause enough of that as it is.</p> <p>\u2022 Stephen Fabes is an A&amp;E doctor and author of the forthcoming book Signs of Life: To the Ends of the Earth with a Doctor</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",

Trump, who still appears in daily press conferences with a team of public health experts such as Dr Anthony Fauci, has wavered on the issue. He has urged protesters to \u201cliberate\u201d several Democratic states from their lockdowns and usually appears keen for a swift reopening, but he has also criticized the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/23/georgia-businesses-wary-governor-brian-kemp-reopen\">Republican governor of Georgia</a> for reopening too early.</p> <p>While the public still largely supports shutdown efforts, the risk, some say, is that disagreements over the pandemic response devolve into another American culture war, like abortion and gun rights.</p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump is not going to go into this election siding with Dr Fauci against this Tea Party-like movement. If he thinks that this is what his base wants, he will go with them,\u201d said <a href=\"https://thebulwark.com/author/charlessykes/\">Charlie Sykes</a>, a conservative anti-Trump author and broadcaster in Wisconsin. </p> <p>Critics of Liz and Richard Uihlein say it is impossible to overstate the couple\u2019s influence over conservative politics and that Liz Uihlein\u2019s outspoken criticism of the stay-at-home orders will act like \u201cjet fuel\u201d to accelerate political opposition to policies that have been endorsed by public health experts.</p> <p>Neither Uihlein has been shy about endorsing rightwing causes \u2013 especially anti-union and anti-tax groups \u2013 and fringe candidates, like Roy Moore, the Republican Senate candidate who was accused of sexual assault of minors and lost a special election in 2017.</p> <p>Like the Mercers and the Kochs, the couple has rarely given interviews.</p> <p>But reached at home this week by the Guardian, Liz Uihlein \u2013 who was one of 36 executives to be invited to participate in a call with Trump last month to discuss the national response to Covid-19 \u2013 expressed her dismay at Wisconsin\u2019s handling of the crisis, which she said was devastating the economy.</p> <p>Of nearly 7,000 employees, Uihlein claimed that her company had seen 15 cases of Covid-19 infection and that six were back at work.</p> <p>An anonymous employee told the Guardian that the company had previously reported 19 cases in internal communications, and has since stopped sending out alerts.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s overhyped,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t wish anybody ill will.

In the country it\u2019s not as rampant as the press would have you make it.\u201d</p> <p>The company, which has remained open because it is considered an essential business, has come under fire for allegedly adopting lax safety practices in the face of the pandemic, including initially discouraging employees from working at home and not providing enough space to the non-warehouse employees who did come to work.</p> <p>Uihlein said the work-from-home recommendations were dragging on the company and that tasks that would take \u201cfive minutes to get done at the office takes two days\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe have no choice with a lot of them,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Uihlein, who said she and her husband \u201cloved Trump\u201d and is believed to have a net worth of about $4bn, laughed off suggestions that she might influence the president.</p> <p>\u201cYou honestly think that money influences Donald Trump, are you kidding me?\u201d she said.</p> <p>But Uline, she and her husband\u2019s privately held company, has already donated $1.5m to Trump\u2019s Super Pac, America First Action, and $20m to other Republican groups so far in the 2020 election cycle. In the past, their donations topped $90m, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</p> <p>In her interview with the Guardian, Liz Uihlein, who is 74, repeatedly compared the current crisis to polio outbreaks in the 1940s and 1950s \u2013 her own sister contracted the disease when they were children \u2013 and suggested Americans then had not \u201cshut down\u201d communities to deal with those outbreaks.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a terrifically scary thing. It hit children and this virus doesn\u2019t hit children. So I\u2019ve got a different view on it.

Polio had been ravaging communities for decades <a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/salk-announces-polio-vaccine\">before a vaccine was discovered in 1953</a> and large segments of the population had developed immunity to the virus.

  "<p>Pilot schemes requiring voters to produce photo ID at polling stations disenfranchise those who do not have or cannot find their documents and alienate people from the democratic process, the court of appeal has been told.</p> <p>The claim has been made by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/13/voter-id-trials-government-court-local-elections\">Neil Coughlan</a>, a community activist from Braintree in Essex, who argues that voter fraud is extremely rare and the electoral trials are unlawful.</p> <p>In a hearing conducted remotely on Thursday, lawyers for Coughlan told Lord Justice Underhill, Lord Justice Mccombe and Lord Justice Green that many people did not have the type of photo ID required at a few polling stations in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/30/voter-id-trial-local-elections\">last May\u2019s local </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/30/voter-id-trial-local-elections\">elections.</a></p> <p>Anthony Peto QC, appearing for Coughlan, said the scheme was \u201ca major constitutional change in the exercise of a fundamental democratic right\u201d.</p> <p>He said Coughlan lives in a part of Essex that \u201che describes as run-down and neglected\u201d. Peto added: \u201cHe feels that this [scheme] will serve to disenfranchise the poor who already feel [ignored] and where many people do not have photo IDs.\u201d</p> <p>There was little evidence of voter fraud and personation taking place in the UK outside of Northern Ireland, the court was told. A survey last year found that more than 99% of polling station officials said they had no suspicions of anyone impersonating someone else in order to steal their vote.</p> <p>Peto said ministerial orders under which the pilot schemes were given the go-ahead were not made legitimately under the Representation of the People Act 2000.</p> <p>Section 10 of the act gives a minister power to introduce pilots \u201cas regards when, where and how voting at elections is to take place\u201d, the court was told.</p> <p>\u201cBy empowering the minister to make changes \u2018as regards how voting is to take place\u2019,\u201d the court was told, \u201cparliament cannot have intended to empower ministers effectively to disenfranchise a section of legitimate voters who would be unable to find and produce specified documents or who would be unable to satisfy local officials on the spot as to their entitlement to vote\u201d.</p> <p>Coughlan is appealing against the high court\u2019s rejection of his claim. Lawyers for the Cabinet Office told the appeal court judges that the purpose of the electoral trials was to discover what problems might arise and that they were lawful.</p> <p>Before the hearing, Coughlan, who has raised money for his case through a crowdfunding website, said: \u201cHundreds of individuals were denied their vote in last year\u2019s local elections because of these voter ID pilots \u2026 I am determined to persevere with my case arguing that the pilots were unlawful as they needed an act of parliament to be introduced.</p> <p>\u201cAs the government moves to bring forward legislation to introduce voter ID requirements nationally at general elections, it is all the more important to establish whether these pilots were lawful. </p> <p>\u201cAs the Windrush scandal showed, many British citizens do not have official documentation and in fact some 7.5% of the electorate do not possess photo ID. Requiring individuals to produce identity documents is going to deprive legitimate members of the electorate of the vote and I believe it will disproportionately affect the poor and marginalised members of our society.\u201d</p> <p>Tessa Gregory, a solicitor at the law firm Leigh Day who represents Coughlan, said: \u201cMr Coughlan contends that by giving ministers the power to make changes as to \u2018how\u2019 voting takes place, parliament cannot have intended them to disenfranchise those voters who cannot produce the correct form of ID at the polling station.</p> <p>\u201cIn his legal case he argues that restricting people\u2019s right to vote in local elections by requiring them to produce ID is an important constitutional matter that has to be expressly authorised by parliament.\u201d</p> <p>The hearing continues. Judgment is expected to be reserved.</p>",

And if not, can the Italians, in particular, be convinced of the added value of the union?</p> <p>For all the inevitable prevarication, ill-concealed by a smokescreen of Eurojargon and acronyms, we are approaching what Emmanuel Macron has described as a moment of truth.</p> <p>The European economy is in a slow-motion car crash with the coronavirus. Initial impact has been made. The full scale of the damage will not be clear for months to come.</p> <p>There will be a vast number of deaths. There will also be a savage economic recession. Analysts predict a near doubling of unemployment in the EU, with whole swathes of industry collapsing.</p> <p>The depth of the crash and its repercussions in the political sphere will be decided to a significant degree by the nature and range of spending in the immediate months and years. That will involve huge debt, and with that comes the question of where liability for it lies and who controls how the money is spent.</p> <p>If governments try to come out of this crisis through national borrowing alone, it is possible, even probable, that the debt accrued by the least productive economies will come to be seen as unsustainable by the markets. Economies could slide into despair, risking further joblessness, hunger, destitution.</p> <p>Some countries might seek to restrict their borrowing for fear of such an outcome, but they risk their economies shrivelling in relation to their EU neighbours.</p> <p>In either scenario, the EU would be in a dangerous predicament in which cries of betrayal would be strongly heard as some stride out of the pit of the crisis for which all European countries are equally blameless.</p> <p>The Italian answer to this has been the so-called coronabonds under which eurozone countries would, from now, commonly raise debt on the markets and be jointly liable.</p> <p>That concept goes some way to presuming there is an EU community of people in support of a transfer union, where the richest help pay the way for the poorest and the countries more strongly positioned in this crisis sacrifice for the weakest.</p> <p>\u201cEurope has to come up with an answer,\u201d the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, demanded.</p> <p>The Netherlands, Austria, Finland and Germany are opposed to the concept of coronabonds. They raise the issue of moral hazard in that such a policy would seemingly punish those countries that had saved for a rainy day, and say it could risk further fiscal irresponsibility.</p> <p>Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has raised the issue of democratic accountability by suggesting there is not sufficient political union among the 27 for such shared debt. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, well aware that the forces in support of \u201cNexit\u201d \u2013 led by characters such as the Eurosceptic politician Thierry Baudet \u2013 could make mischief, has said such bonds would be in breach of the EU treaties.</p> <p>There are ways out of this dilemma, as there have been in the past. Should Italy stop presenting agreement on coronabonds as a test of solidarity, the commission has suggested a \u20ac300bn recovery fund in the 2021-27 budget. The commission would also borrow \u20ac320bn from the capital markets for targeted spending.</p> <p>Perhaps Italian and Spanish voters will regard this as satisfactory. Their leaders have, however, set a high bar for the EU, which it is not at all clear it is able to meet.</p>",
  "<p>More than 232,000 people may have been infected in the first wave of Covid-19 in mainland China, four times the official figures, according to a study by Hong Kong researchers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/22/las-vegas-mayor-coronavirus-carolyn-goodman\">'I'd love everything open': Las Vegas mayor's coronavirus interview sparks ire</a> </p> </aside>  <p>China reported more than 55,000 cases as of 20 February but, according to research by academics at Hong Kong University\u2019s school of public health, <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(20)30089-X/fulltext\">published in the Lancet</a>, the true number would have been far greater if the definition of a Covid-19 case that was later used had been applied from the outset.</p> <p>China has now reported more than 83,000 cases. Globally, the death toll from the coronavirus has exceeded 184,000, with the number of cases worldwide standing at more than 2.6m.</p> <p>The new estimates come amid a mounting clamour for an international inquiry into the coronavirus outbreak\u2019s origins, led by the United States and Australia, although the estimates appear far from constituting the proof of a coverup sought by some on the political right. The US and Australia have called for an international investigation into the handling of the outbreak.</p> <p>The initial diagnostic criteria for identifying the disease, as the paper\u2019s authors make clear, was very narrow, and was revisited seven times between 15 January and 3 March by China\u2019s national health commission as new information about the disease became available and as laboratory testing capacity was expanded.</p> <p>The Hong Kong study analysed data up to 20 February taken from the World Health Organization\u2019s mission to Wuhan. It estimated that each of the first four changes increased the proportion of cases detected and counted, by between 2.8 and 7.1 times.</p> <p>\u201cIf the fifth version of the case definition had been applied throughout the outbreak with sufficient testing capacity, we estimated that by 20 February 2020, there would have been 232,000 \u2026 confirmed cases in China as opposed to the 55,508 confirmed cases reported,\u201d the study said.</p> <p>Based on the two factors the authors went back to re-examine how many cases could have been missed if the later criteria had been applied at the beginning of the outbreak.</p> <p>The researchers point in particular to the very narrow scope of the first diagnostic guidelines, which required six specific criteria to be met for a patient to be a confirmed case of Covid-19. The criteria included a patient\u2019s epidemiological link to Wuhan or a wet market in Wuhan, and a full genome sequencing test of a patient\u2019s respiratory specimen showing a close homology with Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cIn China, broadening the case definitions over time allowed a greater proportion of infections to be detected as cases,\u201d the researchers wrote. </p> <p>\u201cThe true number of infections could still be higher than that currently estimated, considering the possibility of under-detection of some infections, particularly those that were mild and asymptomatic, even under the broadest case definitions.\u201d</p> <p>There have been controversies in many countries about the counting of deaths and infections, but China in particular has been accused of a lack of transparency over the reporting of its figures.

  "<p>Sir David Barnes, who has died aged 84, was the self-effacing but determined and clear-sighted chief executive who turned the bioscience interests of ICI into one of the world\u2019s major pharmaceutical corporations, AstraZeneca.</p> <p>Teased at its launch in 1993 that Zeneca sounded like a Czechoslovakian camera, Barnes responded that its performance would define its brand \u2013 and was vindicated. The first suggested name had been Zenica, but then Barnes, tracking the Bosnian conflict days before the launch, found to his horror that hostilities were threatening to spread to a previously unremarked town of that name. Alarmed that it \u201ccould become as notorious as Guernica\u201d, he changed the spelling and held his breath.</p> <p>It was one of a number of courageous decisions \u2013 another being that Zeneca should not rush into a merger until the right partner (which turned out to be the Swedish Astra company) came along \u2013 that marked out Barnes\u2019s career.</p> <p>The son of Eric Barnes, a colonial official, and his wife, Jean, David was born in Blantyre, which was then in Nyasaland and is now Malawi\u2019s second largest city. At six he was sent on a perilous journey to prep school in wartime England. He was educated at Shrewsbury school, and during national service saw action in the Malayan emergency. With a passing resemblance to the young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/may/10/features\">Dirk Bogarde</a>, he sometimes seemed the quintessence of a 1950s Englishman pulling on his pipe and seeing no contradiction between enjoying both birdwatching and duck-shooting.</p> <p>At Shrewsbury, where he commanded the cadet force, a fascination with animal behaviour led him to long sessions dissecting in the biology labs before he enrolled for a veterinary degree at Liverpool University. The surprise was that he never finished, having been advised by his dean that he lacked application; Barnes\u2019s explanation was that he was too involved in university debating and reluctant to enter a profession so often required to kill its patients.</p> <p>Instead, he filled in time before national service as a lab assistant at the newly formed ICI pharmaceutical division at Alderley Edge, Cheshire. In 1960 he rejoined in the more substantive post of a commercial assistant and within four years was a section head in European sales. He met his future wife, Fiona Riddell, at Alderley and they married in 1963.</p> <p>In 1971 he became overseas director, working closely with the chairman Peter Cunliffe to build the division into a genuinely international business, becoming deputy chairman in 1977. His qualities were recognised by the wider ICI group with appointment in 1983 as chairman of its paints division. Barnes was credited once again with transforming a business into a genuinely international player, crowned by the acquisition of the US-based Glidden Paints in 1986, the year he was promoted to the ICI board.</p> <p>ICI had successfully grown its own pharmaceutical division, with world-beating heart and cancer drugs, but it competed with the older, capital-intensive heavy chemical businesses for investment. As the only commercial director who had grown up in the business, Barnes was a key advocate for its expansion. When ICI reshaped under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jan/11/ici.bbc\">John Harvey-Jones</a> to favour the newer businesses, Barnes continued to argue for more decisive action, \u201changing on to the jewels and getting rid of the tarnished tinsel\u201d.</p> <p>A passionate advocate of applied science, Barnes chaired the pharmaceutical economic development council of the National Economic Development Office,<strong> </strong>charting the issues for the industry for a decade until 1992 . He was an outspoken champion of research into genetic modification, which he saw as vital to feed the developing world. He was proud that ICI\u2019s development of GM tomatoes led to the first GM foodstuff \u2013 bestselling tomato paste \u2013 on UK supermarket shelves, calling the decision by supermarkets subsequently to withdraw it as \u201ca bit pusillanimous\u201d.</p> <p>The cyclical boom in heavy chemicals in the mid-1980s helped ICI to become the first UK company to post a \u00a31bn profit but obscured their longterm weakness. However, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/nov/03/guardianobituaries.obituaries\">Lord Hanson</a> took his run at ICI after the 1990 recession, it was obvious that not enough reshaping had been done and ICI management was spread over too many businesses. When the board took the bold decision in 1993 to demerge the bioscience business, primarily pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, Barnes was in the right place at the right time. As the only senior director with a strong pharmaceutical background he was the obvious choice for chief executive.</p> <p>He assumed command with the clarity of the good military commander he had once aspired to be. The new company would, he said, be \u201cbold and innovative\u201d and while he genuflected to \u201cthe best of the ICI heritage\u201d he made it clear that things would be done differently, establishing a relatively small head office, with fewer committees. His personal approachability and lack of pomposity set a refreshing tone. Pharmaceutical executives who had chafed under ICI control felt they were given freedom. One, Sir Tom McKillop, later chairman, described it as \u201chaving a great stone lifted from our backs\u201d.</p> <p>Zeneca\u2019s first months were marked by criticism, rebutted by Barnes, of its drugs pipeline \u2013 the potential of the drugs passing through its development labs \u2013 and its shares initially trailed ICI\u2019s. But under his calm direction Zeneca began to reach his target \u2013 recognition as one of the major quoted pharmaceutical companies in the world. Having been made CBE in 1987, he was knighted in 1996.</p> <p>Initially he resisted regular overtures for mergers, sometimes characterising rival alliances as \u201ctwo drunks holding each other up\u201d, and welded a disparate group of executives into a harmonious team.</p> <p> He was reluctant to move away from the \u201cthree-legged stool\u201d model of a bioscience business incorporating agrochemicals and specialty chemicals as well. But, once persuaded, he could move decisively. The specialties business was divested in 1998, and by 1997 the Swedish drugs firm Astra had been identified as a preferred partner. Talks were deferred while Astra attended to issues with its US subsidiary, but Barnes stayed in touch and when negotiations resumed it was the good relations he had established with his Astra counterparts that were decisive in affecting the merger. In particular, his decision as Zeneca chairman-elect to step back and take a supporting role, as one of two deputy chairmen, defused touchy corporate governance issues.</p> <p>Barnes stayed on for only two years, though he remained deputy chairman of Syngenta, the spinoff of AstraZeneca\u2019s and Novartis\u2019s agrochemical interests, until 2004.</p> <p>He directed his energies towards supporting his family and a range of pro bono activities. He was a governor of Ashridge business school in Hertfordshire, a deputy chairman of Business in the Community, and served on the governing bodies of his old school and university. He was active in the British Veterinary Association and cancer research and raised funds for the Thames Valley hospice.</p> <p>Barnes performed one more service for AstraZeneca when it was threatened by takeover by Pfizer in 2014. Emerging from retirement with a typically trenchant phrase he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2014/may/06/pfizer-offer-astrazeneca\">declared his concern</a> that Pfizer would \u201cact like praying mantis and suck the lifeblood out of their prey\u201d. He took the view that if Pfizer wanted the UK tax breaks they should build their own labs in Britain and not do it via a takeover. Pfizer walked away after its final offer was refused.</p> <p>Always a countryman, who declared he could never live in a town, Barnes took pleasure in restoring a narrowboat as well as fishing, shooting and walking.</p> <p>He is survived by Fiona and their son, Jonathan, and daughter, Alison.</p> <p>\u2022 James David Francis Barnes, businessman, born 4 March 1936; died 4 March 2020</p>",

But there is one form of crime that is keeping those rooms busy from 10am to 4pm each day.</p> \n<p>This month alone, 172 domestic violence cases have been listed before Manchester magistrates, ranging from allegations of grievous bodily harm to repeated breaches of restraining orders and verbal threats to kill. Most have ended up in court 4, colloquially known as the \u201cDV court\u201d and \u201cthe most depressing place in Manchester\u201d.</p> \n<p>Journalists no longer sit at the back, scribbling shorthand, straining to hear defendants\u2019 pleas in the bulletproof dock. Instead, they listen in from home.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>For four days this month, the Guardian listened in on court 4 to hear what was happening behind closed doors in lockdown. Charities have recorded <a href=\"https://www.refuge.org.uk/25-increase-in-calls-to-national-domestic-abuse-helpline-since-lockdown-measures-began/\">a 25% increase in calls</a> about domestic violence and police say incidents are up by 3% across England and Wales. But it is in courtrooms like these that a picture of what is going on in bad relationships under lockdown emerges under oath \u2013 where women regret letting their violent ex back to help out with the kids while schools are shut; where people lose their tempers in the kitchen and grab the nearest utensil to beat their partner; and where some victims are now applying to allow their abusers back home.</p> \n<p>One day the court heard a case involving an estranged couple who split up last year after a decade together. Police were called after the 28-year-old man is said to have made threats to kill his ex-partner in front of their small child. She had allowed him to move back in \u201cto make things easier\u201d during lockdown, the court heard. He became violent after she refused to get into bed with him.</p> \n<p>Neither were in court. There weren\u2019t even any lawyers present. Instead, a police officer went into the witness box to apply for a domestic violence protection order (DVPO). A bit like a restraining order, a DVPO is a protective measure designed to give breathing space to victims in the immediate aftermath of an incident by granting a temporary respite from their abuser and allowing for referral to support services. Crucially, they do not require a complainant to provide a witness statement and there does not need to be enough evidence to bring charges.</p> \n<p>The judge granted the DVPO, despite the woman refusing to cooperate with police. On Tuesday another was given against a 34-year-old man from Salford accused of punching his partner and ripping her top off so that she was naked from the waist up when police arrived. She did not support the order being made, the court heard, despite having called 999. Her partner had nowhere else to live during the lockdown and only enough money to stretch to two weeks in a hotel: the judge made the order for 14 days accordingly.</p> \n<p>On Thursday a 41-year-old man appeared in the dock accused of hitting his wife in the face with a pan in front of their daughter, requiring her to have stitches. He pleaded not guilty to actual bodily harm and was bailed on an electronic tag. He was told he would eventually stand trial, but no trial dates are currently being set, meaning the already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/feb/28/crown-courts-criminal-justice-backlog-lord-burnett-legal-aid\">over</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/feb/28/crown-courts-criminal-justice-backlog-lord-burnett-legal-aid\">burdened courts</a> will have to deal with a huge backlog when the lockdown is lifted.</p> \n<p>Bailing alleged abusers is posing a particular problem, with defendants required to keep their distance from complainants. Some have nowhere else to go, or are being bailed to live with elderly parents who may be shielding during the pandemic. Local authorities have told police they will find emergency accommodation for domestic abusers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/councils-told-to-house-all-rough-sleepers-in-england-by-weekend\">just as they </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/councils-told-to-house-all-rough-sleepers-in-england-by-weekend\">are doing for </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/councils-told-to-house-all-rough-sleepers-in-england-by-weekend\">homeless people</a>. But it is unclear how that is working in practice.</p> \n<p>Court 4 does not just deal with disputes between couples. Sometimes parents press charges against their violent children, though some are ready to forgive their abusive offspring.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday a woman from Moston in north Manchester applied to discharge a restraining order she had taken out against her 18-year-old son last August. He had been convicted of causing \u00a34,000 worth of damage to her home. She would take him back because he had promised not to hurt her again, the court heard. Her request was granted, after much discussion with probation and the youth offending services. Three other victims made similar applications to the court this month.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>In another case, a 15-year-old boy pleaded guilty to assaulting his mother by spitting at her and smashing a door in their house in Salford. He appeared in court with his social worker, who explained the boy had grown up surrounded by violence and that arrangements had been made to take him away from the home since the latest incident.</p> \n<p>On Thursday a 33-year-old woman was in the dock after allegedly threatening to kill her mother with a kitchen knife shortly after being released from a psychiatric unit. She wailed throughout the hearing. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it, she\u2019s lying,\u201d she cried as her lawyer asked for bail. It was denied. She will spend the lockdown on remand in jail.</p>",
  "<p>Living on lockdown has given us time to reflect. On ourselves, our relationships and what\u2019s important to us. For some of us, that means reaching out to old friends, or healing old wounds with people we once thought we\u2019d never speak to again. And in a way, the tech that helps us reconnect makes repairing those relationships easier: the screen gives us an element of safety, yet we can tap directly into those emotional connections we need to get us through this crisis.</p> <p>Here, three people who found isolation has had a positive effect on their relationships share their experiences \u2013 from building bridges, to creating the foundations for better communication, and reconnecting with family members they haven\u2019t spoken to in years \u2026</p> <p><strong>Emma*: \u2018Coronavirus gave me a reason to reach out to my brother\u2019<br></strong>\u201cI\u2019d always had a good relationship with my brother, but it came crashing down last Christmas when my family discovered he\u2019d been keeping his gambling addiction from us. He\u2019d even taken money from Mum, and I was upset that he could put her through so much stress \u2013 I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to speak to him. But after chatting to Mum over the past couple of weeks and hearing that he\u2019d been helping her with food deliveries while she\u2019s been in isolation, I decided to reach out. I sent him a text first and then he called me and we chatted about coronavirus and how we\u2019ve been coping \u2013 a few days later, he FaceTimed me and gave me a tour of his new flat that I\u2019ve never visited. I\u2019d wanted to reach out to him before, but I was struggling to know how, so while lockdown is a very weird situation, it gave us both an excuse to push our differences to one side.</p> <p>\u201cI also realised that life is too short \u2013 if my mum could move past what had happened, so could I. In fact, I\u2019m probably speaking to him more now than I ever did before.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Michael: \u2018Lockdown made me realise what\u2019s important\u2019<br></strong>\u201cMy ex-partner and I split a year ago and we share a young daughter, but our relationship has been really rocky ever since we broke up. We\u2019d fight all the time and nasty words would be fired back and forth at each other over text message. But when the lockdown happened, it really made me take a step back and think about what\u2019s important.</p> <p>\u201cI reached out to her via text and also sent her some money for petrol, as she is driving our daughter between our two houses during this time \u2013 I wanted to make sure she knew I appreciated that she was helping me to see my daughter. It has felt like a real turning point for us and our relationship and it\u2019s a really positive outcome from a situation that is out of our control. Now my daughter is with me and I\u2019ve been sending my ex-partner pictures and we\u2019ve been having civil conversations. Without this happening, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019d have ever reached this point.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Jo: \u2018I\u2019m connecting with family members I haven\u2019t spoken to in years\u2019<br></strong>\u201cWe have an extended family WhatsApp group made up of the descendants of my grandparents, both of whom sadly passed away recently. We used to use it every so often to share pictures from when people visited them, but over the years as individual families grew, and as my grandparents got more frail, we didn\u2019t have the same opportunities to gather together. And for some of the family, my only contact was an annual Christmas card. Since everyone has been staying at home for the past few weeks, though, the group has blown up with almost daily messages \u2013 pictures of the great-grandchildren doing their home school work, baking or learning to ride bikes without stabilisers in abandoned car parks.</p> <p>\u201cMy mum and dad both work in the NHS, with more than 60 years of service between them, so everyone shared videos from the 8pm clap for the NHS in recognition. And my brother, who\u2019s a musician, livestreamed a gig on Facebook and lots of the family who\u2019ve never had the opportunity to see him play before got to watch.

  "<p>In his 2015 debut novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/25/im-jack-by-mark-blacklock-review\">I\u2019m Jack</a></em>, Mark Blacklock focused his attention on the marginalised figure of John Humble, more popularly known as Wearside Jack, or the Yorkshire Ripper hoaxer. The thrust of that novel resides in the war of nerves between Humble and Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield, the senior investigating officer in the Ripper investigation. Oldfield infamously fell so hard for Humble\u2019s hoax that he ignored key evidence from Ripper survivors in pursuit of his own mistaken quest for Wearside Jack.</p> <p>In Blacklock\u2019s new novel, the gritty reality of late 20th-century urban deprivation is replaced by the more outwardly sedate, conservatively hidebound milieu of late 19th-century intellectual bohemia, familiar to modern readers only through the tinted lens of period drama. <em>Hinton</em> manages not only to keep faith with the principles of what Blacklock has referred to as \u201cdocumentary realism\u201d laid out in <em>I\u2019m Jack</em>, but to expand and consolidate the author\u2019s overarching project as a writer. As with the baseline biographical details assembled in <em>I\u2019m Jack</em>, readers curious enough to check the dates on the timeline in <em>Hinton</em> will discover that all of them tally with recorded history: Blacklock is leading us once again into the uneasy liminal space between fact and fiction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bde3591bddc291d8daf61df595173f3fed7bd18c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bde3591bddc291d8daf61df595173f3fed7bd18c/0_0_325_457/325.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Hinton\" width=\"325\" height=\"457\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The problem of genius \u2026 Charles Hinton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>British mathematician Charles Howard Hinton was born in 1853, the son of James Hinton, a pedagogue-philosopher and an early advocate of polyamory. He grew up surrounded by men and women of letters whose enthusiasms flowed freely, firing him with a similar zeal for learning. Combined with his own precocious talent for mathematics, he looked set for a stellar career in the sciences. In 1880, Hinton married Mary Edith Boole, daughter of George Boole the mathematician. Mary soon became pregnant, giving birth in 1882 to George, the first of four sons. Early in 1883, Hinton bigamously married Maud Florence, who at the time was carrying his twins. When the deception became known, he surrendered himself to police and was sentenced to three days\u2019 imprisonment. His career ruined, he was forced to emigrate, first to Japan and then to America where, away from the scene of his misadventures, his reputation gradually recovered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"93b8e89a60f199e22cb7d0eed562e4174287729a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93b8e89a60f199e22cb7d0eed562e4174287729a/0_0_3266_3868/844.jpg\" alt=\"The Monument to the Constitution in Madrid\" width=\"844\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Monument to the Constitution in Madrid is a geometric representation of a fourth dimensional analog of a cube.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: agefotostock/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hinton died of a stroke in 1907, at the age of 53. In the US, he was briefly famous as the inventor of the world\u2019s first mechanical baseball pitcher. In the world of science fiction, he has been more broadly influential for the stories and short novels he based on his 1883 essay \u201cWhat is the Fourth Dimension?\u201d an early theory of what might now be recognised as quantum geometry. Hinton referred to his tales as \u201cscientific romances\u201d, and there is a strong likelihood that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/13/hg-wells-visions-of-the-future-remain-unsurpassed\">HG Wells</a> was influenced by Hinton in his own later popularising of the term, as well as his enthusiasm for similar ideas \u2013 Hinton\u2019s 1895 novella \u201cStella\u201d, for example, introduces the theme of invisibility expanded on by Wells in<em> The Invisible Man</em>. Hinton\u2019s obsession with Edwin Abbot\u2019s 1885 proto-science fiction novel <em>Flatland</em> resulted in the 1907 homage <em>An Episode of Flatland</em>, which in its preoccupation with temporal and spatial dimensions has left a lasting influence on multiple generations of science fiction writers, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/20/ten-things-you-should-know-about-hp-lovecraft\">HP Lovecraft</a> to Rudy Rucker.</p> <p>In spite of his achievements, Hinton\u2019s name has drifted into obscurity, and the bald facts of his life provide only the framework for Blacklock\u2019s imaginative reconstruction of a personality that both defied and was ultimately overmastered by the social and intellectual conventions of his time. Indeed, it would be more accurate to say that <em>Hinton</em> is a novel of multiple personalities, tracing not only one adventurous life but filling in the shadowy biographical outlines of his family and descendents, a still-extending line of figures who seem equally extraordinary.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The imagined sections are so well in tune with their contemporary source material that we believe in them utterly</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The overarching subject of <em>Hinton</em> lies in the problem of genius, not only for the ostracised radical possessed of it but for those caught in his tailwind, experiencing the gradual erosion of their autonomy and mental wellbeing. Thus the emotional heartland of Blacklock\u2019s novel belongs to its supporting cast. Both Hinton\u2019s wives were intellectually and creatively gifted, women denied their full potential through a frustrating combination of society and circumstance, while the attention afforded by Blacklock to Mary\u2019s four children offers up some of the novel\u2019s most mesmerising and immersive writing. They exist in a rarefied atmosphere of learning and scholarly opportunity, yet what most flourishes in each of them is a yearning for escape, for self-realisation in a world that appears to be missing a dimension.</p> <p>The artistry of <em>Hinton</em> appears seamless, the imagined sections so well in tune with their contemporary source material that we believe in them utterly. Equally, Blacklock\u2019s introduction of unadulterated source materials into the text, most notably letters exchanged between Havelock Ellis, Olive Schreiner and other members of statistician Karl Pearson\u2019s Men and Women\u2019s Club (a forum for freethinkers that flourished during the 1880s) grants the illusion of incontrovertible reality, even as elusive missing pieces deny us closure.</p> <p>From the remarkable facts about the Hintons, Blacklock weaves a distinct and original fiction, a fittingly four-dimensional representation of lived reality. Questions of societal convention versus individual freedom and Classical enlightenment versus Romantic self-expression play themselves out against a backdrop that, as we familiarise ourselves with its complexities, jumps glowingly to life. This is a dense, multilayered, knotty book, demanding the reader\u2019s full cooperation. But Blacklock\u2019s attention to detail, his imaginative reach, not to mention his willingness to wrestle with problems of geometry, have produced a singular literary achievement.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Hinton by Mark Blacklock is published by Granta (\u00a316.99).

  "<p>Beginning where most disaster movies end \u2013 with cities ruined and civilisation in utter disarray \u2013 XCOM: Chimera Squad is about the horrifying aftermath of an alien invasion. Our heroic band of scientists and soldiers may have defeated the extraterrestrial conquerors at the end of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/05/xcom-2-review-best-strategy-game-ever-truth-is-in-here\">acclaimed strategy sequel XCOM 2</a>, but the world they won back is barely functioning. One squad member mentions that he\u2019s from Canada before acknowledging that this was when such a thing existed. A mission briefing notes that hard cash is the only currency after the implosion of the global financial system.</p> <p>To complicate things further, the aliens are still here. The stranded remnants of the invasion force are trying their best to assimilate into human society, with varying degrees of success. And even the very notion of humanity is in flux thanks to the widespread creation of human-alien hybrids during the occupation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b304851e5dbd573edb2cd1a93da952f6880bdbb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b304851e5dbd573edb2cd1a93da952f6880bdbb1/86_0_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"More finessed battles \u2026 XCOM Chimera Squad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">More finessed battles \u2026 XCOM Chimera Squad</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: XCOM Chimera Squad</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chimera Squad takes place in City 31, which is not unlike the Los Angeles depicted in 1980s sci-fi franchise Alien Nation. In an experiment in integration, humans and aliens live alongside each other \u2013 and the city\u2019s police force has to reflect the multi-species make-up of the people it\u2019s protecting. Players must command a squad of human, alien and hybrid law enforcers, harnessing their various abilities to tackle a new threat to the city\u2019s uneasy peace.</p> <p>Lizard woman Torque can lash out her tongue and yank enemies from across the map; Axiom the Muton can race up to foes and pound them into meat with his fists; and Verge, a former Thin Man (the infiltration arm of the alien\u2019s invasion force), can access enemies\u2019 minds and control them like puppets. After years of being tormented by these abilities in previous XCOM games, it\u2019s wonderfully cathartic to finally use them for yourself.</p> <p>Then again, not much else has really changed. In essence, Chimera Squad is XCOM 2 with some genetic splicing. The base building is gone, although you\u2019re still tasked with researching weaponry and training recruits in between fights, and the scope is limited to a single city rather than the whole planet. But now you have a permanent crew of unique characters, and battles are smaller and more finessed.</p> <p>Rather than attacking with your team then waiting with fingers crossed for the computer to have its go, in Chimera Squad you can see the order in which each combatant will make their move. This allows you to focus assaults on the enemy who will attack next, and even change the turn order with special moves. It\u2019s satisfying to work your way through a room, methodically picking off the most urgent threats, although it does tend to make the game a little easier than its predecessor.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZnpl3hWfVM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aZnpl3hWfVM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Perhaps the most radical change is the introduction of a team of superheroes with unique abilities; battles can play out very differently accordingly to which squad members you select. The flipside is that, unlike in XCOM 2, the characters cannot die. If they bleed out, you\u2019re simply sent back to the last save. This takes away some of the tension of the previous games, all those times spent agonising over whether to press on or replay a lengthy level because one of your squad bought it at the end. Still, the little snippets of characterisation are welcome in what can be a clinical genre \u2013 although the developers could have gone further, perhaps adding crew-specific missions as in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/jan/14/mass-effect-2-game-review\">Mass Effect 2</a>, or something akin to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/jul/25/fire-emblem-three-houses-review-nintendo-switch\">Fire Emblem</a>\u2019s relationship building.</p> <p>XCOM: Chimera Squad is essentially the Agents of Shield to XCOM 2\u2019s Avengers. It gently plays with the formula, and tells the peripheral stories of a much wider world on a much tighter budget and with much smaller stakes. In other words, it\u2019s XCOM but chilled \u2013 and, in these desperate times, that\u2019s just fine.</p>",

So, we just need to look at what is reasonable in the circumstance. <br></p> \n   <p>Obviously New Zealand is a very low-risk country for us given the very low numbers of cases, and people would have to go into quarantine in accordance with the state jurisdiction\u2019s Department of Health requirements so, if the Warriors were to come into NSW or Queensland they would have to go through two weeks of isolation, as would be the case for everybody else \u2026 we just need to clarify what [Palaszczuk\u2019s] position is and the position of the premiers otherwise, so there\u2019s a lot of work to do but we all want to see it up and started as soon as possible.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T01:49:54.574Z\">at 2.49am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea0efdb8f084784dca58448\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T01:31:29.500Z\">2.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Well, something didn\u2019t go to plan <br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jekearsley/status/1253132555030638592\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Chief Medical Office Professor Brendan Murphy says authorities including NSW Health carried out a training exercise in May last year = for a cruise ship arriving into Sydney - with a pandemic on board. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/9NewsAUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@9newsaus</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#auspol</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RubyPrincess?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#RubyPrincess</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coronavirus</a></p>\u2014 Jonathan Kearsley (@jekearsley) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jekearsley/status/1253132555030638592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 23, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea0ef278f08a1178d5b00d2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T01:29:52.313Z\">2.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The AFL is preparing to restart its season:<br></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/23/sydney-should-be-considered-for-hub-as-afl-prepares-to-set-return-date\">Sydney 'should be considered' for hub as AFL prepares to set return date</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>There are no AFL islands being discussed, but there are hubs.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Mason Cox </strong>had a few things to say about how his homeland was handling the pandemic.

  "<p>A car driven by an active duty airman has crashed close to the scene of the death of Harry Dunn, the 19-year-old motorcyclist who died after a collision with a car driven on the wrong side of the road by the wife of a US diplomat.</p> <p>The report of the new crash highlights concerns that overseas personnel are not trained sufficiently about UK driving laws, especially driving on the left.</p> <p>The crash that led to Dunn\u2019s death occurred after Anne Sacoolas had been driving for some distance on the wrong side of the road. The local MP Andrea Leadsom has been contacted by the Harry Dunn campaign and said she would be in touch with Northamptonshire police over the latest incident.</p> <p>Radd Seiger, the spokesman for the Dunn campaign, tweeted a picture of the right-hand drive crashed car that had ploughed into a wall after turning a corner. No one appears to have been injured.</p> <p>Seiger complained: \u201cUnbelievably, under current legal arrangements, even though US bases are on sovereign UK soil, UK authorities are unable to exercise any control over what goes on there. Several disasters have occurred, including that of Harry Dunn. How many more does there need to be?\u201d</p> <p>Dunn\u2019s family are campaigning for the extradition of Sacoolas back to the UK to face a charge of death by reckless driving.</p> <p>The latest development came as the most senior civil servant in the Foreign Office said Britain had agreed to let Sacoolas return to the US on the basis of an \u201capparently illogical\u201d interpretation of the law on diplomatic immunity. He also revealed the interpretation followed discussions between British government and US government lawyers.</p> <p>The description of this interpretation given to the foreign affairs select committee by Sir Simon McDonald, the permanent undersecretary and head of the diplomatic service, will add fuel to the efforts of the Dunn family to mount a judicial review of the Foreign Office\u2019s decision-making in the case. A dispute over disclosure of papers to the Dunn family lawyers has held up the review\u2019s start.</p> <p>The Foreign Office accepted a US government claim that as the wife of a CIA agent working at the US intelligence base RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire, Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity. She was allowed to return to the US with her family, days after driving her car on the wrong side of the road on 27 August and crashing into Dunn on his motorcycle.</p> <p>The Crown Prosecution Service has subsequently charged her with causing death by reckless driving, but the US government has rejected the British extradition request.</p> <p>It has now emerged that the UK Foreign Office lawyers discussed her diplomatic status with their US state department counterparts in the immediate aftermath of Dunn\u2019s death \u2013 and initially advised British ministers on 30 August that there was legal ambiguity about her standing.</p> <p>But then, according to a report in the Mail on Sunday, the Foreign Office told Northamptonshire police on 2 September that Sacoolas had full immunity and no prosecution was possible. So within three full working days of the crash, the Foreign Office had sided with a US interpretation of what McDonald described to the committee as \u201ca recondite bit of law\u201d. Sacoolas left the UK on 16 September.</p> <p>In the fullest high-level explanation of the events subsequent to Dunn\u2019s death, McDonald told the select committee on Tuesday: \u201cIn the case of Harry Dunn, the controversy was over an agreement made at the end of the last century over continuing immunities for US diplomats posted at the Croughton annex.</p> <p>\u201cIn that agreement the American authorities gave a pre-waiver for accredited diplomats so that was the formal position, but that agreement was silent on the rights of their dependants, and that has been the origin of a lot of the dispute. But our legal advice is that when an agreement is silent on something, then what pertained before still applies \u2013 ie immunity.\u201d</p> <p>McDonald told committee members this was a \u201crecondite bit of law\u201d, and the interpretation of the law was \u201ca bit illogical\u201d.</p> <p>The illogicality arose since the US and UK lawyers had mutually decided that, even though the immunity of the diplomat working at the base had clearly been waived by the US in the agreement, that of the dependant had not.</p> <p>Chris Bryant, a Labour member of the foreign affairs select committee, said: \u201cIt seems surprising the Foreign Office would accept an anomaly such as a dependant of a diplomat enjoying greater immunity than the diplomat himself.</p> <p>\u201cYou would have expected at the very least that the Foreign Office would not side with this dubious American interpretation of the law, but instead leap to the defence of a British citizen.\u201d</p> <p>A subsequent internal Foreign Office review has concluded the legal status of dependants at the Croughton base was anomalous, and the UK is now seeking to renegotiate the agreement with the US.</p> <p>The Dunn family have written to the Foreign Office suggesting that no diplomat or dependant should be allowed to work or reside in the UK without first signing a pre-waiver of immunity. The family admit such a requirement would be unprecedented, but said the UK should lead the way in clarifying an anomalous and abused law.</p> <p>McDonald was clear that only the Foreign Office, and not the police, can determine the issue of someone\u2019s diplomatic immunity: \u201cThe police force does not determine immunity. The police ask the Foreign Office about immunity matters.\u201d</p>",

The country, which avoided sweeping shutdown measures throughout March, appeared to have contained the virus.</p> \n<p>But rights groups say little attention was paid to migrant workers who, despite the pandemic, continued to live in close quarters, and spent hours a day travelling on the back of crowded lorries to get to and from construction sites. \u201cThe way the workers were stacked in [on the back of lorries], it was like the way goats are stacked in when they are taken to a slaughter house,\u201d says B, a second worker, who also asked to be anonymous.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Activists say they raised concerns about the risks posed by the virus to migrant workers as early as February. In March, the campaign group Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) said <a href=\"http://twc2.org.sg/2020/03/23/straits-times-forum-employers-practices-leave-foreign-workers-vulnerable-to-infection/\">the risk of an outbreak among this community was \u201cundeniable\u201d</a>.</p> \n<h2>Inequality laid bare</h2> \n<p>When clusters began to emerge, the government moved 7,000 workers, mostly people who do essential jobs such as working on power plants, out of the buildings. About 293,000 remain housed in such facilities. Authorities say they will prioritise relocating older people. Cleaning services have been increased to improve hygiene, officials say, and meals are also being delivered to prevent workers needing to use communal kitchens.</p> \n<p>The outbreak has brought to the surface the glaring inequality in Singapore, which relies heavily on a workforce of about a million migrant workers to build its famous skyscrapers, and clean its gleaming shopping malls. Most have travelled to the country from Bangladesh, India and other south Asian countries, in the hope of sending money back home. Their lifestyles are a stark contrast to the country\u2019s wealthy elite and financial workers.</p> \n<p>Kokila Annamalai, a local activist who supports migrant workers, fears that the spread of Covid-19 within the dormitories has fanned the flames of xenophobia and racism. She points to comments made online and in the media. \u201cOn top of [the view that] \u2018it\u2019s their fault for not being clean and for their eating habits\u2019 and things like that, there is also this almost worse mindset of \u2018they\u2019re driving our numbers up and it makes us look bad on the world stage, and they should go home\u2019,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>While such remarks have been condemned by Singapore\u2019s home affairs and law minister, Kasiviswanathan Shanmugam, campaigners say official messages have also been unhelpful. Workers have been urged to \u201cbe responsible\u201d, wear face masks at all times, report symptoms to their dormitory operators and stay at least one metre from one another.</p> \n<p>A recent study by Mohan Dutta, a professor at Massey University in New Zealand, suggests such guidance is often just impractical. The overwhelming majority of about 100 workers surveyed said they were unable to maintain such a distance at all times. More than half described their rooms as unhygienic.</p> \n<p>Just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/singapores-cramped-migrant-worker-dorms-hide-covid-19-surge-risk\">last week</a>, workers reported that they did not have enough soap to wash their hands.</p> \n<h2>\u2018I had no idea I would have to live like this\u2019</h2> \n<p>Workers are generally reluctant to voice complaints. Most take out huge debts in order to work in Singapore, often to find on arrival that they will be paid less than promised. A typical salary is around S$500-750 (\u00a3285-\u00a3425) a month. They are required to hold temporary work permits, but these are tied to their employer, making them extremely vulnerable to exploitation.</p> \n<p>B sold his family land and took loans so he could afford to pay an agency about S$7,000 to work in Singapore, where he hoped he would earn a high salary. As the eldest son, he is responsible for supporting his extended family, as well as his own wife and children. He knew that he would be required to work hard in Singapore, but his body was unprepared for the long hours of heavy lifting on construction sites. He did not expect that he would live, initially, in a container with eight others. \u201c[I] had no idea that I would have to live like this and be in this much pain,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8d01dce0d52080a96cffc9955df7ec657cff8e7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8d01dce0d52080a96cffc9955df7ec657cff8e7/0_65_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Singapore\u2019s skyscrapers were built on migrant labour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Singapore\u2019s skyscrapers were built on migrant labour.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edgar Su/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Now, about a decade later, he says he is at least lucky to share a dorm room with just 12 people \u2013 fewer than many of his peers, and a contrast to his previous room, which had virtually no natural light. A also shares a room with 12 others. The heat is so suffocating, that everyone sleeps on the floor, he says. He is afraid to use the communal toilets, which are unclean.</p> \n<p>Many in Singapore are sympathetic towards the workers. \u201cThey deserve more. They deserve what every Singaporean deserves,\u201d says William Lai, a photographer. \u201cI don\u2019t know what is going through the minds of these people [who blame workers] ... It is not their fault. They don\u2019t want to be affected by this.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a speech this week, Singapore\u2019s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, said migrant workers would be cared for in the same way as Singaporeans: \u201cWe will look after your health, your welfare and your livelihood.\u201d Almost all the migrant workers infected have only mild symptoms, he added.</p> \n<p>Dutta believes the crisis could present an opportunity to reform how migrant workers are treated, but he added that small tweaks would not be enough. \u201cSubstantive changes are needed in how Singapore looks at migrant workers, what rights migrant workers have, and how they are able to advocate for their own health and wellbeing,\u201d says Dutta.</p> \n<p>B says that, for a start, migrant worker dormitories should be more strictly controlled, with caps on the number of workers allowed per room and per bathroom facilities. \u201cIt is not like Singapore cannot regulate it.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThis entire city is built on our labour and on our hard work,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat tells you what you need to be told about the culture that we bring, and how our culture makes up the clean and sparkling facade of the city.\u201d</p> \n<p>Workers, he adds, do not expect special kindness, just their basic labour rights.</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Redwan Ahmed</em></p>",
  "<p>A select committee hearing is not normally a place culture vultures go to spot works of art. Yet last week, eagle-eyed folk watching the health secretary, Matt Hancock, face a (remote) grilling on coronavirus couldn\u2019t help spot something in the background: a garish image of the Queen overlaid with blue and pink spray-paint. <a href=\"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/blog/hancock-and-hirst-health-secretary-matt-hancock-delivers-six-point-covid-19-battle-plan-in-front-of-spin-painting-of-the-queen\">The Art Newspaper</a> confirmed that it was one of Damien Hirst\u2019s \u201cspin paintings\u201d, donated to the government in 2015. It wasn\u2019t hard to make the obvious link: a hapless health minister addressing the nation, accompanied by spin.</p> <p>Since cities around the world have locked down, people starved of culture have been finding their kicks where they can \u2013 and often this means other people\u2019s offices and living rooms. <a href=\"http://mitchellalgusgallery.com/landing.html\">Gallerist</a> Mitchel Algus was one of the first to find fun in spying the art lurking in the background when prominent figures appeared on TV in their own homes.</p> <p>\u201cI watch the PBS nightly news and when [former US treasury secretary] Lawrence Summers came on I noticed the Mir\u00f3 behind him,\u201d says Algus. \u201cIt was just a print but I knew the painting [Bleu II, 1961]. And then I thought, \u2018Now let\u2019s see what else people have.\u201d </p> <p>Algus posted the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-R96Ipl9RK/\">image of Summers</a> on his Instagram account, along with snaps of other journalists, experts and business people with their home artwork. Even when the art wasn\u2019t interesting, Algus enjoyed \u201cthe voyeurism in seeing people\u2019s homes and what they choose to put behind themselves\u201d.</p> <p>Algus was fascinated when a screengrab emerged of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-4cQUKHJBR/\">Alex Rodriguez</a>, Jennifer Lopez\u2019s husband and a former baseball superstar, talking on MSNBC with a work on his wall by <a href=\"https://www.sadiecoles.com/publications/184/\">Jonathan Horowitz</a> \u2013 an appropriation of an earlier Roy Lichtenstein painting.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was interesting was how people at that level all have art advisers who push the same crap on them,\u201d says Algus. \u201cIt\u2019s the same kind of art-advised art that a lot of people have \u2013 like Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. It\u2019s interesting to be able to see how very wealthy people interact with the art world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f81e05b42815e1d4297ab44450ab817ad9753ca8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f81e05b42815e1d4297ab44450ab817ad9753ca8/39_63_2490_1495/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nancy Pelosi appears on MSNBC before a colourful background.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nancy Pelosi appears on MSNBC before a colourful background.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MSNBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Matthew Higgs, the UK-born curator and director of White Columns in New York, has picked up the baton. On Instagram, he has been <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-o2lVxndOk/\">posting images</a> of interviewees and their art from news reports.</p> <p>Among those collected by Higgs were Democratic Senate leader <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-_G1kxnlCF/\">Chuck Schumer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-7pCRpndyY/\">Thomas Frieden</a>, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, both with hanging art that landed somewhere between minimalist and abstract. Nancy Pelosi, the senior Democrat in Congress, appeared on MSNBC with a painting thick with brush strokes and swipes of colour. After some <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-qUrMSnL5H/\">online sleuthing</a> it emerged that it was by the Chicago artist Wesley Kimler (who confirmed it in a comment under Higgs\u2019s Instagram post).</p> <p>\u201cAll of sudden we have these glimpses of other people\u2019s realities that we normally wouldn\u2019t have access to,\u201d says Higgs.</p> <p>Art has always been interwoven with the wider culture in unexpected ways. Higgs points to <a href=\"https://www.petzel.com/exhibitions/allan-mccollum2\">Allan McCollum</a> who, in his Perpetual Photos series from the 1980s, took snapshots of his television whenever he saw a framed artwork on screen, and would then enlarge that image. In 1993, the German artist Timm Ulrichs published a book, <em>Kunst und Leben </em>(Art and Life), that collected images from old pornographic magazines where reproductions of famous art were visible in the background. \u201cIt\u2019s thinking about domestic space and how culture finds its way into those spaces,\u201d says Higgs.</p> <p>In the mid 90s, the conceptual artist Mel Chin persuaded the makers of the LA-based soap opera <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/arts/design/the-plot-to-put-conceptual-art-on-melrose-place-yes-really.html\">Melrose Place</a> to let him create original art, objects and props to be placed in the backgrounds of sets, in characters\u2019 homes and workplaces. Chin put together a 100-strong team of largely unknown artists, billing themselves as the Gala Committee, to make art for the show \u2013 often bearing subversive or topical messages. In 2016 it was displayed in a gallery show.</p> <p>Today, the art world is trying desperately hard to reach house-bound audiences. The larger galleries are providing some remote access to their collections and big shows, or attempting educational offerings. Commercial galleries have set up online \u201cviewing rooms\u201d \u2013 a number of small galleries in London have teamed with behemoth dealer David Zwirner to create such a <a href=\"https://www.davidzwirner.com/viewing-room/platform-london\">platform</a>; there\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.davidzwirner.com/viewing-room/platform-new-york\">New York</a> version, too.

I miss that in-person perambulatory relationship with culture.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/08-04-2020-who-timeline---covid-19\">The dates</a> are by now well-rehearsed. 31 December: China informs the World Health Organisation that cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause have been detected in Wuhan. 20 January: human-to-human transmission is confirmed. 24 January: scientists publish <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext\">an article in the Lancet </a>noting the coronavirus\u2019s \u201cpandemic potential\u201d. 9 March: Italy imposes a national quarantine and enters lockdown. To this list of key moments, we can now add 24 March: Slavoj \u017di\u017eek\u2019s publisher announces that he has written a book about coronavirus.</p> <p>That\u2019s roughly 100 days between the outbreak of Covid-19 and \u017di\u017eek firing up the presses. It\u2019s an impressive feat, and for a prolific philosopher-provocateur known for his use of humour, feels like it was designed to be the punchline to a gag: what reproduces itself more quickly, the coronavirus or the commentary?</p> <p>But <em>Pandemic!: Covid-19 Shakes the World</em> is thin on humour. In fact, \u017di\u017eek wonders aloud whether he should exercise caution with his distinctive flights of conceptual fancy, given his \u201c(as yet) safe external position\u201d from the widespread suffering. He doesn\u2019t. Over the course of the short book, he enlists those typically \u017di\u017eekian thinkers and tactics \u2013 Hegel, Lacan, an analogy for capitalism\u2019s health derived from Quentin Tarantino\u2019s <em>Kill Bill</em> \u2013 to form 10 impressionistic chapters. Each circles a different subject, very occasionally landing on the thesis: a \u201cnew form of what was once called communism\u201d is needed to avoid this pandemic resolving into a global nightmare.</p> <p>The opening gambit is to use Jesus Christ\u2019s injunction on resurrection to Mary \u2013 \u201cTouch me not\u201d \u2013 to explain how social distancing can underwrite solidarity. \u017di\u017eek describes himself as a \u201cChristian atheist\u201d, so it\u2019s not a surprising start and is also a little too neat. An odd chapter on \u201cPutogan\u201d, a portmanteau of Russia and Turkey\u2019s leaders, allows him to write about the refugee crisis, oddly implying that it is the main challenge facing European \u201coperational unity\u201d during the pandemic. \u201cPolitical correctness\u201d, one of the philosopher\u2019s bugbears, is mentioned twice. It\u2019s hard to shake off a sense that \u017di\u017eek, with the speed and efficiency of a just-in-time production line, has simply corralled events into a shape that fits his pre-existing interests and logical operations.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u017di\u017eek powerfully makes the point that the moral task during this pandemic is to alleviate suffering, not to 'economise'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is nothing inherently wrong with that. But what in the book works? There is a nice passage that counters the view that humanity is being \u201cpunished\u201d by this epidemic for exploiting the natural world. \u017di\u017eek thinks that such arguments have a reassuring function, since they assume that humans \u201cmatter in some profound way\u201d; the really difficult thing to accept is that this \u201cstupid self-replicating mechanism\u201d, as he describes the virus, \u201chides no deeper meaning\u201d. He is at his most powerful \u2013 useful, even \u2013 when simply pointing out that the moral task during this pandemic is to alleviate suffering, not to \u201ceconomise\u201d. There is something profoundly radical in the way states have adhered to this anti-economistic logic by locking down, and the temptation to return to \u201cnormal\u201d at the expense of the sick must be resisted.</p> <p>That said, \u017di\u017eek has an inner liberal that stops him from praising China\u2019s leaders \u2013 pioneers of the lockdown \u2013 for their handling of the crisis. He endorses journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/verna-yu\">Verna Yu</a>\u2019s comment that \u201cif China valued free speech, there would be no coronavirus crisis\u201d, in reference to the muzzling of whistleblowers. This disguises an inconvenient truth: as the months pass, China will likely emerge as the most effective superpower at dealing with the pandemic; the comparison with the poorly organised systems centred in Washington and Brussels is already stark. A crisis of legitimacy will follow and in anticipation of this \u2013 to find a way out of the binary between an incompetent western barbarism and ruthlessly efficient eastern totalitarianism \u2013 \u017di\u017eek plumbs the present to find the unfolding of a latent \u201ccommunism\u201d.</p> <p>When \u017di\u017eek uses the term \u201ccommunism\u201d he is not talking about the \u201cold-style\u201d states of the 20th century, he tells us, but the necessity for a \u201cglobal organisation that can control and regulate the economy as well as limit the sovereignty of nation states when needed\u201d, and a coordinated shift away from the market. He sees stirrings of this in the massive mobilisation of state resources to pay private sector wages, nationalise services and direct industrial production.</p> <p>When Donald Trump is issuing cheques to millions of Americans, and a Conservative British government is effectively <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/29/northern-rail-franchise-to-be-renationalised\">nationalising the railways</a>, old orthodoxies melt into air. And what further encourages \u017di\u017eek is that this newfound solidarity is not based on leftwing idealistic sloganeering, but bare necessity. In Israel, the prime minister Benjamin<strong> </strong>Netanyahu \u201cimmediately offered help and coordination to the Palestinian authorities\u201d to fight coronavirus because, as \u017di\u017eek puts it, \u201cif one group is affected, the other will inevitably also suffer\u201d. Communism is the translation of this epidemiological reality into a durable politics.</p> <p>Though this is interesting, it\u2019s an image of communism that lacks a central scene: the fate of the working class. In the global south, where most of the world\u2019s labourers live, millions find themselves desperate and immediately without income. In countries where there are fewer ventilators than cabinet members, where social distancing in crowded slums is impossible, where debt repayments to western creditors are set to rise, where there are no powerful central banks to issue bonds that investors will trust, \u017di\u017eek\u2019s \u201ccommunism\u201d means little. And contrary to his sketch of the situation in Israel, reports show Palestinians are worried about coronavirus overwhelming the West Bank after one sick labourer was \u201cunceremoniously dumped\u201d at the border by Israeli police. Israel has also linked the political conditions of returning captured soldiers to any future coronavirus-aid to Gaza, Reuters reports. It turns out the logic of domination trumps even the rationalism of \u201cbiological\u201d solidarity.</p> <p>\u017di\u017eek has spent his career writing in anticipation of a world-historic moment like the coronavirus pandemic, a truly totalising event that would allow the Hegelian philosopher \u2013 Hegel\u2019s being a totalising philosophy \u2013 to deploy his skills on the frontline. But this first attempt from our philosophical key-worker is forgettable. It\u2019s frustrating, because there are moments when his analysis would be clearly useful, as when he asks: \u201cWhere does data end and ideology begin?\u201d It\u2019s a vital question as we spend our days glued to fatality graphs, but he doesn\u2019t answer it. That, as he argues, \u201cthe virus hides no deeper meaning\u201d must be a chilling prospect indeed.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Pandemic!: Covid-19 Shakes the World by Slavoj \u017di\u017eek is published by OR Books and is available from <a href=\"http://www.orbooks.com/\">www.orbooks.com</a></em></p>",
  "<p>\u2018Where\u2019s the drop?\u201d This was a complaint often howled at festivals or in YouTube comment sections during the EDM years (usually by a hench guy in a vest), when mainstream dance was all about extreme peaks and troughs. They would get annoyed if a track just simmered without delivering a thunderous pay-off, accompanied by a blast of confetti, which in turn was annoying, because for many people the simmering \u2013 the coiling tension as a track builds or is allowed to just <em>be</em> \u2013 is the best bit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bc3ae488569b59d76af25db9db0c7e5ea9796dfb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc3ae488569b59d76af25db9db0c7e5ea9796dfb/0_0_3000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lorenzo Senni: Scacco Matto album art work\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lorenzo Senni: Scacco Matto album art work</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Taking this to the extreme is <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/sennilorenzo\">Lorenzo Senni</a>, an Italian arthouse trance producer who puts the palette of rave music to experimental, yet still euphoric, ends. He came of age away from dance music in the Rimini hardcore punk scene, perhaps helping him to now ask the questions that other producers don\u2019t: why have lulls and crescendoes? Why even have beats at all?</p> <p>His 2012 debut album <a href=\"https://www.tinymixtapes.com/music-review/lorenzo-senni-quantum-jelly\">Quantum Jelly</a> explored the minimalist compositional potential of trashy rave synths, which was a laudable punk provocation and also a little bit boring, with a narrow dynamic range. But with <a href=\"https://thequietus.com/articles/16189-lorenzo-senni-superimpositions-review\">Superimpositions </a>(2014), his music started to open up, taking our pleasure centres with it; his career can be seen as a scientific exploration into the sheer effect of electronic music, honing and intensifying it to provoke the strongest possible response.</p> <p>With further tracks such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2AEex59eVM\">Win in the Flat World</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-INk1qkPEw\">Rave Voyeur</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFKOMhu88bY\">The Shape of Trance to Come</a>, his method approached an almost dangerous perfection. He sustained the breakdown sections of dance tracks in perpetuity, making you cover your face with your hands because you couldn\u2019t handle any more glorious stimulus. To be kept in this state of permanently delayed gratification induces a kind of madness; were it a Hollywood movie, this is the point where the suits funding the experiment would say from behind reinforced glass: \u201cShut it down. Shut it down!\u201d</p> <p>But Senni continues to ratchet up the intensity on this new album. He uses his widest range of sound yet but maintains focus by resisting, as he always has done, the inclusion of vocals or drums. This is one of the great and joyous paradoxes of his music, which is still intensely percussive \u2013 synths are planed down and combined into hard bolts of sound that have the rhythmic strength of a drum machine \u2013 but freed from the shackles of looped drum patterns. Opener Discipline of Enthusiasm is full of this toughness, but funkily hops from one foot to another, a heavyweight with the speed of a bantam.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UH2tqHTi_M\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0UH2tqHTi_M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>He scales up melodically too, with some decidedly rococo tunes fluting through XBreakingEdgeX and Move in Silence (Only Speak When It\u2019s Time to Say Checkmate). While they slightly overreach and verge on fussiness, there is still a wonderful exuberance to them. The central section, a pair of ballads, is stronger. Canone Infinito showcases a distinct Senni tone, a pealing yet distorted sound that faintly resembles an electric guitar, set against lulling background undulations: you can imagine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/30/manuel-gottsching-gottfather\">Manuel G\u00f6ttsching</a> approving. Dance Tonight Revolution Tomorrow is exceptional, with a simpler and more realised melody plucked on an algorithmic harp, joined by other ersatz string parts including a double bass twang low in the mix. It captures that beautiful moment in the club when the beat falls away and you click out of your internal space to look around and drink in your mates\u2019 grins.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/31DdFqt8J1AMFXBzrMf1Hb\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/31DdFqt8J1AMFXBzrMf1Hb\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>This music, and indeed all of Senni\u2019s work that deals with that pre-drop tension, is even more poetic when club culture has been silenced during the coronavirus crisis. We\u2019re all waiting for the beat to come back in, and Senni\u2019s work inadvertently hymns this sad moment while encouraging us to look for the poignancy in it.</p> <p>Scacco Matto means checkmate, and Senni does indeed play his queen last. Think Big is his most ambitious and brilliant track yet, built around a big, charmingly naive melody rendered in the cleanest of analogue signals. Underneath, synths stutter in the same peppy syncopation of Chicago house pianos, before being harassed by blurts of slap bass: an incapacitating accumulation of pleasure triggers. The drop, thankfully, never comes.</p>",
  "<p>Things are bad. But in many ways, we are in exactly the right time period for this specific brand of badness. Imagine having to stay locked in your house in 1910, with only the Bible to read and the Pears Soap ads for erotic visual stimulation. We\u2019re lucky in that there\u2019s limitless culture available, and the only barrier is our lack of focus. Focus is difficult in a quarantine, because while you might have every intention to sit down and watch Roma, inevitably, you will pick up your phone and check how many coronavirus-related deaths there are in Lewisham, and that\u2019s the evening gone.</p> <p>Video games have the distinct advantage that they are harder to be distracted from. You can\u2019t check your phone if you\u2019re trying to outrun a nightmare demon in Wandersong.</p> <p>But here\u2019s the tricky part. If you haven\u2019t played video games properly since your early teens, how do you get back in? Googling \u201cthe best games of the year\u201d and blithely purchasing from there might not work. For one thing, mistakes are expensive. The latest Animal Crossing title got amazing reviews, but that\u2019s partly because seasoned gamers know what they are getting and think nothing of spending \u00a360 on the latest title in a long-running franchise about living in a community of cute, grabby animals. In contrast, paying \u00a360 to weed <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/gaming/2020/03/31/animal-crossings-tom-nook-is-a-patriarchal-tyrant-in-raccoon-form/\">Tom Nook\u2019s bucolic hell garden</a> may feel like a rip-off to you, the person who hasn\u2019t bought a game since GTA: Vice City.</p> <p>Then there are the stressful action games, the ones that give real gamers such an adrenaline high they need an hour on Animal Crossing to climb down. I\u2019m talking BioShock, The Last of Us, Resident Evil \u2013 games that have incredible stories and beautiful landscapes, which you cannot appreciate because you have lost all your physical dexterity, causing you to panic and throw the controller across the room.

Written by former screenwriter Cho Nam-joo, the book details the life of an \u201cevery woman\u201d and the sexism she experiences in a deeply male-dominated society. Though it preceeded #MeToo by a year, Cho\u2019s novel became a rallying cry for South Korean women when the movement took off there in 2018. In one of the country\u2019s most famous #MeToo cases, a junior prosecutor, Seo Ji-hyeon, quoted Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982 while accusing her boss \u2013 during a TV interview \u2013 of sexual misconduct .

While Cho\u2019s focus is on South Korean culture, the normalisation of violence and harassment in the book seems all too familiar.</p> <p>\u201cIn the first draft, there were episodes of domestic violence, dating violence, and abortion, but eventually I deleted them,\u201d Cho says. \u201cThis is because I wanted male readers to be immersed in this novel without feeling rejected or defensive.

But while violence was previously explored in literature through the masculine world of war, feminist authors are examining another kind of violence that is far more female. South Korea has the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/business/south-korea-makeup-plastic-surgery-free-the-corset.html\">highest rate of plastic surgery per capita in the world</a>. In The Vegetarian, two sisters are juxtaposed: the unconventional vegetarian of the title, and her older sibling, whose \u201ceyes were deep and clear, thanks to the double-eyelid surgery she\u2019d had in her 20s\u201d; her cosmetic store\u2019s success is attributed to \u201cthe impression of affability\u201d that surgery has given her.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Plastic surgery is another way of improving chances of achieving social recognition, no different from wearing make-up</p> <footer> <cite>Elisa Shua Dusapin, author</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201c[In Korea], plastic surgery is another way of improving chances of achieving social recognition, no different from wearing makeup or dressing appropriately for a job interview,\u201d says Franco-Korean author \u00c9lisa Shua Dusapin. \u201cA friend told me the other day that she\u2019d been turned down for a job on the grounds that these days, \u2018surgery is affordable; it\u2019s up to the individual to make every effort to show themselves in the best light possible\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Dusapin\u2019s debut, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/28/winter-in-sokcho-review-elisa-shua-dusapin-first-novel-south-korea\">Winter in Sokcho</a>, translated from French by Aneesa Abbas Higgins, is narrated by an unnamed woman working in a guesthouse where one guest is recovering from plastic surgery. \u201cI could see the wounds weeping as the skin was exposed,\u201d she observes. \u201cHer eyebrows hadn\u2019t grown back yet. She looked like a burn victim, the face neither a man\u2019s nor a woman\u2019s.\u201d In spite of such a graphic deterrent, the narrator\u2019s mother, aunt and boyfriend all attempt to convince her to have operations of her own.</p> <p>Frances Cha, whose debut, If I Had Your Face, will be published in July, wants her novel to dispel western misconceptions about the reasons South Korean women go under the knife. \u201cIt bothers me when Korean women are dismissed as frivolous or vain,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to explore the very practical reasons why women [have plastic surgery], and how it can change your life. It can be life-threatening, and if it\u2019s not life-threatening it\u2019s so much pain and recovery \u2013 not a decision that is undertaken lightly.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a word in Korean that has no direct English translation:<em> han</em>. Cha defines it as a \u201cresentment and anger that\u2019s built up over being unfairly treated\u201d. \u201cA lot of women in my life have that. Mothers-in-law tend to have it because they were daughters-in-law and were mistreated by their <em>own</em> mothers-in-law. It\u2019s been a very vicious cycle historically,\u201d Cha says.</p> <p>In novels such as Ch\u2019oe Yun\u2019s There a Petal Silently Falls and Park Wansuh\u2019s Who Ate Up All the Shinga?, female authors have explored the violence, psychological and otherwise, inflicted after conflicts such as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46123548\">the 1980 Gwangju massacre</a> and the Korean war. \u201cViolence is a big theme in Korean culture in general, it\u2019s not just women. The \u2018<em>han\u2019</em> is more skewed to women. I think the violence \u2013 because everyone is on such good behaviour in polite society \u2013 is a release of all the pent-up emotions of every day,\u201d Cha suggests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"785b6936e3c2689594990db4ea8b49c67a25b87b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/785b6936e3c2689594990db4ea8b49c67a25b87b/48_0_785_981/400.jpg\" alt=\"\u00c9lisa Shua Dusapin\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There is a harshness, a hardness, a violence\u2019 ... \u00c9lisa Shua Dusapin, author of Winter in Sochko</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sales of Korean fiction overseas have exploded, and female authors are now outnumbering males in translation. While Cho stresses that there are many excellent contemporary male authors, more women are being nominated for Korean literary awards at a time when \u201cfeminist stories are coming more to the forefront globally\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cDuring the recession, many novels were about the pain and anxiety of fathers and young men,\u201d Cho says. \u201cRecently, readers love stories about the lives of older women, books that focus on the social life and concerns of female workers, express sympathy between female colleagues, friends, and neighbours \u2026 themes that weren\u2019t considered as a subject of literature are now covered.\u201d </p> <p>Dusapin rattles off a list of contemporary Korean writers who she admires: Lee Seung-u, <a href=\"http://barbarajzitweragency.com/news-main/2020/1/30/welcome-kim-yi-hwan-and-his-first-novel-dessert-world\">Kim Yi-Hwan</a>, Han Kang, Kim Ae-ran, Oh Jung-hi, <a href=\"https://koreanliteraturenow.com/fiction/reviews/eun-heekyung-skeptic%E2%80%99s-guide-life-beauty-despises-me-eun-heekyung\">Eun Hee</a><a href=\"https://koreanliteraturenow.com/fiction/reviews/eun-heekyung-skeptic%E2%80%99s-guide-life-beauty-despises-me-eun-heekyung\">kyung</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a harshness, a hardness, a violence that at the same time is very sensual [in Korean writing],\u201d she adds. \u201cA coldness that masks a burning inner rage.

  "<p>In recent weeks, on a quiet stretch of Detroit\u2019s west side dotted with vacant homes, a 262,000 sq ft Coca-Cola manufacturing facility has buzzed with activity, even as many businesses in Michigan were ordered by the state to temporarily close to combat the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<p>Coca-Cola churns out a number of beverages here, including Dasani, the company\u2019s well-known bottled water that generated more than $1bn in US sales in the past year, according to the market research firm IRI.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s a good time to be in the water business: as the coronavirus outbreak spread in the US throughout March, bottled water sales increased 57% over the same period last year.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Detroit residents are paying twice when they buy bottled water</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Beulah Walker, of Hydrate Detroit</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But among the products, like toilet paper or hand sanitizer, that Americans are panic-buying, bottled water is unusual: there is no shortage of safe drinking water, and health officials have tried to assure people that public water supplies are not contaminated by the coronavirus. Hoarding bottled water simply isn\u2019t necessary for most people.</p> \n<p>What\u2019s more, most bottled water sold in the US comes from the same municipal sources that supply tap water \u2013 a fact probably unknown to most consumers. Coca-Cola makes Dasani at the company\u2019s Detroit plant by purchasing, treating and bottling municipal water before selling it at a significant mark-up to consumers. Pepsi bottles its Aquafina water brand in Detroit the same way.</p> \n<p>The business model is hugely profitable. The cost to buy that municipal water is exceedingly low \u2013 and once bottled, the mark-up can be about 133 times greater, a Consumer Reports analysis of company water billing and usage records found.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=57%25&amp;title=increase%20of%20sales%20of%20bottled%20water%20in%20March%20compared%20to%20last%20year\" data-alt=\"bottled water\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=57%25&amp;title=increase%20of%20sales%20of%20bottled%20water%20in%20March%20compared%20to%20last%20year\">bottled water</a> \n</figure> \n<p>But what\u2019s good for businesses isn\u2019t necessarily good for consumers, according to CR\u2019s review, which included the examination of hundreds of pages of billing and other records obtained through public records requests, and interviews with environmental law experts, industry consultants, residents of Detroit and consumer advocates.</p> \n<p>For starters, bottlers and consumers aren\u2019t always treated as equals by water utilities, CR found. In Detroit, whose policy before the coronavirus crisis called for shutting off water to residents if they fall $150 behind in their water bills, 2,800 homes were estimated to be without running water at the start of the pandemic.</p> \n<p>But bottlers in Detroit have also racked up tens of thousands of dollars of past due water bills that went unpaid for months, CR found. Not once has their access to water been shut off over the period we examined. When asked why, the city cited the companies\u2019 strong payment history and an ability to pay their bills. The city said in a later statement that it had made errors collecting past-due balances.</p> \n<p>From a regulatory point of view, companies that want to put vast quantities of public water into bottles for profit face few hurdles and minimal ancillary costs, leading some experts to call for taxes on the bottlers. And because the water supply, including the processing and infrastructure, that bottlers rely on is paid for by local taxpayers, the companies\u2019 business is subsidized by the public, consumer advocates say.</p> \n<h2>Shutoffs pose health risk</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ab9f4c6e0f69aa7fd1c69a808fcdf17488a7bb1b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab9f4c6e0f69aa7fd1c69a808fcdf17488a7bb1b/0_0_2397_1575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An abandoned house on Detroit\u2019s east side on Saturday, Jan. 26, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"657\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An abandoned house on Detroit\u2019s east side.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erin Kirkland/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Detroit has been questioned about the potential health risk of water shutoffs before. In August 2014, residents who had their taps turned off argued in court to suspend shutoffs because a lack of water could create unsanitary conditions and lead to the transmission of hepatitis A, influenza and other diseases.</p> \n<p>Detroit\u2019s lawyers argued that those residents could rely on alternative sources \u2013 like bottled water. \u201cJust because a person is out of water doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t get water,\u201d a city lawyer said at a court hearing.</p> \n<p>The judge in the case ultimately sided with the city, and the shutoff campaign carried on.</p> \n<p>Now, six years later, Detroit and other cities have taken some steps to address residential water shutoffs during the coronavirus crisis \u2013 people need running water not just to cook and bathe, but to practice basic virus-fighting hygiene.</p> \n<p>But the reprieve is only temporary. And it hasn\u2019t necessarily reached everyone.</p> \n<p>A Detroit spokesperson said all customers who called to enroll in a program that would turn their water back on during the pandemic had either been restored or were in the process of a restoration. But the spokesperson conceded that some occupants may not have called, and advocates dispute the city\u2019s reported progress.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe believe the city of Detroit is vastly exaggerating their progress and underreporting the number of people without water,\u201d said Shea Howell, a member of the Detroit-based advocacy group the People\u2019s Water Board Coalition, during a recent teleconference with reporters.</p> \n<p>The coronavirus pandemic has underscored just how problematic water shutoffs can be, as utilities servicing nearly 40% of the US population still have not committed to suspending water shutoffs, according to Food &amp; Water Watch. This has consumer advocates worried.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just unconscionable to make people fear losing their water service at this time,\u201d said Mary Grant, director of the Public Water for All Campaign at Food &amp; Water Watch. \u201cWe need every governor to step up to address this crisis immediately.\u201d</p> \n<h2>\u2018Paying twice for bottled water\u2019</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bde9790f1f37ac0ebfb27bc0ce80917bcc290ab8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bde9790f1f37ac0ebfb27bc0ce80917bcc290ab8/56_0_4835_3335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bottles of Dasani water seen in a superstore.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"690\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bottles of Dasani water seen in a superstore.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Tai/LightRocket via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>People whose water gets shut off because they can\u2019t afford their bill may have no choice but to buy bottled water that comes from the same source that feeds their tap. They may be obtaining bottled water from companies that have been behind on their water bills but didn\u2019t face a shutoff, and whose business depends on access to publicly funded water systems.</p> \n<p>And it\u2019s not just in Detroit: Coca-Cola and Pepsi get water from other major cities, including Phoenix and Denver, with a history of shutting off water to residents before the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n<p>Coca-Cola didn\u2019t respond to questions from CR about water shutoffs or its late payments, but the company says it obtains water from a variety of sources, including municipal supplies, and uses a treatment process that \u201ccreates a consistent pure, clean, and crisp taste\u201d. The company said it remains in operation as the federal government identified the food and beverage industry as \u201ccritical\u201d to keeping grocery stores stocked.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"42387a55-40c6-46d6-b3ff-98b51445fccb\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Two decades ago, most bottled water in the US came from natural springs, sold by brands like Evian and Nestle\u0301\u2019s Poland Spring.</p>\n    <p>After Pepsi and Coca-Cola introduced their bottled water brands in the 1990s, the industry began to shift from spring water to \u201cpurified\u201d, which generally means municipal water that is treated further, sometimes through a process called reverse osmosis. In 2000, spring water comprised 67% of the bottled-water market, with purified water making up the rest. By 2018, those numbers had essentially flipped, industry data shows, with purified water now dominating the market.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Pepsi did not respond to repeated requests for comment from CR.</p> \n<p>Beulah Walker, chief coordinator for the local not-for-profit group Hydrate Detroit, which assists local residents without running water, pointed out the irony of the situation for residents who have lost their water service at home and may turn to bottled water \u2013 possibly Aquafina or Dasani made with city tap water \u2013 as an alternative.</p> \n<p>\u201cDetroit residents are paying twice when they buy bottled water,\u201d Walker says.</p> \n<h2>\u2018Picking on the little guy\u2019</h2> \n<p>In 2014, Detroit\u2019s shutoff policy drew national attention, when the city, which emerged that year from bankruptcy, launched a campaign to disconnect service to residents in arrears \u2013 forcing them to turn to other sources such as capturing rainwater or buying bottled water. Shutoffs have continued since then, but officials concluded in early March that a reprieve was needed to help residents during the coronavirus outbreak.</p> \n<p>Ricky Reynolds is one of the beneficiaries. The 65-year-old Detroit resident moved into his home down the road from Coca-Cola\u2019s bottling plant last summer, after obtaining the deed from an acquaintance for $500. It should have been a happy occasion. Reynolds had been homeless, bouncing between family and friends, so it was a relief to get his own place \u2013 until he tried to get the water bill put in his name.</p> \n<p>Reynolds, who is retired, learned from the city that his new home had a nearly $20,000 unpaid water bill.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3b033298969d351d6e4697d64530514586cae438\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b033298969d351d6e4697d64530514586cae438/78_0_788_788/500.jpg\" alt=\"Ricky Reynolds, a Detroit resident, who moved into his new home to find out that it had a nearly $20,000 unpaid water bill.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ricky Reynolds, a Detroit resident, who moved into his new home to find out that it had a nearly $20,000 unpaid water bill.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Felton/Courtesy Consumer Reports</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to catch up with $20,000 when you have a fixed income,\u201d he said. And the city refused to turn on his water until he paid 10% of the bill, he said, a monumental demand for someone living on social security income. Reynolds was never able to pay the bill.</p> \n<p>In the months before the city finally restored his water service during the pandemic, Reynolds says, he had to fill up containers with water from family members, then haul them home. And he bought bottled water whenever he could \u2013 including, he said, Dasani, which may have been made around the corner at the Coca-Cola plant. (The city didn\u2019t directly respond to questions about Reynolds\u2019 case.)</p> \n<p>Detroit\u2019s temporarily suspended shutoff policy states that residents or businesses are delinquent and potentially risk having their water shut off if they are 60 days past due with a minimum balance of $150, a spokesperson said. (The city considers a company\u2019s accounting practices, as well, before determining whether to proceed with a service interruption.)</p> \n<p>Records show that, since 2017, both Pepsi and Coca-Cola met that threshold at points.</p> \n<p>Between April and July 2017, billing records show, Coca-Cola had a $77,600 balance that went unpaid for three months. From August to November of that year, it carried a balance of as much as $287,250, before finally paying it off. That December to March of 2018, the company had a balance that fluctuated between $1,860 to $108,170, before paying it off in full. Meanwhile, from December 2018 to February 2019, Pepsi had a balance between $1,410 and $29,710, until paying it off.</p> \n<p>The city never shut off the company\u2019s water, and bottling continued.</p> \n<p>\u201cSince both Pepsi and Coca-Cola have a strong payment history and an unmatched ability to pay their bills, DWSD does not pursue service interruptions,\u201d said Bryan Peckinpaugh, spokesman for Detroit\u2019s water and sewage department.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese companies never go longer than three months past due, at which time the balances due, including late fees, are paid. These companies are not a priority target for service interruption due to their payment history and ability to pay.\u201d</p> \n<p>(After this article was first published, the DWSD said that, contrary to Peckinpaugh\u2019s previous statement, the past-due balances cited on the billing data were due to errors on the city\u2019s part, including address mailing issues. Regardless, while the city registered Pepsi and Coca-Cola as delinquent, and continued sending bills and assessing late fees, it never shut off the companies\u2019 water.)</p> \n<p>Coca-Cola and Pepsi did not respond to CR\u2019s questions about why they went months without paying their bills.</p> \n<p>Grant, of Food &amp; Water Watch, takes exception to the city\u2019s position. \u201cYou should have a policy and should apply it equitably,\u201d she said. \u201cI think this is discrimination against low-income households in Detroit, that you\u2019re having a shutoff policy and you\u2019re not applying it, the same shutoff policy, to these big corporations because you expect them to pay down the road.\u201d</p> \n<p>Reynolds was also stunned to hear that Detroit let Coke and Pepsi\u2019s bills slide.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re picking on the little guy.\u201d</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em> This article was updated on Friday 24 April after a subsequent statement by Detroit city officials that it had made errors collecting past-due balances. <br></em></p></li> \n <li><p><em>This story is co-published in partnership with Consumer Reports, which has a <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/bottled-water/how-coke-and-pepsi-make-millions-from-bottling-tap-water-as-residents-face-shutoffs/\">full version of the story here</a>.

  "<p>The original Penny Dreadful, named after the lurid shock novels popular in Ripper-era London and which aired from 2014 to 2016 on Showtime, drew blood from what was already well-trodden ground for horror: the ghoulish, dark streets of Victorian London. Penny Dreadful: City of Angels, the 10-part spin-off billed as its \u201cspiritual descendant\u201d, instead transports us to sunbaked, rangy Los Angeles, 1938. But, as it turns out, evil doesn\u2019t lurk just within shadows, for City of Angels shares with the original a belief in humans as the most horrific monster of all. Or, as the leather-clad demoness Magda (Natalie Dormer) tells her sister, death-angel Santa Muerte (Lorena Izzo), in the first show\u2019s first scene (their intro is as sudden and unsubtle as mine here): \u201cAll mankind needs to be the monster he truly is, is being told he can.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/15/mrs-america-cate-blanchett-fx-hulu\">Mrs America review: Cate Blanchett shines in 70s feminism drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Magda, demon puppeteer of the series, gets a literal fiery entrance, starting a blaze that almost kills a young Tiago Vega, who survives with help from Santa Muerte. But the show, created and written, like the original, by John Logan (Skyfall, The Aviator), cedes most of its action to the mortals in 1938 \u2013 LA\u2019s so-called Golden Age, though there are no starlets to be found here. This is the ascendant LA of oil wells and parched mom-and-pop streets, working-class dance halls and a strong Chicano presence. The adult Tiago (Daniel Zovatto), the first Mexican American detective in a racist cesspool Los Angeles police department, partners with Lewis Michener (Nathan Lane), a sardonic Jew sympathetic to Tiago\u2019s outsider status. The two are tasked with a grisly crime: a family murdered and left naked, hearts ripped out and faces painted Day of the Dead-style, in a dried-up riverbed. (City of Angels is considerably less macabre than its forebear, but has its fair share of gore.)</p> <p>From here, weighty plots ooze in several disparate, loosely connected directions anchored by historical research (and, in disguise, Magda\u2019s demonic nudging). Tiago and Lewis\u2019s investigation leads to Tiago\u2019s mother Maria (a standout Adriana Barraza), an ardent believer in Mexican folklore, and to the radio church of Sister Molly Finnister (Kerry Bish\u00e9), which switches Tiago into romantic lead mode, and her ruthlessly controlling mother Adelaide (Amy Madigan). Meanwhile, riots between Chicano residents and hostile law enforcement over police brutality and stifled opportunity offer Tiago\u2019s brothers Ra\u00fal (Adam Rodriguez) and Mateo (Jonathan Nieves) subplots in resistance groups (the union for Ra\u00fal, a pachuco gang for Manuel) and echo the city\u2019s so-called Zoot Suit riots in 1943.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETy8virrvbU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ETy8virrvbU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Over the first three episodes, Penny Dreadful plunges into its immersive world and hovers, scouring the city\u2019s moral underground (which, it understands, can be as much the institutional as the criminal), slowly overturning pebbles with calls to the present. Over here, Dr Peter Craft (Rory Kinnear, the one holdover from the original), a German Nazi working as a pediatrician, spouts \u201cAmerica First\u201d white nationalism in a city park. Over there, Tiago\u2019s sister Josefina (Jessica Garza) silently bears the brunt of neighborhood police terrorism. City councilman Charlton Townsend (Michael Gladis), seeking to bulldoze Chicano neighborhoods for a highway to Pasadena, is approached to collaborate with Nazi insurgents to facilitate fascism in the US.</p> <p>Most of the performances, particularly from veterans like Lane, are solid, but the heavy lift here is done by Dormer, who plays not one but four avatars of Magda: Alex, a homely assistant to Townsend; Elsa, a mysterious if slightly cartoonish German emigre who lures Dr Kraft with her tale as a battered wife with a strange, asthmatic son; and Rio, a maroon-haired, flamboyant leader of a Mexican American gang. As Anne Boleyn in The Tudors and Thrones\u2019s Margaery Tyrell, Dormer is no stranger to beguiling subterfuge, and she\u2019s queen of the subtle smirk; save a few overflowing monologues, she strikes the right balance of camp and restraint here for a Hydra of a character whose only motivation seems to be, at least in the six episodes available for review, chaos alone.</p> <p>If you\u2019re already dropping threads of this plot, well, join the club \u2013 the bold and disparate strands of this series (Nazis! Footloose-style dance sequence! Jewish gangsters!) are individually compelling, but the show strains under the weight of its own webbing. Which makes for some confusion (and intrigue \u2013 seriously, are they ever going solve this murder?) but a no less enjoyable experience; like an old wooden rollercoaster, the kind found on Tiago\u2019s trip to the Santa Monica pier, the bumpiness is part of the ride\u2019s appeal. I found myself, despite whiplash from the laundry list of characters, immediately diving into the next episode; the show\u2019s well-constructed, trenchant escapism can be aggressive, but it is magnetic.</p> <p>This is in no small part due to the series\u2019s smart handling of its smaller moments \u2013 the tentative bond between Lewis and Tiago, Maria\u2019s formidable support for each of her sons. These bonds are organic and mellowing, a balm even as the malignant supernatural forces remain frustratingly opaque. Over halfway into its season, it\u2019s unclear if, and how, the show can recollect the Pandora\u2019s box of horrors it\u2019s released. But Penny Dreadful: City of Angels so far offers an entertaining promise to figure it out.</p> <ul> <li><p>Penny Dreadful: City of Angels starts in the US on Showtime on 26 April and in the UK at a later date</p></li> </ul>",

This increased to meeting the statutory timeframes for 87% of the 61 key decisions due in the March quarter 2020,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The environment department also publishes <a href=\"https://www.awe.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-01/annual-report-2018-19-environment-and-energy.pdf\">annual data</a> on the percentage of EPBC-related decisions that are made on time.

With what arguments could we respond to wishes from other states with similar ideas?\u201d</p> \n<p>The German Green party said Britain could only hope to take part in data-sharing schemes if it accepted the EU\u2019s standards for data protection, and therefore the jurisdiction of the European court of justice.</p> \n<p>\u201cOtherwise we are endangering the basic rights of our citizens, which is not something we can tolerate,\u201d said Franziska Brantner of the German Greens, who are currently second in polls to Merkel\u2019s CDU. \u201cRights also come with responsibilities\u201d.</p> \n<p>UK officials have argued in the negotiations that they are making a pragmatic offer of strong cooperation and that a refusal to engage with the proposals will lead to a mutual loss in capability to fight crime and terrorism.</p> \n<p>Sources suggested that those who claimed the UK was trying to attain the benefits of membership while outside the EU were misrepresenting the British position.</p> \n<p>The UK\u2019s chief negotiator, David Frost, has repeatedly emphasised that his stance builds on relationships the EU has with other so-called \u201cthird countries\u201d not in the bloc.</p> \n<p>But some German politicians are particularly indignant at the idea that the UK could continue to take part in the Schengen Information System (SIS), since the decision to allow Britain to take part in the scheme five years ago has already proven controversial.</p> \n<p>A 2018 report by the Council of the European Union found that the UK was making <a href=\"https://euobserver.com/justice/141919\">improper use of the database</a> by illegally copying classified personal information and sharing it with US companies.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is nothing short of brazen by the British government to want to take part in Europe\u2019s largest police database in spite of repeatedly breaking its rules,\u201d said Andrej Hunko, a spokesman on European affairs for Die Linke, the German left party.</p> \n<p>\u201cInstead, the commission must initiate an immediate expulsion from SIS, as officials in Great Britain still refuse to address a list of deficiencies compiled by the European commission in January.\u201d Hunko said his party would \u201cput up resistance\u201d against the British proposals in Germany and at an EU level.</p> \n<p>EU officials said the last week of negotiations covering trade, police and judicial cooperation and governance of the future relationship, had not made any significant progress. \u201cThere is a chasm,\u201d said the source.</p> \n<p>The EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, is expected to offer an uncompromising view when he speaks to reporters on Friday.</p> \n<p>A Home Office spokesman said: \u201cThe safety and security of our citizens is the government\u2019s top priority and we are working closely with the European Union to reach an agreement on law enforcement and criminal justice cooperation in criminal matters that works for both of us.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe agreement should equip operational partners on both sides with the capabilities that help protect citizens and bring criminals to justice \u2013 promoting the security of all our citizens.\u201d</p>",

What if Titanic is like Madrid?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/23/titanic-favorite-best-picture-oscar-winner\">My favorite best picture Oscar winner: Titanic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 1997, Titanic was all but inescapable. It cleaned up at the Oscars. It earned a billion dollars at the global box office. At that time, I was writing a weekly film review column and going to screenings pretty much every night and yet still somehow conspired to avoid the biggest film of them all. Heaven knows why. I hope I wasn\u2019t dumb enough to frame this dereliction of duty as some kind of principled stance. That would be insufferably snobbish and wilfully perverse, like a music critic bragging that they\u2019ve never listened to the Beatles.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LOrwvyQey8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5LOrwvyQey8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And so, very belatedly, I sit down and watch Titanic, in which the young Kate Winslet is swept off her feet by the young Leonardo DiCaprio and an extra in the crow\u2019s nest shouts \u201cIceberg straight ahead!\u201d, and God almighty, maybe I <em>have</em> seen it before because it\u2019s pretty much exactly as I thought it would be. \u201cTo hardly know it is to know it well,\u201d as Cary Grant nearly said in The Philadelphia Story. It\u2019s not just the foreknowledge that the ship will sink. It\u2019s knowing most of the beats that lead up to the sinking. Titanic moves forward as if on tramlines, helpfully indicating every twist and turn in advance. It transpires that what Rose actually says is: \u201cJack, I want you to draw me like one of your French girls\u201d \u2013 but this is the film\u2019s biggest rabbit-from-the-hat surprise.</p> <p>So OK, Titanic is not the Beatles. It runs wide but not deep and has left virtually no cultural footprint. But nor is it Madrid, because there is never any danger of us becoming interestingly lost and discovering some side-street or subtext that the other tourists have missed. If anything, Titanic is Essen, a city in the industrial heartland of Germany which \u2013 inasmuch as I\u2019d ever thought about it at all \u2013 turns out to be pretty much as one would expect it to be. It\u2019s functional, accommodating and entirely built for purpose. In one early scene, a posh lady stands on the quay and says, \u201cSo this is the ship they say is unsinkable.\u201d The dialogue hardly gets any less stiff and formal from there.</p> <p>In the real world, people are strange and confusing. In Titanic they\u2019re not. The good people are the poor ones who appreciate painting and dancing. The bad people are the rich ones who disapprove of Picasso and have never heard of Freud. As with many inherently conservative films, it likes to think of itself as siding with the radicals and underdogs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d34a86894a88c91fd49c1e370db06593a5cab8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d34a86894a88c91fd49c1e370db06593a5cab8d/0_37_3004_1803/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gloria Stuart in Titanic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Just another goodie ...

Here, she plays the older version of Rose, who is being interviewed on camera by a bunch of marine explorers. The woman holds her audience spellbound with a tale of forbidden love below deck. She says things like, \u201cIt was the most erotic moment of my life,\u201d and asks with a twinkle, \u201cYou mean, did we do it?\u201d Midway through the film, I half-hoped that old Rose would eventually be unmasked as a charlatan or a fantasist, spinning lurid tales of servant sex. But no \u2013 it turns out she\u2019s another goodie after all.</p> <p>For all that, I didn\u2019t dislike Titanic. The director David Fincher once said that there are films and there are movies and that these should never be confused, because measuring them by the same criteria is like comparing apples with oranges. Titanic, perhaps, is the movie-est movie of the lot \u2013 a delivery system for broad emotions and enormous set-pieces and as distinct from the work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/dec/22/news.obituaries\">Robert Bresson</a> as it is from an elk, a pen or a thong. Cameron\u2019s handling is commanding and professional. He effectively grabs your head in order to direct your gaze this way and that, like a brutish schoolmaster manhandling a daydreaming pupil. But he\u2019s also smart enough to allow just one rogue element \u2013 and it is this that makes all the difference.</p> <p>Playing the role of Jack Dawson, Titanic\u2019s emblem of youthful promise, DiCaprio looks as though he\u2019s dropped in from a completely different movie \u2013 or more likely a different film. DiCaprio (22 years old at the time of shooting) is loose and limber where the other players are stolid. Even during the non-dancing scenes, he moves with the lightest of steps through Cameron\u2019s world of waxwork dummies, as though recognising them all for the cheap impostors that they are. The actor is better than this material, geared for better things. But he\u2019s exploring and experimenting; happy to stretch his muscles and find his range. He\u2019s like a brilliant tour guide, at once respectful and irreverent, strolling back and forth around Essen and making it feel like Madrid.</p>",

As with so much about the government\u2019s response, such as the identity of most members of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/14/no-10-secrecy-around-sage-coronavirus-advisory-group\">Covid-19 advisory group</a>,<strong> </strong>information is released on a strictly need-to-know basis. What we do know is that the government will not set a specific date. It is right not to do so. Donald Trump may believe he is battling a germ that is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL_9dLKb3c\">\u201cbrilliant\u201d</a>, a characteristic not normally associated with a microscopic clump of genetic material, but even he abandoned his initial goal of opening up the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/trump-says-keeping-us-covid-19-deaths-to-100000-would-be-a-very-good-job\">by Easter</a>. This <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL_9dLKb3c\">\u201cvery smart\u201d</a> virus does not observe religious festivals or read his tweets.</p> <p>The seeming unwillingness of the British government to share its thinking with the public contrasts starkly with the approach taken elsewhere. The European Union has published a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_652\">roadmap</a> that lays out a phased approach for containing the virus. Cynics might be forgiven for recalling the contrast between the EU\u2019s detailed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/26/brexit-studies-were-being-prepared-a-year-before-davis-said-they-didnt-exist\">Brexit impact assessments</a> and the superficial British ones, which had to be prised from the hands of ministers many months later. In the case of coronavirus, the UK would do well to follow the European roadmap, which recommends developing a robust system of contact tracing, expanding testing capacity and reinforcing PPE supplies as among the first steps towards lifting a lockdown.</p> <p>Other European countries have also set out their proposals in varying levels of detail. Angela Merkel gave an in-depth <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/angela-merkel-draws-on-science-background-in-covid-19-explainer-lockdown-exit\">explanation</a> of the scientific basis behind Germany\u2019s lockdown strategy, drawing on a deep understanding of the epidemiology. In a speech marked by humility and acceptance that mistakes had been made, Emmanuel Macron <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/macron-france-remain-strict-lockdown-for-another-month\">explained</a> that the process would be lengthy: schools would be opened when the data supported it, but restaurants and bars would remain closed for much longer.</p> <p>The countries that are most advanced in this process are those that closed down earliest, and thus managed to better contain the spread of the virus. This approach contrasts with that of the United Kingdom, which delayed its lockdown. Germany, which has attracted widespread praise for its ability to deliver widespread testing, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/german-shops-open-angela-merkel-warns-second-wave-coronavirus\">opening up smaller shops</a>, as is Austria, although this is subject to customers distancing from each other and wearing face coverings. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/czechs-grapple-with-how-to-ease-covid-19-lockdown\">Czech Republic,</a> which like its neighbour Slovakia has strongly encouraged face coverings, is also opening small businesses. Denmark<strong>, </strong>meanwhile, is starting to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-denmark/denmark-proposes-faster-easing-of-lockdown-as-coronavirus-cases-fall-pm-idUSKCN21W223\">open up elementary schools</a>. These governments have made clear that continued progress is dependent on the course of the pandemic, and restrictions might well be reimposed \u2013 but they have been much more open with citizens about their respective approaches than the UK has been.</p> <p>The key elements that a British exit strategy must include are fairly obvious, providing, as the UK government keeps repeating, that these decisions are led by science. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/scientists-age-groups-covid-19-workplaces-shops-restaurants\">science is clear</a>. The only way to get back to anything like normality is to get what epidemiologists call the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/apr/22/see-how-coronavirus-can-spread-through-a-population-and-how-countries-flatten-the-curve\">reproduction number</a>, or R<sub>0</sub>, below 1. Put another way, we must find ways to ensure that those who are infected in a community pass that infection on to fewer than one other person. We can be certain this point is being made by England\u2019s chief medical officer, an experienced infectious disease epidemiologist. But how can this be achieved?</p> <p>The EU\u2019s document provides helpful guidance for what the UK\u2019s strategy might look like. First, it should not even consider lifting restrictions until it has adequate data to be sure that the R<sub>0</sub> really is below one. It can only do so if it has sufficient testing in place, for both the virus, determining who is infected, and the antibody, telling us who has been infected in the past and is therefore, hopefully, immune. This will require many more tests than the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/19/impossible-for-uk-to-meet-covid-19-testing-targets-say-scientists\">current daily target of 100,000</a>.</p> <p>At the same time, it will be important to show that the death rate really is falling, which will require far better data than is<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/coronavirus-deaths-in-care-homes-in-england-and-wales-more-than-quadruple-in-a-week\"> currently being provided</a>, which has created considerable confusion about the number of deaths outside hospitals, especially in care homes. And the NHS must be ready for any resurgence once restrictions are lifted. This means having enough PPE, which is no more than an aspiration at present. Finally, the UK will need sufficient public health capacity to tackle resurgent infections, a task that will require enormous efforts to reverse the effects of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/england-public-health-coronavirus-cuts-regional\">decade of cuts</a>.</p> <p>Easing the lockdown will have to be accompanied by other measures to reduce transmission, such as continued physical distancing and, increasingly likely, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/face-masks-coronavirus-covid-19-public\">face coverings</a>, as in France, Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Change must be gradual, with health authorities closely monitoring the effects. In Italy, regions are taking the first very hesitant steps at different speeds, while in Spain those in construction and manufacturing sectors who are now permitted to go back to work must maintain stringent precautions.</p> <p>Throughout this process, it will be essential to follow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/the-exit-strategy-how-countries-around-the-world-are-preparing-for-life-after-covid-19\">what other countries are doing</a>. The approaches taken by various European countries offer a natural laboratory in which to test our own ideas. We must avoid simplistic comparisons, but also accept that the different approaches offer many learning opportunities.

Frank Tassone, the superintendent presiding over Long Island\u2019s Roslyn high school and the No 4-ranked district that contains it, gets a drink from a bartender who happens to have once strode Roslyn\u2019s halls. Tassone duly recalls not only the boy\u2019s name, not only that he used to like writing science-fiction stories, but one of the plots dreamed up by his teenaged self.</p> <p>Except this isn\u2019t a scholastic administrator showing his dedication to the job. This is the beginning of a flirtation between the two men, and in a greater sense, the beginning of the end.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVffM3OZkH8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZVffM3OZkH8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Cory Finley\u2019s film tracks Tassone\u2019s downfall, a scam of such hubris, folly and tragedy that it fits snugly in the Greek pantheon. Tassone skimmed millions from the school district budget to maintain a princely lifestyle with a husband unbeknown to everyone, from the co-workers buying his story about a deceased wife to the aforementioned boytoy kept in the dark. The ripped-from-the-headlines true story would be engrossing any way you slice it, but Jackman elevates the facts into a sublime dramatic work.</p> <p>That\u2019s not just because he gives the performance of his career, more studied and specific and fully-formed than we\u2019ve ever seen, but because he brings an abundance of extra-textual baggage. The film confronts head-on the question of \u201cHugh Jackman\u201d, the intuited public perception halfway between the real Jackman and his fictionalized persona of Tassone. The answer to this question, unsurprisingly, is complicated.</p> <p>Jackman and Tassone excel by carefully maintaining an aura of absolute control. Frank Tassone is the sort of guy who makes the phrase \u201cnot a hair out of place\u201d literal, with his sleek mane so raven-black it just has to be dyed. He\u2019s introduced slugging activated-charcoal smoothies, part of a fitness regimen so obsessive we eventually learn regular facelifts help keep him in tip-top shape. That\u2019s one of the first signs his total composure might be hiding something, as if behind the facade of cufflinks and cologne spritzes there\u2019s only a big nothing. He uses his charisma to keep the world at an arm\u2019s length, letting them see only the version of himself he\u2019d like them to.</p> <p>Even before The Greatest Showman<em> </em>made it official, Jackman was a consummate pro of stage and screen. He\u2019s a paragon of excellence, the night-after-night dependability that made him a sensation on Broadway, where a person needs an entertainer\u2019s soul and an athlete\u2019s hustle to get by. Not even years of reprising his star-making Wolverine gig could make him seem rugged; his has always been a clean-cut machismo, polished to a sheen. This quality, combined with Jackman\u2019s tendency to play personal matters close to the vest in interviews, has led some fans to see him as perhaps <em>too </em>perfect to be true. Jackman\u2019s not one of those tell-all A-listers making content out of his privacy; he comes off like a movie star in the old Hollywood tradition, a seeming trick of the light, as much PR team as man.</p> <p>Adding another fascinating wrinkle is Tassone\u2019s homosexuality, kept to himself while not strictly closeted. This may be the gentlest and most vulnerable Jackman has ever permitted himself to appear on screen; one scene deals the veteran hoofer his greatest acting challenge by forcing him to be bad at dancing, having followed his younger boyfriend to a club where they at-first-tentatively get close to Moby\u2019s In This World.</p> <p>Watching Jackman shed his self-consciousness and allow Tassone to relax for the first time in the film lands with a disarming tenderness, in part because he\u2019s nodding to rumors in our real world. Though he\u2019s been married for years, Jackman still attracts murmurs, and he must have known this when agreeing to take this job. It would be more than a reach to describe the performance as confessional, but it cannot be denied as commentary.</p> <p>Jackman finds the humanity in someone who\u2019s forced himself to bury his down deep, for the sake of fitting into a rigid template of success. The brutal irony is that Tassone probably could have been openly gay if he wanted to \u2013 even in 2002, Long Island was pretty tolerant \u2013 but he forced himself to match a picture of a superintendent he had in his head. Perhaps not in regard to his sexual orientation, but Jackman has also conducted himself with an unflappable professionalism, fitting himself into a classical mold of movie stardom. As much as it has won him a massive fandom, it\u2019s also rendered him somewhat unknowable to the sort of cinephile curious about the overlap between an actor\u2019s work and self.</p> <p>With his latest and greatest acting feat, however, he\u2019s teased us with a couple of clues as to what happens when someone who\u2019s always \u201con\u201d finally goes off stage.</p> <ul> <li><p>Bad Education premieres in the US on HBO on 25 April with a UK date to follow soon</p></li> </ul>",

It was reminiscent of another government minister explaining how they were \u201cfollowing the scientific advice\u201d when confronted with some awkward questions about past shortcomings. Given the current turmoil, an argument about Colin Graves\u2019s successor is the last thing the ECB wants. Nor do the counties, who, like everyone else, are far more concerned with keeping afloat.</p> <p>My guess is that with the circumstances surrounding his departure from the EFL likely to remain an unresolved case with differing opinions, Watmore\u2019s nomination will stand and he may be capable of doing the job well in the most trying of circumstances. But it is not a good look.</p> <p>Surrey\u2019s chairman, Richard Thompson, meanwhile, says that \u201cif we lose a county I don\u2019t think it will be a small one\u201d. It will not be Surrey either, who are less dependent on ECB contributions than any county.</p> <p>His assessment is borne out by the situation at Somerset where Gordon Hollins, once of the ECB and now the chief executive at Taunton, has taken over in interesting times. He has hardly met anyone and has been catapulted into crisis management from the start. \u201cI think the most difficult thing I\u2019ve had to do is to tell 67 of our 76 staff that their services are not required at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>This was a financial necessity. The furlough system has become vital to the survival of our counties and the smaller ones can apply it to a higher percentage of their staff. Hollins also mentions a cost that cannot be quantified in pounds. \u201cAttending a cricket match is not like going to a concert,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is a social get-together; friendships are built there and it becomes a big part of our supporters\u2019 lives.\u201d</p> <p>Uncertainty abounds over when professional cricket might resume and, yes, those overseeing this must \u201cfollow the scientific advice\u201d about mass gatherings.

Understandably the focus will be to deliver the Blast.</p> <p>There may be no better time to swerve and experiment. Two-match Test series with West Indies and Pakistan could only take place at the end of the summer. Perhaps in exceptional circumstances and with a shortage of time, four-day Tests could be tried.</p> <p>In between them a completely different England side could fulfil ODI fixtures against Australia and Ireland. At domestic level there might be time for a rejuvenated 50-over competition for the counties alongside the Blast with a red ball and white clothing. Why?

First the president falsely claimed that Dr Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had been \u201ctotally misquoted\u201d in a Washington Post article <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/coronavirus-second-wave-hydroxychloroquine-trial\">about the danger</a> of the virus in tandem with seasonal flu.</p> \n<p>He then had to look on as Redfield told reporters: \u201cI\u2019m accurately quoted in the Washington Post.\u201d </p> \n<p>Trump shifted gear and objected to the newspaper\u2019s headline, before seeking once again to downplay the threat: \u201cWe will not go through what we went through for the last two months \u2026 And if it comes back, though, it won\u2019t be coming back in the form that it was. It will be coming back in smaller doses that we can contain \u2026 It may not come back at all.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fauci, however, was bluntly realistic: \u201cWe will have coronavirus in the fall. I am convinced of that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump also announced that he had signed an executive order that will temporarily suspend the issuance of certain green cards for 60 days he said aimed at protecting American jobs. The order includes a long list of exemptions, including for those who are currently in the country, those who have valid immigrant visas, people seeking entry to work as physicians and nurses, and the spouses and unmarried children of US citizens.</p> \n<p>But the American Civil Liberties Union warned that the order will delay the ability of families to reunite and of employers to hire workers necessary to their enterprises. Omar Jadwat, director of its immigrants\u2019 rights project, said: \u201cWhile the order is limited in scope, President Trump\u2019s transparent attempt to distract from his own failures with this unwarranted suspension will cause real pain for families and employers across the country.</p> \n<p>\u201cMeanwhile, he continues to fail to take obvious steps that will save lives \u2013 like releasing people from Ice facilities that cannot keep them safe from Covid-19. We all deserve better leadership than this.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a bizarre riff, Trump also spoke optimistically about staging a 4 July celebration on the National Mall, including an air display. He compared the turnout at last year\u2019s event to the March on Washington in 1963. \u201cI saw a magnificent picture of Dr Martin Luther King and I saw a magnificent picture of our event last year, and both of them were maxed out. It was beautiful to see. Beautiful, very similar. This year, most likely, we\u2019ll be standing six feet apart. We\u2019ll have to do that in a very interesting way.\u201d</p> \n<p>Histories of the Trump presidency are likely to record how he compared the crowd size at his inauguration, also on the National Mall, to that of Barack Obama, even though photos show his predecessor\u2019s was significantly bigger.</p>",

Do the chapter headings refer to many alpha men and \u201ccontroversial intellectuals\u201d (Richard Dawkins, David Hume, David Irving, Hitchens, and Peterson again) but not a single female?</p> <p>Is the text peppered with fond reminiscences of boozing with Hitch et al on the global conference circuit? By now you will be getting a strong whiff of a distinctive, testosterone-filled musk. Yes, you\u2019ve wandered into the habitat of that fearless, self-assured celebrity creature: the ageing, raging, white, male, \u201cscientific\u201d truthteller. He\u2019s here to cut through the bullshit for you, whether you like it or not.</p> <p>This particular specimen, Michael Shermer, is the author of many previous works, including <em>The Moral Arc: How Science and Reason Lead Humanity toward Truth, Justice and Freedom</em> (2015), and the more fun-sounding <em>Why People Believe Weird Things</em> (1997). A onetime evangelical Christian, libertarian and professional bicycle racer turned historian, he\u2019s best known as an enthusiastic, atheistical debunker of pseudo-science.</p> <p>His latest volume is a collection of almost 30 \u201creflections\u201d published over the past 15 years, repackaged and organised around five themes: freedom of speech, religion, politics, \u201cscientific humanism\u201d and examples of \u201ctranscendent thinkers\u201d. Your opinion of the book will almost certainly depend on your fondness for quick, super-brief journalistic takes on large, complicated issues. Reading it is a bit like being stuck next to a well-meaning but opinionated guy on a (safe, boring, post-coronavirus) transatlantic flight \u2013 you\u2019re unlikely to learn anything very profound, and you probably won\u2019t want to stay in touch, but if you\u2019re in the mood, it passes the time to have a chatty stranger mansplain the meaning of the cosmos, the genius of the Founding Fathers, and how he got rid of his beloved .357 Magnum during an unfortunate period of marital strife. (Or you could just turn away, pop in your earplugs, and binge on the free movies.)</p> <p>Shermer\u2019s project is to open our eyes to supposedly rational, scientific ways of analysing and mastering knotty, controversial subjects, from gun control in America, through the \u201cnatural\u201d foundations of economic prosperity, to the prospects for a global advance of civilisation. Try to be reasonable, he patiently explains. It\u2019s good to keep an open mind and listen to what others have to say. Look out for confirmation bias. We should accept or reject ideas only \u201caccording to their evidentiary standing\u201d.</p> <p>Unfortunately the brevity of Shermer\u2019s chapters means that his application of these unobjectionable principles often results only in banal truisms. You might not need to read his essays on God and religion to appreciate that Scientology is a money-making cult; that both atheists and people of faith deserve to be treated as intelligent and worthy of respect; that many Americans these days define themselves as agnostic; or that \u201cthe universe per se cannot have a purpose\u201d in an anthropomorphic sense because, well, it isn\u2019t a human being.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"30aad8ab58c2dc02f1d7ad1ee8095d3aaa3a7ab3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30aad8ab58c2dc02f1d7ad1ee8095d3aaa3a7ab3/0_132_3840_2304/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Michael Shermer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Shermer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, one person\u2019s platitude can be another\u2019s revelation. The book\u2019s essays on gun violence grapple with some peculiarly American presumptions, such as the notion that guns prevent violence, or that their private ownership provides an essential bulwark against governmental tyranny. What is remarkable is not so much the fairly basic evidence and arguments that Shermer marshals to oppose such views, but the poignantly recent evolution of his own stance. He starts off as a lifelong gun-loving libertarian, and even less than a decade ago, while acknowledging the \u201cstaggering\u201d toll of other gun-related deaths in the US, he dismissed mass shootings as \u201chighly improbable\u201d events, largely impossible to prevent unless we \u201cvote to change our government into a Chinese-like communist regime\u201d. By 2017 he was suggesting that the media should stop naming and publicising mass murderers, to prevent their gaining fame and inspiring others. And the longer he debated with gun-rights advocates, the more he came to realise that their minds were never going to be changed by all the data and PowerPoint slides he could muster: their disagreements went much deeper than that.</p> <p>More satisfying is Shermer\u2019s thought-experiment on a more off-beat topic, the governance of any future human settlement on Mars.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/15/elon-musk-cyborgs-robots-artificial-intelligence-is-he-right\"> Elon Musk</a>, the busy, self-regarding Californian tech-billionaire, wants to establish a base there as soon as possible. He also seriously thinks that a such a community of over a million settlers could and should be run as a direct democracy. On Musk\u2019s Mars, any law that 40% of the people came to oppose would automatically become invalid, \u201cto overcome inertia\u201d. All Martian laws, he\u2019s prescribed, \u201cmust be short, as there is trickery in length\u201d, and would be also time-limited, \u201cto prevent death by bureaucracy\u201d. Everyone would constantly vote on every issue, and laws would be continually expiring and need to be re-established: apparently, that\u2019s the best route to personal \u201cfreedom\u201d (which is naturally the ultimate goal of Musk\u2019s political utopia).</p> <p>As well as pointing out the inherent flaws in this libertarian fantasy, Shermer seeks out the views of scientists, science fiction writers, Martian enthusiasts and students of different kinds of \u201cunintentional\u201d Earth-bound communities, such as the survivors of shipwrecks, to come up with an alternative model. Why do some groups of thrown-together people end up murdering and eating each other, while others co-operate and flourish? The answers aren\u2019t so startling (it helps to start with a balanced sex ratio, emphasise teamwork, and avoid racism), but it\u2019s certainly fun to consider the mutiny on the Bounty as a test-case for how (not) to go about colonising other planets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a79e9f2757b5c08fb154888c4e2719852a9db7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a79e9f2757b5c08fb154888c4e2719852a9db7d/0_118_5519_3312/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A lesson to colonists ... the mutiny on the Bounty.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lesson to colonists ... the mutiny on the Bounty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though this book is billed as \u201ca timely and full-throated defence of free speech\u201d, that is sadly a field in which it makes no substantive contribution. The basic problem is that, like any polemicist masquerading as an impartial observer, Shermer proceeds from so many questionable premises that he raises far more questions than he answers. All human communication requires rules, merely to be intelligible. And it\u2019s at least arguable that the freedom to debate any subject, however contentious, might legitimately co-exist with, or even depend on, rules of civility or evidence. But that\u2019s too nuanced an approach for Shermer; or perhaps it smacks of the \u201cidentity politics\u201d and \u201cfar-left dogma on college campuses\u201d that are among his pet peeves.</p> <p>Instead, he starts with the blunt (though conventional American) presumption that communicative laws and norms always reek of \u201ctyranny\u201d and \u201cdictatorship\u201d, and approvingly cites the claim that the Holocaust denier \u201cmust be given <em>extra</em> protection because what he has to say must have taken him some effort to come up with\u201d. In this abstract, dehumanised vision of speech, utterances never harm anybody. All regulation is presumed \u201ccensorship\u201d, \u201csilencing\u201d, and intrinsically contradictory \u2013 for, bizarrely, one of his overarching free speech \u201ccommandments\u201d is that all \u201cArguments in favour of censorship and against free speech are gainsaid the moment the speaker speaks \u2013 otherwise we would be unaware of their arguments if they were censored.\u201d Ironically, given its commitment to clear thinking and fearless iconoclasm, <em>Giving the Devil His Due</em> is at its sloppiest and most lazily conventional on the subject of free speech.</p> <p>For many years now, as the Washington Post and other reputable media outlets have reported, women have been coming forward with claims of sexual harassment and assault by Shermer. He has never been charged with any offences and he denies the allegation. Recently, some of his public speaking engagements have been cancelled as a result. A few months ago, Scientific American<em> </em>discontinued his longstanding column for the magazine. Perhaps all this helps to clarify why, though <em>Giving the Devil His Due </em>is a deeply American work, it is not (unlike all his previous books) being published by any US firm, but only by Cambridge \u2013 though it certainly doesn\u2019t explain why that reputable scholarly institution, the world\u2019s oldest publishing house, was keen to do so. In any case, as Shermer himself would doubtless agree, even if objectionable and muddle-headed people are given a platform to speak, no one is obliged to listen to them.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Fara Dabhoiwala is writing a global history of free speech.

  "<p>These days the public is enjoined to forgo any \u201cnon-essential\u201d outdoor activity, and to go out shopping only for \u201cessentials\u201d. But who is to say what is essential and what isn\u2019t?</p> <p>After the Latin <em>essentialis</em>, \u201cessential\u201d originally means relating to something\u2019s intrinsic nature or essence: this is the sense in which an \u201cessential oil\u201d, distilled from a plant, is essential but not indispensable. Only later does it come to mean also \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d, first in a religious context: poverty, chastity and obedience were the three \u201cessential vows\u201d to a monastic life, as they are an involuntary feature of many people\u2019s present lockdown experience.</p> <p>What is considered absolutely necessary beyond air, water and baseline nourishment is, of course, a matter of interpretation. The UK legislation says that people can leave their house only to buy \u201cbasic necessities\u201d, which strongly implies the existence of a category of advanced or sophisticated necessities that, punitively, we are denied even though they are utterly essential. (Vintage champagne, perhaps.)</p> <p>In the mean time it might lift the spirits to reflect that while the essentials make life possible, it is what is \u201cnon-essential\u201d, such as poetry or music, that makes it worth living.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Steven Poole\u2019s A Word for Every Day of the Year is published by Quercus.</em></p>",

Never mind the racism inherent in headlines that announced the arrival of Meghan from \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3896180/Prince-Harry-s-girlfriend-actress-Meghan-Markles.html\">(almost) straight outta Compton</a>\u201d \u2013 the wedding was seen as a triumph. The nation congratulated itself on taking this beautiful divorcee into its midst.</p> <p>However, this \u201cacceptance\u201d turned out to be as flimsy as a veil. Meghan soon did all sorts of crimes, according to the tabloids: going bare legged, being too \u201cwoke\u201d, turning Harry into a social justice warrior. The popular press indulged in a nasty game of <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ellievhall/meghan-markle-kate-middleton-double-standards-royal\">compare and contrast</a>. Kate Middleton \u2013 bland, skinny and pliable \u2013 was the good princess, Meghan the evil one.</p> <p>Eventually Harry and Meghan couldn\u2019t take it any more and decided they wanted a new life outside of the UK. They also wanted to hit back at the press, starting with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/01/meghan-sues-mail-on-sunday-for-publishing-letter-to-her-father\">suing the Mail on Sunday</a> for publishing a letter Meghan had originally sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle. Hearings are due to begin this week. To up the ante, on Monday they issued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/20/harry-and-meghan-uk-tabloids-duke-duchess-sussex-sun-daily-mail\">an overwrought letter</a> to the tabloids, the Sun, the Mirror, the Daily Mail and the Express, saying they will no longer deal with them. \u201cThere will be no corroboration and zero engagement,\u201d the couple declared.</p> <p>What are they doing? In the midst of a pandemic this letter looks purely solipsistic. Now is simply not the time for a display of their very thin skins, when others are covering themselves in PPE to help the gravely sick.</p> <p>The court case, the grandiose letter and their exhibition of hurt has been met with <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-8242911/SARAH-VINE-Dear-Meghan-Harry-dont-worry-not-worried-you.html\">predictable scorn</a> from tabloid rottweilers. But all of it indicates that the symbiotic contract between royals and the tabloids is even more dysfunctional than ever. The Sussexes, minus their royal duties, now fall into that category of celebs around which any gossip can be spun. If they had truly wanted privacy, perhaps they wouldn\u2019t have moved to Los Angeles, where paparazzi lie in wait too.</p> <p>All rich and powerful people would love to dictate what the media says about them. This is not to defend the worst excesses of the tabloids, but Meghan\u2019s shock at her treatment by the British tabloids is hard to understand. Gossip mags and tabloid exposure exist in her homeland.</p> <p>\u201cI really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a \u2018stiff upper lip\u2019,\u201d she told Tom Bradby in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/20/meghan-duchess-of-sussex-warned-tabloids-destroy-my-life\">ITV interview</a> last year. \u201cI really tried, but I think what that does internally is probably really damaging. I never thought it would be easy, but I thought it would be fair.\u201d</p> <p>Fair it is not, and if Harry was attracted to Meghan\u2019s need to be emotionally open, he must also have known what happened to the last royal woman who would not be silent about her feelings: his mother. It took Harry a long time to talk publicly about what it was like to lose Diana.</p> <p>Many remember the long, silent walk he was made to do as a small boy behind her coffin in 1997, his head down and fists clenched. There is \u201cstill talk about the silence\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/princess-problem/608032/\">Harry said years later</a>, \u201cbut what I remember is every 50 yards or whatever, certain people in the crowd just unable to contain their emotion\u201d. How awful. He blames the tabloids for his mother\u2019s death and he wants to protect his wife. Who is not sympathetic to that?</p> <p>Yet somehow this couple have blown much of the goodwill they had by wanting to be both special and yet left alone. Royal in name only. They didn\u2019t stay in Vancouver after their initial move out of the UK. Meghan has been on TV <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aNCZpfhgEo\">talking about elephants</a>. They Zoomed the Queen on her birthday. It\u2019s all so dislocated.</p> <p>However, they did not get the deal they wanted in their separation from the royal family, because in the end the firm is utterly ruthless. The new role they thought they could carve out for themselves was vetoed. They couldn\u2019t use the term royal or be called \u201croyal highness\u201d any more. Their offices in Buckingham Palace would be closed. They can no longer perform royal duties. They are out on their own.</p> <p>The control they sought over the firm backfired, as will the control they seek over the tabloids, for whom Meghan in particular is simply a villain akin to someone from reality TV.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/22/piers-morgan-voice-of-reason-now-i-know-the-apocalypse-is-nigh\">Piers Morgan, voice of reason?

The Queen is widely loved because people see that her sense of duty seems to come before personal desires. </p> <p>Meghan and Harry may well be right about press intrusion before their wedding. They are certainly right that tabloid journalism must be held to account. But is now the right time for this complaint to be aired? With everyone shut in their homes, we are overburdened with self-obsessed and oversharing celebs as it is. None of this is fair, just as Meghan said.</p> <p>They could have continued in self-isolation, far away in LA. But in the time of Covid-19 their actions look both petty and grandiose.

It is also a war movie about a country at war with itself, with its neighbours and with the whole world. Hermanus and his co-writer, Jack Sidey, have adapted the novel by Andr\u00e9 Carl van der Merwe, entitled Moffie \u2013 the (still very much unreclaimed) Afrikaans word for \u201cfaggot\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/15/moffie-triggering-film-south-africa-toxic-masculinity-oliver-hermanus\">'It's a triggering film': visceral South African drama Moffie</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kai Luke Brummer plays Nicholas van der Swart, a white South African teenager in 1981 who has to do two years\u2019 national service.

The drill sergeant is a traditional figure here, and Hilton Pelser\u2019s performance as the monstrous Sergeant Brand measures up in sadism and abuse. Hermanus shows how, from the very first, Brand displays his own mysterious enthusiasm for homophobic abuse, screaming into the young men\u2019s flinching faces his sneering questions about their alleged interest in each other\u2019s bodies. In the camp, furtive glances in the showers and lavatories mean more, and the stakes are much higher. The same is true for Nicholas\u2019s emotional connection with fellow trainee, Dylan (Ryan de Villiers).</p> <p>Nicholas\u2019s family background is what further complicates the dynamic. Despite his soft \u201cEnglish\u201d looks, he has an Afrikaans name, but he has to explain he has taken the surname of his more robust stepfather after what appears to have been his parents\u2019 divorce. His father (whose photograph Nicholas poignantly carries with him to the camp, almost like that of a sweetheart) is a gentle soul who, in an excruciating act of misjudged manliness, has given Nicholas a porn magazine to take to the camp with him. And it is his father who is to be at the centre of an enigmatic, superbly filmed and rather shocking \u201cflashback\u201d scene of Nicholas\u2019s childhood, when he and his family were horribly humiliated at a holiday resort.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bb68376a609d03e26e02f5d2f566607aae5e826\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bb68376a609d03e26e02f5d2f566607aae5e826/75_144_1545_927/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A gruesome rail journey takes the proto-squaddies to their training camp.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A gruesome rail journey takes the proto-squaddies to their training camp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Rutland Manners/Curzon Artificial Eye</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is, arguably, a complication with regards to race.

(One of them, Sachs, played by Matthew Vey, offers some limited leftist talk of Mao and Che in a bar.) But, in this context, it is the gay white man, not the black man, who has victim status.

This, too, is a complicated reaction. Most of the time the physicality on display is intimidating and violent, and yet it can also be a swooning epiphany of carefree beauty, more beautiful, in some forbidden and unknowable way, because of the violence.</p> <p>We are accustomed to talk about toxic masculinity \u2013 and of course the masculinity of this film is mostly very toxic.

  "<h2>Top story: Researchers to test 300,000 in UK for immunity</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray with the stories that should be top of mind this morning.</p> \n<p>Guardian research has revealed that ethnic minorities in England are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/racial-inequality-in-britain-found-a-risk-factor-for-covid-19\">dying in disproportionately high numbers compared with white people</a>. Minority groups appear to be over-represented among coronavirus deaths by as much as 27%. The Guardian analysis found that of 12,593 patients who died in hospital up to 19 April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/what-is-happening-is-not-normal-we-100-need-answers-this-is-not-adding-up\">19% were Black, Asian and minority ethnic</a> (BAME) even though these groups make up only 15% of the general population in England. \u201cThere have been health inequalities that have existed in the [BAME] population but what is being reflected in this pandemic is that those inequalities are actually coming out,\u201d said Wasim Hanif, professor of diabetes and endocrinology at University Hospital Birmingham. The Labour shadow equalities minister, Marsha de Cordova, has called for an independent investigation into the impact of Covid-19 on BAME communities.</p> \n<p>The UK is embarking on a large-scale study of 300,000 people to find out what proportion of the population has already caught and become immune to coronavirus. In the first wave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/uk-plans-to-test-300000-for-immunity-to-coronavirus\">about 25,000 people in England will be invited to take part in testing</a>.

China\u2019s national health commission issued seven different case definitions for Covid-19 between 15 January and 3 March, and the Hong Kong study found these changes had a \u201csubstantial effect\u201d on how many infections were officially recorded. \u201cIf the fifth version of the case definition had been applied throughout the outbreak with sufficient testing capacity, we estimated that by 20 February 2020 there would have been 232,000 \u2026 confirmed cases in China as opposed to the 55,508 confirmed cases reported,\u201d the study said.</p> \n<p>The world is on track for a recession of \u201cunprecedented depth in the post-war period\u201d, ratings agency Fitch has said.

  "<p>To begin looking for objects in the heavens, you\u2019ll need to know where north, south, east and west are. Make a note of where the sun rises (east) and sets (west), use Google maps or use the compass on your phone. Now, download a free astronomy app to your phone AND computer. My favourite, for ease of use and features, is <a href=\"https://stellarium.org/\">Stellarium</a> .</p> <p>Once the app is installed, set your location. This ensures that, when opened, the app indicates what is in the sky above you \u2013 wherever you live in the world. Stellarium automatically sets the time and date but also has a function that speeds up time, so you can fast forward to night-time and explore the sky from your sofa. It\u2019s even possible to set it to show the sky on the night you were born.</p> <p>Decide what you want to search for in the sky (such as star clusters, constellations, planets) and use Stellarium to find them virtually: this will tell you which direction they lie in, and how high up in the sky to look. <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.stardroid&amp;hl=en_GB\">Sky Map </a>(Android) and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/star-walk-explore-the-sky/id295430577\">Star Walk</a> (iPhone) are free stargazing apps and provide the names of stars, constellations and planets if you point your phone at the sky. Both have a \u201cnight view\u201d or \u201cred light\u201d option, which is useful once your eyes adjust to the dark.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b70f6db3a80ae1a34211cf5bf5724ff9b4a04f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b70f6db3a80ae1a34211cf5bf5724ff9b4a04f7/50_15_977_497/500.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshots from Star Walk app\" width=\"500\" height=\"254\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Screenshots from Star Walk app</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Star Walk app on iPhone</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stargazing from home doesn\u2019t always mean apps and laptops: you can see plenty with binoculars \u2013 even a cheap pair.

Another supermoon is due on 7 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Devlin/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The moon is visible day and the night over the course of a month and on 7 May it will be a supermoon \u2013 a little closer to us than normal and appearing around 10% bigger. Look at the moon with your naked eyes and notice the dark and light-grey patches. Light-grey areas are mountainous highlands; the dark grey are long-dried-up lava beds called \u201cseas\u201d because early astronomers took them for actual seas. If you look closely you can see a white circle (where the seven would be if the moon were a clock face) with rays of white pointing out from it. This is Tycho; a crater about as big as East Anglia. If you have any kind of binoculars \u2013 old or even toy ones \u2013 grab them and have a closer look at the moon. You\u2019ll see more detail around the craters and seas but have a look around the edge of the moon, too, and see it\u2019s not a perfect circle. The rough, jagged outline is because of lunar mountain ranges.</p> <p>The phase of the moon changes daily. The phase is how much of the moon is visible from Earth \u2013 full, half and crescent, for example. The line between the light and dark side of the moon is called the terminator. Each night, look closely at the terminator and you\u2019ll see different craters, valleys and mountain ranges as the line slowly moves across the surface.</p> <h2>Planets</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fccfc37a4a775f35702f88db1edb9c8fe89d8918\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fccfc37a4a775f35702f88db1edb9c8fe89d8918/0_0_4782_3188/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Night sky, with constellations and Venus and Mars close to each other.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Night sky, with constellations and Venus and Mars close to each other.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brickley Pix/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the evening, Venus is a bright dot in the west. It shines brightly because the thick clouds that shroud it are reflecting sunlight towards us. If you\u2019ve got binoculars to hand, or a small telescope, notice that Venus isn\u2019t a perfect circle either \u2013 it has phases just like the moon.</p> <p>In the east on pre-dawn mornings throughout April and May, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars line up as three incredibly bright colourful dots. They\u2019re all visible with the naked eye, though with binoculars Mars will look salmon pink, Saturn oval-shaped (because of the rings) and you may even see some of Jupiter\u2019s moons.</p> <p>On 4 July after 9.30pm, the Moon, Jupiter and Saturn will all be very close together in the sky, forming a conjunction, which is a rare event.</p> <h2>Constellations and stars</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ad994832235d125e5c8d7a18211046e4ff10c12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ad994832235d125e5c8d7a18211046e4ff10c12/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stars of the Plough constellation in the night sky.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stars of the Plough constellation in the night sky.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Howard Litherland/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Constellations are official patterns of stars, and you\u2019ll be familiar with some names and patterns. During April, Orion will be visible in the west after sunset. Recognisable by the three stars in a row that form his belt, this is one of my favourites because hanging from his belt is a \u201csword\u201d containing another three stars and the middle \u201cstar\u201d is a naked-eye visible nebula where baby stars are being born. Look at this with binoculars and you may spot a blurry smudge that some see as coloured turquoise.</p> <p>Look north for the Plough (often called the Big Dipper). The second star on the \u201chandle\u201d of the Plough is a naked-eye double star. Look closely or use binoculars and you\u2019ll be able to see them clearly even with high light pollution.</p> <h2>International Space Station</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4116db9a1fddf8c201c27e57c7f320eedf69bab8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4116db9a1fddf8c201c27e57c7f320eedf69bab8/0_111_1440_789/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Screengrab from spotthestation.nasa.gov\" width=\"1000\" height=\"548\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Screengrab from <a href=\"https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/\">spotthestation.nasa.gov</a></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Orbiting the Earth, 250 miles up, is the International Space Station (ISS), home to (usually) six astronauts from around the world.

  "<p>Remember the banana bread era? An age of innocence, when we still thought lockdown was going to be like a wet half-term in an Enid Blyton book \u2013 a bit dull, but gosh, surely we can make the best of it with some cheery baking and 1,000-piece jigsaws. I think that was about 4,000 years ago. Oh wait, I just checked and it was actually the first week of April.<br><br>The initial three-week lockdown period has come and gone, and here we still are. Now it is less Enid Blyton, and more like day 453 in the Big Brother house, except there is no jacuzzi and no prize. Any novelty has worn off and it is time to dig deep, pick up our rookie game and work on making the second phase of lockdown as livable as it can be.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a63ba665459744d298f62c1cfe0f694647c94a3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a63ba665459744d298f62c1cfe0f694647c94a3e/0_0_1476_706/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Season one of Big Brother.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"478\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Season one of Big Brother.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now that this is not our first rodeo, we can be more realistic about what lockdown looks like. No one seriously thinks they are going to write their first novel any more. Three weeks ago I was confident I would be eating homegrown salad by now. Last night I was pumped because I invented a stir-fry recipe that polished off the last of a three-year-old jar of stem ginger. Yes, my passion project has turned out to be using up sticky half-jars from my kitchen shelves. The glamour. Here follows a five-point guide for nailing the tricky second act of lockdown.</p> <h2><strong>1. Embrace the tracksuit</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc4e251510f46ba49a2210f640111666f71d16c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc4e251510f46ba49a2210f640111666f71d16c2/0_0_1439_1800/799.jpg\" alt=\"The LGLB SS20 Impatient tracksuit\" width=\"799\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The LGLB SS20 Impatient tracksuit</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m not talking about the fancy sweatshirt you got for Christmas with a slogan either in French or feminist-adjacent or both. I\u2019m not talking about silky jogger-shaped trousers. I\u2019m talking about a proper tracksuit, matching top and bottoms, and not even in grey marl. We are all in this together, remember, and nothing says team player like a colourful tracksuit, which elevates domestic listlessness to something snappier. Since the last week of March, tracksuit sales have spiked to levels not seen since Paris Hilton rocked Juicy Couture velour. I have never worn an actual tracksuit before, but since lockdown I have lived in my two-piece in \u201cimpatient pink\u201d by Serena Rees\u2019 British loungewear label,<a href=\"https://lesgirlslesboys.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/slim-shrunken-sweatshirt-and-regular-track-pants-set\"> Les Girls Les Boys</a>. I\u2019m not pretending it\u2019s the most elegant outfit I\u2019ve ever worn \u2013 \u201cyou look \u2026 fun,\u201d offered my husband with the diplomacy essential to current domestic circumstances \u2013 but it is cheerful to put on in the morning, comfortable and has an enjoyable \u201cpastel-toned Florida retiree does happy hour at the beach club\u201d vibe<strong> </strong>when teamed with a quarantini for an evening Zoom catchup. Also doubles as pyjamas for the ultimate in day-to-night dressing.</p> <h2><strong>2. Brush up your lockdown comms</strong></h2> <p>Can we talk about the email opener about hoping your correspondent is staying sane during these crazy days/challenging times? I\u2019m \u2026 over it. Is that too soon? I still feel the need to check in with friends and family, like we all do, but I think we all know what\u2019s going on by now. Is there really anything to be gained from being served yet another reminder every single time we open a sodding email? In other key comms updates: Fomo has been replaced by Zomo, AKA the lockdown form of social anxiety, prompted when you wake up to screengrabs on other people\u2019s Instagram Stories of a Zoom quiz/locktail hour you weren\u2019t invited to.</p> <h2><strong>3. Dig out a work-to-walk dress</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4e8f8bf4c1fcd5b7a816e41f3a535ddbcf3af4dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e8f8bf4c1fcd5b7a816e41f3a535ddbcf3af4dc/0_0_1920_2880/667.jpg\" alt=\"The Zara polka dot printed dress.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Zara polka dot printed dress.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zara</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Forget walk to work \u2013 work to walk is the daily routine. If you are hunched over a laptop at your kitchen table all day except for your daily prescription constitutional, warm spring weather is a good time to dig out a presentable-but-breezy dress that works for both. (Your tracksuit is going to need a wash at some point, if nothing else.) Clare Hornby, the founder and creative director of British womenswear label Me &amp; Em, says figuring out your work-to-walk look is the key to a lockdown wardrobe that takes you from Zoom call to fixing lunch in the kitchen to walking the dog and back to the laptop. In the past week, three out of five of her label\u2019s bestsellers were dresses. I have bookmarked the <a href=\"https://www.meandem.com/cargo-pocket-swing-dress-sage\">cargo pocket swing dress</a> in sage green, \u00a3195, which has Zoom-pleasing detailing without being inappropriately glam \u2013 but you have this type of dress in your wardrobe already.

Time to nail your Zoom groom. One of the many ironic footnotes of lockdown life is that now that there is nowhere to get our hair cut or our roots done or a manicure or brow threading, and nothing in the diary to actually get dressed up for and nothing to stop us raiding the fridge every 10 minutes, we spend hours every day staring at our own faces on video conference calls. I have never been any good at makeup so for that I refer you to my world-beating colleague <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/11/top-10-lockdown-beauty-tips-sali-hughes\">Sali Hughes</a>, but I do have thoughts on set design and lighting. First, your laptop should be at least elevated at least two coffee-table books or four September issues of Vogue above table top height, or the camera angle will be a shocker. Second, do as Tom Ford suggests and position a table lamp just behind your laptop, on the side that highlights your \u201cgood side\u201d. (Everyone has one. Look in a mirror.) Third, tidy up the background, and remember that everyone is definitely judging you on your tea mug and your paint colour \u2013 but don\u2019t show off. Read the room, people. Your team do not want to see you hot-desking in a poolside cabana and your NCT group doesn\u2019t need to know that you recreate the baby cinema experience in your home screening room. Daffodils on the kitchen table and a yoga mat jammed down the back of the sofa is about the right pitch. A small child appearing for a brief cameo is ideal cuteness plus relatability vibes.</p> <h2><strong>5. Make 6pm happen</strong></h2> <p>There are lots of nice things about working from home, but I really miss coming home from work. Now that I don\u2019t get to kick my shoes off and hang my jacket up, I need a different kind of marker to end the working day. At some point it would probably be a good idea to find a device for this that was less than 25% alcohol, but for now \u2013 embrace the quarantini.</p>",
  "<p>For the 35 years I have practised as a psychotherapist, I have discouraged people from seeing themselves as hapless victims of forces arrayed against them. That\u2019s the whole premise \u2013 that whatever brought you to my office, it is hampering your ability to direct the course of your own life. So let\u2019s name your pain and then do something about it. Tell off the boss, walk out on the husband, confront the perpetrator, whatever it takes, and then move on, become the agent of your existence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/audio/2020/may/18/psychotherapy-under-lockdown-terrified-patients-podcast\">Therapy under lockdown: 'I\u2019m just as terrified as my patients are' \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a profession that has been good to me, and I hope good for my patients. But what if the premise is undone by circumstance? What if it turns out that we <em>are</em> hapless victims of a force arrayed against us, that will mercilessly hijack the machinery of our lives, that is silent and invisible and leaves us with nothing to do but cower in our homes and wash our hands and hope that it will pass us by? Is there a role for therapy in a pandemic?</p> <p>Those are not the kind of questions I used to start my work day with, unless my first patient was someone with paranoid delusions. But then again, until a month or so ago, I didn\u2019t start my working day by sitting down in front of my computer and clicking a patient into view. I\u2019m already getting accustomed to it; the human capacity for adapting is remarkable. But the one thing I can\u2019t get used to, so far anyway, is the way my patients\u2019 faces appear in this simulacrum of intimacy. I may have sat for hours with them, watched their faces contort in anguish, or beam in satisfaction. I may have searched out their eyes, tried to bring them back into contact from their safe haven on the ceiling. I may have thought I knew every inch of these faces, and no longer even needed to ask what their expressions meant.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t wrong, not exactly. I just didn\u2019t realise that all that searching was done against so many tempting distractions: the catalpa trees outside my window, the paintings on my wall, the little corner of ceiling tile that was chipped 30 years ago and has never been repaired. I could swivel in my chair, adjust my posture, look at the clock, and then back to the face. Now that it has been reduced to a flat image in the middle of a flat screen, and I have no easy elsewhere to look, I\u2019m realising that half the work was the struggle to behold those faces, and half the satisfaction was succeeding in wrestling attention to the task at hand. And maybe half the treatment was their observing that struggle, feeling the love in it.</p> <p>Of course, there\u2019s more to the video than just the face, and distractions aplenty on the screen. But they are unfamiliar to me, and not in the world I share with my patient. Take this patient, just a guy trying to figure out his life now that his wife has left him. I might have known all about his sex life and his financial woes, but not that his couch was brown and his living room painted sky blue. It feels a little indecent to be seeing it. It\u2019s one thing to penetrate the hidden meaning of his words \u2013 after all, that\u2019s what he\u2019s paying me for \u2013 and quite another to catch a glimpse of something I\u2019m only seeing because that\u2019s where the best wifi is. Can I ask him what it means that the shelves above the couch are empty? Would that question be a sign of love, or just impertinence?</p> <p>But still, that face. It\u2019s right there. I can\u2019t escape it, as I imagine he can\u2019t escape mine. I keep looking at the postage-stamp version of what he is seeing. It\u2019s vanity that draws my attention back to that corner of my screen, but it\u2019s also curiosity. This hard and wrinkled face, this half-smile, these hooded eyes: this is what my patient sees? So much of my job is making sure I understand what I am conveying, labouring to launch my words across the room with the right inflection, the right expression, the one that carries my concern as well as my scepticism, that challenges and supports in equal measure, and watching myself watching myself, I can see that I haven\u2019t got the slightest idea of how I am coming across \u2013 and I am far too interested in finding out. I click off the view of my own face.</p> <p>So we are focused on each other\u2019s faces, but there is still at least one thing missing: that moment when your mutual darting attention comes to rest and you make real eye contact, not the off-kilter kind that comes from peering at a screen located a few inches from a camera, but an actual meeting of actual eyes transmitted through the air of a shared room. You look into each other, and you see, even if you don\u2019t say it out loud (and you rarely do) just how rare and precious this is, this intimacy that you have kindled by agreeing (and again mostly without saying so) to be honest with each other, and to sit with the consequences. Which is the whole point, the reason they pay and I work, and the means, if there is one, of healing, if there is any.</p> <p>God, I miss that.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>If anything unites the disparate branches of psychotherapy, it is the belief that trauma twists the timber of the self, and determines the precise shape of our suffering. Freud identified this as the \u201crepetition compulsion\u201d, the unconscious tendency to place ourselves in situations that are versions of the past \u2013 or to construe them that way. Some traumas are more obvious than others, outright violation easier to identify than the diffuse ineptitude of some parents, or their inability to provide both love and sustenance on a sales assistant\u2019s salary, or the manifold humiliations children suffer at the hands of other children. But as capable as we might be at burying them, our traumas are more capable of haunting us. Therapy is the work of exhuming them, bringing them to light, and then putting them behind us.</p> <p>This idea that the pain of the past shapes our present experience has never been scientifically proven, but it is very likely that this idea is part of how you understand your own history, whether or not you ever enter into therapy. And if you do come into my office, we will ferret out the trauma at the source of your discontent, and, having found it, if our work is successful, you will recognise it as the moment that turned your life, and as the moment that you must leave behind.</p> <p>But what if the trauma is not hidden in the mists of time, but right here, in the midst of life? What if it grows at every moment, in every encounter, at no one\u2019s hand in particular but at everyone\u2019s hands \u2013 especially if they were unwashed and touched the apple that you are right now hesitating over in the supermarket. Maybe that guy on the other side of the apple bin is smiling at you, understanding exactly what you are thinking, or maybe he\u2019s glaring at you, trying urgently to dissuade you from putting the apple back into the pile. You can\u2019t tell, of course, because, like you, he is wearing a mask. And the only thing worse are the people who are not \u2013 the people who, encouraged by a president with a Jack-o\u2019-lantern smile, believe that the cure is worse than the disease and have brought their entire families to the grocery store to escape their lockdown. Complain to me right now, in the middle of this video therapy session, about that president or the masks or the guy who touched the apple and put it back, and am I really going to tell you that your outrage is about your father \u2013 even if, in some ineluctable way, it is?</p> <p>Or maybe you work in a hospital emergency department and you come home from your shift every day and take your clothes off in the garage and shower in the basement before joining your family upstairs, and you\u2019re trying to snuggle with your kids, but all you can think of is the intubation you did, in full hazmat kit, and all those virulent droplets the patient expelled as you slipped the tube down his throat? Or you work in a nursing home and your ex-wife won\u2019t let you see your children, even at a distance, until this whole thing is over, which is when, exactly? Or you are stuck at home in a marriage that depended for its success, you are just finding out, on your not being stuck at home together. Shall we go down memory lane in search of the trauma that has you ricocheting between boredom and terror? Shall we dissect your emotions so that you can see just how neurotic your response is?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8a2a872ba7bbdcfd8d136da0a0af5f3bb5376369\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a2a872ba7bbdcfd8d136da0a0af5f3bb5376369/584_383_5065_3040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sigmund Freud circa 1932.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sigmund Freud circa 1932.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imagno/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Freud promised his patients nothing more than the ability to trade in neurotic misery for common unhappiness. Still, he harboured some optimism, albeit a strange variety. He would surely have scoffed at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/jan/27/the-greatest-anne-frank-quotes-ever\" title=\"\">Anne Frank\u2019s assertion</a> that in spite of everything, people are still good at heart, but he did believe we have a heart, and that it could be convinced to ache less, if only we could tell it the right story. That story would have to be realistic. It could not be the \u201cnursemaid\u2019s lullaby\u201d of religion or the paranoid person\u2019s account of a world out to get him. Its hero would be the stoic, who could accept the price he paid for the comforts of civilisation: the never-ending need to restrain his animal nature, and to never lose sight of the inescapability of nature\u2019s red tooth and claw. It was a tall order, but Freud was convinced that we could accommodate ourselves to reality rather than pretending reality was other than what it is.</p> <p>Freud placed his bet on the human, as the source of both suffering and balm. He didn\u2019t reckon with a nemesis so indifferent as a virus, any more than he worried about a meteor crashing into the Earth or the sun suddenly being snuffed out. The nice thing about depravity is that we can imagine ways to suppress it, and even succeed, if fitfully, at doing so. It\u2019s not clear yet if we are ingenious enough to do that with this virus, and even if we are, that outcome is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\" title=\"\">a long way off</a>. In the meantime, we are stuck with the imperative to restrain ourselves to a degree that Freud did not anticipate. At a time when we need each other badly, when we are under attack not by human nature but by nature itself, the best we can do to take care of one another is to stay away from one another. Even Freud at his most misanthropic never imagined that.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Perhaps this is not the time to ask \u201cWhat would Sigmund do?\u201d. He\u2019s not much of a role model in normal times, let alone times like these. It\u2019s certainly not what I am asking right now, as I prepare for another day in front of the unblinking camera. What I am asking is the same thing that manufacturers turning their assembly lines to ventilator production or retailers improvising kerbside services are asking: how can I put my experience, my knowledge, my talents \u2013 suddenly rendered irrelevant and impotent \u2013 to use in a new and unfamiliar world?</p> <p>Some things are the same. People still complain about their wives and their kids and their bosses. They still have dreams, although it seems like a lot of them recently are about being trapped. They still well up with sadness or bite off their words in anger. They still look to me for support and guidance. They still laugh at my stupid jokes and tell me theirs. They still show up \u2013 although occasionally, if the appointment is in the evening, with a glass of wine. They still talk to me, answer my questions. They still pay me, if by online transfer.</p> <p>It\u2019s reassuring, this continuity. It may help to explain one of the differences I\u2019ve noticed: the ease with which people who are frequently evasive or argumentative or, as Freud would put it, resistant, seem to have suddenly shed their ambivalence. The man who could not talk about being molested now wants to, the woman whose abandonment by her husband left her too humiliated to speak of it now speaks of nothing else; the couple who always showed up to the office five or 10 minutes late now sign into my virtual office five or 10 minutes early, and are perched eagerly on their sofa when I open my screen.</p> <p>Is it possible that the screen creates just enough distance to provide a safety that my words and gestures cannot? Have we inadvertently found a sweet spot between the detachment of everyday life and the cloud chamber of face-to-face therapy? Or are people so sick and tired of being cooped up with family, or alone, that they are spilling over with the desire to talk to someone else at any opportunity?</p> <p>I haven\u2019t had time to interrogate this yet. I suppose if lockdown keeps up or gets more stringent, I will have to. Or maybe people will discover a new way to protect themselves from my intrusions, as the old forms of intimacy, the ones that require physical presence, recede into memory and the video version becomes the new normal. Perhaps Covid-19 has only accelerated a trend already under way.</p> <p>But the immediate question is not for the patients, but for me: what exactly am I supposed to do when I slip on the headphones and turn on the camera and another person in the midst of this crisis comes into view? The gambit of therapy is that the therapist is a few steps ahead of the patient, like a caving veteran leading a novice into a cavern unfamiliar to both; he may not know the particulars, but his headlamp is a little brighter and he knows how to find his way around. But this cave is unfamiliar and my lamp is dim. I don\u2019t even have a name yet for the strange admixture of emotion \u2013 fear and helplessness and disorientation and sadness and anger, in constantly shifting measure \u2013 that has taken hold in the last month or so, and that has become the new background of my life, too. I\u2019m just as terrified as my patients are, maybe more so \u2013 and not just of drowning in Covid-19 or infecting my wife or losing my friends to disease. I\u2019m as afraid of the aftermath as I am of the illness. Police are using helicopters to enforce social distancing. To those who defer to scientists and public health authorities, that may seem like a good idea. To those who crave power and who understand science well enough to know that this virus will be with us for a long time, it may seem like an opportunity.</p> <p>So I do not know what I am supposed to do when confronted with those worried, perplexed faces. I am making this up as I go along. I\u2019m making more jokes than usual. I\u2019m talking about my life more than I normally would, maybe because my patients hear my dogs barking or see the piano that sits in view of my camera as inexplicably as those empty shelves. And I am finding myself saying words I don\u2019t remember saying, at least not so often: \u201cExtraordinary times\u201d, \u201cunprecedented stress\u201d, \u201cuncharted waters\u201d. To the man who can\u2019t sleep, to the woman so racked by anxiety that she has begun to pull out her own hair, to the miserable college student whose postgraduate plans have evaporated along with the economy, to the parents of the high schooler who suddenly believes that the furniture in the house in which he is trapped is alive, and who, in less extraordinary times, probably would not have become psychotic, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u201d is all I seem to have to offer.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>These are not the circumstances for which therapy is designed. The events that bring us into therapy generally have the decency to be limited in time and place. A global pandemic is global, and it may never fully recede, or it may be replaced by another, and either way, we will have learned what few people alive today know firsthand: that, despite our dams and cities, despite our weather forecasts, despite our medicines and ventilators, despite the vast knowledge and dedication of our scientists, the genius of our artists, and the scale of our achievements \u2013 despite everything we have built to keep ourselves safe, we are not. We can be undone \u2013 not only by one another, but by a strand of proteins, and not only in a moment, but with months of warning and over more months, perhaps years, of fear and illness. The horizons on which nuclear holocaust or global warming are gathering are just distant enough to remain abstract, and they are at least theoretically under human control. Not so with a virus.</p> <p>Therapists knew this long before Covid-19. Sit with people stunned by loss for any length of time and listen, really listen, to them, and it becomes clear that everyone will be confronted with grief and no one knows how it is supposed to go. So, if nothing else, we have got good at consolation. We know how to comfort, how to help people speak the unspeakable. Perhaps I will find use for other old tools, or the trauma of this pandemic will not prove as pervasive or persistent as it seems at this moment. But for the moment, this is what I have to offer those expectant, beautiful faces that are far away and so close: help in cataloguing the losses, and at grappling with them even as they mount. I can only hope it is sufficient.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>As the coronavirus lockdown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/uk-lockdown-to-continue-for-at-least-three-weeks-raab-confirms\">continues</a>, many of us holed up at home with family will be wondering how much more of it we can take. But what is it like if you have 11 kids or live with your extended family? We asked some of Britain\u2019s biggest families how they are coping.</p> <p><strong>Danielle Jackson, 36, is from Southend in Essex. She is a full-time parent to Allysha, 18, Mia, 16, Amelia, 14, Sophie, 13, Ruby, 10, and one-year-old twins Reid and Hunter</strong></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m finding it hard,\u201d admits Danielle Jackson. She is a single parent: space and money are tight. (One of her daughters has to sleep on a sofa in the living room.) Danielle is on employment and support allowance due to her mental health condition, and her children are eligible for free school meals. Since the schools closed, Danielle has been given Tesco vouchers to cover their lunches. However, the queue to get into Tesco is more than an hour long, and Danielle doesn\u2019t want to leave the kids at home alone for that long.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m having to ration our food,\u201d Danielle says. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult because, normally, the kids can just make themselves something to eat, but I have to be in control of all our meals now, to make sure we don\u2019t run out. And the minute I go food shopping, the next day it\u2019s all gone.\u201d She has been issued food bank vouchers, but finding time to go is difficult.</p> <p>With so many children cooped up at home, there can be occasional fireworks. \u201cIt\u2019s the arguments between them,\u201d Danielle sighs. \u201cThat\u2019s what does me. Especially the older ones, because they\u2019re teenagers now. Having them at home is hard. They haven\u2019t got a computer or anything to keep them entertained.\u201d</p> <p>Danielle has stopped the children from watching the news. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to get scared,\u201d she explains. \u201cNot when it\u2019s just me there to break it down to them and help them deal with it.\u201d Normally Danielle\u2019s mum and sister would help her with childcare, but due to the restrictions they have been unable to visit.</p> <p>Being at home alone with the kids has been psychologically challenging. \u201cI have felt suffocated, and I think the kids have, too,\u201d she says. But when it all gets too much, Danielle goes for night-time walks. \u201cIt\u2019s peaceful,\u201d she says. \u201cI love it. No cars. You can hear the foxes and all the other animals that come out at night. When the sky is clear, you can see the stars. It\u2019s lovely.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f3201f0dcb1b4af0d399c0730bcb6f0193543edb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3201f0dcb1b4af0d399c0730bcb6f0193543edb/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Bhullar family (l to r): Inveer, Charan, Mohan, Tim, Ravinder and Harneet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bhullar family (l to r): Inveer, Charan, Mohan, Tim, Ravinder and Harneet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Tim Bhullar, 57, is a business owner from Huddersfield in West Yorkshire.

His niece Nimrata, 21, was also staying with the family until last week</strong></p> <p>Tim Bhullar usually wakes up at about 7am. But he doesn\u2019t go downstairs until 11. \u201cI just want to spend some time upstairs on my own,\u201d he jokes. He usually listens to his daughter Harpreet\u2019s radio show during this time \u2013 she lives in London, and presents the BBC Asian Network breakfast show.</p> <p>TV has become a big issue in the Bhullar house. \u201cOne kid wants to watch American films and the other wants to watch Sky Sports and my parents want to watch the Asian channels,\u201d he says. To resolve conflict, Tim installed a TV in a bedroom, so that the children could watch what they wanted. But Tim\u2019s parents missed having the kids around, so they relinquished control of the remote. \u201cNow my dad gives my son the remote and says: \u2018Here, put on whatever you want, come sit with us,\u2019\u201d Tim says. \u201cDad doesn\u2019t mind watching Sky Sports, as long as we\u2019re all together.\u201d</p> <p>Due to their age, Tim\u2019s parents are particularly at risk if they catch coronavirus. \u201cI looked out of the window recently and Dad was standing at the top of the drive,\u201d Tim says. \u201cI asked him what he was doing and he said he wanted to get some air. I said: \u2018That\u2019s the furthest you\u2019re going!\u2019\u201d No one is leaving the house, apart from shopping. \u201cMy son says: \u2018When will this be over? I want to see my friends,\u2019\u201d Tim says. \u201cI say: \u2018You can\u2019t see your friends! You\u2019re handcuffed here because of your grandparents.\u2019 But he\u2019s taken it well.\u201d</p> <p>Tim has imposed one crucial ground rule. \u201cI don\u2019t want my parents to get depressed, not at their age,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I\u2019ve told the kids: \u2018If you want to be miserable, fine, but be miserable upstairs! When you come downstairs, be happy.\u2019 I want everyone to take the lockdown in good spirits.\u201d</p> <p>Griping aside, lockdown has brought the family closer together. \u201cThe kids are spending much more time with their grandparents than they would normally,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have a better bond now.

They start arguing over their toys or wanting to go on the laptop at the same time.\u201d</p> <p>David has Parkinson\u2019s disease, which puts him in the at-risk group for coronavirus. He has been off work for the past 12 weeks and has to follow strict social distancing guidance. \u201cIt\u2019s made things hard,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I\u2019m the one who drives. Now Alexis has to do the shopping on her own, and carry it back , as they don\u2019t let more than one person into the shop. And we\u2019re not talking one or two small bags \u2013 she\u2019s buying eight pints of milk a day! Luckily, she\u2019s quite fit.\u201d</p> <p>Being at home has given David a newfound respect for Alexis, who is a full-time parent. \u201cI\u2019ve always had enormous respect for her,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it\u2019s been an eye-opener as to what goes on when I\u2019m at work.\u201d Trying to manage the children\u2019s screen time has been particularly difficult: David has been teaching them jiu-jitsu in their small garden, so the children get some exercise. When the family goes for a walk, they get funny looks. \u201cPeople think we aren\u2019t social distancing,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause there are so many of us together.\u201d</p> <p>David is trying to see the positives. \u201cHaving more quality time with the children has been really good.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7116838cdde29ed376aaa5edaae8d0e02f4c02c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7116838cdde29ed376aaa5edaae8d0e02f4c02c9/0_385_6006_3604/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zara Sehr (seated) with (l to r) Rubina, Arshad, Huraira, Imaan, Noor, Faisal and three of their cats.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zara Sehr (seated) with (l to r) Rubina, Arshad, Huraira, Imaan, Noor, Faisal and three of their cats.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Zara Sehr Ashraf, 31, is a fashion programmer from Croydon, south London.

I\u2019ll be talking to my boss and out of the corner of my eye, I\u2019ll see my niece ripping my favourite book to shreds.\u201d Zara created a workstation in the living room, surrounding a makeshift desk with plants and purchasing an office chair, but her nieces knocked over the plants and drew all over the beige chair. \u201cThey\u2019re only little,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat can you do?\u201d</p> <p>In lieu of being able to escape her surroundings, headphones have become Zara\u2019s best friend. But they don\u2019t block out her dad\u2019s friendly attempts at conversation. \u201cHe always wants to share a news story with me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t really understand that I\u2019m in a different headspace.\u201d If her dad\u2019s not nattering away, Zara\u2019s mum is finding her something to do. \u201cWe\u2019re not a hugely traditional family,\u201d she says, \u201cbut we are south Asian, so there are gender roles there. I\u2019ve not been furloughed, but I\u2019m still being asked to help out in the kitchen with the cooking!\u201d</p> <p>Maintaining focus at work has been difficult given the circumstances. \u201cI feel grateful that I still have work,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I\u2019ve really noticed the psychological effects of not being able to go into the office every day and have the commute to decompress.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not just work that is a challenge. \u201cYou\u2019ll be lucky if you can steal a precious 20 minutes of sanctuary in the bathroom before the banging on the door begins,\u201d Zara says. She proposed a bathroom rota to no avail. \u201cIt\u2019s lawless in our household,\u201d she laughs. \u201cWe don\u2019t take well to rules.\u201d</p> <p>Being trapped at home with her family has led to some conflict. \u201cThings that wouldn\u2019t normally bother us are definitely building up in an unhealthy way,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd because my parents are older, it\u2019s more dangerous for them to go outside. So their pressures and frustrations are building up even more, because they have less release.\u201d</p> <p>When everything gets too much, Zara retreats to her bedroom. \u201cIt\u2019s my small paradise,\u201d she says. Babaganoush sometimes joins her. \u201cHe\u2019s my only ally in this house,\u201d she jokes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"70cd52fd4ccf6765dc72788b7db923481d12ae39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70cd52fd4ccf6765dc72788b7db923481d12ae39/0_202_828_497/500.jpg\" alt=\"Tess Giddings with (l to r) Amiah, Jacob, Savannah, Hezekiah, Nevaeh (front), Chris, Zion and Levi.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tess Giddings with (l to r) Amiah, Jacob, Savannah, Hezekiah, Nevaeh (front), Chris, Zion and Levi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image provided by Tess Giddings</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Tess Giddings, 32, a home</strong><strong>maker and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thegiddingstribe/?hl=en\">influencer</a> from Bournemouth in Dorset, lives with her husband, Chris, an engineer, and their children, Jacob, 13, Savannah, 11, Amiah, 10, Zion, 8, Nevaeh, 4, and twins Levi and Hezekiah, </strong><strong>2</strong></p> <p>\u201cWhen this first started, I was like, \u2018This is my worst nightmare\u2019,\u201d says Tess Giddings. \u201cHaving all the kids home from school? I can\u2019t do this.\u201d She is speaking to me from the family\u2019s minivan because the house is too loud.</p> <p>Home schooling all seven children was her biggest worry. \u201cThe thought of it was overwhelming,\u201d she says. Teachers advised Tess to take it day by day, and not put too much pressure on the kids, which helped her to feel more relaxed. Like many families, the Giddingses have been regulars at Joe Wicks\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/26/joe-wicks-interview-my-hearthrob-days-are-over\">morning P</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/26/joe-wicks-interview-my-hearthrob-days-are-over\">E</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/26/joe-wicks-interview-my-hearthrob-days-are-over\"> sessions</a>. \u201cWhen there are so many kids to entertain, it is non-stop,\u201d she says. \u201cBut every time I get stressed, I think that there are people in worse situations \u2013 people are dying. I have to be thankful we\u2019re all healthy and together.\u201d</p> <p>Chris, who has been furloughed, came up with an innovative solution to keep the younger children entertained: he has converted their garage into a soft play centre. \u201cHe\u2019s padded it all out and childproofed it using his martial arts mats,\u201d Tess says. \u201cWhile he was doing it, I was rolling my eyes. But it\u2019s been really good.\u201d</p> <p>Buying enough food for her nine-person family exposes Tess to the ire of the British public. She was in Aldi doing a big shop when a man came up to her. \u201cHe said: \u2018You better be having a party, because that takes the absolute mickey,\u2019\u201d Tess recalls. \u201cHe was smiling, but I could tell he meant it.\u201d</p> <p>Online commenters can also be critical. After Tess posted a picture on Instagram of her family on a walk by the seafront, she received negative comments. \u201cPeople were saying: \u2018Stay in, you\u2019re so selfish,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cBut I know the government guidelines \u2013 we\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Everyone is allowed one walk a day.\u201d</p> <p>When it all gets too much, Tess hides in the van. \u201cThere is no escape in the house,\u201d she sighs. \u201cI even get followed to the toilet by the twins! Sometimes I go and sit in the van, for a bit of peace and quiet.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>\u2018It\u2019s the strangest casting I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d says Jeff Pope. \u201cI phoned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/19/eddie-marsan-interview-twitter-is-my-midlife-crisis\">Eddie Marsan</a> and said, \u2018Look, I really want you for this. But we need a couple of your kids to be in it as well, and could your wife film it?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The producer, whose award-winning work includes Cilla, Mrs Biggs and A Confession, is talking about a new peak-time ITV drama which is being shot this week at various locations around England. Starring actors including Marsan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/nov/03/sheridan-smith-fell-apart-lost-my-mind-tom-lamont\">Sheridan Smith</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2009/oct/23/your-next-box-set-shameless\">David Threlfall</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/nov/15/pinter-favourite-tamsin-greig-robert-glenister-janie-dee-harold\">Robert Glenister</a>, it will be screened over four nights from 4 May. But before anyone calls the police, Isolation Stories \u2013 a quartet of 15-minute mini-dramas \u2013 is fully compliant with government instructions. The show will go out with almost no one involved having gone outside.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We delivered sanitised equipment to the actors at home \u2026 then talked them through by phone how to use it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe asked ourselves: how do we do this without breaking the law?\u201d explains Pope. \u201cSo we delivered sanitised filming equipment to the actors at home. They took out the stuff, cleaned it, then we talked them through by phone how to use it.\u201d</p> <p>Among the cultural consequences of the coronavirus pandemic was the shutdown of all British TV drama production. Because fiction, unlike news, is not defined as key media work, the numbers of people, travel and amount of close contact involved in filming were deemed a health risk. Isolation Stories is an attempt to create a drama series within those restrictions. To avoid all of the stories being monologues, Pope swelled some of the casts with relatives quarantined with the dramas\u2019 stars. And to prevent the films being as visually restricted as selfies, it was also decided to have someone else operating the camera.</p> <p>So Eddie Marsan\u2019s wife Janine, by training a makeup artist, is looking through the lens. Smith was filmed by her partner Jamie, who is by trade an insurance broker, but, says Pope, \u201cturned out to be a natural director of photography \u2013 rock-steady moves.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c842ac5120d309eb292386fa9ec0313fd56d2a30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c842ac5120d309eb292386fa9ec0313fd56d2a30/0_155_2121_2863/741.jpg\" alt=\"Sheridan Smith, who is heavily pregnant, stars in the story Mel.\" width=\"741\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I jumped at the chance\u2019 \u2026 Sheridan Smith, who is heavily pregnant, stars in the story Mel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV Studios</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whereas many actors would be filming other TV dramas now if the sets had not been closed for infection control, Smith could only ever have made this one. \u201cI am heavily pregnant and have been isolating at home,\u201d she says, \u201cso I jumped at the chance to make a drama about the massive drama going on all around us.\u201d</p> <p>In Mel, by Gaby Chiappe, co-writer of the Miss World movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/10/misbehaviour-review-1970-miss-world-contest-keira-knightley-jessie-buckley\">Misbehaviour</a>, Smith brings a dramatic authenticity startling even by her standards to the character of a woman who is eight months pregnant and unable to leave the house.</p> <p>For Pope, the project also has a personal element. An elderly aunt, unwell with other conditions, caught the bug and died. Pope, his wife and three sons also all suffered the major symptoms of coronavirus, although, in the absence of testing for the general population, cannot be sure they were infected.</p> <p>\u201cMy wife was one of the unlucky ones who suffered really badly,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere were two nights when I was sure I was going to have to take her to A&amp;E. I\u2019d been told to count the number of breaths per minute because that can be an indicator of how bad it is. I remember standing outside the door and listening because I didn\u2019t want her to know I was counting.\u201d</p> <p>That ordeal, transferred to a less happy family home, inspired Pope\u2019s script, Ron and Russell. A young man is in reluctant and truculent lockdown with his dad, who becomes seriously ill. This was the hardest of the quartet to cast. Because acting is often dynastic, a number of fathers and sons are both Equity members. Within that sub-set, though, the production was restricted to those confined in the same household. Luckily, these included Robert Glenister, who played Ash Morgan in Hustle and the home secretary in Spooks, and Tom Glenister, a recent drama school graduate who has appeared in the crime drama Vera. However, as the family had neglected to contain a qualified camera operator, Celia De Woolf, a radio producer who is Tom\u2019s mum and Robert\u2019s wife, was given a Zoom course in how to use the disinfected camera.</p> <p>When I spoke to the trio by video during Wednesday\u2019s shooting, Celia said she often records radio on location, so is \u201cquite used to running a set. But I had no idea how a camera worked - a tilt, a zoom. I do now!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s great is working in one\u2019s own house,\u201d said Robert. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to get up at half five to go to some freezing location. Just get out of bed and get on with it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even need to get out bed,\u201d his wife points out. \u201cBecause your character\u2019s in it.\u201d</p> <p>Has there been any family creative tension? \u201cEr,\u201d said Celia, looking at her son.</p> <p>Tom smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ve had hushed firm whispers about the technology. But that\u2019s someone of my age assuming they know more about tech than their parents. I\u2019ve had to relinquish power and accept this is different from turning the Sky Box on.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"baaf6634cb7085e56173d559e04f1a4bb9cedfc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/baaf6634cb7085e56173d559e04f1a4bb9cedfc4/0_291_3200_3975/805.jpg\" alt=\"Hands off \u2026 producer Jeff Pope oversees the series from his garden office.\" width=\"805\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hands off \u2026 producer Jeff Pope oversees the series from his garden office.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max Pope</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Currently unemployed members of the industry may bridle that this system gives a lot of work to non-professional and non-union labour.

But I would point out that qualified and union crew are on hand to advise.\u201d</p> <p>With lighting and makeup experts providing long-distance tips, the main feed from the actor\u2019s home goes to a monitor at the house of the director, who can communicate with the set through the camera operator\u2019s earpiece.</p> <p>When directing ITV series such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/apr/25/little-boy-blue-review\">Little Boy Blue </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/08/white-house-farm-review-jeremy-bamber-family-murder\">White House Farm</a>, Paul Whittington is used to being surrounded by dozens of others. But on Mel, he worked alone. \u201cFor most of the day I have been up in my loft \u2013 the quietest spot in my house \u2013 looking at images relayed from the set which are a bit like Andy Warhol screen prints, all the colours separated. And the sound is intermittent so at times it\u2019s like trying to direct <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA2aAFjQqL4\">Norman Collier</a>. But it\u2019s exciting to be doing something and we are refining the process all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Smith told me, by email during shooting: \u201cIt\u2019s mad sat here in my kitchen with my partner as the cameraman and a load of people in their houses are all trying to talk to us at once \u2013 move the lights, get her to turn to her left. It\u2019s so interesting for us but it must be a nightmare for them.\u201d</p> <p>Neil McKay has written the drama Karen, involving a man whose \u201cessential shopping\u201d takes him past the house where his estranged son and grandchildren, played by three Marsans, live. Another of the Marsan children is shooting footage for a how-it-was-made documentary that may also be screened on ITV.</p> <p>McKay\u2019s usual work, such as the Fred West drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/sep/04/appropriate-adult-review\">Appropriate Adult</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/08/the-moorside-review-sheridan-smith-finds-a-new-way-into-the-familiar-awful-shannon-matthews-story\">The Moorside</a>, usually take two to three years of research, writing and shooting. \u201cBut, with this,\u201d he notes, \u201cit\u2019s two or three <em>weeks</em>. So the immediacy of it is astonishing.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike his character, McKay is a regular and loving visitor to grandsons who live nearby, at least he was until lockdown restricted family interaction. The writer says: \u201cOn my daily walk or bike ride, I pass their house but now can\u2019t go in. So, if they\u2019re at the window, I do a bit of Michael Flatley Irish dancing or run up and pretend to bowl a cricket ball at them. So I had the idea of a relative who isn\u2019t allowed to come in. Which is both poignant and comic.\u201d</p> <p>During his permitted daily act of exercise, the writer was also struck by how the current emergency has effectively killed the whisper: \u201cI\u2019ve observed people talking to each other across the lawn or road, rather than over the fence or across a pub or kitchen table. But whereas, in those circumstances, people lean in and lower their voice for intimate details, people are now proclaiming them across two metres, yelling: \u2018I\u2019ve got to have my prostate out!\u2019 Everyone sounds as if they\u2019re in a West End play.\u201d</p> <p>The fourth play, written by William Ivory, is an emergency online therapy session between Mike (Darren Boyd) and his psychiatrist Rochelle (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/15/angela-griffin-shes-ace-my-mum-a-grounded-down-to-earth-yorkshirewoman\">Angela Griffin</a>). \u201cThe positions of patient and shrink switch,\u201d says Pope.</p> <p>A complication for all four dramas was what Pope calls the \u201clegal, but also moral\u201d necessity of not breaking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/uk-lockdown-what-are-new-coronavirus-restrictions\">the lockdown rules</a> in any way. McKay\u2019s script is the only one to feature action outside a house. ITV\u2019s lawyers ruled that this element could be justified as the actor playing Grandad, David Threlfall, was travelling, within London, to do work that was not possible at home.</p> <p>McKay\u2019s script also scrupulously complies with the regulations because of the premise that the character can\u2019t go inside. But, as the drama takes place over a number of days, Threlfall will need to change costumes under a blanket in his car. And there may \u2013 Pope has realised ahead of filming later this week \u2013 be a further complication: \u201cIt has struck me that I hope David Threlfall doesn\u2019t need to use a loo. Because he can\u2019t go into the Marsans\u2019 house. So, strictly, he\u2019d have to drive back to his house, and then come back again. But let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t get to that.\u201d</p> <p>Next week, the directors will edit the films at their homes, then send them to post-production technicians also working in isolation. \u201cIt just bounces around virtually between all these houses,\u201d says Pope, \u201cand then it\u2019s transmitted. The weirdest thing is that these will go out on ITV without any of the crew having met.\u201d</p> <p>Although TV is a relatively young medium, most types of drama are many decades old. But these family-made shorts are a completely new form, born of emergency. McKay says: \u201cI\u2019m sure, in due course, normal service will be resumed, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/julian-fellowes\">Lord Fellowes</a> will be making his costume dramas again. But, in the short term, travelling light and improvising is going to have to be the way.\u201d</p> <p>Pope reflects: \u201cWe can\u2019t be sure that every shot will be pin-sharp. But, whatever technical imperfections there may be, I hope people are going to cut us some slack for having a go. There will be a big factual drama at some point \u2013 maybe I\u2019ll take it on, or one of the others who do this kind of thing \u2013 which will try to make sense of all this. But that will probably be in two or three years. In the meantime, there are these little stories that process this experience.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Isolation Stories screens nightly on ITV, 4-7 May.</em></p>",

While most of Malaysia remains in lockdown, glove factories are back to full production, with employees working round the clock to meet demand.</p> <p>In the rush to ramp up production, some glove manufacturers are failing to protect their staff, workers have told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re really afraid. The company is not enforcing social distancing. Everyone clocks in using the same thumb print scanner; 45 people travel to work on the same bus. All the workers arrive at the same time so the main entrance becomes very crowded,\u201d said a worker from Nepal.</p> <p>The migrant workers sleep in 24-person dorms, go to work on crowded company buses and stand shoulder to shoulder on 12-hour shifts for six days a week, making social distancing impossible. In return, some earn as little as \u00a37 a day.</p> <p>\u201cOur biggest fear is getting infected by local [Malaysian] workers. If they bring the virus in from outside there\u2019s a very high risk that we will get infected,\u201d said another Nepali worker.</p> <p>Neill Wilkins, head of the migrant workers programme at the Institute for Human Rights and Business, said the government must ensure that its suppliers prioritise the health and safety of their workforce. \u201cWorkers should be given clear instructions on how to keep safe, adequate PPE should be provided and social distancing practised. Measures should be taken to reduce overcrowding in living and sleeping spaces and to ensure enhanced sanitation,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Despite the glove industry\u2019s record on workers\u2019 rights, the NHS spent over \u00a375m on rubber gloves in 2018, most of them sourced from Malaysia.</p> <p>In March, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-52063563\">the government reportedly bought </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-52063563\">88.5m</a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-52063563\"> gloves from Supermax</a>, the European arm of a Malaysian firm.</p> <p>Workers employed at Supermax in Malaysia <a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2019/11/clean-gloves-dirty-practices-debt-bondage-in-malaysias-rubber-glove-industry/\">alleged last year</a> that they had to pay high fees in their home countries to secure their jobs, worked up to 30 days without rest and were penalised if they complained. Supermax denied the allegations, saying they operate in accordance with Malaysian law.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/dec/09/nhs-rubber-gloves-made-in-malaysian-factories-accused-of-forced-labour\">Guardian investigation in late 2018</a> into two of the then largest suppliers of medical gloves to the NHS, Top Glove and WRP, found migrant workers who alleged they were subject to forced overtime, withheld wages and passport confiscation. Top Glove and WRP denied the allegations.</p> <p>NHS Supply Chain, an organisation that manages the sourcing, delivery and supply of healthcare products for the NHS, said they no longer have contracts with Top Glove and WRP, but would not say if their current suppliers source from these companies, citing commercial sensitivity.</p> <p>There are around <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---asia/---ro-bangkok/documents/publication/wcms_447687.pdf\">3 to 4 million migrant workers in Malaysia</a>, mostly low-wage workers from Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar and Indonesia. The majority pay illegal recruitment fees to brokers \u2013 some as high as \u00a34,000 \u2013 to secure their jobs, leaving them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/apr/03/modern-day-slavery-explainer\">deep in debt and effectively trapped</a>.</p> <p>The UK government acknowledged the problem of excessive recruitment fees in its rubber manufacturing supply chains in Malaysia in its <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/875800/UK_Government_Modern_Slavery_Statement.pdf\">first ever modern slavery statement, published in March</a>, saying it had, \u201ccommissioned research into best practice interventions that prevent debt bondage within this industry.\u201d</p> <p>The US government banned the import of gloves from WRP in September, citing evidence of forced labour in its production. The <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-revokes-withhold-release-order-disposable-rubber-gloves\">ban was lifted in March</a> after the government said \u201cthe company is no longer producing gloves under forced labour conditions.\u201d</p> <p>Workers\u2019 rights activist Andy Hall says, despite some minor improvements, worker abuse is still widespread in the industry.</p> <p>He said that the British government has known about allegations of forced labour in its rubber gloves and medical device supply chain for many years now, and has been \u201cfar too slow to act\u201d. \u201cIt is not a case of either protecting frontline NHS staff with the gloves they need or protecting workers producing the gloves, but ensuring both are safe,\u201d said Hall.</p> <p>A spokesperson for NHS Supply Chain said, \u201cNHS Supply Chain takes all allegations of labour abuses in its supply chain very seriously, and we have a range of contractual arrangements and initiatives in place to try and prevent such situations arising.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>As Canada reels from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/portapique-shooting-nova-scotia-rcmp-canada\">mass shooting that killed at least 22 people</a>, residents in Nova Scotia have asked why authorities failed to send an emergency alert as a gunman posing as a police officer drove around the province for more than 12 hours.</p> <p>A week before Canada\u2019s worst-ever mass shooting, all residents of the province received a mobile phone alert asking them to remain at home due to the coronavirus pandemic. Many argue that a similar warning during the shooting spree could have saved lives.</p> <p>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said on Wednesday that the active shooter situation over the weekend was \u201cdynamic\u201d and \u201cfluid\u201d as officers scrambled to locate the gunman, delaying an emergency message broadcast to the public.</p> <p>\u201cWe were in the process of preparing an alert when the gunman was shot and killed by the RCMP,\u201d Chief Superintendent Chris Leather told reporters.</p> <p>The first reports of gunfire came late on Saturday, and police officers were dispatched to a home in the town of Portapique. At 11.32pm, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police sent out a tweet asking residents to \u201cstay in their homes with doors locked at this time\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RCMPNS/status/1251700067460886530\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RCMPNS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#RCMPNS</a> is responding to a firearms complaint in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Portapique?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Portapique</a> area.

Police believe the first victims were targeted, but Wortman went on to attack anyone on his path.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until 8.02am on Sunday that the police sent another tweet, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RCMPNS/status/1251828496810328064\">warning that there was an \u201cactive shooter situation\u201d</a> and that Wortman was probably disguised as an RCMP officer. Residents were once again asked to stay home and lock their doors.</p> <p>But by then, a number of residents \u2013 many of whom had heard about the incident the night before \u2013 assumed police had cleared up the situation.</p> <p>Nick Beaton told CTV news that as he and his pregnant wife Kristen started their day, in the town of Truro, they believed the incident had long passed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/canada_shooting_map/giv-39026zLjkJSGsU0C/\" data-alt=\"interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/canada_shooting_map/giv-39026zLjkJSGsU0C/\">interactive</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe thought he was taken care of,\u201d Nick Beaton said. By the time he realized the gunman was still at large, Kristen had left to begin her shift as a care worker. Nick desperately texted a picture of Wortman to his wife \u2013 but she never received he message. Her body was recovered later on Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cIf I had known he was on the loose I would have not let my wife leave the house that day,\u201d Beaton told CTV.</p> <p>Lillian Hyslop was also killed by Wortman as she walked along a familiar stretch of country road on Sunday morning. Friends have also said that an alert would have kept Hyslop at home.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Nova Scotia\u2019s premier, Stephen McNeil, said the province had activated the emergency management office by Sunday morning \u2013 which includes preparing for the release of an emergency alert to all telephones in the province \u2013 but the RCMP never requested an alert be sent.</p> <p>\u201cIn this case, the RCMP has to ask for that alert to go out, because quite frankly, we need the information from them. McNeil said, having previously told reporters that we wasn\u2019t prepared to \u201csecond-guess\u201d decisions that were made in a rapidly evolving situation.</p> <p>Such comments have angered many locals. \u201cIf that is not an emergency, what is? The death toll is rising. He has not been taken into custody. At what point do you decide that people need to be warned?\u201d said Maggie Rahr, a freelance investigative journalist in Nova Scotia, told the Guardian.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Canadian Press has reported that the US consulate in Nova Scotia emailed citizens on Sunday, warning of an active shooter. \u201cIt\u2019s our protocol \u2013 when emergencies occur \u2013 to alert US citizens in the area of the situation,\u201d said a consulate spokeswoman, Marcia R Seitz-Ehler.</p> <p>The RCMP previously defended their decision to use social media channels on Facebook and Twitter for their \u201cinstantaneous\u201d way of communicating.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/nova-scotia-shooting-death-toll-canada\">Nova Scotia shooting: death toll rises to 22 as more victims identified</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re aware that we have thousands of followers in Nova Scotia and felt that it was a way, a superior way to communicate this ongoing threat,\u201d Ch Supt Leather told reporters on Monday.</p> <p>Police have yet to determine what motivated the shooting spree, and the death toll is expected to rise still further as 16 crime scenes are investigated.</p> <p>The head RCMP initially said Wortman was not \u201cknown to police\u201d, but court documents show that in 2002 he pleaded guilty to assaulting a 15-year-old boy in the parking lot of a denture clinic.</p> <p>Wortman was ordered to undergo counselling for anger management and banned from possessing firearms, explosives and any prohibited weapon for nine months.</p>",
  "<p>Over the last several weeks, we have been both spectator and recipient to frequent leadership actions designed to protect and safeguard our communities against Covid-19. The worldwide response to this pandemic has set into motion a swift upheaval of life which has been novel to our collective livingmemory. We have witnessed a range of social restrictions to mitigate viral transmission to flatten the curve, actions to uphold food security and supply chains, and legislation to protect household incomes. As the dust starts to settle on what is becoming the new short-term norm of isolated living, it is opportune to examine how this initial phase of sweeping arrangements has been promulgated among Indigenous communities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/we-should-have-learned-from-past-epidemics-that-the-only-way-through-this-crisis-is-together\">We should have learned from past epidemics that the only way through this crisis is together | Kris Rallah-Baker for IndigenousX</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ask any Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person, the daily grind of \u201clife in the colony\u201d offers up the usual pervading social and cultural challenges (gaining a meaningful job, racism, having access to appropriate housing, having a platform to voice and determine change). These challenges and barriers are cultivated by the institutions and structures designed to benefit the masses. This is the reason why so many minority groups find themselves in similar situations on the fringes of society becoming more stressed and increasingly sicker. There is nothing new or groundbreaking about this and it is happening throughout the world. This context, however, is what is triggering alarm bells among many Indigenous health professionals around the world. Concerns of Covid-19 getting into our communities is driven by the knowledge that this virus can cause a lot of harm to those already enduring illness or disease in an alarmingly short period of time.</p> <p>The widespread plight of illness and disease endured by Indigenous peoples is well understood. The ways of community life, the burden of disease and the successive lack of social and economic infrastructure released to Indigenous peoples sees a set of circumstances that is difficult to ignore. Yet despite this situation, modelling to effectively understand the implications of containment, social distancing and accessing healthcare for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples during a pandemic has been reactive, rather than a proactive measure.</p> <p>There is good evidence both locally and internationally that clearly describes the requirements of planning for pandemics among Indigenous communities. The reinvigoration of jurisdictional public health units with a clear Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander remit may be a needed consequence from this pandemic. This has not been, however, the main message voiced by Indigenous health leaders at this time, and nor should it be. Indigenous leaders have instead focused their energies to safeguard their communities through the capacities and resources available to them. At an individual level, leaders have not sat back waiting for directives, modelling or strategy. They have not expected anyone from government or elsewhere to \u201ccome to save\u201d or inform their communities about how to prepare for this pandemic. We have seen many examples of individual leadership through social media platforms and the like. Many Indigenous doctors, nurses, allied health workers, Aboriginal health workers, and CEOs of peak organisations are sending their messages broadly. NACCHO and AIDA for instance have advocated for national and strategic responses such as restricted access to remote communities, release of low-risk incarcerated Indigenous inmates and shoring up remote food and supply chains.</p> <p>It has been heartening to see our leaders execute their skills and attributes in preparing their communities. They have done this by staying true to Aboriginal ways of knowing, being and doing.</p> <p>People\u2019s social and emotional wellbeing has been a large part of this holistic response. Such efforts have been particularly fundamental during these times of needing physical distance.</p> <p>Many Indigenous Australians who have limited control over the challenges ahead are watching with anticipation as to how the government will use their systems and powers to protect the vulnerable from an influx of Covid-19. We cannot implement the social and cultural safeguards in the present moment to protect our communities from the impacts of this pandemic. The benefits of implementing such measures were required generations ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/14/i-am-frightened-indigenous-people-return-to-homelands-to-wait-out-coronavirus\">'I am frightened': Indigenous people return to homelands to wait out coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead as an Aboriginal doctor, I say to my colleagues, as the health system stands and waits for the ill, remember \u2013 be culturally safe and responsive!

  "<p>Late last week millions of South Koreans queued patiently at polling stations to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/south-korea-votes-in-first-national-election-of-coronavirus-era\">cast their votes for a new national assembly</a>. If any uttered words of frustration from behind their masks, they were out of earshot of their fellow voters, kept at a distance by duct tape marking appropriate intervals.</p> \n<p>As they waited to wash their hands and pull on disposable plastic gloves before entering the booths, some may have allowed themselves to contemplate life beyond exercising their democratic right: an imminent return to work, a round of golf or, at last, a chance to shop for something more indulgent than food and hand sanitiser.</p> \n<p>Going out for dinner, let alone voting in a national election, would have seemed almost inconceivable weeks earlier when the coronavirus threatened to exact the same relentless toll on South Koreans as it has in the US and parts of Europe.</p> \n<p>Long before politicians in Britain accepted that the illness posed a serious threat to public health, South Korea watched the rise in reported daily infections with growing alarm. After the country reported its first case on 20 January, numbers initially remained low before climbing sharply, reaching a peak of 909 daily infections on 29 February.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902r1zGcf5CUyu4/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902r1zGcf5CUyu4/\">Graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Then something extraordinary happened. The steep rise in cases <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/south-korea/\">began to plateau</a>. By late March, daily infections were being counted in the dozens, and then in single digits. In the space of a few weeks, South Korea had flattened the curve.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday South Korea reported 11 new Covid-19 cases, the fourth day in a row the number was below 15. That brought the total number of patients to 10,683, more than 8,000 of whom have recovered. With 237 deaths so far, South Korea has <a href=\"https://coronaboard.kr/en/\">one of the lowest</a> Covid-19 case mortality rates in the world, at 2.23%.</p> \n<p>Other countries are now looking to South Korea and its three guiding principles on how to reign in the outbreak: test, trace and contain.</p> \n<p>Perhaps most striking is South Korea\u2019s ability to tame the coronavirus without resorting to lockdowns of the kind imposed in the UK, Italy and France. In contrast to the panic-buying witnessed elsewhere, South Koreans for the most part stayed calm. There were no reports of hoarding, and the only people queuing were waiting to be tested or to buy face masks \u2026 or to vote.</p> \n<p>By the time the World Health Organization issued its plea in mid-March for countries to \u201ctest, test, test\u201d, South Korea had spent weeks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/covid-19-south-koreans-keep-calm-and-carry-on-testing\">doing just that</a>, quickly developing the capability to test an average of 12,000 people \u2013 and sometimes as many as 20,000 \u2013 a day at hundreds of drive-through and walk-in testing centres. The mobile centres conducted the tests free of charge within 10 minutes, with the results were sent to people\u2019s phones within 24 hours. By mid-March more than 270,000 people had been tested.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dbabe1a8c06bf55ccf29610577f02f04843fb891\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbabe1a8c06bf55ccf29610577f02f04843fb891/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Voting in South Korean election\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People in self-isolation cast their ballots after regular voting hours ended in South Korea\u2019s national elections last week.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Testing aside, South Korea \u2013 the most connected country in the world \u2013 also used mobile technology against the outbreak in the form of contact tracing.

  "<p>Last Thursday I was one of the thousands of expats who scurried home to Australia as the Covid-19 crisis erupted.

Almost every weekend I would gallivant around clubs including the Berghain and its accompanying Panorama Bar, finding solace in the knowledge I was surrounded by people like me, with no ties to who I was back home, listening to dance music that had the ability to transcend and transform. Clubbing and dance culture can seem frivolous to the average onlooker but for me they were a form of therapy. Entering a club could somehow feel as though I was the only person in the world but also a speck in a field of glitter.</p> <p>In primary school I was in the dance troupe until my final year. When I started high school, I quit dancing, thinking that boys my age just didn\u2019t do that sort of stuff. My high school years ticked by, and I only came out three days after I graduated. Stepping on to the dancefloors in Berlin was like finding that primary school boy again. Through swaying my body, sometimes erratically, I understood that I could express both my masculine and feminine sides, and the clubs helped me become the person I was always supposed to be. When bans on large public gatherings began, the threat of not being able to step into these spaces became frighteningly real \u2013 even more so when I made the incredibly hard decision to return to Australia.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was content with the fact I was dancing alone in my quarantine hotel room, lapping up the ridiculousness of it all</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For the last 13 days I\u2019ve been in a hotel in Sydney, waiting out the Australian government\u2019s mandatory 14 days of quarantine. My experience has been better than what I\u2019ve seen at other hotels or in other states, but that\u2019s not to say cabin fever hasn\u2019t been lining the walls of my king-sized bedroom. I\u2019m naturally an extrovert so the idea of being trapped for two weeks wasn\u2019t exactly ideal, but I swiftly found ways to keep my mental health in check, one of which is turning my room into a makeshift dancefloor.</p> <p>On my first day, after doing a lousy excuse for a hotel workout, I began to just naturally have a boogie to whatever house mix I was listening to. All of a sudden, the anxiety about returning home and feeling confined subsided; I closed my eyes and was back on the dancefloor. What began as just a random shake of my ass quickly turned into a daily ritual. I put on a fun shirt or something of the sort for my workout and alternated between drawing the curtains to create a dark and moody atmosphere and leaving them wide open, letting the locals watch me flail my arms to Madonna. I would sometimes imagine I was on a dancefloor, filled with queer bodies but just as often I wouldn\u2019t do any daydreaming; I was content with the fact I was dancing alone in my quarantine hotel room, lapping up the ridiculousness of it all. Funnily, both feelings weren\u2019t dissimilar, I felt as alone in the world when I envisioned myself in a club and when I looked out the hotel window at Sydney Harbour. Finding comfort in solitude was calming and cathartic when the world felt so distant.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/02/my-first-mardi-gras-last-year-forced-me-to-embrace-the-culture-im-now-so-fond-of\">My first Mardi Gras last year forced me to embrace the culture I\u2019m now so fond of | Ben Freeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s a form of dance called ecstatic dance, usually held in halls or studios pre-corona. The only rules are that you shouldn\u2019t wear shoes and you can\u2019t stop moving. I went to one of these sessions in Berlin. The music began quite ambient, before progressing into classical, then tribal, crescendoing into deep techno, and then descending back into the ambient music that started the class. This method of dance is said to help people reach a state of ecstasy, diminishing the stresses of the outside world, allowing them to focus only on their bodies and the rhythm. I found my version of ecstatic dance to be really helpful in practising mindfulness \u2013 giving me a break from the insanity of Covid-19.</p> <p>There were moments in clubs in Berlin where I felt complete, unadulterated joy. Never before in my life had I experienced such a feeling. I\u2019ve learnt now not to reminisce about what I\u2019ve lost but rather to hold on to the belief that this feeling can exist.</p> <p>I really didn\u2019t think I would ever be trapped in a room for two weeks amid a pandemic, but I also wouldn\u2019t have imagined I\u2019d be able to handle it so calmly. While you may not be in a government-sanctioned quarantine hotel, nothing is stopping you from closing the curtains, dimming the lights and popping it back to some Kate Bush in your lounge room. It\u2019s my last night in quarantine tonight and I think I\u2019m going to blast Madonna\u2019s Into the Groove:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Only when I\u2019m dancing can I feel this free, <br>At night I lock the doors, where no one else can see,<br> I\u2019m tired of dancing here all by myself, <br>Tonight I want to dance with someone else.</p> </blockquote> <p>Though it\u2019s doubtful the security guard outside my door will want to join me, I know that even trapped in a hotel amid a global crisis, I\u2019m going to feel completely free.</p> <p>\u2022 Ben Freeman is a writer from Sydney.

My old friend\u2019s recent death offers an eerily timely punctuation on this virus and a reminder that we can\u2019t forget to protect one another, and the animals that roam the Earth. \ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0f This virus has created a different version of me. My hope is to be stronger, healthier, smarter about the virus at large. \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99After 10 days of ups and downs, feeling good one-day and terrible the next, I am now working hard to get my son, Mario, through the virus. My heart hurts more than my head over his infection. This virus does not discriminate. While kids are more resilient, they can suffer same severity of symptoms. I\u2019m applying a modified version of my remedies for his protocol with a focus on lots of vitamins. Since his sense of smell and taste have disappeared, I am feeding him healthy foods that I normally can\u2019t get him to touch. I kept a diary of the past week including my remedies and things that I did to stay sane through it all. \ud83d\ude4f Link in bio, as they say.</a></p> <p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;>A post shared by <a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/cristinacuomo/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;> Cristina Cuomo</a> (@cristinacuomo) on <time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2020-04-22T17:41:41+00:00&quot;>Apr 22, 2020 at 10:41am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;></script></body></html>\"></iframe> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea0d82b8f0898fe360d660a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T23:50:19.249Z\">12.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>That briefing has now ended.
