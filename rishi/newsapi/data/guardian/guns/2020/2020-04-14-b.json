Iata\u2019s director general, Alexandre de Juniac, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The industry\u2019s outlook grows darker by the day.

Allowing them an exemption would weaken any debt-relief initiative. Providing aid through the World Bank and other donors while allowing commercial debt payments to absorb a large share of the transfer would be the financial equivalent of pouring water into a bucket with large holes. To put the figures in context, commercial debt repayments would be equivalent to over half of the emergency Covid-19 financing being prepared by the World Bank for delivery through IDA.</p> \n   <p>... Official creditors should make it clear that they expect commercial creditors to apply comparable treatment. There are precedents which, if not directly applicable, could serve as a guide. These include the \u2018Vienna Initiative\u2019 through which European governments coordinated the response to the 2009 financial crisis. If necessary, governments should encourage participation by making access to special Covid-19 financing programmes conditional on commercial creditors participating in the debt standstill. Faced with a global public health emergency that demands a global financial response, governments must deploy their regulatory powers and financial resources in the interest. The G20 should work with the IMF and World Bank to convene a commercial creditors summit to agree terms for creditor participation in debt repayment suspension.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/commercial-creditors-must-sign-up-to-global-debt-deal-or-forgo-covid-19-help\">Commercial creditors 'must sign up to global debt deal' - or forgo Covid-19 help</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T16:57:16.441Z\">at 5.57pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e95e3c18f082a2cd32a6aa3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T16:38:41.425Z\">5.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The coronavirus lockdown in <strong>Uganda</strong> has been extended for another three weeks, with the president, Yoweri Museveni, calling on people to be disciplined to avoid spreading infection. </p> \n  <p>In a lengthy address to the nation on Tuesday, Museveni reaffirmed Uganda\u2019s 35 restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus, adding that judging by the comparatively low number of infections in the country - 54 confirmed cases as of Monday - they seemed to have worked.

The strictest measures implemented so far have been gatherings of more than 50 people and a ban on visits to nursing homes.</p> \n  <p>But its soft approach has drawn criticism. On Tuesday Sweden\u2019s public health agency said it had recorded a total of 11,445 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 1,033 deaths. Neighbouring Finland, which has about half the population of Sweden, had as of Tuesday reported 64 deaths, and has closed down restaurants and schools.</p> \n  <p>In an open letter, a group of 22 doctors, virologists and researchers from Sweden\u2019s top hospitals, universities and research institutes pointed write:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One would like to imagine that Sweden has also had a forward-looking strategy, especially as our country has always had a different way of dealing with the spread of infection than the rest of the world. One would like to imagine that our authorities have prepared well since the epidemic broke out in China, and especially since it was clear that the problem was likely to be global.</p> \n   <p>\u2026 If there was a well-thought-out, well-functioning strategy for Swedish infection prevention work with Covid-19, Sweden would hardly have the same death toll as Italy today, and 10 times higher than Finland\u2019s. If there had been a well-developed, well-functioning strategy, half of Stockholm\u2019s elderly residents would not have been affected by the epidemic - and in some cases over 20% of the healthcare staff would be antibody positive.</p> \n   <p>\u2026 The approach must be changed radically and quickly. As the disease-free virus spreads, it is necessary to increase social distance. Close schools and restaurants in the same way you do in Finland. Everyone who works with the elderly must wear adequate protective equipment. Prior to mass testing of infectiousness on all caring staff and testing for antibodies to sars-covid-2 so that established immune personnel can return to work.

He appealed to Germans to continue following the hygiene regulations as well as keeping their distance, saying these remained the two most crucial ways to dampen the virus\u2019 spread.</p> \n  <p>He added that in Germany the average age of those infected was 49, and a cough, temperature, blocked nose and loss of taste and smell remained the most commonly reported symptoms. In 2% of cases people developed pneumonia he said, while 16% of cases ended up in hospital.</p> \n  <p>On Monday, the Academy of Sciences, Leopoldina released a long-awaited study in which it recommended a staggered return to normal life starting with schools reopening.

system</h2> \n  <p>In the third week of March, while most of our minds were fixed on surging coronavirus death rates and the apocalyptic scenes in hospital wards, global financial markets came as close to a collapse as they have since September 2008. The price of shares in the world\u2019s major corporations plunged. The value of the dollar surged against every currency in the world, squeezing debtors everywhere from Indonesia to Mexico. Trillion-dollar markets for government debt, the basic foundation of the financial system, lurched up and down in terror-stricken cycles.</p> \n  <p>On the terminal screens, interest rates danced. Traders hunched over improvised home workstations \u2013 known in the new slang of March 2020 as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/global-traders-creating-the-ultimate-work-from-home-rona-rigs\">Rona rigs</a>\u201d \u2013 screaming with frustration as sluggish home wifi systems dragged behind the movement of the markets. At the low point on 23 March, $26tn had been <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2020/03/22/goodbye-dow-30000-hello-dow-10000/#559a9620ff50\">wiped off</a> the value of global equity markets, inflicting huge losses both on the fortunate few who own shares, and on the collective pools of savings held by pension and insurance funds.</p> \n  <p>What the markets were reacting to was an unthinkable turn of events. After a fatal period of hesitation, governments around the world were ordering comprehensive lockdowns to contain a lethal pandemic. Built for growth, the global economic machine was being brought to a screeching halt. In 2020, for the first time since the second world war, production around the world will contract. </p> \n  <p>It is now clear that we can, if circumstances demand, turn the economy off. But the consequences are catastrophic. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/how-coronavirus-almost-brought-down-the-global-financial-system\">How coronavirus almost brought down the global financial system</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e95475c8f08db3109f21f15\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helen-davidson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T05:18:50.139Z\">6.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Global Covid-19 cases near 2 million as Putin warns Russia faces \u2018extraordinary\u2019 crisis</h2> \n  <p>The number of Covid-19 cases recorded worldwide is nearing 2 million, as Vladimir Putin warned warned officials to brace for \u201ccomplex and extraordinary\u201d scenarios in Russia as a result of the outbreak.</p> \n  <p>The country reported 2,558 new cases on Monday, its highest daily figure yet, as officials tightened lockdown restrictions in Moscow.

Ferguson is a favoured target, but so is her colleague, Louise Milligan, who has reported on allegations against Pell for 7.30, and wrote the book Cardinal: the Rise and Fall of George Pell detailing a number of allegations including the ones that caused him to be jailed.</p> <p>Andrew Bolt, a consistent Pell supporter, <a href=\"https://www.heraldsun.com.au/blogs/andrew-bolt/abc-denies-pell-witchhunt-how-we-laughed/news-story/130e04313a00ac54789f07fea79d9f18\">has alleged</a> the ABC took \u201ca starring role in the vilification, destruction and jailing of an innocent man\u201d and on Tuesday night in an exclusive interview with Pell on Sky News, weighed in again with accusations of persecution by the national broadcaster.</p> <p>\u201cDoes the ABC\u2019s role in your persecution concern you?\u201d Bolt asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes it does,\u201d Pell replied. \u201cBecause, I mean, it\u2019s partly financed by Catholic taxes.\u201d Some might think of that as an additional reason for scrutiny of the church, of course.</p> <p>Pell said: \u201cI acknowledge the right of those who differ from me to state their views. But in a national broadcaster to have an overwhelming presentation of one view, and only one view, I think that\u2019s a betrayal of the national interest.\u201d</p> <p>Bolt continued on his theme of witch-hunts, culture wars and conspiracies. He previously asserted that book publishers, the ABC, the Victorian director of public prosecutions and Victoria police have \u201cacted together\u201d to bring Pell down \u2013 an inherently unlikely allegation and one that has been denied by all concerned.</p> <p>Beneath these attacks lies an important ethical question about what is generally referred to as \u201ctrial by media\u201d. Should the media publish serious allegations against people before, after and during court processes? Did the reporting about Pell step over a line?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4eb1eab1d6887108285059d9e790b7e05eef3ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4eb1eab1d6887108285059d9e790b7e05eef3ed/249_0_3598_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Australian journalist Sarah Ferguson in a still from Revelation, a documentary about sexual abuse in the Catholic Church\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australian journalist Sarah Ferguson in a still from Revelation, an ABC documentary about sexual abuse in the Catholic church.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ABC TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Pell case polarises people, as demonstrated by the wordplay around whether the high court found Pell to be innocent.</p> <p>Two important aspects of our justice system collide. First, there is the presumption of innocence, which holds that accused people are entitled to be regarded as innocent unless the allegations against them can be proven beyond reasonable doubt. In the legal system, Pell is now entitled to that presumption of innocence.</p> <p>Some commentators \u2013 <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-george-pell-won-in-the-high-court-on-a-legal-technicality-133156\">including legal academics</a> \u2013 have described this as Pell being acquitted on a technicality. At the other extreme, his supporters suggested the high court finding means he should never have been prosecuted.</p> <p>This disparity highlights part of the answer to the trial-by-media debate.

That is part of what we have a media for \u2013 whether you are talking about the victims of sexual abuse or the people on the end of one-punch attacks.</p> <p>A recent example of where the media got ahead of the law on a story is the runaway hit podcast Teacher\u2019s Pet, which suggested that <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/podcasts/the-teachers-pet-the-unsolved-murder-of-lyn-dawson/news-story/da4bb90abff76bbe0f2bd932aa987e2a\">Chris Dawson murdered his wife, Lyn Dawson</a>.

Think the controversy over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/13/from-novelty-cheque-to-full-blown-scandal-a-timeline-of-the-sports-rorts-saga\">sports grants</a>, or the allegations concerning one of Julia Gillard\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-08-19/gillard-dismisses-allegations-of-law-firm-wrongdoing/4208360\">past relationships while she was working at Slater and Gordon</a>, or the examination of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/14/water-wars-will-politics-destroy-the-murray-darling-basin-plan-and-the-river-system-itself\">water deals in the Murray-Darling Basin</a>.</p> <p>The role of the legal system is to decide the guilt of individuals and punish the guilty. It rightly sets a very high bar \u2013 beyond reasonable doubt.</p> <p>The media has a wider role and a different standard \u2013 are the allegations something the public should know about?</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean journalists should be cavalier. The judgments involved are serious and difficult \u2013 particularly so when, as with Pell and as with Teacher\u2019s Pet \u2013 there are allegations that the media has interfered with or prejudiced legal processes. Louise Milligan was a witness in part of Pell\u2019s legal case, and Hedley Thomas is expected to be a witness in the Dawson case.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/apr/08/the-day-george-pell-walked-free-the-reckoning-podcast\">The day George Pell walked free \u2013 The Reckoning podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The literary critic Peter Craven has described Milligan as \u201ca writer of flaming convictions and sensationalist prose\u201d whose book amounted to the case for the prosecution. Thomas told 60 Minutes that \u201ceverything points to Chris Dawson killing Lyn\u201d. It\u2019s never comfortable when journalists become part of the story, and it\u2019s right and healthy to hold them to account.</p> <p>So how do we assess what the ABC has done in the case of Pell?</p> <p>Before Milligan and Ferguson published, there were a series of allegations against Pell, a powerful public figure. Bolt and others have pointed out that most of the allegations in Milligan\u2019s book never got to trial. But it is also the case that most of them were prosecuted to committal stage. In other words, they passed the filter of police investigation and the assessment of the prosecution authorities, who judged they were substantial enough to be tested in court. Unless you buy Bolt\u2019s conspiracy theory, that\u2019s significant.</p> <p>It\u2019s useful to consider the counterfactual. What if the journalists had done their interviews, found people they judged credible making these serious allegations, and then done nothing?</p> <p>Surely that is not how we want journalists to behave. It would amount to cover-up.</p> <p>I don\u2019t give the ABC a complete bill of clean health. I am old-school enough to believe that journalists should conduct themselves with care and disinterest in the public eye.</p> <p>While passion on behalf of the survivors of sex abuse is understandable, there has been some social media activity by ABC journalists that looks very much like lobbying against Pell in particular.</p> <p>In my book that\u2019s conduct unbecoming and undermines the force of the journalism. I wonder why the ABC doesn\u2019t rein some of it in under its social media policy, which directs employees\u2019 use of social media should not \u201cundermine your effectiveness at work\u201d.</p> <p>The Pell story is not over. It is reported that there will be civil actions, and at some stage previously redacted parts of the royal commission report into institutional child sex abuse dealing with Pell\u2019s history will probably be published.</p> <p>The story is not only about what happens before the courts.</p> <p>If Chris Dawson is found not guilty, it doesn\u2019t mean Hedley Thomas shouldn\u2019t have made the Teachers\u2019 Pet podcast. The high court decision doesn\u2019t mean that journalists shouldn\u2019t have published allegations against George Pell.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/08/appeal-judges-are-reluctant-to-overturn-jury-verdicts-so-why-did-they-do-it-for-george-pell\">Appeal judges are reluctant to overturn jury verdicts.

She was later adopted by Leith and her first husband, Rayne Kruger, and taken to their huge Cotswolds home to begin what was, by all accounts, and including some gorgeously sun-dappled home video footage, an idyllic English childhood.

Of course, the delay is partly evidence of a contented family life, but Leith also admitted to some regret over her past lack of curiosity. \u201cI don\u2019t go scratching the surface looking for problems,\u201d she said of her parenting style. \u201cI wasn\u2019t concerned about Li-Da being wrenched from her cultural roots, or the trauma she must have experienced as a tiny infant.\u201d This regret only intensified as their journey continued and it became clear that some family secrets were lost in time.<br><br>It wasn\u2019t just Prue, though, was it? It was the 70s. Attitudes have changed a lot since the days when, in Leith\u2019s words, \u201cWe just cavalierly said: \u2018We\u2019re adopting!\u2019, and that was that.\u201d The current adoption process is much slower and more cautiously bureaucratic, as Kruger experienced when she adopted her own son. Leith was surely right to question how such processes benefit children in care: \u201cI just always believed that all children need to grow up well is love. Buckets and buckets of love.\u201d </p> <p>But it\u2019s not that simple, either. Growing up as a racial minority, both in your own country <em>and</em> in your own family must have some sort of impact. That much was obvious as soon as Kruger, newly arrived in Phnom Penh, took stock of her surroundings. \u201cI find I\u2019m constantly looking at Cambodian faces and just seeing myself.\u201d Leith suggested that perhaps she was looking for potential family members, but Kruger clarified: \u201cIt\u2019s more like, \u2018Could that be me?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>If, as has been argued, today\u2019s adoption processes are overly concerned with such concepts as \u201cethnic cultural background\u201d, the irony is that Cambodian-born Kruger and her South African-born mother could hardly be more quintessentially English. Leith was irked by her own leaky tear ducts: \u201cThis is ridiculous! I\u2019m not a woman who cries!\u201d And their relationship, though loving, is crisply unsentimental. Unless you would count them responding to bad news by jointly lamenting that it\u2019s \u201ctoo early for gin and tonics\u201d as girly bonding. <br><br>The devastation wrought by the Khmer Rouge means that Leith and Kruger\u2019s task was much more complex than what a pair of amateur genealogists normally face, so their stoicism was practical. Yet it\u2019s not as if the twists and turns of their investigation would not have fully justified some histrionics - or G&amp;Ts. Was Kruger\u2019s birth mother killed by a rocket attack on a hospital? Did her birth father, an injured soldier, carry his infant daughter on his back until he he collapsed? The family legends are dramatic, but this may be one case where the truth, if they can get at it, is more astounding still.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/13/prue-leith-i-worried-about-my-daughter-finding-her-birth-mother\">Prue Leith: 'I worried about my daughter finding her birth mother'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When a long-standing record keeper in Kruger\u2019s birth district recounted a strikingly familiar story of a baby girl born locally in 1974 and given up for adoption, Li-Da bit her (stiff upper) lip and asked: \u201cIs the mother of the baby \u2026 is she still alive?\u201d The time it took for their guide to translate this question and then its answer felt like an eternity.

  "<p>Libya\u2019s UN-recognised government in Tripoli has refused to authorise the landing of migrants stopped at sea and sent back to Libyan territory by its coastguard vessels.</p> <p>The Libyan coastguard stopped about 280 migrants on Thursday, but when it attempted to return them to Libya, the country\u2019s authorities refused to let them disembark, according to the UN migration agency IOM, due to fighting around the capital.</p> <p>IOM initially said that \u2018\u2018due to the intensity in shelling, relevant officials in Tripoli had declared its own seaports closed and \u2018unsafe\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), said on Tuesday, however, that Libyan ports had not closed as the IOM had claimed. \u201cThe IOM mistake is due to the fact that there was shelling near the commercial port and the Libyan coastguard refused to disembark the people,\u201d Vincent Cochetel, the UNHCR\u2019s special envoy for the central Mediterranean, told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cSome escaped ... Around 160 Sudanese were released.

According to charities, Maltese authorities have also increasingly been delaying responses to migrant boats in distress.</p> <p>Alarm Phone, a hotline service for migrants in distress at sea, has shared two audio recordings with the Guardian of a series of calls from a group of asylum seekers claiming an official from a Maltese navy boat on Thursday sabotaged their vessel, carrying about 70 people, by cutting the engine cable.</p> <p>\u201cWe have an emergency here,\u201d a man can be heard saying in one of the audio recordings. \u201cThe Maltese military came and cut the motor cable. There is water in the boat. The Maltese military said: \u2018We will leave you to die in the water. Nobody will come to Malta.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease help us. We will die,\u201d says another man. \u201cThe Malta military ship number is P52.\u201d</p> <p>The migrants, who were allegedly boarded by the Maltese navy roughly 20 miles south-west of Malta, were eventually rescued by the Maltese authorities.</p> <p>The Guardian has asked the Maltese navy for comment but the officials have did not respond.</p> <p>Since the beginning of the coronavirus emergency, the central Mediterranean route has become increasingly impenetrable for people fleeing war-afflicted Libya.</p> <p>The risk, according to charitable organisations, is that the restrictive measures in Italy and Malta will set the migrant situation back years, to when boats from Libya would set off on their own, risking people\u2019s lives in the attempt to reach Italian shores.</p> <p>\u201cEuropean governments\u2019 actions to close their ports to people rescued at sea put lives at risk and cannot be justified on public health grounds,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/judith-sunderland\">Judith Sunderland</a>, associate Europe and central Asia director at Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>\u201cRecent and unfolding events in the Mediterranean Sea raise serious concerns that <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/european-union\">European Union</a> countries will use the Covid-19 pandemic as an excuse to evade their responsibilities under international law to respond to boats in distress at sea.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday, Italian authorities said a 15-year-old who had landed on the Italian island of Lampedusa on Tuesday had tested positive for Covid-19 and been placed under quarantine.</p> <p>The rescue boat Alan Kurdi, operated by the German NGO Sea Eye and named after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/01/alan-kurdi-khaled-hosseini-mediterranean-refugees-sea-prayer\">three-year-old Syrian boy who drowned in 2015</a>, is currently the only NGO rescue boat operating in the central Mediterranean.</p> <p>The coronavirus outbreak has forced many charities to concentrate their aid efforts elsewhere, while other rescue groups, such as Sea Watch and SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, have not returned to international waters after being quarantined for 14 days after their last missions at the end of February.</p> <p>In a sign of how dangerous Libya is for those trying to reach Europe, dozens of people held at Tripoli\u2019s main port since Thursday fled the facility as it was being shelled early on Friday morning.</p>",

Many Twitter users found it troubling that she was turning her skin into a darker shade than it was naturally, comparing her to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/13/rachel-dolezal-i-wasnt-identifying-as-black-to-upset-people-i-was-being-me\">Rachel Dolezal</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI do question the motivation behind some people\u2019s excessive use of tanner,\u201d says the journalist Wanna Thompson. \u201cDo I believe that every person who tans wants to be black? Not particularly, but I do wonder about the need to make yourself appear several shades darker. Who are you trying to emulate?\u201d Thompson came up with the term \u201cblackfishing\u201d when she saw a discussion about white women cosplaying as black women on Twitter. \u201cAnd I said to myself, \u2018I need to bring awareness to this growing issue\u2019. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s always been prevalent,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cBe it fashion, beauty or music. Black is cool, unless you\u2019re actually black.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>For most of us it feels like a lifetime ago but, actually, just over three weeks have passed since the UK went into lockdown. Friday 20 March to be precise \u2013 the day it was announced all cafes, pubs and restaurants had to shut because of coronavirus and everyone in the country realised they were in for many, <em>many</em> nights stuck in front of the television.</p> \n<p>So began the search for things to watch and for football lovers quick relief came on that first Saturday when Channel Four showed Diego Maradona, the critically acclaimed documentary by director Asif Kapadia. I\u2019d seen it at a screening in central London 10 months earlier and found myself nodding in agreement as praise for the film filled social media. Kapadia witnessed the outpouring too and even for a man who has been there, done that and got the Oscar, there was satisfaction to be taken from the way his work was being received.</p> \n<p>\u201cLooking at Twitter from my sofa it felt like a lot of people were watching the film, and a lot of people I respect. So that was a great feeling,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was actually a complete coincidence Channel Four showed the film on the first Saturday after the pubs shut, and as ever I was one of the last people to find out.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/12/missing-live-sport-here-are-12-great-documentaries-to-watch-instead\">Missing live sport during lockdown? Here are 12 sporting films to watch</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Kapadia delivers that last line with a laugh, which is in keeping with his mood as we speak \u2013 like many are doing right now \u2013 via WhatsApp.</p> \n<p>These are strange times but the 47-year-old is coping well, partly because he is used to working from home and partly because of the sense of perspective he is able to maintain while in isolation with his wife and two children. \u201cWe have a home, food, hot water and a garden,\u201d Kapadia says. \u201cCompared to a lot of people we\u2019re lucky.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ecc00268-27fa-43b5-ba4f-18ddf8293550\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>His frustration is instead directed towards the government, which will come as no surprise to anyone who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/asifkapadia?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">follows Kapadia on Twitter</a>. He is politically outspoken and does not hold back when assessing how the current crisis is being managed. \u201cI\u2019ve felt for years that the Tories have not looked after the NHS, not properly funded it, and nothing they are doing right now has changed my mind. I hope people remember this the next time they vote.\u201d</p> \n<p>This is a theme Kapadia will touch on again later but for now our conversation shifts back to Diego Maradona, the director\u2019s seventh feature film and third documentary following Senna, which focuses on the life and death of Formula One legend Ayrton Senna, and Amy, which tells the tragic story of singer Amy Winehouse and for which Kapadia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/29/amy-wins-best-documentary-feature-oscar\" title=\"\">won his Oscar in 2016</a>.</p> \n<p>For Maradona he deployed the same archive techniques and again produced something brilliant. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2019/may/10/diego-maradona-documentary-official-trailer-video\" title=\"\">An intense, captivating biography</a> centred on the seven years Maradona spent at Napoli, a period that took in two World Cups and during which the Argentinian\u2019s myth and legend \u2013 for better and worse \u2013 was established. It is all there in the film, starting with a sequence showing cars hurtling through the streets of Naples en route to Maradona\u2019s unveiling at the Stadio San Paolo in July 1984 that is as thrilling as it is apt.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"acd6878a3000cd8e9e0e28ccf00fa7145c29b154\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acd6878a3000cd8e9e0e28ccf00fa7145c29b154/36_82_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Asif Kapadia speaks with Diego Maradona at the Argentinian\u2019s home in Dubai.

He\u2019s not in the middle, he\u2019s extreme, and people like that cannot help but be interesting,\u201d Kapadia says. \u201cThe point of the film is to say \u2018just watch him\u2019, and even if you hate him you can\u2019t deny he was amazing.</p> \n<p>\u201cI love the opening sequence \u2013 it\u2019s the very essence of Maradona\u2019s life. One of my other favourite scenes is the one of him at Napoli\u2019s Christmas party, after the [1990] World Cup. No one talks to him and he doesn\u2019t talk to anyone, the shot holds for ages and you just know he\u2019s going through a lot. It\u2019s really powerful.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kapadia spent nine hours interviewing Maradona before making the documentary, speaking with him at his home in Dubai and elsewhere. The experience allowed him to develop an unusually rounded view of someone who, post-retirement, has taken on a rather grotesque persona.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s rare you have direct access to someone like Maradona \u2013 you\u2019re always going via other people. So you get annoyed with the guy but it\u2019s the entourage who play a big part in how he comes across,\u201d Kapadia says. \u201cIn the time I spent with Maradona I got to see he has good days and bad days, like most people.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b2378cc1-8e9c-4558-992d-05fbf2532016\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cuErPYsoaR4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>And has he seen the film? \u201cAnyone else, if there was a film about them you know they would have by now, but this being Maradona, he\u2019s decided he\u2019s not going to watch it,\u201d Kapadia replies with another laugh. \u201cI think he probably has.\u201d</p> \n<p>The son of Indian immigrants, Kapadia was born and raised in Hackney, east London. He found his calling in the visual arts in his early 20s. It was perhaps inevitable he would make a film about football given one of his earliest memories is watching the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwfHjbeNV8\" title=\"\">1978 World Cup final between Argentina and the Netherlands</a> on television.</p> \n<p>Kapadia also played football as a child and, during that time, developed a love for a club that endures to this day. \u201cI come from a family of Arsenal fans and for my first game, my brother took me to Highbury to watch Arsenal versus Liverpool,\u201d he says. \u201cI was with the Arsenal fans and Arsenal won but I felt nothing for them \u2013 it was all about Liverpool.</p> \n<p>\u201cI supported them because my best mate did. Neither of us even knew where Liverpool was but it was the 1970s and back then we weren\u2019t even allowed out of our road.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5078262ecf97d178a113f6a221d79ca340ea5e4e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5078262ecf97d178a113f6a221d79ca340ea5e4e/213_221_3287_1974/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I think J\u00fcrgen Klopp is a man of faith,\u2019 says Asif Kapadia of the Liverpool manager.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I think J\u00fcrgen Klopp is a man of faith,\u2019 says Asif Kapadia of the Liverpool manager.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images via Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This leads to a discussion about the incredible season Liverpool were experiencing and to the man who has brought joy and hope back to the supporters \u2013 J\u00fcrgen Klopp. \u201cI love him,\u201d Kapadia says. \u201cHe is honest, passionate and genuinely cares. Whenever I hear him speak I think: \u2018Why can\u2019t we have politicians like that?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI have a theory on Klopp,\u201d Kapadia continues. \u201cI think he\u2019s a man of faith. I know from my own background that believing in God doesn\u2019t have to be an awful thing \u2013 it can be really interesting and get you through difficult times, and I see that in J\u00fcrgen.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/11/buy-a-classic-sport-photograph-maradona-the-god-of-naples\">Buy a classic sport photograph: Maradona, the 'God of Naples'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cTo stress \u2013 I don\u2019t know this for sure. But it would explain how he has lost as many finals as he has and never whinged, or how he is able to see the bigger picture right now.

There has been a 45% decrease since 1972.</p> <p>There were 242,842 marriages registered in 2017 \u2013 a fall of 2.8% from 2016.

They have also been told to prioritise the most serious criminal cases during the crisis.</p> <p>With \u201cless serious\u201d crimes prosecutors are asked to consider out of court disposals, such as a caution or community resolution, as well as stopping cases where the public interest does not require a prosecution.</p> <p>Prosecutors are asked to consider whether accepting a guilty plea \u201cto some, but not all charges, or to a less serious offence, would enable the court to pass a sentence that matches the seriousness of the offending\u201d. They must also take into account the age of the suspect and how long they have been in custody on remand.</p> <p>The advice does not apply to serious, including violent, offences.</p> <p>The director of public prosecutions, Max Hill QC, said: \u201cWe know very well the impact crime can have on people\u2019s lives, so we want the public to be confident that \u2013 even in these very difficult circumstances \u2013 justice will be done.</p> <p>\u201cOur very function is to prosecute, but we cannot ignore the unprecedented challenge facing the criminal justice system.</p> <p>\u201cWe must focus on making sure the most dangerous offenders are dealt with as a priority as we adapt to challenging circumstances. And in less serious cases, it is right that we consider all options available when weighing up the right course of action.</p> <p>\u201cThis will only relate to a very small amount of cases and offences relating to Covid-19 will remain an immediate priority \u2013 anybody jeopardising the safety of the public will face the full force of the law.\u201d</p> <p>Prosecutors have always had to consider whether criminal charges are in the public interest as part of their decision making, but for the first time the guidance asks that the pressures that Covid-19 is placing on the system are given special consideration during the pandemic.</p> <p>The guidance states: \u201cThe Covid-19 outbreak presents an unprecedented challenge for the criminal justice system in England and Wales. The scale and seriousness of the situation has created significant difficulties for the criminal justice process.</p> <p>\u201cThe pandemic has already had a significant impact on the criminal justice system, particularly on case progression.</p> <p>\u201cThe majority of ongoing trials had to be stopped because of problems over the attendance of victims, witnesses, defendants, advocates and jurors.

Of course being able to announce almost limitless government spending does help a lot, but he is less evasive than most of his colleagues and generally does a better job than the rest of them at sounding positive yet not deluded.</p> \n  <p>He managed it again today, even though some of his assumptions are verging on the heroic. The OBR does broadly back his claim that the economy will be able to recover quickly. But his suggestion that Boris Johnson\u2019s open-chequebook \u201clevelling up\u201d agenda will be able to survive intact after the national debt has risen much higher seems optimistic, to put it politely. And perhaps his boldest claim is that this is no inherent tension between safeguarding the economy and protecting lives. That argument might look robust now, but it is likely to appear more tenuous in the months to come.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Sunak insisted that the UK economy would be able to recover \u201cquickly and strongly\u201d after the coronavirus crisis was over. </strong>He made the claim in response to a report from the Office for Budget Responsibility suggesting a three-month lockdown, followed by three more months of partial lockdown measures, could shrink GDP by 35% and put unemployment up by more than 2m. Sunak insisted that this was not a firm forecast, but he accepted that the economic impact of the crisis would be significant. However, he claimed recovery could come very quickly. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is going to be hard, our economy\u2019s going to take a significant hit and as I\u2019ve said before that\u2019s not an abstract thing, people are going to feel that in their jobs and in their household incomes ...</p> \n   <p>Yes it will be difficult in the short term. I\u2019m happy to be honest about that with people. I think the measures we\u2019ve put in place will help and then as we get through this it will mean that we can recover quickly and strongly and get our lives and economy back to normal.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Improbable as this claim may seem, it is in line with <a href=\"https://obr.uk/coronavirus-reference-scenario/\">the OBR analysis, </a>which envisages that says that \u201creal GDP falls 35% in the second quarter, but bounces back quickly\u201d.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Sunak rejected suggestions that the coronavirus crisis, and the enormous increase in government borrowing and debt that it will generate, would prevent the government from pursuing its \u201clevelling up\u201d agenda (which prioritises infrastructure spending, particularly in the north)</strong>. When this suggestion was put to him, he replied: </li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Once we get through this obviously we will have to take stock of public finances and the economy and make the right decisions at that point and I\u2019ve talked before about doing whatever we need to to right the ship at that point.</p> \n   <p>But what I would say is we remain very committed to the agenda that we set out before which was about levelling up and spreading opportunity around this country, and indeed I believe this can still be a critical part of how we get back to normal here.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He rejected claims that there was an inherent contradiction between protecting the economy and saving lives.</strong> In <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-delivers-daily-coronavirus-update-14-april-2020\">his opening remarks</a> he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The third point I want to make is this: right now, the single most important thing we can do for the health of our economy is to protect the health of our people.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s not a case of choosing between the economy and public health \u2013 common sense tells us that doing so would be self-defeating.</p> \n   <p>At a time when we are seeing hundreds of people dying every day from this terrible disease, the absolute priority must be to focus all of our resources \u2026</p> \n   <p>\u2026 not just of the state, but of businesses, and of all of you at home as well, in a collective national effort to beat this virus.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He refused to back a call for the government to scrap the pensions \u201ctriple lock\u201d as a result of the crisis, to free up money to help young workers who are particularly likely to be disadvantaged</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/scrap-triple-lock-uk-pensions-coronavirus-crisis\">The Social Market Foundation, a centrist thinktank, has proposed this idea.</a> Asked if he agreed, Sunak said he would not write his budget now. But he said he wanted to provide opportunity for people, whatever age they were.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the government was working with the ONS to speed up the publication of information about the deaths of people with coronavirus in care homes.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that the coronavirus job retention scheme is due to open on 20 April.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he would c</strong><strong>onsider making some of the coronavirus business loans 100% guaranteed by the government, not just 80% guaranteed. </strong>George Osborne, a former Tory chancellor, has proposed this idea.

In the past lobby briefings weren\u2019t always the most informative events in the Westminster daily diary, and they normally wrapped up in under half an hour. Now they take place by conference call, just once a day, and they regularly last for more than an hour (like today\u2019s). They have also become a lot more useful, partly because of the length (it is not as if political journalists have a lot of other things to do), partly because of the format, but also partly because No 10 needs to engage with the media more than it thought it did in the pre-coronavirus era.</p> \n  <p>Most of the briefing was taken by the prime minister\u2019s spokesman, but we also heard from a Treasury spokesman talking about the OBR report.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Treasury spokesman stressed that the OBR description of what might happen to the economy was not an official government prediction - although he did not challenge it in any significant way.</strong> He described the OBR analysis as \u201cone scenario\u201d, but he said that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has already acknowledged that coronavirus was going to have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on the economy. Sunak is chairing the government\u2019s daily coronavirus press conference at 5pm this afternoon.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Treasury spokesman implied the OBR report vindicated government policy. </strong>He said the report confirmed that, if the government had not intervened, the economic impact on people would be \u201cmuch worse\u201d. And he said the OBR did say that the impact of the lockdown would be \u201ccontained in time\u201d and that there would be a rapid bounce back.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Treasury spokesman said figures for how many workers were being furloughed under the government\u2019s job retention scheme would be available when the online portal was up and running at the end of April.</strong> The OBR estimates that around of 30% of employees will take advantage of this. <a href=\"https://obr.uk/coronavirus-reference-scenario/\">The OBR report</a> says:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have tried to estimate a cost that is consistent with the assumptions underpinning the economic scenario. Doing so implies that around 30 per cent of employees will be covered at a cost of \u00a342bn (equivalent to almost 15 per cent of total employee compensation in the baseline). We estimate that around a fifth of that returns to the Exchequer in income tax and NICs \u2013 an effect that is captured implicitly via the fiscal ready-reckoning rather than explicitly here. The first payments are expected this month.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The Treasury spokesman rejected claims that take-up was higher than the government expected. He said that the Treasury had never predicted what the take-up would be, and that a high take-up showed that the scheme was doing what it was meant to be doing.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said that the OBR\u2019s decision to model the impact of a three-month lockdown, followed by three months of partial lockdown (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-uk-live-news-lockdown-extended-peak-dominic-raab-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e959a8d8f082c29014b0914#block-5e959a8d8f082c29014b0914\"> 12.16pm)</a>, should not be seen as an indication of what the government was planning.</strong> It was just a modelling assumption by the OBR, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman rejected suggestions that the government was playing down the number of coronavirus deaths in care homes</strong>. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-uk-live-news-lockdown-extended-peak-dominic-raab-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9570168f081a236f192eaa#block-5e9570168f081a236f192eaa\">9.27am.) </a>He said the government published different sets of figures, but that it was completely transparent as to what they covered. When it was put to him that the figures being given by care home providers suggested the official government figures for the number of care homes affected by coronavirus (13.5%) understated the scale of the problem, the spokesman said the government figure was the best available.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman said the most recently daily figure for the overall number of tests carried out (in the 24 hours to 9am yesterday) was 14,506.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman was unable to say whether the government would investigate every death of a social care worker with coronavirus.</strong> The government has said that the death of every NHS worker with coronavirus will be investigated.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman said the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) was meeting now to consider its evidence for government about the case of extending the lockdown.</strong> He said the government would be responding on Thursday. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman said government advisers were reviewing policy on whether members of the public should wear masks. </strong>The group looking at this is \u201cNervtag\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/new-and-emerging-respiratory-virus-threats-advisory-group\">the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group,</a> the spokesman said. Yesterday <strong>Sir Patrick Vallance,</strong> the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, said <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8214939/UK-reviewing-evidence-face-masks-AGAIN.html\">the government would change its policy if the scientific case for wearing masks grew stronger.</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that progress was being made towards procuring more ventilators for the NHS was a positive thing.</strong> Asked about reports that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/uk-scraps-plans-to-buy-thousands-of-bluesky-ventilators-coronavirus\">some designs for new ventilators have not been approved by regulators</a>, the spokesman said that it was important for the government to make sure it only bought machines that met regulatory requirements.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman rejected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/uk-missed-three-chances-to-join-eu-scheme-to-bulk-buy-ppe\">a report suggesting that the UK has lost out by not participating in an EU-wide scheme for the procurement of PPE (personal protective equipment)</a>.</strong> Asked about the Guardian report by my colleagues <strong>Daniel Boffey </strong>and<strong> Robert Booth</strong>, the spokesman said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>For the majority of PPE included in the EU schemes, the supply of items to participating countries is still subject to the European commission signing off individual contracts with suppliers, the placing of orders and delivery schedules. We understand that participating countries may begin to receive PPE two weeks after orders are placed. Deliveries will be subject to the same demand pressures as all other procurement currently taking place. Participating in this scheme would not have allowed us to do anything that we have not been able to do ourselves.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman sidestepped questions about whether the government would hold a public inquiry into its handling of coronavirus</strong>. He said the government was focusing on tackling coronavirus. But he went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As we progress through this pandemic, we are of course looking at any improvements that we can make and any lessons that we can learn.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman would not endorse a statement from Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, about the government being too slow to ramp up testing.</strong> On ITV last night Vallance said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At the beginning, Public Health England got off to a good start in terms of testing to try and make sure they caught people coming in to the country with it. I then think it\u2019s not scaled as fast as it needs to scale \u2014 and that\u2019s being done now. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked about this, the spokesman said the government was very clear about the need to scale up testing. </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman said that Boris Johnson was still off work.</strong> He was not engaged in any government business, the spokesman said. He said there was nothing new to add about the condition of the PM, who is continuing his recovery at Chequers. He said the priority for the PM was for him to \u201crest and recover\u201d and that his medical team had advised him not to immediately return to work. The spokesman was unable to say whether the PM would be holding his usual weekly audience with the Queen (which currently takes place by telephone) this week.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman said that the government would be saying more later this week about its plans for a partial \u201cvirtual parliament\u201d when MPs returns from their Easter recess next week.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said suppliers of personal protective equipment (PPE) should not be prioritising England over Scotland.</strong> He said it was being distributed \u201cevenly across the UK\u201d in a \u201cfour-nation approach\u201d. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Our PPE strategy is UK-wide, making sure that frontline workers in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have the PPE they need to stay protected while taking care of patients. Through this four-nation approach we are working closely with the devolved administrations to coordinate the distribution of PPE evenly across the UK. We have not instructed any company to prioritise PPE for one nation over the others.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman confirmed that Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief adviser who has been off work with coronavirus symptoms, is now back at work in No 10. </strong>Asked about a photo showing Cummings arriving at work alongside Cleo Watson, another No 10 aide, and about claims that this showed people in Downing Street ignoring the social distancing rules, the spokesman claimed everyone in No 10 was observing the rules. When it was put to him that this photograph suggested the opposite, the spokesman just stuck to his line.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1a2577f0e7a31214ebeb915712dc48e82fd51f4\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1a2577f0e7a31214ebeb915712dc48e82fd51f4/0_99_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Cummings arriving at No 10 this morning with his colleague, Cleo Watson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Cummings arriving at No 10 this morning with his colleague, Cleo Watson.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T13:44:43.166Z\">at 2.44pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e95b8868f08213494be6660\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T13:25:43.101Z\">2.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wales records 19 deaths in hospital in the last 24 hours</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Wales has recorded <a href=\"https://covid19-phwstatement.nhs.wales/\">19 further deaths of people who had tested positive for Covid-19</a>, taking the number of deaths in Wales to 403.</p> \n  <p>Wales also reported 238 new cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 5,848, although the true number of cases is likely to be higher.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T14:12:48.083Z\">at 3.12pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e95b7a78f082a2cd32a67f3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T13:18:19.087Z\">2.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">England records 744 deaths in hospital in last 24 hours</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A further 744 people have died in hospital in England in the last 24 hours, bringing the total deaths in hospital in England to 11,005. </p> \n  <p>Patients were aged between 34 and 102 years old. 58 of the 744 patients (aged between 38 and 96 years old) had no known underlying health condition. </p> \n  <p>The full details are <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/COVID-19-daily-announced-deaths-14-April-2020.xlsx\">here (pdf).</a></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T14:21:57.152Z\">at 3.21pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e95b50c8f082c29014b0a6e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T13:14:42.450Z\">2.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The first UK-built ventilators</strong> backed by a consortium of leading manufacturers have been delivered to hospitals over the weekend, with another device now in final clinical trials, the <strong>PA Media</strong> reports:</p> \n  <p>It is understood a number of ParaPac devices, made by Smiths Medical -

He added the outbreak aboard had not affected the ship\u2019s ability to to receive patients.</p> <p>The Mercy left Naval Base San Diego on 23 March and arrived at Los Angeles four days later as part of the national response to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>The mission of the 1,000-bed ship and more than 800 medical personnel and support staff onboard is to relieve strain on local hospitals by providing care to patients who do not have Covid-19, allowing those hospitals to use intensive care units and ventilators for virus cases.</p> <p>One sailor <a href=\"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/military/story/2020-04-10/theft-of-masks-sanitizer-at-naval-medical-center-san-diego-lead-to-bag-checks-for-staff\">told the Union-Tribune</a> there were concerns that the crew could have brought the virus onboard when they left San Diego, given that medical staff had been present at the screening area at Naval Medical Center San Diego before their deployment on the Mercy.</p> <p>The news of the Mercy outbreak comes the same day that a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/c5a9bb159bbf34532783c9dd55ce0c89\">crew member on the coronavirus-infected USS Theodore Roosevelt died</a> of complications related to Covid-19. That marked the first Covid-19 death of an active-duty military member and came 11 days after the aircraft carrier\u2019s captain was fired for raising concerns that the navy was failing to safeguard his crew.</p> <p>The Roosevelt sailor who died, whose name and other identifying information were not immediately released, had tested positive for <a href=\"https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">coronavirus</a> on 30 March and was taken off the ship and placed in \u201cisolation housing\u201d along with four other sailors at a base in Guam. On 9 April, he was found unresponsive during a medical check, officials said.</p> <p>For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause severe life-threatening illness, including pneumonia.</p> <p>As of Monday, Los Angeles county public health authorities reported 9,420 positive cases and 320 deaths.</p>",
  "<p>Britain\u2019s leading arms manufacturer BAE Systems sold \u00a315bn worth of arms and services to the Saudi military during the last five years, the period covered by Riyadh\u2019s involvement in the deadly bombing campaign in the war in Yemen.</p> <p>Figures taken from <a href=\"http://www.annualreports.co.uk/HostedData/AnnualReports/PDF/LSE_BA_2019.pdf\">the company\u2019s most recent annual report</a> and newly analysed by the <a href=\"https://www.caat.org.uk/\">Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT)</a> reveal the British arms maker generated \u00a32.5bn in revenues from the Saudi military during the whole of 2019.</p> <p>That takes the total sales of BAE arms and services to the Saudi military for the period between 2015 and 2019 \u2013 including the period from the start of the Saudi bombing in March 2015 \u2013 to slightly over \u00a315bn, or 17.3% over the five years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2020-04-14T14:13:26/embed.html\" data-alt=\"asf\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2020-04-14T14:13:26/embed.html\">asf</a> </figure>  <p>Andrew Smith of CAAT said: \u201cThe last five years have seen a brutal humanitarian crisis for the people of Yemen, but for BAE it\u2019s been business as usual. The war has only been possible because of arms companies and complicit governments willing to support it.\u201d</p> <p>Thousands of civilians have been killed since the civil war in Yemen began in March 2015 with indiscriminate bombing by a Saudi-led coalition that is supplied by BAE and other Western arms makers. The kingdom\u2019s airforce is accused of being responsible for many of the 12,600 killed in targeted attacks.</p> <p>Five days ago <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/saudi-arabia-begins-two-week-ceasefire-in-yemen-due-to-coronavirus\">the Saudi-led coalition began a unilateral two-week ceasefire</a>, in an attempt to show awareness of the threat posed by coronavirus to the war-ravaged country with only rudimentary health services, although it is not certain if the pause in hostilities will hold.</p> <p>The data also reveals that the true value of British arms sales to the Gulf kingdom is far greater than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/05/dont-let-saudi-arms-ship-dock-in-uk-campaigners-military-yemen-war\">the \u00a35.3bn total value of UK export licences</a> since the Saudi-led coalition began its campaign in Yemen.</p> <p>The apparent discrepancy is caused by the fact that official export total does not include the value of arms sold to Saudi Arabia via so called open licences, which allow a wide range of hardware to be included without their cost recorded.</p> <p>\u201cThese figures expose the cozy relationship between the Saudi regime and BAE. But they also imply that the value of UK arms sales is far greater than government figures show,\u201d Smith added.</p> <p>Sales of UK-manufactured arms to Saudi Arabia have been called into question since the war began, although a succession of British ministers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/11/johnson-allowed-arms-sales-to-saudis-after-strike-on-food-factory\">including Boris Johnson when he was foreign secretary</a>, have signed off on exports to the kingdom despite mounting evidence that civilians were being killed in air strikes.</p> <p>At other times, British support for Saudi Arabia has been overt. Five years ago, at the outset of the conflict, Philip Hammond, then Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, declared: \u201cBritain will support the Saudi-led assault on Yemeni rebels in every practical way short of engaging in combat.\u201d</p> <p>Exports of British arms to Saudi that could have been used in Yemen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jun/20/uk-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia-for-use-in-yemen-declared-unlawful#maincontent\">were halted in the summer of 2019</a> when the Court of Appeal ruled that in June 2019 that no formal assessment had been made by ministers to see if the Saudi-led coalition had committed violations of international humanitarian law.</p> <p>The UK government has appealed to the Supreme Court to have the judgment overturned, but the Court of Appeal judgment remains valid until the UK\u2019s highest court completes its review of the high-profile case.</p> <p>BAE maintains and supplies Tornado jet aircraft to the kingdom\u2019s airforce and provides \u201coperational capability\u201d to the country\u2019s air and naval forces. Sales to Saudi Arabia accounts for 35% of the company\u2019s air division, the largest single destination for its military aircraft.</p> <p>The company\u2019s relationship with Saudi Arabia is structured via massive multi-year contracts signed between the UK and the Saudi governments, in which BAE is effectively a sub-contractor, its revenues partly guaranteed by the involvement of the British state.</p> <p>The Saudi military is BAE\u2019s third largest customer overall, after the US Department of Defence and the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence. In 2019, revenues from the Pentagon \u2013 the world\u2019s largest buyer of arms \u2013 accounted for \u00a36.5bn, while in the UK, where BAE builds and maintains ships for the Royal Navy, the figure was \u00a33.9bn.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe government takes its export responsibilities seriously and assesses all export licences in accordance with strict licensing criteria. We will not issue any export licences where to do so would be inconsistent with these criteria.\u201d </p> <p>A BAE Systems spokesperson said: \u201cWe provide defence equipment, training and support under government to government agreements between the UK and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\u200e We comply with all relevant export control laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate and our activities are subject to UK government approval and oversight.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Doctors and nurses are being put at risk of catching Covid-19 because hospitals are abandoning vital checks to ensure their personal protective equipment (PPE) fits properly.</p> \n<p>Growing numbers of hospitals are running so short of FFP3 face masks they are no longer insisting staff have a \u201cfit-test\u201d before they start wearing a mask while treating infected patients.</p> \n<p>NHS trusts do not want to deplete their limited supplies of the disposable masks by using them up during what until now have been seen as routine and necessary checks to ensure the virus cannot get past the mask and into the wearer\u2019s nose or mouth.</p> \n<p>The fit-test <a href=\"https://www.hse.gov.uk/news/face-mask-ppe-rpe-coronavirus.htm\">is a rigorous process</a> which ensures health workers wear the right size mask, which does not leak. The masks are sprayed with a chemical mist to see if staff can taste it.</p> \n<p>However, trusts are instead telling staff to carry out what doctors fear is a crude and unreliable manual assessment, <a href=\"https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/disposable-respirator.pdf\">known as a \u201cfit-check\u201d</a>, to see if masks have any gaps. This involves checking the seal by covering the filter, breathing in and seeing if the mask sucks in.</p> \n<p>The Doctors\u2019 Association UK (DAUK) says that hospitals which no longer do fit-tests are playing \u201cRussian roulette with doctors\u2019 lives\u201d at a time when Covid-19 has already claimed the lives of at least 40 NHS doctors, nurses, paramedics, midwives and porters.</p> \n<p>Hospitals appear to be in breach of <a href=\"https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/disposable-respirator.pdf\">Health and Safety Executive guidelines</a>, which specify that anyone using a disposable respirator such as an FFP3 in the course of their work should always have a fit-test first.</p> \n<p>For example, Northwick Park hospital in London emailed its staff last week to tell them: \u201cAs you know, there is currently an international shortage of FFP3 masks. That means we can\u2019t rely on receiving the same types of mask that have been used in the fit testing process. Instead we are needing to change masks as supplies come into place.</p> \n<p>\u201cTherefore, we are adopting an approach that has already been put in place in a number of trusts both in London and nationally: we are training staff to properly identify and use the best fitting FFP3 mask presently available, and to check that they have a good seal.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is designed to keep you as safe as possible, regardless of which masks we have in stock.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hospitals are also ditching fit-tests because they have been unable to get hold of the chemicals involved.</p> \n<p>Samantha Batt-Rawden, DAUK\u2019s president and an intensive care specialist, said: \u201cThis is a scandal which shows a flagrant disregard for the safety of frontline NHS staff. Many doctors will \u2018fail\u2019 a fit-test on certain brands of mask, which means it will not work for them.</p> \n<p>\u201cWith mask brands and types regularly changing due to shortages, sometimes shift to shift, doctors are now going in blind, with no way of knowing whether a particular mask will give them any protection whatsover. It is simply unacceptable to play Russian roulette with doctors\u2019 lives.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis flagrant disregard for the safety of dedicated NHS staff must be addressed as a matter of urgency.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bbdedea8-3745-42f9-a4fe-eb53a8598b4f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1zHDqywPrnc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>One hospital consultant said: \u201cI\u2019m worried. I tried to get fit-tested and my hospital isn\u2019t testing anyone now. I\u2019ve just been told to breathe deeply and see if there is a leak. How is this safe? They won\u2019t admit it but they are gambling with our lives because they don\u2019t have enough masks.\u201d</p> \n<p>Prof Neil Mortensen, the president-elect of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said: \u201cRespiratory protective equipment needs to fit the wearer\u2019s face and must be tested before it is used to ensure it is effective. Surgeons <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/one-in-three-uk-surgeons-lacks-enough-protective-kit-survey-finds\">who responded to our survey</a> said they have been told to \u2018fit-test themselves\u2019, highlighted mask shortages, and mentioned shortages of the testing solution.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts in England, said the NHS had a \u201cplentiful\u201d supply of FFP3 masks but that there were \u201cseveral challenges around fit-testing\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cThe current emergency PPE distribution system, which proactively delivers PPE to trusts without them having to order it, means trusts are receiving up to five different brands of face mask. Each time a person starts using a different brand of mask, they need a new fit-test. This can take up to an hour for each member of staff.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere has also been a shortage of fit-testing solution, though we understand this is now easing. Trust leaders will always do everything they can to ensure every member of staff is appropriately fit-tested.\u201d</p> \n<p>An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cNational guidance is clear that fit-tests are required in hospitals. Government is continuing to procure vital protective equipment in line with its PPE strategy, and over the bank holiday weekend more than 48m pieces of protective kit were distributed to us, including 160,000 fit-test solutions and 8,000 fit-test kits.\u201d </p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 April 2020. A reference to Derriford hospital having suspended mask fit-testing was removed after University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust informed the Guardian that testing had not been stopped.</p>",

  "<p>Poland\u2019s parliament will this week discuss a controversial proposal to tighten abortion laws in the country, as opposition politicians and women\u2019s rights groups warn that the country\u2019s conservative government may use the distraction of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> pandemic to push through the legislation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/poland\">Poland</a> already has some of the strictest legislation in Europe on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/abortion\">abortion</a>, and previous attempts to tighten the laws further were abandoned after mass protests in 2016. The proposal comes from a citizen initiative, and it is unclear if the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party will support it, but president Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, has said he would sign the law if it reaches his desk.</p> <p>\u201cFor them, this is the best time to pay the debts they have to ultra-conservative groups,\u201d said Barbara Nowacka, an opposition MP who was active in the protests four years ago. \u201cWe are really afraid that they will use the fact that citizens of Poland are really focused on their future and health right now, and not on values, sexual education, women rights.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday, dozens of women protested in central Warsaw, in cars and on bicycles, honking horns and displaying posters against the law. Police used megaphones to warn protesters they risked fines for breaking lockdown regulations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3dbea90a1d544d5cc87b9437bdc582cc506194f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dbea90a1d544d5cc87b9437bdc582cc506194f5/0_348_5626_3376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman rides her bicycle during a protest of Polish women\u2019s rights activists in Warsaw.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman rides her bicycle in Warsaw during a protest by Polish women\u2019s rights activists.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wojtek Radwa\u0144ski/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Polish proposal comes amid global concerns over access to abortion during the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, Amnesty International called on governments across Europe to ease \u201conerous administrative requirements to access abortion services\u201d, which it said was making safe access difficult.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Marie Stopes International <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-crisis-may-deny-95-million-women-access-to-family-planning\">estimated</a> that there could be as many as 3 million additional unintended pregnancies and 2.7 million unsafe abortions in the 37 countries in which it works, as well as 11,000 pregnancy-related deaths.</p> <p>In Poland, abortion is already illegal except in cases of rape, incest, severe foetal abnormalities or in cases where the mother\u2019s life is at risk. In 2016, a citizen\u2019s bill aimed to outlaw even these types of abortion, leading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/polish-government-performs-u-turn-on-total-abortion-ban\">to huge protests in towns and cities across the country</a>. The government backed away from its support.</p> <p>The bill was re-submitted in a less severe form in 2018, seeking to outlaw abortions in the case of foetal abnormalities. It has since been stalled in parliament but is now due for mandatory review, with discussions expected on Wednesday and Thursday. Some have suggested that this is merely a formality, and they are not expecting the government to push the law through quickly. Others, however, fear the difficulty of protest during the coronavirus pandemic could provide the perfect cover.</p> <p>There have been protests online, and with people hanging flags in their windows. \u201cBut this doesn\u2019t have the same impact as a massive protest on the streets,\u201d said Nowacka.</p> <p>In an interview with a Catholic news outlet earlier this month, president Duda said \u201ckilling disabled children is simply murder\u201d and promised he would sign the law if it reached him. Duda is up for re-election next month, a vote the government is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/polish-government-still-planning-to-hold-presidential-election\">controversially insisting will go ahead</a>, despite the restrictions in place due to the pandemic. PiS has courted a conservative, Catholic voter base with rightwing rhetoric against abortion rights, LGBT rights and so-called \u201cgender ideology\u201d.</p> <p>Natalia Broniarczyk, of the Abortion Dream Team organisation, said that even without the new legislation, the coronavirus pandemic has made life harder for women seeking abortion. The organisation\u2019s helpline has received around 550 calls in the month since lockdown was imposed in Poland, which is twice as much as during a usual month.</p> <p>Many Polish women with pregnancies in the first trimester are able to get around the current legislation by ordering pills online for medical abortion at home. Some women were concerned at whether the postal service would still function to deliver pills, while others were considering abortions due to the unexpected difficult economic situation.</p> <p>\u201cMany people lost their job from one day to the next and they don\u2019t have money even to live. For them, an unwanted pregnancy is the worst scenario,\u201d Broniarczyk said. Some Polish women <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/10/pro-choice-activists-launch-abortion-initiative-in-poland\">travel abroad for abortions</a>, something which has also become extremely difficult due to recently imposed travel restrictions.</p> <p>Rights groups have warned the Polish government not to support the new legislation. \u201cThe chaos and anxiety surrounding Covid-19 shouldn\u2019t be used as a distraction from harmful attempts to push through dangerous legislation,\u201d said Hillary Margolis, senior women\u2019s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch.</p>",

  "<p>Jimmy Gordon, Lord Gordon of Strathblane, who has died aged 83 from Covid-19, was a pioneering force for good in the history of commercial radio, setting standards for others to follow, with a keen understanding of what a mass audience would embrace.</p> <p>He was the first managing director of Radio Clyde, which went on air as the New Year bells welcomed in 1974. It was the third legal commercial station in the UK. Unlike Capital and LBC, it was an instant success, commanding a 70% audience share within its west of Scotland catchment area.</p> <p>For those who feared commercial radio would equate to a diet of pop interspersed with adverts, Gordon gave the perfect riposte. Radio Clyde was exuberant and intelligent. His background ensured that a sharp news operation would balance music, that it would be the go-to station for political debate and that young talent would be fostered.</p> <p>Fiona Ross, Clyde\u2019s first political editor, recalls that everyone \u2013 from office cleaner to company chairman \u2013 called the managing director \u201cJimmy\u201d as he prowled the station\u2019s headquarters in Glasgow, encouraging staff and seeking opinions. He was, she says \u201cthe perfect boss\u201d, a view echoed by many whose careers he launched.</p> <p>Even as a peer of the realm in his 80s, Gordon exuded qualities of agelessness and classlessness. He thought the House of Lords \u201ca great place\u201d and personified its best aspect \u2013 an individual who brought largely apolitical expertise to the political process, specialising in media and associated technologies, with which he kept closely abreast.</p> <p>Gordon was born in the Maryhill area of Glasgow, his father, James, a shipyard clerk and his mother, Elsie (nee Riach), a teacher. He won a bursary to St Aloysius college, the city\u2019s private Catholic school, and went on to Glasgow University. That, as he always acknowledged, was the transformational phase of his life.</p> <p>He became part of a talented circle that included the future politicians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1994/may/13/obituaries.past\" title=\"\">John Smith</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/oct/12/guardianobituaries.labour\" title=\"\">Donald Dewar</a> and Menzies Campbell. Gordon discovered a talent for debating and was part of the team that secured the Observer Mace for Glasgow in 1957. The following year, he was president of <a href=\"https://www.guu.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Glasgow University Union</a>.</p> <p>Gordon went straight into broadcasting for the BBC but was quickly headhunted by its commercial rival, STV. He could easily have followed a political career and in 1964 stood in East Renfrewshire where, in a ritual familiar to aspiring Labour politicians, he was soundly defeated by the formidable Tory MP, Betty Harvie Anderson.</p> <p>Greatly preferring broadcasting, Gordon became STV\u2019s political editor in 1965. In a diversion from his day job, the board of Celtic FC asked him to make a film about its history. This proved prescient as 1966-67 proved to be the season in which they became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2017/may/25/lisbon-lions-remembered-celtics-historic-victory-50-years-on-in-pictures\" title=\"\">the first British club to win the European Cup</a>. Virtually all the archive footage of the momentous final in Lisbon comes from the film Gordon directed.</p> <p>He remained at STV until 1973, when the station, then part of the Thomson empire, joined a consortium that won the west of Scotland commercial radio franchise. Gordon was asked to lead the project and the core of his team, both editorial and technical, came from STV though, as Ross recalls, \u201cnone of us knew anything about radio\u201d.</p> <p>He took a hands-on approach to running the station, supported by outstanding professionals such as Alex Dickson as news editor and Andy Park as head of entertainment. In spite of domestic success, he later recalled, Glasgow remained \u201ca dot on the map\u201d for London advertising agencies so Gordon drove an expansionist policy, acquiring virtually all Scotland\u2019s other commercial stations while leaving their local identities untouched.</p> <p>By the 1980s, he had become a panjandrum of Scottish public and business life and an admired figure in broadcasting throughout the UK and Ireland, where Scottish Radio Holdings acquired stations and newspapers. He was recognised in 1984 through a Sony special award for services to radio.</p> <p>A great Glasgow patriot, his public roles included chairing the city\u2019s new Scottish exhibition centre from 1983 as well as spells on the Scottish Development Agency board, as trustee of the National Galleries of Scotland and chair of the Scottish Tourist Board.</p> <p>Gordon was not politically aligned during his media and business days but became a Labour peer in 1997. One of his roles was to chair the advisory group on listed sports events on television, which helped stem the flow of major events to Sky, while not being as restrictive as critics wished.</p> <p>Characteristically, Gordon\u2019s style was pragmatic and consensual, commanding great respect in the Lords, where he remained active until his death.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Anne Stevenson, whom he met at STV and married in 1971, two sons, a daughter and four grandchildren.</p> <p>\u2022 James Stuart Gordon, Lord Gordon of Strathblane, broadcaster, businessman and politician, born 17 May 1936; died 1 April 2020</p>",
  "<h2>We\u2019re comfort-listening</h2> <p><strong>Alexis Petridis, chief music critic</strong></p> <p>Last night I found myself listening to the Flaming Lips\u2019 1999 album <a href=\"https://music.avclub.com/the-soft-bulletin-still-stands-as-the-flaming-lips-tri-1837053577\">The Soft Bulletin</a>, and I wasn\u2019t prepared for how eerily its contents suit life in spring 2020. It opens with a track about scientists racing for an unspecified cure, and the sequence of songs at its centre \u2013 Waitin\u2019 for a Superman, Suddenly Everything Has Changed, The Gash and Feeling Yourself Disintegrate \u2013 all seemed bizarrely appropriate.</p> <p>The relationship we have with music might have altered under lockdown. It\u2019s not just that songs seem to have taken on new, apposite resonances given the current situation, but music that you unexpectedly find yourself leaning towards, because you find it chimes with your mood: it\u2019s comforting, elevating or transporting. I speak as someone who recently spent an admittedly tipsy evening listening to what a friend called mumcore: the kind of music parents gravitated toward when I was a kid, somewhere on the cusp of chart pop and easy listening. I can\u2019t profess any great personal passion for Dr Hook\u2019s When You\u2019re in Love With a Beautiful Woman or Marti Webb\u2019s Take That Look Off Your Face, but at that particular moment it sounded reassuring, a little wallow in nostalgia for a time when I had nothing to worry about.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvvGYEjloOg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XvvGYEjloOg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In fairness, there isn\u2019t much data to suggest that listeners\u2019 habits have changed.

However, the <a href=\"https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/\">UK singles chart</a> is the same as usual: Doja Cat, Dua Lipa, Harry Styles and the Weeknd.</p> <p>The album charts are filled with the kind of best-of collections that seem to enjoy such permanent residence there you wonder who\u2019s still buying them: how can anyone who wants to hear the greatest hits of Queen, Fleetwood Mac or Elton John not already own them? There\u2019s a vague intimation about the streaming figures on Spotify that parents of a certain age are home more than usual and listening to Wonderwall and Dancing in the Moonlight by Toploader, but there\u2019s nothing in the way of major anomalies, beyond a boost in streams for the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/08/john-prine-songwriter-bob-dylan-johnny-cash-bruce-springsteen\">John Prine</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps this is all evidence that music is fulfilling a keep-calm-and-carry-on function at the moment \u2013 normality in a wildly abnormal world \u2013 but I think it\u2019s more likely evidence that the charts deal in broad brushstrokes and the kind of response I\u2019m talking about is unique and personal. If, as Zoe Williams <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/why-are-we-talking-about-morrissey-and-buffy-because-cultural-nostalgia-is-now-king\">recently suggested</a>, lockdown means that, culturally, \u201cwe are all basically living out of the store cupboard \u2013 all the music and literature and thought-paraphernalia you have carelessly stashed over the past few decades\u201d, then everyone\u2019s stash of memories is bound to be different, particularly the stuff we find ourselves digging deep for, the stuff we find chimes more loudly with us than the standard-issue all-purpose crisis anthems such as Imagine or You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone.

Feeble lyrics by major pop acts about feeling unpopular and awkward were wearing thin, while musicians venturing personal intimacies largely found them turned into grist for an unforgiving gossip mill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"05c0e6ef4b9c530e454671dc4e6e991531a17299\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05c0e6ef4b9c530e454671dc4e6e991531a17299/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Ocean performing at Parklife festival, 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frank Ocean performing at Parklife festival, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Visionhaus/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe expectation for artists to be vulnerable and truthful is a lot, you know, when it\u2019s no longer a choice,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.wmagazine.com/story/frank-ocean-cover-story-interview/\">Frank Ocean told W Magazine</a>. \u201cLike, in order for me to satisfy expectations, there needs to be an outpouring of my heart or my experiences in a very truthful, vulnerable way. I\u2019m more interested in lies than that. Like, give me a full motion-picture fantasy.\u201d And as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/03/dua-lipa-you-have-to-be-made-of-steel-to-not-let-words-get-to-you\">Dua Lipa was teasing what would turn out to be a pointedly escapist second album</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lady-gaga\">Lady Gaga</a> was threatening a return to the high-concept dance-pop that made her a star.</p> <p>The pandemic won\u2019t slow this shift. Once lockdown is over, after months of fear for everyone and far more grievous circumstances for many, the idea of having to relive this period via a glut of insular, anxious pop music just sounds like prolonging the agony. Although we\u2019ve quickly acclimatised to seeing grainy FaceTime feeds on national TV, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/06/livestreaming-beat-battles-lockdown-skepta-timabaland-self-isolating\">lo-fi beat battles through Instagram Live</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGwQZrDNLO8&amp;feature=emb_title\">music videos made on Zoom</a>, those homespun production values will only increase fans\u2019 hunger for the kind of high-end production you can\u2019t easily put together on the fly \u2013 especially if, as healthcare experts are suggesting, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/magazine/coronavirus-economy-debate.html?referringSource=articleShare\">live music and festivals might not realistically return until late 2021</a>. Transportive fantasias might be all we have.</p> <p>Perhaps it might shift fans\u2019 attitudes, too. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/charli-xcx\">Charli XCX</a> has committed to producing an album, How I\u2019m Feeling Now, from scratch during lockdown, to be released on 15 May. She\u2019s working with producers AG Cook and BJ Burton, so it\u2019s not totally a one-woman show, but presumably the results will demonstrate the limitations of creating at speed. You\u2019d hope it might engender some patience and appreciation for craft from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/15/leave-rihanna-alone-a-manifesto-for-healthier-pop-fandom-in-the-2020s\">fans inclined to demand ever more music from their faves</a>. Maybe these straitened times will also help pop stars \u2013 especially women \u2013 refuse inessential elements of the job. In the New York Times profile of Lipa releasing her album in lockdown, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/arts/music/dua-lipa-future-nostalgia-coronavirus.html\">she remarked on how doing her own styling</a> for the paper\u2019s socially distanced photoshoot showed \u201ca very unfiltered version of yourself\u201d and let her spend longer in bed. (That Lipa is genetically blessed obviously helps.)</p> <p>Ultimately, pop will emerge from this period in better shape than less lucrative and exposed forms of music \u2013 though it\u2019s still going to be forced into new shapes by club culture. Dozens of clubs will close during this period; tour revenues for DJs will be destroyed. But dance music is the living embodiment of how necessity is the mother of invention. Perhaps more so than any other music community, club culture provides a lifeline for its often marginalised participants, and has a progressive social imperative at its heart: it will find new sounds and spaces and spring back, because it has to. (Plus, parties are far easier to organise at the drop of a hat \u2013 or the relaxing of a social distancing order \u2013 than a fully fledged festival.) You only have to look at the divide between the thrilling, emergent dance singles and lumpen, complacent pop in 1988 and 1989 to realise that the latter\u2019s contemporary catalysts would be foolish not to pay very close attention.</p> <h2>Rap will become more introverted</h2> <p><strong>Ben Beaumont-Thomas, music editor</strong></p> <p>So much of the grist for mainstream rap lyricshas been ruined by coronavirus. The club? Closed. Rolls-Royce dealership? Furloughed. Sex with women who you aren\u2019t planning to self-isolate with for more than 45 minutes? Now even more morally dubious. So what do you rap about?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/23/rappers-coronavirus-cardi-b-dj-imarkkeyz\">Lyrical lockdown: rappers respond to coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like a bond market, the most shallow rap lyricism needs constant activity to keep it alive \u2013 without an engine of expenditure, or antipathy stoked by confected beef, their subject matter collapses. Once we get past a month of lockdown and jittery boredom sets in, we could get a wave of old grievances aired and rappers \u201csending\u201d for one another on social media. Also, like a bond market, rap lyrics can deal in money itself rather than anything material or social underpinning it, and as we nose into recession, these tracks may well go from being aspirational or enjoyably dumb to grating.</p> <p>Existing rap tracks have been tainted by the virus \u2013 Future\u2019s Mask Off now sounds like it\u2019s about a reckless approach to PPE rather than emotional availability \u2013 and the lexicon of the virus itself will, of course, find its way into rhymes. Tracks will be heralded as catchier than it; women\u2019s legs will depressingly be \u201cspread like coronavirus\u201d; someone, somewhere, has hesitantly entered \u201cho vid?\u201d into their iPhone notes. One of my favourite tweets over the last month was by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EasyStreetKeys/status/1240094152118894594\">@EasyStreetKeys, who wrote</a>: \u201cDrake somewhere in the booth singing, \u2018I can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re social distancing or distancing yourself from me socially\u2019\u201d \u2013 the joke being that the Canadian rapper is permanently given to brooding on toxic relationships, and a global pandemic isn\u2019t likely to change that.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW71FKXQwSY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EW71FKXQwSY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>That mooted Drake lyric also shows how the interiority of the coronavirus experience \u2013 where we\u2019re stuck inside our own heads as well as houses \u2013 could be creatively stimulating and a boon for rap fans. You can imagine how a rapper given to self-examination like Polo G might already be writing affecting and emotional material; the political material for acts such as Dave or Run the Jewels is also in abundance. But rappers previously given to extroversion \u2013 because that was what they felt the culture demanded of them \u2013 could also find a new side to their artistry. There are rappers addressing the crisis head on, like Psychs\u2019 UK drill track Spreadin or Lady Leshurr\u2019s fitfully amusing Quarantine Speech, but this all feels a bit on the nose. It\u2019ll be the ones who have finally found time to work out who they are that will be most worth listening to.</p>",

The area has been subject to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/clashing-uae-and-saudi-interests-are-keeping-the-yemen-conflict-alive\">fierce battles</a> since the beginning of this year, which have displaced almost 40,000 people.</p> <p>A unilateral two-week ceasefire announced by Riyadh came into effect last Thursday, but was greeted with scepticism by Houthi officials, who called it a \u201cpolitical and media manoeuvre\u201d.

They\u2019ll tell the Saudis they\u2019ll stop attacks in border areas and leave Saudi troops alone, but continue their push on the internal frontlines so they have a better hand overall, not just over the Saudis but also over their Yemeni enemies.\u201d</p> <p>Yemen\u2019s coronavirus response is also facing difficulties because of aid cuts: half of the UN\u2019s humanitarian programmes in the country will be forced to reduce or close by the end of April unless a funding crisis is fixed.</p> <p>Some donors, including the US, cut funds to UN programmes in Yemen earlier this year because of fears the Houthis are consolidating control over the management and distribution of aid.</p> <p>The UN feeds more than 12 million Yemenis a month, of whom 80% live in Houthi territory.</p>",

  "<p>Sacred relics of a 19th-century indigenous chief are to go back to Canada after Exeter city council voted for their return, a move described by a leading curator as a sign that local councils were becoming the pioneers of repatriation.</p> <p>The Devon council voted to return the items to the Siksika Nation, in Canada, after guidance from curators at the Royal Albert Memorial Museum (RAMM), which holds the sacred relics that once belonged to Crowfoot, a Blackfoot leader who signed a treaty in 1877 with forces of the Crown.</p> <p>The return of the regalia, which include a buckskin shirt, leggings and a knife bought for \u00a310 in 1904 from the family of an English-born member of the Canadian mounted police, followed a formal request made for the repatriation in 2015. It resolves a drawn-out dispute that has beenacrimonious at times.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/feb/02/british-museum-in-repatriation-dispute-over-indigenous-relics#maincontent\">In February</a> leaders from the Blackfoot-run cultural and educational centre, the <a href=\"http://www.blackfootcrossing.ca/\">Blackfoot Crossing Historical Park</a>, told the Guardian they had been shocked by their interactions with RAMM. The museum, they said, had challenged the repatriation claim by alleging that the park was not an accredited museum.</p> <p>\u201cIt is like Siksika and Crowfoot are in a long dark tunnel with no end in sight,\u201d said Stephen Yellow Old Woman, general manager of BCHP, who said the repatriation initiative dated to 2008. However, the final decision rested with Exeter city council.</p> <p>Dan Hicks, a professor of archaeology at the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford, who is helping to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/17/soldiers-grandson-to-return-items-looted-from-benin-city-nigeria\">repatriate colonial-era items held in private collections</a>, said the decision by Exeter was a reminder that many decisions about restitution lie with local councils and museum trustees, not with national government.</p> <p>He said: \u201cLandmark decisions like this reveal how items that are subject to restitution claims represent a tiny minority of the UK\u2019s museum collections \u2013 that are usually not even on public display but which can hold immense significance and value for claimant communities.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel Sutton, the council\u2019s portfolio holder for climate and culture, said there was a moral obligation to return the items and that the council recognised that the \u201coriginal injustices\u201d still reverberated today with First Nation Canadians.</p> <p>\u201cGiving back Crowfoot\u2019s regalia returns control to the Siksika Nation over their cultural identity, dignity and authority, and is the right thing to do,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Representatives from the Siksika Nation will visit Exeter once Covid-19 restrictions have lifted, and an official ceremony to hand over the regalia will take place.</p> <p>The decision highlights the treatment of items held in national museums, such as the V&amp;A, and the British Museum, which cannot return some artefacts because of legal constraints, compared with that shown by non-national museums and institutions, which have more freedom.</p> <p>In April 2019, Jeremy Wright, the UK\u2019s culture secretary at the time, ruled out returning objects held in national museums, saying that if you \u201cfollowed the logic of restitution to its logical conclusion\u201d, there would be no \u201csingle points where people can see multiple things\u201d.</p> <p>Following Wright\u2019s comments there have been several pledges to return disputed artefacts held in museums and collections outside the national portfolio.</p> <p>In November 2019 <a href=\"https://www.museum.manchester.ac.uk/collection/\">Manchester Museum</a> became the first UK institution to return ceremonial items to Aboriginal groups nearly a century after they were stolen by British forces. The repatriation of the artefacts was heralded as the beginning of the return of tens of thousands of similar items from institutions across the UK.</p> <p>Later the same year Jesus College Cambridge announced it was returning a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/mar/08/benin-bronze-row-cambridge-college-removes-cockerel\">bronze cockerel</a> stolen by British colonial forces during the notorious 1897 \u201cpunitive expedition\u201d to Benin city and donated to the college. This followed after a student-led campaign to secure its repatriation.</p> <p>Hicks added that many local authority and university museums were pioneering approaches that could make normalise restitution, while operating on a case-by-case basis.</p> <p>\u201cI hope that city councillors across the UK will now pay closer attention to the \u2018world culture\u2019 collections for which they are responsible, many of which are subject to restitution claims, whether from north America, Africa, or beyond,\u201d he added.</p>",

The first three episodes were released on Apple at the end of March.

Six years ago, Maxwell contacted the three-time Tony award-winning composer Doug Besterman with the idea that he should adapt Maxwell\u2019s novel, also called Little Did I Know. Set in 1976, it tells the semi-autobiographical story of Sam August, a recent college graduate who ropes his friends into reopening a dilapidated summer stock theater in Massachusetts. Sam\u2019s idea of a breezy season: Hair, Two Gentlemen of Verona, The Me Nobody Knows. \u201cGo ahead and say I\u2019m crazy,\u201d Sam sings in his I Want song, \u201cGo ahead and say I\u2019m dumb.\u201d</p> <p>Besterman teamed with lyricists: Oscar and Grammy winner Dean Pitchford and Marcy Heisler. They developed the show, first at Tufts University, Maxwell\u2019s alma mater, then at a regional theater. But like many Broadway-aimed musicals, it fell short of its target. Commercial producers couldn\u2019t see a path forward. About a year ago, Mitchell suggested a new route. A podcast could bring the musical to the public and maybe generate enough interest to make a stage production possible.</p> <p>At first, Besterman flinched. \u201cI thought, oh, we\u2019re talking about doing a radio play of the musical. And that didn\u2019t interest me,\u201d he said, speaking from the 500 sq ft Manhattan studio that he shares with his fiancee. \u201cI felt like minus the live experience, it just wouldn\u2019t be fun.\u201d But Maxwell and Lou Aronica, who co-wrote the musical\u2019s book, sold him on the podcast form and the freedoms it allowed and he agreed.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GslcKoIsQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/videoseries?wmode=opaque&list=OLAK5uy_lytp-CeDWvij2XuzZK8UYblxbdKK3E0nk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The musical that arrives in your earbuds has undergone some alterations. It doubled in length, now running more than four hours. There are twice as many songs and the songs do different work. \u201cThe arc is much longer,\u201d Lesli Margherita, one of the cast members explained. \u201cAn 11 o\u2019clock number is maybe the 3 o\u2019clock number.\u201d</p> <p>Scenes changed and characters changed, and Besterman and his colleagues learned to let the book drive narrative and convey setting, with songs supplying emotional accents. Besterman hesitated to describe those songs as \u201c70s pastiche\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBut it definitely has the feel of 70s music,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Marlo Hunter signed on as director last May. She has a background developing new musicals, but preparing a podcast involved what she described as a lengthy learning curve. \u201cIt\u2019s really a very different rhythm and different structure than a musical would be,\u201d she said. She was speaking from her in-laws\u2019 house, where she had fled with her husband, a five-year-old and a seven-week-old. (\u201cI\u2019m so tired right now,\u201d she said.)</p> <p>The producers stacked the cast with Broadway veterans such as Margherita and Patrick Page, who live in New York, and YouTube stars like Kurt Hugo Schneider and Sam Tsui, who don\u2019t. Coordinating everyone\u2019s availability became a barely solvable geometry problem. The cast finally met in October, at Threshold Recording Studios, and while a musical might rehearse for weeks, this one rehearsed for half a day.</p> <p>Besterman and the orchestrator, Mike Morrison, brought in temporary tracks, flexible enough that tempos could be changed in the room, which they were. The cast recorded 23 songs (OK, a bunch of them were reprises) in four days. \u201cIt was a marathon,\u201d Margherita said. She was sheltering in her New York apartment, a country away from her husband in LA.</p> <p>Hunter kept the schedule tight. \u201cWe knew that if we didn\u2019t get the background harmony for this song by 4.30, we were not getting it,\u201d Besterman said. And she spent much of the recording sessions with her eyes closed. \u201cI didn\u2019t look at an actor in four days, because I knew I couldn\u2019t rely on watching their performance,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cI had to just trust my ear.\u201d</p> <p>A long postproduction process began, stretching late into Hunter\u2019s pregnancy \u2013 \u201cI kept saying to her, don\u2019t you need to be having the baby right now?\u201d Besterman said \u2013 and continuing postpartum. Vocals were mastered, a 10-piece band recorded, dialogue refined. \u201cI was almost afraid to listen to it,\u201d Margherita said. \u201cBut it was really fascinating.\u201d Besterman said he hoped that the musical theater community embraced the show, or at least the form it takes.</p> <p>Several of the creators described Little Did I Know to me as the first podcast musical, which it isn\u2019t. The show follows earlier entrants like 36 Questions and Loveville High and John Cameron Mitchell\u2019s Homunculus, which take a more experimental approach to medium and structure. But Little Did I Know does benefit, however unfortunately, from good, virus-assisted timing. \u201cWe\u2019re now living in a time when Broadway and all live theater has been put on a hiatus. Little Did I Know fills a need,\u201d Maxwell said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s horrible to think it, but yes, the thought has crossed our minds for sure,\u201d Margherita said. \u201cIt breaks my heart that theater will probably be the last to come back because it\u2019s just groups of people together in one place. I think this may have to be a new way to go. And I\u2019m thrilled to be able to offer it at all.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It was to be the trip of a lifetime for the British couple. One disease ensured that. Another turned that dream on its head and left them feeling like global pariahs.</p> <p>Simon and Kerry Lafrenais remortgaged their home to pay for the round-the-world cruise on the luxury P&amp;O liner Arcadia. The couple, aged 52 and 47, could not wait. At an advanced stage of multiple sclerosis, Kerry had already lost control of her legs and one arm and was steadily going blind. The 99-day holiday was to be a final adventure.</p> <p>Instead, the coronavirus pandemic, which unfolded as they made their way around the globe, turned the voyage into an endurance marathon. First, the itinerary was changed to avert Covid-19 hotspots. Then port after port turned their vessel away due to fears of contamination. By the time the passengers finally returned to Southampton on Easter Sunday, they had not set foot on dry land since Australia, 31 days and 30,000km earlier. The captain told them this was a record.</p> <p>After deadly Covid-19 outbreaks on at least 10 cruise liners \u2013 including the Diamond Princess and Ruby Princess, which are in the same <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_Corporation_%26_plc\">Carnival conglomerate</a> as the Arcadia \u2013 disembarking passengers are likely to be greeted with as much suspicion as sympathy. Even before the pandemic, cruises were viewed with hostility in some quarters because they were associated with the wealthy.</p> <p>But in Simon and Kerry\u2019s case, the opposite was true. They had racked up debt so they could pay \u00a336,000 for the cruise. Simon was borrowing from his future so Kerry would have a present beyond the usual confines of her bedroom. It was part of a strategy of investing in happy memories to tide them through the tough times of her degenerative condition.</p> <p>The multiple sclerosis had revealed itself 18 years ago when Kerry suddenly could not take her foot off the accelerator pedal during a holiday in Devon. The couple, then living in Hertfordshire, narrowly avoided an accident, but could not escape the life-changing diagnosis that followed. Simon\u2019s first response was to propose marriage so he could assure Kerry she would not be alone as her condition worsened. They both worked as bank clerks, and spent the next two years saving for a spectacular wedding in a Scottish castle so they would have special photos to look back on. Kerry \u2013 a self-proclaimed \u201cEssex girl\u201d, with a cheeky grin and a ribald sense of humour \u2013 led the ceilidh dancing. To his friends\u2019 astonishment, Simon \u2013 a somewhat laconic son of Sri Lankan immigrants who was more comfortable listening to the Cure \u2013 joined in.</p> <p>In the years that followed, Kerry had to use a stick more often, then a wheelchair. In 2016, Simon decided to quit the bank so he could become her full-time nurse. They sold their house in the London commuter belt and bought a cheaper home in Lincolnshire so they would have enough to live on until their pension. Kerry was increasingly bed-bound and in need of medication to dull her pain. The couple could no longer afford annual holidays. Instead, they planned a round-the-world cruise with the lump-sum early retirement payment that was due in 2023.</p> <p>But with Kerry\u2019s condition deteriorating fast, Simon realised that might be too late. Going behind his wife\u2019s back for the first time in their marriage, he secretly made preparations to remortgage their home so they could go on the trip early. He knew it was a financial risk, but \u2013 like their wedding \u2013 he felt they could live on the memories it would create. Before going ahead, he got up the courage to tell his wife what he had done.</p> <p>\u201cShe looked at me stunned, asked me to repeat myself and then burst into tears,\u201d he recalls. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t handle crying people well, but it turned out they were tears of joy. What a relief!\u201d</p> <p>Kerry perked up. In the following months, she excitedly planned what to wear at each stage of the cruise and what sights they would see. Adding to Simon\u2019s happiness was the prospect of three months in which the crew and medical staff of the ship would partly relieve him of nursing and cooking duties. He decided he would share highlights of the voyage with friends by posting a simple haiku and photographs on Facebook at each destination, and compiling a cruise playlist on Spotify.</p> <p>Neither imagined, as they set sail in January, that escaping confinement from one disease would lead to quarantine because of another. The following account of their voyage \u2013 compiled from Simon\u2019s diary, social media posts and messages, and media reports \u2013 shows how the pandemic caught up with them.</p> <h2>3 January \u2013 Southampton</h2> <p>A fireworks display accompanies Arcadia\u2019s departure from port. Few, if any, of the 2,388 passengers know that four days earlier, China informed the World Health Organization that an as yet unnamed virus had broken out in Wuhan. The trip will mark Simon and Kerry\u2019s 15th wedding anniversary. \u201cWatch out world!\u201d Simon posts on Facebook along with a first haiku: \u201cSouthampton, \u2018Hello\u2019, Beginning of adventure, Hoping for calm seas.\u201d</p> <h2>15 January \u2013 Cura<strong>\u00e7</strong>ao, Caribbean</h2> <p>After crossing the Atlantic, Simon and Kerry have a health concern, but not about Covid-19. They still haven\u2019t heard of the disease, although it has now taken two lives in Wuhan, and spread to several countries, including Thailand, the US and South Korea. The British couple\u2019s worry is that Kerry feels pain in her foot. It turns out to be cellulitis, an infection that could cut the journey short because her immune system is weak. The ship\u2019s doctors prescribe antibiotics and warn that she may have to disembark for possible amputation if the symptoms worsen. \u201cI feel numb,\u201d Simon writes.</p> <h2>27 January \u2013 San Francisco</h2> <p>The antibiotics take effect and Kerry\u2019s foot clears up as the ship passes through the Panama canal. By the time they reach San Francisco, she is well enough to enjoy the sights of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz. Inside the happy bubble of the ship, there is still no inkling of coronavirus, although the disease is spreading wider. Several US airports have begun to screen passengers from Wuhan, but cruise liners are considered safe. That is about to change.</p> <h2>3 February \u2013 Hawaii</h2> <p>After almost a week at sea without free internet, passengers reconnect at Hawaii between outings to second world war memorials. They are almost halfway across the Pacific to Asia, where cases are rising exponentially. But the outbreak is still barely on the radar. \u201cIf the coronavirus had been in the news it passed me by,\u201d Simon writes.</p> <h2>4 February \u2013 Mid-Pacific</h2> <p>While the Arcadia is at sea, another vessel in the Carnival conglomerate of cruise line companies \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/06/inside-the-cruise-ship-that-became-a-coronavirus-breeding-ground-diamond-princess\">the Diamond Princess</a> \u2013 is quarantined in Japan after more than 100 passengers are found to be sick with Covid-19. This leads to heightened concerns about the risk of outbreaks on other vessels. In the following days, the captain of the Arcadia informs passengers that the Asian leg of the world tour has been cancelled. Instead they will spend more time in Australia and New Zealand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c528f7e8c0175a702dfc2d7bc9802e2242aa719e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c528f7e8c0175a702dfc2d7bc9802e2242aa719e/0_338_3497_2098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon and Kerry come face to face with a koala\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon and Kerry come face to face with a koala during one of their excursions in Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>11 February \u2013 Polynesia</h2> <p>Kerry gets a cake and a card from the captain for her birthday. The itinerary is changed again. A planned stop in Tonga is scuppered by an outbreak of measles on the island, so the Arcadia diverts to Tahiti. Coronavirus still feels a distant threat, although it has almost taken a thousand lives around the world. Passengers are more worried about sunburn.</p> <h2>11 March \u2013 Freemantle, Australia</h2> <p>New Zealand and Australia mark the high point of the trip for the British couple. They love shore excursions to Auckland and Sydney. At Tauranga, on New Zealand\u2019s North Island, Simon says people are so laid-back that he would like to live among them. In Brisbane, Kelly is thrilled to hug a koala. Simon revels in the landscape around Hobart, Tasmania. \u201cWords cannot convey, Breathtakingly scenic views, Mount Wellington, thanks,\u201d he posts on social media. But the pandemic is creeping closer. In Perth, Western Australia, they hear that one or two new passengers have failed health screening tests and have been refused permission to board. They set sail from Freemantle at 7.42pm on 11 March, hours before the World Health Organization declares coronavirus a pandemic. As a result, it will be 30,000km before they are allowed on dry land.</p> <h2>12-21 March \u2013 Indian Ocean</h2> <p>\u201cFrom then on we seem to have lurched from disaster to disaster,\u201d Simon recalls. The Arcadia is refused permission to land in Sri Lanka due to the coronavirus lockdown. This was to have been a big moment for the couple. Simon\u2019s parents emigrated from Sri Lanka in 1966, the year before he was born. He was taking his wife to meet his relatives there for the first time. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d Simon writes. \u201cIt is hard to put into words the disappointment. This is probably the last chance for this type of meeting \u2013 financially, it is unlikely we could afford to do this again and, physically, I\u2019m not sure Kerry will be able to.\u201d Other setbacks follow. Dubai and Malta close their ports, meaning the ship has to divert from the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean. \u201cOur world cruise is shrinking,\u201d Simon writes. \u201cEach new day seems to bring bad news \u2026 Cruise ships have become the pariahs of the world. Nobody wants us to dock.\u201d</p> <h2>22 March \u2013 Durban, South Africa</h2> <p>By the time the ship reaches the Horn of Africa, the pandemic has taken 30,000 lives worldwide. There are still no cases of Covid-19 on the ship, which means it can fly a yellow (sickness-free) flag, but passengers have to practise physical distancing and sit apart from one another at dinner. Anxieties and frustrations have crept into conversations. These rise to a pitch when the Arcadia is denied permission to evacuate passengers from Durban and then forced to wait five days to refuel and resupply. Simon begins to fear Kerry may not have enough medicine if they are held up much longer. Without the right pills, the pain would kick in and her physical deterioration would accelerate. They finally dock on 26 March but only three South Africans are permitted ashore.</p> <h2>29 March \u2013 Atlantic Ocean</h2> <p>The ship is on its way back to the UK. Restrictions on board are tightened. The couple spend more time in their cabin. With one last refuelling stop in Tenerife, the focus is now on home, where relatives and friends are in lockdown and more than a thousand people have died. Simon asks a neighbour to buy groceries so the fridge will not be empty when they return home. He is surprised by how difficult it has become to buy online \u2013 a sign of how out-of-touch the ship is. \u201cBizarrely, fruit and veg is plentiful but loo roll is out of stock \u2013 I think people have their priorities wrong,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92934ed662c47cecf25b2e69059038494224875b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92934ed662c47cecf25b2e69059038494224875b/0_32_3159_1896/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arcadia at Southampton docks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arcadia at Southampton docks \u2013 for its naming ceremony in April 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>12 April \u2013 Southampton</h2> <p>The Arcadia docks in Southampton, the last of P&amp;O\u2019s fleet to return home. The usual fanfare welcome is absent. The passengers \u2013 who have spent 72 days of the 99-day cruise at sea \u2013 have to disembark in stages to ensure physical distancing rules are maintained. They have effectively been in quarantine for 31 days, but they have to be briefed about the changes they must adapt to on a land transformed. Since they set off in early January, the virus has killed more than 110,000 people. The UK is now a hotspot with almost one in 10 of those deaths. They are given a letter from the captain in case police stop them on the way home, and they have been warned they now have to take special precautions just to go to the shops.</p> <p>Simon and Kerry know it could be a lot worse. Their story is one of frustration, not tragedy. They are grateful to be in one piece and to leave with a P&amp;O compensation voucher for a 33-day trip next year, which eases Simon\u2019s greatest concern that Kerry would end the trip with nothing to look forward to.</p> <p>They drive back to Lincolnshire in a car full of suitcases, heads crammed with conflicting memories and a future of a quarantine behind familiar walls.</p> <p>Simon finds time for a final haiku on Facebook. \u201cThe cruise is over, Thanks for the likes and wishes, Back to abnormal\u201d, and \u2013 expressing himself better in musical choices than words \u2013 a Spotify playlist. It starts with Once in a Lifetime by Talking Heads and Fantastic Voyage by David Bowie, then progresses towards Isolation by Joy Division and Ghost Town by the Specials. The final track is A Better Future by Bowie. In case anyone should think this last choice is uncharacteristically optimistic, he adds a caveat: \u201cImagine it as a question, rather than a statement.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>I had been \u201cbidet curious\u201d for years. But it wasn\u2019t until my husband sent me a photo of the ransacked paper products aisle at the supermarket that I finally decided to take the plunge.</p> <p>Cleaning yourself with water just makes sense to me. If I step in dog poo, I wash my shoes off with water. Bidets are also a lot gentler on your nether regions than toilet paper. You still use a little paper, but much less \u2013 a reduction of as much as 80%, according to one bidet purveyor. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-face-mask-fashion\">Coronavirus couture: the rise of the $60 designer face mask</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A couple of days later, I got a text from a friend running low on toilet paper. I told her about my recent bidet purchase. Minutes later she messaged me again: the company I suggested was backordered through the end of the month.</p> <p>It seems that America, too, has discovered the bidet.</p> <p>In the first week of March, \u201cwe saw sales starting to double what they had been the month prior\u201d, said Jason Ojalvo, CEO of Tushy, a bidet company founded in 2015. \u201cThen two days later they were triple what they usually are, and then suddenly it was 10 times what normal sales are. A few days later it peaked at a million-dollar sales per day.\u201d</p> <p>Owing to shelter-in-place restrictions across the country, families need more toilet paper at home. While previously they used the bathroom at work, school and restaurants, they are now going at home. The type of toilet paper in short supply are luxury brands \u2013 double-ply and made of virgin fiber \u2013 as opposed to the single-ply recycled paper that businesses tend to use.</p> <p>Rather than chasing rumors of where toilet paper was last seen on shelves, some millennials see purchasing a bidet as a kind of pandemic lifehack. Kaitlyn Braswell, a management analyst in Chicago who ordered hers a few days ago, is looking forward to what she describes as a new level of cleanliness. She only wishes she had ordered it sooner \u2013 it\u2019s expected to ship in mid-May.</p> <p>In Italy, where bidets are in every household, the American rush for toilet paper remains a mystery. It\u2019s completely unthinkable that Italian bathrooms would be without such an essential piece of equipment. As far back as 1975, a hygiene law stated: \u201cFor each accommodation, at least one bathroom must be equipped with the following sanitary facilities: toilet, bidet, bath or shower, washbasin.\u201d</p> <p>America\u2019s disdain for bidets has no clear basis. Douching was once thought to be a kind of birth control, and in 1936 an onlooker suggested that \u201cthe presence of a bidet is regarded as almost a symbol of sin\u201d, according to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/the-bidets-revival/555770/\">the Atlantic</a>. One convoluted theory<strong> </strong> holds that American soldiers in Europe during the second world war visited French brothels and saw the basins, which they instantly associated with prostitution. </p> <p>Today the stress hoarding of toilet paper has become exactly the incentive that many people needed to make a decision they may have been mulling for years.</p> <p>For Brandon Krajewski, a film-maker living in Los Angeles, a combination of the rumored paper shortage and Tushy\u2019s marketing convinced him to wash instead of wipe.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Once we saw all the toilet paper flying off the shelves, we realized we could reduce our costs and paper waste</p> <footer> <cite>Brandon Krajewski</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe had a bidet experience several months prior while staying at an Airbnb and liked it. Once we saw all the toilet paper flying off the shelves, we realized we could reduce our costs and paper waste.\u201d</p> <p>Tushy isn\u2019t the only bidet brand seeing an incredible spike in sales. Business Insider has <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-bidet-sales-increase-panic-toilet-paper-shortages-brondell-tushy-2020-3\">reported</a> that Brondell is \u201cselling a bidet on Amazon every two minutes, or about 1,000 units per day\u201d. The demand for some of the bidet attachments that Hygiene for Health sells has doubled over the last two weeks.</p> <p>The timing could be a boon for the environment. Trees are a carbon sink, and a (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21115862/davos-1-trillion-trees-controversy-world-economic-forum-campaign\">controversial</a>) <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6448/76\">study</a> published last year claimed the world has the capacity for at least another trillion trees, which could mitigate climate change. </p> <p>If Americans gave up toilet paper, they could keep 15m trees from being turned into pulp every year. Instead of deforesting Canada\u2019s boreal forest, one of the largest carbon stores on the planet would be preserved.</p> <p>Bidets can, surprisingly, also help conserve water. Manufacturing one roll of toilet paper requires 37 gallons of water, Scientific American has <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-talks-bidets/\">reported</a>. Some bidets, by comparison, use one-eighth of a gallon<strong> </strong>a flush.<strong> </strong>Also contributing to toilet paper\u2019s carbon footprint are the hundreds of thousands of tons of chlorine required to make toilet paper white, the energy required in the manufacturing process, the single-use plastic that it gets packaged in, and the fuel for shipping .</p> <p>Now quarantined at his house in Madison, Wisconsin, Josh Faulkes, manager of the Wisconsin Society of Cytology, said the pandemic has changed the bidet from a fantasy item to a necessity.</p> <p>\u201cThis situation moved the product from a \u2018one of these days\u2019 luxury item to a more practical purchase, up there with replacing our back door and changing our tires.\u201d</p> <p>Though he views ownership of a bidet as entirely practical, Faulkes is actually splashing out and getting one with warm water, a heated toilet seat and a warm air dryer.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually a birthday present,\u201d Faulkes confessed. For himself.</p>",
  "<p>Since the coronavirus outbreak in the UK was first identified, the issue of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers has never been far from the headlines. Here are some of the key questions raised.</p> \n<h2>What is the official PPE advice for healthcare workers who may be exposed to Covid-19?</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe\">The latest guidance states</a> that any clinician working in a hospital, primary care or community care setting within two metres of a suspected or confirmed coronavirus Covid-19 patient should wear an apron, gloves, surgical mask and eye protection \u201cbased on the risk\u201d.</p> \n<p>For the riskiest procedures on possible and confirmed cases, a long-sleeved disposable fluid-repellent gown (covering the arms and body) or disposable fluid-repellent coveralls, the highest specification filtering face mask (FFP3), a full-face shield or visor and gloves are recommended.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>At the opposite end of the scale, for lower-risk situations, single-use disposable aprons, surgical masks and gloves are considered adequate.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/clinicians-revised-ppe-guidance-inadequate-supplies\">The guidance </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/clinicians-revised-ppe-guidance-inadequate-supplies\"> has been updated several times</a> after bodies representing healthcare workers complained that the existing rules were confusing and offered insufficient protection. Some still believe the latest guidelines do not go far enough.</p> \n<h2>Is there a shortage of PPE?</h2> \n<p>For weeks, unions, royal colleges and employers have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/doctors-threaten-to-quit-over-protective-equipment-shortage\">warning about a lack of adequate PPE</a>, based on feedback from those working on the frontline. Pictures were published of healthcare workers wearing their own makeshift protective equipment made out of materials such as bin bags, and there were stories about staff <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/01/nhs-staff-making-masks-from-snorkels-amid-ppe-shortages\">improvising masks out of snorkels and using school science goggles</a>. Nevertheless, NHS England and the government persisted in saying there was no shortage, only distribution problems. Finally on 13 April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/13/timeline-of-uks-coronavirus-ppe-shortage\">Dominic Raab, deputising for Boris Johnson, admitted there were problems with supply, citing \u201ca competitive market out there</a>\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>Are particular items in short supply?</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/nhs-doctors-lacking-ppe-bullied-into-treating-covid-19-patients\">Face masks, gowns and visors all appear to be in particularly short supply.</a></p> \n<p>While the guidelines recommend FFP3 face masks \u2013 which are recommended by the World Health Organization and offer a high level of respiratory protection \u2013 for high-risk procedures, doctors have complained about not being able to access them. There have also been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/uk-hospitals-being-sent-untested-coronavirus-protection-say-medics\">complaints from doctors about being given FFP3 masks without undergoing the 20-minute \u201cfit-test\u201d</a> necessary to ensure they offer the highest degree of protection. <a href=\"https://www.hse.gov.uk/news/face-mask-ppe-rpe-coronavirus.htm\">The Health and Safety Executive has warned</a> that incorrect fitting can increase the risk of Covid-19 infection and \u201clead to immediate or long-term ill-health or can even put the \u2026 wearer\u2019s life in danger\u201d.</p> \n<p>In an email on 9 April, senior NHS leaders in London were warned about a shortage of gowns. Full-length surgical gowns are vital because they stop droplets of infection from getting on to the doctor or nurse\u2019s normal clothing and leaving them or colleagues at risk of them getting into their mouth, nose or eyes. By contrast plastic aprons have been described as \u201cflimsy\u201d by the Doctors\u2019 Association UK.</p> \n<h2>Can PPE be reused?</h2> \n<p>Most PPE should not be reused because of the risks of contamination. Some eye and face protection can be used if decontaminated but in many cases it is only designed for single use. However, there have been complaints of healthcare workers having to reuse items not designed for multiple use because of shortages.</p> \n<h2>What can a healthcare worker do in the absence of adequate PPE?</h2> \n<p>The Royal College of Surgeons has told its members not to carry out risky procedures in the absence of adequate PPE. Guidance by the Royal College of Nursing advises its members they are entitled to refuse to work as a \u201clast resort\u201d. It says they could face dismissal, civil or criminal action (although the latter is very rare) but reassures nurses that it will support them if they refuse to treat because of lack of PPE. In reality, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/nhs-doctors-lacking-ppe-bullied-into-treating-covid-19-patients\">many healthcare workers feel they do not have the option of saying \u201cno\u201d</a>. </p>",

He recently finished shooting a Channel 4 sitcom in which he plays Doofus. His haircut, Gleeson says, perfectly suits the name.</p> <p>Really, he assures me, most days have gone better. He\u2019s getting dressed, going for walks within the prescribed 2km radius. It\u2019s just this afternoon that he is still in bed, looking like a Lego man in his pyjamas.</p> <p>Lazing around the house in Dublin is something of a novelty for the 36-year-old. He has been busy the past few years, appearing in three Star Wars films, Peter Rabbit and its 2021 sequel, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/22/the-kitchen-review-melissa-mccarthy-tiffany-haddish-elisabeth-moss\">widely slated</a> The Kitchen, which we will place to one side. Soon there will be Frank of Ireland (with its aforementioned haircut) and Run, the much-anticipated HBO comedy-romance-thriller created and written by Vicky Jones \u2013 director of the original Fleabag stage show \u2013 and produced by her long-time collaborator Phoebe Waller-Bridge.</p> <p>Gleeson and Merritt Wever (Nurse Jackie, Godless) play exes with an escape plan from the new lives they have created since their breakup. On receiving a one-word text, both know a time and location at which to meet. From there they attempt to rekindle their love affair. That is, if the other decides to show up.</p> <p>Aside from an episode of Black Mirror and a handful of sketches, Gleeson has, until recently, steered clear of television. You can end up treading water while nothing happens in TV, he says, unlike films, which have to be wrapped up by the credits. In Run, though, Gleeson saw something different: a pilot script full of energy and excitement, although he makes no secret of the fact it was Waller-Bridge\u2019s name which first got his attention.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc8def2a543d13ccf5046faee6a13daf9d64ccb0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc8def2a543d13ccf5046faee6a13daf9d64ccb0/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Domhnall Gleeson alongside Merritt Wever in Run.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Domhnall Gleeson alongside Merritt Wever in Run.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The writer and star of Fleabag arrived on the shoot halfway through filming in Toronto and then out on location. \u201cIt\u2019s such a funny thing to throw more praise at Phoebe,\u201d he says. Yes, she\u2019s talented, funny and quick on her feet; her reputation for being one of the most skilled people in her field is well-deserved. \u201cBut,\u201d he asks, \u201cwho the fuck needs to read more people speaking about how unbelievably amazing she is?\u201d</p> <p>He could just say she was crap ...</p> <p>\u201cYeah fuck it, let\u2019s go big and give people something to read about. She hits people; she\u2019s got body odour. I\u2019m not really sure where to go with this \u2026 No, she didn\u2019t hit anyone that I saw, and as far as I can remember she smelt lovely.\u201d At least he tried.</p> <p>Despite the considerable hype around the release \u2013 it is Jones\u2019s first big post-Fleabag project \u2013 Gleeson says he didn\u2019t feel a heightened sense of pressure being a leading man with all eyes watching. And to be fair, with roles in both Star Wars and the Harry Potter \u2013 two of the biggest movie franchises of all time \u2013 he is used to high expectations. Instead, he says, the names on the script were a comfort.</p> <p>Gleeson is more tuned in than he would usually be to Run\u2019s critical reception, now that there\u2019s little he can do to distract himself; nothing stopping him clicking on links to reviews he otherwise might avoid. But whatever the reaction, the momentum of Run\u2019s train-based storyline is maintained with the tense, fizzing on-screen chemistry between the lead characters. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny thing when people talk about chemistry and worrying about it. I\u2019ve never thought: \u2018Oh shit, I wonder if I\u2019ll have good chemistry with X person.\u201d He reckons if you work hard and try to be generous \u2013 as long as your partner has some talent \u2013 the rest looks after itself.</p> <p>And Gleeson is quick to praise Wever\u2019s talent, even if he\u2019s unsure about their off-screen relationship. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I really know Merritt at all,\u201d he says. \u201cI think she would probably say that I don\u2019t.\u201d That\u2019s not to say they didn\u2019t get on; Gleeson definitely enjoyed her company. He just often finds himself meeting people he has worked with after finishing a job \u2013 from Margot Robbie to Saoirse Ronan \u2013 and thinking: \u201cJesus, they\u2019re totally different to how I remember them.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe Gleeson has got a bad memory, or more likely he is just not a fan of the showbiz life. That could explain why he steered clear of a move to Hollywood, instead opting to stick around in Ireland close to friends and family \u2013 a family that casts a long shadow.</p> <p>It wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable for Gleeson to object to talking about his dad, Brendan, in interviews. Constantly being compared with your Emmy-award-winning actor father could become irritating. But Gleeson Jr clearly admires his dad greatly, bringing him up twice of his own accord.</p> <p>Right before we speak, he had been listening to Gleeson Sr discussing on the radio how Ireland is coping with coronavirus. A few years ago, Brendan appeared on national television to talk about the sorry state of the country\u2019s underfunded health service. \u201cHe was on again today saying how proud he is that people in Ireland have come together to flatten the curve.\u201d His son agrees.</p> <p>And when talking about his tendency to be overly self-critical (something he wonders if he should have just never have mentioned during previous interviews: \u201cEveryone feels it\u201d), he compares his work ethic with that of his father. Stepping into a parent\u2019s shoes makes him work harder. The pair are close; Dad is always on hand for advice.</p> <p>\u201cLook,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s no way in which he is a hindrance. I was aware, when I\u2019d turn up on stuff, that there\u2019d be a certain amount of: \u2018Maybe he got the job because of who is dad is,\u2019 or whatever. But it\u2019s hard to make a film or a play happen, and if anyone has spent money on anything they\u2019re not going to hire someone who can\u2019t do the job just because they know your dad.\u201d</p> <p>Possibly, he adds, that was naive. Still, he never considered using a different surname when starting out, in an effort to distance himself from his father. Brendan Gleeson was less of a name during his son\u2019s early years in the industry, he suggests, and everyone in Ireland \u2013 where Domhnall cut his teeth \u2013 would have known anyway.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe it would have been nice to take my mam\u2019s surname just to get it out there. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m just not a good-enough son that it crossed my mind.\u201d</p> <p>Despite appearing in his fair share of dystopian sci-fi, he fears none have helped him prepare for this pandemic. He has got a few projects to keep himself busy enough for now \u2013 and he\u2019s excited about a play he was due to appear in this year, although he won\u2019t tell me more in case it doesn\u2019t happen.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>I\u2019m just hoping and trusting that people will still want to go to the theatre on the far side of this,\u201d he says, \u201cThat there is another side.\u201d When we emerge, he believes, people will still want to go to the cinema and to the theatre. The Jackass film was on TV last night; seeing it at the cinema was the most communal event he has ever experienced. Everyone laughing and talking, holding each other; praying they wouldn\u2019t do that thing with sandpaper. \u201cWe have to be responsible now, but we\u2019ll get back to those things. We\u2019ll want to experience stories; to laugh and cry together.\u201d</p> <p>Until then though, Gleeson\u2019s going to focus on the small victories, such as getting out of his pyjamas more often.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Run is on Sky Comedy and NOW TV, 15 April, 9pm</em></p>",
  "<p>Since the coronavirus outbreak, cruise ships have transformed from (polarizing) sites of pleasure to floating dungeons where the extremely unlucky have been, or continue to be, confined. The Guardian recently reported that, as of last Friday, more than 6,300 people \u2013 crew and passengers alike \u2013 were still stranded on cruise ships.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/09/revealed-6000-passengers-on-cruise-ships-at-sea-despite-coronavirus-crisis\">Revealed: 6,000 passengers on cruise ships despite coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those stuck aboard are understandably <a href=\"https://www.cruiselawnews.com/2020/03/articles/disease/cruise-coronavirus-crisis-crew-members-on-the-ruby-princess-plea-for-help/\">frightened and uncertain</a>. The sick are unable to receive long-term care, and the threat of contagion is omnipresent. A wave of would-be vacationers who have returned to dry land are launching lawsuits against cruise companies; some <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/costa-cruise-lines-coronavirus-covid-19-luminosa-2020-4\">have accused</a> cruise operators of endangering passengers by covering up cases of coronavirus onboard. Indeed, cruise companies \u2013 despite claiming to have been blindsided by the speed and severity of the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 continued to launch voyages even after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic.</p> <p>Between cruise operators\u2019 disastrous pandemic response and the economic effects of the pandemic, the future of the cruise industry is uncertain. Cruise operators are no doubt wondering when \u2013 or if - passengers will return. But the better question is: <em>Should </em>passengers return?</p> <p>There are plenty of reasons for the answer to be no.</p> <p>For many tourists, cruises are the ideal vacation \u2013 a chance to see the world with limited hassle and unlimited buffets. But, as Covid-19 has emphasized, in addition to convenience and luxury, cruises also provide a golden opportunity to get sick. Even in the absence of a global pandemic, cruise ships are ideal incubators of infectious diseases.</p> <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp/surv/gilist.htm\">investigate</a> about 13 outbreaks of gastrointestinal bugs like <em>E</em><em> coli</em> and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/cruise-ship-nightmare-after-measles-norovirus-outbreaks-why-does-anyone-ncna1043516\">norovirus</a> aboard cruise ships a year; influenza and chickenpox are also fairly common.

Yes, you can get sick anywhere, but according to Tara C Smith, professor of epidemiology at Kent State University, cruise ships <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/cruise-ship-nightmare-after-measles-norovirus-outbreaks-why-does-anyone-ncna1043516\">genuinely amplify</a> the risk of infection \u2013 in part because of the close quarters onboard, and in part because passengers are at the mercy of companies\u2019 hygienic standards. In 2019, Carnival Cruises <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/carnival-fantasy-cruise-ship-receives-failing-sanitation-score-2019-8\">failed</a> sanitation inspections for offenses including \u201cbrown water\u201d discharge from showers in the medical center and unclean food service utensils. Moreover, when you fall ill on a cruise you are dependent on contractor physicians who charge high fees regular health insurance is unlikely to cover.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A passenger\u2019s carbon footprint triples in size when taking a cruise</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After investigating air quality on cruises, the Johns Hopkins University professor Ryan David Kennedy <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/24/health/cruise-ship-air-quality-report/index.html\">told CNN</a> their onboard air pollution was \u201ccomparable to concentrations measured in polluted cities, including Beijing and Santiago\u201d. Yet the health risks posed by cruise ship emissions do not only affect their passengers. As Forbes <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesellsmoor/2019/04/26/cruise-ship-pollution-is-causing-serious-health-and-environmental-problems/#3c8bdbf337db\">reports</a>, a single cruise ship emits daily pollution equal to a <em>million</em> cars. A passenger\u2019s carbon footprint triples in size when taking a cruise. The Royal College of Physicians <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39129270\">estimates</a> that the premature deaths of about 40,000 Britons every year are linked to air pollution, with the cruise and shipping industry being <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/air-pollution-uk-shipping-levels-record-environment-fumes-damage-nitrogen-dioxide-sulphur-a8189691.html\">major contributors</a>.</p> <p>Then, there\u2019s the fact that cruises expel enormous quantities of hideous discharge into the ocean. Cruises are <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/carnival-cruise-ships-dumped-sewage-waste-into-ocean-report-2019-4\">notorious</a> for covering up the fact that they illegally dump sewage, garbage and sulfurous fuel waste \u2013 sometimes even <a href=\"https://www.stand.earth/latest/markets-vs-climate/carnivals-cruise-pollution/46000-people-ask-national-park-service-suspend\">in the protected waters of national parks</a>.

Even massive fines \u2013 such as the $40m US Carnival was charged in 2016 for <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/tourism-cruises/article118245433.html\">illegally dumping oily water off the coast of England and trying to cover up the crime</a> \u2013 hardly matter when some cruise companies earn revenues of almost <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/carnival-corporation--plc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-record-full-year-earnings-300769295.html\">$19bn</a> annually, essentially tax-free. Cruise companies are able to <a href=\"https://www.cruiselawnews.com/2011/02/articles/taxes/no-taxes-the-cruise-lines-dirty-little-secret/\">exploit a loophole</a> to avoid most US taxes and labor regulations; three major companies make up <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21187076/cruise-line-industry-bailout-trump-coronavirus-us-companies-tax\">70%</a> of the global cruise market, all of which are incorporated in countries with tax and labor laws very different from those of the US.</p> <p>Yes, many people who work on cruises are currently losing their jobs, and that is rightly sad. But bear in mind that the cruise industry\u2019s economic model is built around hiring people from poor countries whose economic prospects are so bad they are willing to endure exploitation and mistreatment. Despite the industry\u2019s massive profits, cruises pay employees as little as <a href=\"https://www.cruisecritic.com/articles.cfm?ID=261\">$600 a month</a>.</p> <p>Additionally, cruises further the misguided notion that vacationers should be entitled to travel anywhere, no matter how culturally and ecologically sensitive. Case in point: as sea ice dwindles, the Arctic has emerged as a <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/articles/the-best-arctic-and-antarctic-cruises/\">chic destination</a>, allowing cruise passengers to observe the effects of climate change while actively contributing to it.</p> <p>It\u2019s comforting to believe that our vacations benefit local communities \u2013 but that\u2019s not always true, especially in the case of cruise tourism. Residents of Nunavut, Canada, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-complicated-relationship-between-cruise-ships-and-the-arctic-inuit\">have expressed</a> concerns that cruise ships disrupt wildlife and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/arctic-cruise-boom-canada-inuit-indigenous-communities\">threaten</a> their culture. Investigations have also found that the sunny economic impact figures provided by the cruise industry may <a href=\"https://thewalrus.ca/cruise-ships-often-represent-the-worst-of-capitalism/\">overstate the revenue</a> their business actually brings to local communities.</p> <p>When cruise lines are able to sail again, they will do their best to lure customers back with <a href=\"https://www.cruzely.com/will-cruises-get-cheaper-signs-point-to-more-cruise-deals/\">cheaper prices</a>. Hopefully, the debacle of the cruise industry\u2019s botched pandemic response has shown consumers what industry watchdogs have known for decades: the cruise industry is an ethical disaster that shirks accountability at every turn.

  "<p>Joe Biden has a problem: the young people who fueled Bernie Sanders\u2019 second-place campaign are not very interested in Joe Biden.

Even today, Biden says he has \u201c<a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-says-millennials-dont-have-it-tough-780348\">no empathy</a>\u201d for young people who complain about indebtedness and precarity. He has told millennials who raise concerns about his environmental policies that they should \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3dqR9oQ9pE\">go vote for someone else</a>\u201d. Plenty have been willing to do just that. So while some commentators, such as Vox\u2019s Matthew Yglesias, have <a href=\"https://youtu.be/TmHFt13osiQ\">suggested</a> that activists and left media are responsible for Biden\u2019s \u201cunity problem\u201d, the more blameworthy culprit is Biden himself.</p> <p>In fact, it doesn\u2019t seem as if Biden has much interest in solving his \u201cunity problem\u201d. In an ostensible effort to reach out to the left, Biden recently <a href=\"https://www.democracynow.org/2020/4/10/headlines/joe_biden_calls_for_medicare_eligibility_age_to_be_lowered_from_65_to_60\">debuted new policies</a> on healthcare and education. Did he adopt the policies recommended in the activists\u2019 letter, namely Medicare for All and canceling all outstanding student debt? <a href=\"https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/joe-biden-outlines-new-steps-to-ease-economic-burden-on-working-people-e3e121037322\">No, he did not</a>. Instead, he merely proposed lowering the existing Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60 and canceling tuition-related debt for students who attended public colleges who earn under a certain income.</p> <p>The first of these policies almost seems like a deliberate insult. Biden\u2019s response to those young people demanding a better health policy is to offer a policy that won\u2019t help any of them for decades. And to understand just how pitifully stingy this \u201cconcession\u201d is, remember that dozens of Democratic senators, including plenty of \u201cmoderates\u201d, have <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article211824324.html\">already</a> endorsed lowering the Medicare eligibility age to 55. You can find an op-ed in Forbes (not exactly the Democratic Socialists of America newsletter) <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/teresaghilarducci/2020/04/10/now-more-than-ever-is-time-to-lower-medicares-age-to-50/#6d26b0ee52be\">suggesting</a> 50 would be a better age. Bill Clinton <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/07/us/clinton-proposes-opening-medicare-to-those-55-to-65.html\">proposed 55</a> in 1998, and Hillary Clinton <a href=\"https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2016/07/12/clinton-health-care-plan\">advocated 55</a> in 2016. So Biden\u2019s big concession to the left is actually more conservative than a centrist Democratic proposal! It\u2019s not nothing, but it\u2019s about as close to nothing as a policy can get without literally being nothing, and it shows that Biden isn\u2019t serious about courting the left.</p> <p>Remember, too, that we\u2019re only talking about the <em>platform. </em>This is where negotiations <em>start. </em>By the time a proposal has gone through the political process, it inevitably gets watered down. Maybe, if we\u2019re lucky, we\u2019ll get the Medicare age dropped from 65 to 63 by the year 2030 or something. And even that prospect assumes that Biden is serious about fighting for his platform. At election time, politicians have an unfortunate habit of promising voters whatever they think voters want to hear. Needless to say, they don\u2019t always follow through, and you\u2019re often better off looking at their record than their rhetoric. From Biden\u2019s record, it\u2019s more plausible that he\u2019ll follow through on his <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/03/09/all-you-need-know-biden-reportedly-weighing-billionaires-michael-bloomberg-and-jamie\">reported plan</a> to put Michael Bloomberg and JPMorgan\u2019s CEO, Jamie Dimon, in his cabinet than that he\u2019ll overhaul the healthcare system.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many progressives are going to have a difficult time voting for Biden</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The student debt plan is a disappointment, too. Why only public colleges, when so much unsustainable debt comes from private universities? Why only tuition-related expenses? Why is it means-tested? If Biden wants to impress the left, he will need a big, sweeping plan, not a plan with dozens of qualifiers and caveats that recalls Kamala Harris\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/kamala-harris-student-debt-proposal-confused-people-2019-7\">infamous proposal</a> to forgive debt only for \u201cPell grant recipients who start a business that operates for three years in disadvantaged communities\u201d.</p> <p>I actually really hope Biden embraces one of the big left policy proposals such as Medicare for All or the Green New Deal, because he can\u2019t afford to write off progressive votes, and the stakes of this election are high. If Donald Trump is re-elected, it will be a disaster: he will be emboldened and more powerful, and will end his second term with almost complete control of the courts. Democracy as we know it may disappear altogether; US militarism will escalate; carbon emissions will spiral out of control; and brutal new immigration policies will be introduced. Trump needs to lose, but Biden is <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/01/a-biden-nomination-means-a-second-trump-term\">already a weak candidate</a>, and he will be even weaker if he can\u2019t turn out the progressive base.</p> <p>Many progressives are going to have a difficult time voting for Biden.

Covid-19 has already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/us-elections-voters-coronavirus\">disrupted the Democratic primaries</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/2020-campaign-primary-calendar-coronavirus.html\">with 16 states postponing their primary elections</a> because of public health concerns. There has been some worried speculation in recent weeks that Donald Trump may exploit the coronavirus crisis to indefinitely delay the US presidential election.</p> <p>While you imagine Trump would love to unilaterally crown himself king of the US, he doesn\u2019t have the power to postpone an election, as Clinton noted. Since 1845, federal law has mandated that presidential elections be held on \u201cthe Tuesday next after the first Monday in the month of November\u201d. Only Congress can change that \u2013 and it would be an arduous process, even before you factor in the House of Representatives being controlled by Democrats. Even if Congress did postpone the election, there would still be an expiry date on Trump\u2019s term. The 20th amendment to the constitution dictates that if an election does not happen, or Trump refuses to step down, his presidency will automatically end on 20 January 2021. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/19\">would then become acting president</a>.</p> <p>Trump does not have the power to cancel the election, but he does have the power to corrupt it. Indeed, there are already signs that the Republican party will do everything it can to ensure a low turnout in November \u2013 it is well established that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/13/voter-suppression-2020-democracy-america\">fewer people voting means a higher chance of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/13/voter-suppression-2020-democracy-america\">th</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/13/voter-suppression-2020-democracy-america\">at party winning</a>. Most Republicans don\u2019t like admitting to their voter-suppression advantage, but Trump, who has a well-documented problem with keeping his mouth shut, recently said the quiet part out loud. Last month, he went on the Fox News programme Fox &amp; Friends to talk about the Democrats\u2019 attempts to push through measures that would make voting easier during the pandemic. \u201cThe things [Democrats were proposing] were crazy,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/trump-republican-party-voting-reform-coronavirus\">Trump exclaimed</a>. \u201cThey had \u2026 levels of voting that, if you\u2019d ever agreed to it, you\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again.\u201d</p> <p>Unless a miracle happens and the coronavirus disappears, only the implementation of measures such as voting by mail and expanding early voting can ensure a free and fair election in November. This may be why Trump and the Republicans are fighting such reforms tooth and nail.</p> <p>If you want a preview of the pandemonium that could characterise the general election, look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/wisconsin-voter-restrictions-democracy-coronavirus-primary\">the entirely preventable chaos that </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/wisconsin-voter-restrictions-democracy-coronavirus-primary\">unfolded recently in Wisconsin\u2019s Democratic primary</a>. Last Monday, the US supreme court\u2019s conservative majority blocked a court order <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/07/liberals-recoil-at-supreme-court-decision-on-wisconsin-primary-171347\">that would have extended the window </a><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/07/liberals-recoil-at-supreme-court-decision-on-wisconsin-primary-171347\">to return absentee ballots</a>. This forced people to go out to vote in person, which resulted in dangerously long lines at the five polling places that were open \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/wisconsin-set-vote-national-guard-called-out-many-polling-places-n1178206\">there should have been 180</a>. (Happily, a liberal judge, Jill Karofsky, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/13/us-elections-2020-joe-biden-wisconsin\">defeated the conservative incumbent</a> for a seat on the state\u2019s supreme court a week later, which could prove important in future voting rights cases in the swing state.)</p> <p>Republicans are not only trying to make voting harder, they are also trying to discredit postal votes. \u201cMail in ballots substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD!\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1249132374547464193?s=20\">tweeted on Saturday</a>. This is a lie: <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/trumps-latest-voter-fraud-misinformation/\">voting fraud via mail ballots is rare</a>. Never mind that Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/trump-mail-in-voting-2020-election\">voted by mail in Florida\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/trump-mail-in-voting-2020-election\">primary in March</a>. But that does not count, because inconvenient facts never count.</p> <p>Anyway, if undermining confidence in mail ballots does not work, there is also the option of underfunding the US Postal Service (USPS). The USPS is on the brink of financial collapse and the <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/04/13/trump-threatens-postal-service-amid-pandemic-saveusps-urges-bulk-stamp-purchases-and\">Trump administration is refus</a><a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/04/13/trump-threatens-postal-service-amid-pandemic-saveusps-urges-bulk-stamp-purchases-and\">ing to bail it out</a>. It is hard to vote by mail if there is no public mail service, after all.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be clear: Trump can\u2019t cancel November\u2019s election, but that does not mean we should rest easy. The Republicans will weaponise coronavirus in whatever way they can. The US loves invading countries in order to \u201cinstall democracy\u201d.

  "<p>For many professional athletes, the Olympics are a lifelong dream, the opportunity to represent their countries alongside the best athletes in the world. Very few achieve the distinction, and even fewer do so in their teenage years \u2013 but that is not the case for Sydney McLaughlin.</p> <p>In 2016, the then 16-year-old high-school student qualified for the Olympics in the 400m hurdles (she turned 17 a few days into the Rio Games). At that time, the teenager from New Jersey was the youngest athlete to make the US Track and Field Olympic team in nearly 40 years.</p> <p>\u201cHonestly, even after I made the team, I couldn\u2019t believe it. I woke up the next morning, and I was like: \u2018This is not real life\u2019,\u201d says McLaughlin.</p> <p>After placing fifth in her semi-final, she failed to progress to the final, but the experience was significant for McLaughlin. \u201cI think it actually took me going to Rio to understand that, OK, this one is out of the way \u2026 now I can really go to the Olympics,\u201d says McLaughlin, who is now 20.</p> <p>For the past four years, Tokyo 2020 has been her primary focus, her chance to have the full Olympic experience. And everything seemed to be lining up perfectly.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD37yYSLiS0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JD37yYSLiS0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>McLaughlin ended the 2019 season by reaching the 400m hurdles final at the world championships in Doha.

Though McLaughlin surged towards the end of the race, Muhammad maintained her lead, setting a new world record with McLaughlin only 0.07 seconds behind in second.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone would be upset falling a little bit short, but to end it with a half a second PR and that close to the world record, I couldn\u2019t really complain. And it was perfect timing setting it up for this year,\u201d says McLaughlin.</p> <p>There was no doubt. McLaughlin was ready for the Tokyo Games, but there was something out of her control. At the beginning of 2020, Covid-19 swept across the world, upending nearly every facet of society and ultimately resulting in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/24/tokyo-olympics-to-be-postponed-to-2021-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic\">the postponement of the Olympics until 2021</a>.</p> <p>McLaughlin, like other professional athletes, said she understands why the Games were postponed. \u201cPersonally, I agree with the decision,\u201d says McLaughlin. \u201cAlthough it is unfortunate for all the athletes who have been working so hard up until this point, the safety and wellbeing of athletes, fans and coaches should be the first priority.\u201d</p> <p>McLaughlin is using the extra time to her advantage. \u201cThis just gives us more time to prepare mentally and physically,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Once her normal training schedule resumes, she will focus on the little things, like hurdle technique, stride pattern and confidence going into the first hurdle. These seemingly small details can add up to major gains in a race that lasts less than a minute.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49645baaefc23287e33929dc671fbe5f44dd9bf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49645baaefc23287e33929dc671fbe5f44dd9bf9/0_209_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sydney McLaughlin and Dalilah Muhammad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sydney McLaughlin and Dalilah Muhammad after winning silver and gold respectively for USA at the 2019 world championships.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Lyons/Getty Images for IAAF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though workouts are different during times of social distancing, technology has enabled McLaughlin to remain connected to her teammates and coach, Joanna Hayes.

McLaughlin describes Hayes \u2013 her first female coach\u2013 as nurturing and caring.</p> <p>\u201cSyd knows that I have her complete best interest at heart, not just on the track but in life. I am not going to steer her wrong,\u201d said Hayes. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell her what\u2019s best for Sydney not Sydney McLaughlin.\u201d</p> <p>Hayes says she is careful not to overwhelm McLaughlin. The goal is not necessarily to win gold or set a world record right away. There is plenty of time for that. Instead, the focus is simply on ensuring that McLaughlin is consistently faster with every race \u2013 which was the case in 2019.</p> <p>\u201cWinning races comes and goes, and records come and go with it,\u201d says McLaughlin. \u201cEvery year, the only goal I set for myself is to beat my own times. I try to be better each year than I was the last.\u201d</p> <p>Maintaining balance is also important to McLaughlin, who, with the help of Hayes, prioritizes time to pursue passions and interests outside of running. \u201cShe understands that at the end of the day I\u2019m 20, and there are things that I want to go do in life. She\u2019s very open to fitting those things in and making the process fun,\u201d says McLaughlin.</p> <p>Last summer, after the Wanda Diamond League competition in Monaco, the duo traveled throughout France. Driving to the summit of a mountain in Marseilles was a highlight for McLaughlin, who said she appreciates having time to enjoy race destinations instead of simply running and going home.</p> <p>Recently her sponsor, New Balance, supported McLaughlin in launching her own YouTube channel, which gives her subscribers a peek into her training journey and the more personal \u2013 and goofy \u2013 side of \u2018Syd the Kid.\u2019 McLaughlin is also active on Instagram, where she has amassed <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sydneymclaughlin16/?hl=en\">almost 500,000 followers</a>. There she posts pictures and videos of herself modeling her latest fashion finds, displaying her impressive juggling skills and cuddling with her new Goldendoodle.</p> <p>That\u2019s not the only new thing in McLaughlin\u2019s life. Over the past four years, she graduated high school, competed for the University of Kentucky for one year before becoming a professional athlete, moved to Los Angeles and learned how to drive a car \u2013 a Mercedes she calls Chili.</p> <p>Her transition to the west coast was made easier by having her athletic family close by. For her first year in California, her mom, who ran in high school, lived with her, and now she periodically visits from New Jersey. Both of McLaughlin\u2019s brothers have also moved to Los Angeles \u2013 only a couple blocks away from her. McLaughlin\u2019s brother Taylor, who placed second in the 400m hurdles in the 2016 Under-20 World Championships, even trains alongside her, just as they did when they were kids.</p> <p>As McLaughlin now looks toward the Olympics in 2021, she says her accomplishments have kept her grounded. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m halfway through my story, but technically it\u2019s just starting. It\u2019s really motivating to know that we\u2019ve done this, and there\u2019s still so much more to do.\u201d</p>",

Despite promising signs the country is flattening the curve, the prime minister, Australians should expect restrictions to continue for many more weeks.<br></li> \n   <li>Tasmania recorded its sixth Covid-19 death, a 91-year-old woman at Mersey Hospital. The national toll is now 62.</li> \n   <li>A South Australian intensive care nurse at Royal Adelaide Hospital tested positive for Covid-19.</li> \n   <li>Virgin Australia put its shares into a trading halt as it looks for financial assistance to keep going and considers \u201crestructuring alternatives\u201d due to the coronavirus crisis.

Now in my dealings with the states and territories on vocational education, there has been a strong willingness to deal with these issues because we understand we\u2019ve got significant skills shortages that we have to start addressing.

It put Zeman and many others out of a job, and left patients with far fewer options.</p> <p>\u201cThey say it\u2019s not related to Covid-19, but it\u2019s a huge disservice to the women of the east side of San Jose. Doing this during a pandemic is terrible,\u201d said Zeman. \u201cThey said it wasn\u2019t financially stable to keep the unit open, and so they\u2019re closing. Our big concern is we\u2019re a trauma center and there are no hospitals in this area that can take care of women and children\u2019s services.\u201d</p> <p>Healthcare is a trillion-dollar industry in the US, where hospitals and clinics are overwhelmingly run as businesses, and patients are the core of their revenue cycle.

This has never happened. I\u2019ve been in the medical field for 21 years,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want us to use our paid time off to cover our health insurance benefits, but if you\u2019re collecting unemployment they\u2019ll think you\u2019re taking a paycheck, so that is going to interfere with unemployment and the unemployment benefits are already minimal.

Alecto Healthcare Services, which operated Fairmont, did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>Snyder, one of <a href=\"https://www.wsaz.com/content/news/Nearly-550-employees-to-be-affected-by-hospital-downsizing-567975731.html\">hundreds of employees</a> laid off due to the closure, worked as a cashier at the hospital for nearly 30 years. \u201cThis is going to have a catastrophic effect on this community. In the middle of this pandemic, we don\u2019t have time to wait 20 to 30 minutes for an ambulance, and [then] drive 20 to 30 minutes in either direction to a hospital.\u201d</p> <p>Alex Hlumyk, a certified medical assistant in Hubbard, Ohio, began his job at a physicians\u2019 practice in a healthcare system owned by a private equity firm eight months ago, but was recently laid off after he was told there was not enough money to keep him on the payroll.</p> <p>Before being laid off, Hlumyk was screening patients for coronavirus and was frustrated he was not offered any guidance on how to continue helping on the frontlines of the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cI have the skills to help people during this pandemic and right now I can\u2019t,\u201d said Hlumyk. He filed for unemployment the day he was laid off, but was still awaiting benefit payments to begin, while worrying about being able to pay rent and payments on his car.</p> <p>\u201cThese furloughs make the case that now more than ever our healthcare system should not be for-profit. We are among the most vital workers in the country right now, and there should be no reason that some people on Wall Street should determine the worth of our jobs when thousands upon thousands of lives are at risk.\u201d</p>",

The book is the product of a four-year investigation into domestic abuse with the lens turned firmly on perpetrators. In it Hill asks: why do abusive men make the choices they do, and what systems of power enable them?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/09/stella-prize-2020-a-readers-guide-to-the-shortlist-from-jess-hill-to-charlotte-wood\">Stella prize 2020: a reader's guide to the shortlist from Jess Hill to Charlotte Wood</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a book that Louise Swinn, chair of the judging panel, called an \u201cincredibly powerful\u201d work that \u201cmeticulously dismantle[s] all of the lazy old lies we associate with domestic abuse\u201d.</p> <p>It is an immense project, but Hill\u2019s objectives for the book were initially much more tightly focused.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted people to understand what victim-survivors had been through and why they\u2019d made the choices that they\u2019d made,\u201d she tells Guardian Australia. \u201cI especially wanted people to understand what many victim-survivors go through in the family law system. That was my initial frame: I want to get a visceral feeling across to regular people about what it feels and looks like to go through domestic abuse.\u201d</p> <p>Not long into that process, Hill realised she needed to turn the spotlight on to the perpetrators instead. Why did these men choose to act this way? That reorientation threw up all kinds of complications.</p> <p>\u201cThat was just such a deep rabbit hole. Personally, it was very difficult to contain,\u201d she says. \u201cI was actually having to excavate so many things that I believed \u2013 so many biases and stereotypes \u2013 but also really having to contend with a lot of anger about what these guys do.\u201d</p> <p>Swinn said See What You Made Me Do \u201cdoes much more than draw attention to this crisis \u2013 it offers solutions for reform\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThe statistics are utterly horrifying, and Hill\u2019s extraordinary call to action cannot be ignored.\u201d</p> <p>Alongside Hill in the shortlist for the Stella were 2016 winner Charlotte Wood for her novel The Weekend; Tara June Winch\u2019s novel The Yield; There Was Still Love by Favel Parrett; Caro Llewellyn\u2019s memoir Diving Into Glass; and Josephine Rowe\u2019s collection of short stories, Here Until August.</p> <p>While the main prize of $50,000 is generous, the other authors in the running will not come away empty-handed. Each shortlisted author receives $2,000 and a three-week writing retreat in Point Addis on the Victorian coast, in addition to the $1,000 they received for being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/07/does-writing-books-still-matter-in-an-era-of-environmental-catastrophe\">longlisted</a>.</p> <p>Hill says the proceeds from winning the Stella will go some way towards recouping what she invested in the writing of her book, especially after the project snowballed.</p> <p>\u201cI thought the book would only take six months to write. That\u2019s all we could afford,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd [by then] the book was just not anywhere close to what I wanted it to be. We thought, well, we just have to see this out until it\u2019s finished. And that cost us so much.\u201d</p> <p>Foremost in Hill\u2019s mind while writing the book were the victim-survivors she had met, whose stories she told, and who she became very close to during the process of writing about their lives. She says she hopes the book\u2019s Stella success will help it reach a wider audience.</p> <p>\u201cIf more people can understand this, we\u2019re going to have a better functioning society. It\u2019s just not good enough to me that there are millions of people who are alive right now who have lived through domestic abuse, who are not understood by the rest of Australia,\u201d she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email\">Saved for Later: sign-up for Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle email</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cEven if it just went out to people who\u2019ve lived through this type of abuse, you\u2019re talking about 2 million women who\u2019ve lived through intimate-partner violence, millions of grown-up children.

  "<p>Good morning, and welcome to a slightly different morning briefing. With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2018/sep/17/guardian-us-morning-briefing-sign-up-to-stay-informed\">First Thing</a>, we want to focus more on the biggest story in the world right now \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">whatever that might be</a> \u2013 and listen more closely to the voices of the Guardian journalists and experts who get to the bottom of the news every day.</p> \n<p>We also want to make sure we keep looking beyond the coronavirus crisis to whatever else is happening in the US and around the world \u2013 plus some longer or lighter reads that might help to take your mind off the punishing news cycle. Speaking of which \u2026</p> \n<h2>Trump melts down over his coronavirus media coverage</h2> \n<p>Yes, Donald Trump devoted most of his Monday coronavirus press briefing not to the coronavirus, but to the press. The president opened his daily display of Trumpian id with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/trump-us-coronavirus-briefing-latest-media\">a showreel of news clips compiled by White House staff</a>, which he said highlighted the media\u2019s downplaying of the pandemic in its early stages, in contrast to his administration\u2019s supposed swift response.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9322d7c1-a13a-4678-bbbf-c554a93226a9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/071YQ5u6Gcg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>While he continues to insist the states are responsible for any failings in that response, Trump also claimed his own \u201cauthority is total\u201d when it comes to the lockdown rules and when to lift them. Clearly he felt wounded by the weekend\u2019s big New York Times story, which portrayed a president fumbling through January and February without a pandemic plan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/13/trump-coronavirus-meltdown-media-authority\">writes David Smith</a>:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Donald Trump, starved of campaign rallies, Mar-a-Lago weekends and golf, and goaded by a bombshell newspaper report, couldn\u2019t take it any more.

  "<h2><strong>James Smythe, author</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019m currently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jpsmythe?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">writing book four of a quartet</a>, and it has the shadow of Covid-19 hanging over every part of it. It deals with a very different sort of pandemic (the loss of linear time) and is ostensibly about grief, about how we move past that which we\u2019ve lost. Suddenly, the allegorical nature of it isn\u2019t nearly as allegorical: our relationship with loss and grief has now been altered.</p> <p>I\u2019m also working on a novel set in the fashion world of both a decade ago and the very near now, but that\u2019s suddenly much harder to work on. It feels, in some ways, almost pointless to write, because we can\u2019t say how scarred we will be as a society when we reach the other side of this thing. Writing the present \u2013 novels usually being published 18 months or so after they\u2019re written \u2013 feels impossible. How long until we can travel to New York? Do print magazines exist? Will people shake hands still? Details that feel like nothing until you fixate on them.</p> <p>My anxieties led to something else: a desire to do more than I am. I\u2019m working hard to feed my family, and staying indoors like we\u2019ve been told to. But I\u2019m lucky, and many people are not. I had an unpublished novel, K&amp;R \u2013 a thriller, that\u2019s entirely coincidentally about a family trapped in a house \u2013 and decided to sell it digitally, with all proceeds going to charities helping those who need it. The novel came from a dark time in my life; maybe this way it\u2019ll be able to do some good.</p> <ul> <li><p>K&amp;R is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B086MTXHF5/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i10?pldnSite=1\">available to buy online as an ebook</a>. All proceeds will go to charities helping people during the Covid-19 pandemic, including Street Kitchen and Doctors of the World.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ece3d2700fcf8f8ba7b37af9172c1ae7a311520\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ece3d2700fcf8f8ba7b37af9172c1ae7a311520/0_0_4284_2856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I\u2019m worried about the muscles in my brain I use for acting\u2019 \u2026 Natalie Cassidy (right) as Sonia Fowler in EastEnders.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m worried about the muscles in my brain I use for acting\u2019 \u2026 Natalie Cassidy (right) as Sonia Fowler in EastEnders.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kieron McCarron/BBC/Jack Barnes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Natalie Cassidy, actor</h2> <p>We <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/bbc-suspends-filming-of-eastenders-due-to-coronavirus\">stopped working </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/bbc-suspends-filming-of-eastenders-due-to-coronavirus\">a month </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/bbc-suspends-filming-of-eastenders-due-to-coronavirus\">ago</a>, and the pace of change in my life is incredible. Some actors go job to job, but I started at EastEnders aged 10 playing Sonia, and this year I\u2019ll turn 37. Just like for our audience, it\u2019s odd to see the show close down when you\u2019re part of it: it\u2019s a home from home.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard artistically, I\u2019m worried about the muscles in my brain I use for acting. When I go on holiday, I always feel a bit rusty on returning. Maybe I\u2019ll learn some monologues, look through the plays I\u2019ve got on the bookshelf.</p> <p>All these cancellations have left huge voids in people\u2019s lives, although thankfully \u2013 because EastEnders records ahead \u2013 our episodes are still airing. But if this goes on for a long time we\u2019ll have to get creative. Maybe we can put something out there ourselves \u2013 video conversations between characters maybe? </p> <p>And a decision will need to be made as to whether EastEnders is going to deal with this situation on screen.

I\u2019ve been reading <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/authors/32502/harriet-a-washington\">Harriet A Washington</a>, who makes studies revealing that we don\u2019t all breathethe same air. In north America, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/climate/climate-pollution-coronavirus-lungs.html\">half the population breathes poor quality air </a>and has asthma and high degrees of mortality. And coronavirus is making this inequality even more obvious \u2013 there\u2019s a direct relationship between Covid-19 and the unequal accessibility to clean air.</p> <p>On 25 January, we were in Argentina with a lot of indigenous communities who live on the margins of a salt lake, where there\u2019s huge extraction of lithium. We went up in a black, solar-powered hot air balloon <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/540545/artist-tomas-saraceno-launches-a-fuel-free-solar-air-balloon-breaking-world-records/\">and broke six world records</a>. On it was written: \u201cYes to life, no to lithium, yes to water.\u201d One tonne of lithium needs 200m litres of water to be extracted, and the indigenous people who live around that area are suffering from the process.</p> <p>When you\u2019re flying in a hot air balloon which is just powered by the sun, you need to be really attuned to the weather. We\u2019re all on board spaceship Earth, and there\u2019s an unequal distribution of the resources. Many of the passengers are disappearing, human and not.</p> <p>There was <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B-QJnEmHEuc/?igshid+17dd7epamkoi=\">a beautiful Instagram post from Extinction Rebellion</a> who said that we have to be really careful talking about the diminishing of pollution in relationship with the coronavirus. We have to be attentive and sensitive to the loss of life. Instead of being on Earth together, the virus forces more distance between us. Hopefully, art can engage us in journeys of solidarity and connect us again.</p> <p>When my exhibition in Florence was closed, I didn\u2019t even have the time to think about it \u2013 I\u2019m more thinking about the lives of my family and friends in Italy, you know? I read an article the other day about an indigenous population who thought about coronavirus as a portal. If you\u2019re not very careful you can fall in this portal, but if you\u2019re careful it can take you into a new dimension.</p> <p>So I don\u2019t read the newspaper more than two times a day, and I meditate. There\u2019s a kind of media that\u2019s addictive, it affects your ability to think by connecting people in a way that\u2019s not good. Now when we start to digitise the art and move it into a new medium, we have to learn how to navigate the web \u2013 things that we thought we knew already.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca4ca9d8dec53985a26f56a44193a76d01f25bcf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca4ca9d8dec53985a26f56a44193a76d01f25bcf/0_2551_4480_2688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Desiree Akhavan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The volume on the bullshit got turned off\u2019 \u2026 Desiree Akhavan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Desiree Akhavan, film-maker</h2> <p>Sirens scream outside my window in New York, all day and all night. I\u2019ll forget for a minute. It\u2019ll start to feel like I\u2019m playing hooky from the most tedious elements of my life: crowded subways, pointless meetings, obligatory dinners I never wanted to schedule in the first place. Then, sirens flood the apartment, and it\u2019s like a glass of iced water to the face.</p> <p>When I ask my dad if he\u2019s well stocked, he says there\u2019s no need! He goes to the store every other day. I stress the importance of going to the store no more than once every two weeks, and I\u2019m met with: \u201cBut I live right next to ShopRite!\u201d My lectures feel limp and inarticulate \u2013 deja vu of me at 13 outside Claire\u2019s Accessories, failing to convince him my quality of life would improve with a second ear piercing.</p> <p>He says: \u201cYou think this is scary \u2013 ha! The Islamic Revolution was scary.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve been writing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/12/desiree-akhavan-miseducation-of-cameron-post-mainstream-queer-female-stories\">a film about that revolution</a>, and it\u2019s becoming more relevant by the hour. The sirens, the fear, the empty shelves, the new reality that\u2019s no longer relevant an hour later. I\u2019m finally a character in the stories I was raised on. It feels a bit like coming home. Only it\u2019s a terrifying home where your heart lives in your oesophagus, and the threat of loss manifests itself as constant paranoid fear that rings in your ears like a score (the terrifying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/15/mica-levi-under-the-skin-soundtrack\">Mica Levi</a> kind, not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/dec/03/contemporary-music-guide-philip-glass\">Philip Glass</a>).</p> <p>There\u2019s been a lot of noise in my life this past year \u2013 around how to be more popular, more palatable. Somewhere, amidst the sirens, the volume on all the bullshit got turned off. I\u2019m feeling a level of joy and gratitude I hadn\u2019t allowed myself. It reminds me of how sex becomes a bit spectacular when you feel you\u2019re on the brink of losing your partner. Perhaps that will be what happens to art? Maybe this will become an opportunity to stop worrying about all the noise and find a way to connect to the core of who we are, why we do this, and what we\u2019re saying.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cecd0b4b9f79ec6eec5e39a9e30ea6b065ca9552\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cecd0b4b9f79ec6eec5e39a9e30ea6b065ca9552/0_402_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Enni-Kukka Tuomala\u2019s Empathy Exchange Tokyo, 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enni-Kukka Tuomala\u2019s Empathy Exchange Tokyo, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Chan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Enni-Kukka Tuomala, artist</h2> <p>I\u2019m <a href=\"https://ennikukka.com/\">an empathy artist and designer</a> \u2013 as far as I know I\u2019m the first in the world. So much of my work is about people coming together, and before Covid-19 that meant in person. I would run empathy workshops or have people collaborate on artworks. I\u2019ve even had <a href=\"https://www.rca.ac.uk/students/enni-kukka-tuomala/\">politicians playing with balloons in the Finnish parliament</a>.</p> <p>The pandemic has proven a big challenge. But it\u2019s also made me realise that focusing on empathy is more relevant than ever. So I\u2019ve been working overtime to redesign my projects so that they can take place remotely. It\u2019s given a newfound urgency to my work.</p> <p>I\u2019m planning on using digital platforms, like Zoom and Google Hangouts. But I\u2019m also also looking at things like literally phoning people up. I\u2019ve got a tool called the Menu For Conversation, which is a guide to having a conversation that includes bigger questions that might be hard to ask under normal interactions. I\u2019m hopeful people can use this to speak over the phone and connect.</p> <p>We know that loneliness is a huge issue in this country; being forced into isolation gives us all a chance to experience what it\u2019s like for a lot of people in their daily lives.

When the Argentinian newspaper owner Sergio Szpolski decided to shutter Tiempo Argentino in late 2015, the workers pooled their money to keep it alive as a co-op. Javier Borelli, general information editor with Tiempo Argentino and elected member of the co-op\u2019s executive board, was there during the transition \u2013 a period that saw the paper\u2019s offices <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/democraciaabierta/assault-on-tiempo-argentino/\">attacked</a> by a group of 20 men.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We were very committed to the idea of doing something that could be ours</p> <footer> <cite>Javier Borelli</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe were very committed to the idea of doing something that could be ours, and we had the energy and time to spend in this situation,\u201d says Borelli. He acknowledges starting the co-op was a risk made possible by situational factors, like most of the workers being young and without families to provide for.</p> <p>Tiempo Argentino, which is 70% reader-funded, is one of <a href=\"http://mcdcmadison.org/2019/04/23/for-worker-co-ops-in-argentina-the-struggle-goes-on/\">thousands of worker-recovered enterprises</a> across Argentina. \u201cWe followed the examples of the recovered enterprises that started in Argentina in the 1990s,\u201d says Borelli. When neoliberal measures forced private domestic businesses to close in the face of rising imports, workers reopened them as co-ops.</p> <p>\u201cPersonally, I think it\u2019s the right way,\u201d says Borelli. He <a href=\"https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/risj-review/journalism-argentina-crisis-lessons-spain-and-france-may-hold-key-survival\">studied worker-owned, explicitly leftist media models in France and Spain</a>, including France\u2019s Mediapart which is governed by a non-profit trust that guarantees editorial independence. Borelli found that 95% of its revenue came from readers. The paper\u2019s slogan is appropriate: \u201cOnly our readers can buy us.\u201d</p> <p>Hayes says they would like to develop similar models in radio and video games to give those industries alternatives to relying on advertising, \u201cor some billionaire\u201d. Right now, these concepts seem like tall asks. But June points out: \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to do anything incredibly radical. We\u2019re trying to create media in a space where there\u2019s a democratic workplace and everybody gets paid for what they do. You\u2019d be surprised at how revolutionary that is.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Andy Warhol predicted a time everyone would have 15 minutes of fame. He was nearly right \u2013 it is actually 15 seconds. That is the maximum duration of a video clip with music (non-music clips can last up to a minute) on TikTok, the video-sharing platform that has taken the world by storm. Favoured by <a href=\"https://www.marketingcharts.com/digital/social-media-108342\">under-25s</a>, who make up its core audience, TikTok this year surpassed Facebook and WhatsApp as the world\u2019s most downloaded non-gaming app.</p> <p>TikTok\u2019s content doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously, and ranges from food to fashion, pranks to pets \u2013 as well as the ubiquitous dance challenges. It is a perfect fit, in other words, for the lockdown, when many of us are stuck inside and in desperate need of some silly fun. This may be why, even if you haven\u2019t downloaded it, you suddenly find, clogging up your social media, clips of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-F8_gelXS8/?utm_source=ig_embed\">Justin Bieber</a> dancing to I\u2019m a Savage by Megan Thee Stallion, or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndersenPickard/status/1236995871117586432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1236995871117586432%7Ctwgr%5E393535353b636f6e74726f6c&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cosmopolitan.com%2Fentertainment%2Fcelebs%2Fa31280442%2Fjennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-flip-the-switch-challenge-tiktok%2F\">Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez</a> swapping outfits to Drake\u2019s Flip the Switch. It seems everyone from doctors and nurses in PPE to bemused parents quarantined with teenagers are flocking to the app \u2013 and sometimes going viral in the process. </p> <p>What makes it stand apart from Snapchat or the now defunct Vine is one crucial difference: the closely guarded algorithm that produces the app\u2019s opening dashboard. Unlike other apps, this home screen is not full of people you are following. That is because the algorithm searches for new clips rather than pushing already popular ones. Translation: you don\u2019t need lots of followers to go viral. It is this tantalising prize that gives the app its USP, and what keeps TikTokers ticking over.</p> <p>But how easy is it to become a TikTok influencer? I decided to try my hand at becoming TikTok\u2019s next big thing, with the help of some of the app\u2019s current British stars.</p> <p>I am not a total TikTok novice, having tuned in almost daily for a year. I like the food and travel videos, as well as young female comedians (in particular <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@brittany_broski?lang=en\">Brittany Broski</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@chiwithac?lang=en\">ChiwithaC</a>). Mostly though, I\u2019m in it for the cat videos. (I\u2019m not the only one: the #catsoftiktok hashtag has 5.9bn views.) In fact, my first foray into creating TikTok content was a (now deleted) video of a kitten grooming. I filmed it on Instagram, added a filter to give it a heavy-metal soundtrack and flames to make it look as though the cat was headbanging. Hilarious, right? It received a handful of views and no likes. Later, while complaining to a friend\u2019s little sister that headbanging cats is objectively great content, I was instructed that the issue was using the wrong hashtags and not using a TikTok filter.</p> <p>Her explanation tells you a lot about TikTok culture. The app, which launched in 2016 in China under the name Douyin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/21/tiktok-lip-synching-app-jimmy-fallon\"> with a focus</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/21/tiktok-lip-synching-app-jimmy-fallon\"> on lip-syncing</a>, was specifically designed with teenagers in mind. The hashtags invite you to take part and set challenges. Any user not sure what to create has not only topics but tools at their disposal, from image filters to options to use other users\u2019 music or visuals.</p> <p>I start by figuring out what is popular in the hope that I can ride the wave. As usual there is a dance challenge, currently #blindinglights, which sees people do a set sequence to a song by the same name from the Weeknd. But as dancing is not my strong point, I pass. Luckily, nearly all the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/lockdown-viral-trends-5g-towers-coronavirus-cases\">other current trends are related to lockdown</a>. As I too am in lockdown, I smell an opportunity.</p> <p>I try out the tools by using two clips I already have. First, using my clip of a fox yawning in my back garden, I\u2019ll shoot myself looking bored around the house. Then I\u2019ll add music so it looks as if the yawning fox is singing. For my second video, I\u2019ll try a traditional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/11/hands-and-pans-the-boiled-down-recipe-videos-cooking-up-a-storm\">\u201chands in pans\u201d food instruction clip</a>. I have a video of a big box of Cornish fish I received from relatives, as well as pictures of the process of prepping, portioning up and freezing it. I know haddock storage doesn\u2019t sound the most appealing subject for the under-25s, but I need something.</p> <p>That is when I encounter my first hurdle. The great illusion of TikTok is that the best content is off the cuff. Some is, but for those who do TikTok seriously, it is a craft. I was shocked by how long my first few videos took. I needed to convert all my pictures into short videos, then find a song that delivered the right high note, at just the right moment, so it would look as though my yawning fox was singing \u2013 genuinely one of my most tricky journalistic assignments. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Arshdeep Soni.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tiktok-embed&quot; cite=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@arshsoni10/video/6814066518628764934&quot; data-video-id=&quot;6814066518628764934&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;&quot; &gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;@arshsoni10&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@arshsoni10&quot;&gt;@arshsoni10&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Watch till End... \ud83d\ude31\ud83c\udfe0\ud83e\udd14 - Anyone can spread it \ud83d\ude37 - Make sure to stay indoors \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude0c &lt;a title=&quot;stayhomesavelives&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/stayhomesavelives&quot;&gt;##stayhomesavelives&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;sponsored&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/sponsored&quot;&gt;##sponsored&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;\u266c Spreadin\u2019 (Coronavirus) - Psychs&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/music/Spreadin\u2019-Coronavirus-6806261398071412738&quot;&gt;\u266c Spreadin\u2019 (Coronavirus) - Psychs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The hours I spent honing my little clip was no surprise to Arshdeep Soni, AKA <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@arshsoni10?lang=en\">@arshsoni10</a>, a 24-year old TikTok user with 6 million followers. \u201cSometimes I stay up until two or three in the morning,\u201d he tells me. Based in Shepherd\u2019s Bush, London, Soni performs magic tricks on his TikTok. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work that goes into it. Planning ideas, rehearsing the right tricks for the right moment, then editing the video. Then I have to figure out the best time for me to post. There\u2019s lots of tactics.\u201d</p> <p>Soni posts on other platforms, including Instagram and YouTube, but his biggest audience is on TikTok. When he is recognised on the street, \u201cit\u2019s usually TikTok\u201d. His TikTok reputation helps him get corporate bookings, but he is beginning to generate income working with brands such as Burger King to promote their products, as well as record labels who pay him to use certain songs in his clips in the hope others will borrow that music \u2013 and so on \u2013 until it goes viral. Indeed, TikTok\u2019s influence on the music industry is huge. It is seen as an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/03/do-something-weird-that-works-on-tiktok-how-to-write-a-pop-smash-in-2020\">incubator for </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/03/do-something-weird-that-works-on-tiktok-how-to-write-a-pop-smash-in-2020\"> smash hits</a> and a way to turn lesser-known artists into stars: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2019/aug/27/good-as-hell-why-lizzo-is-the-feel-good-superstar-everyone-needs\">Lizzo\u2019s Good As Hell</a> and Doja Cat\u2019s Say So became hits after being repeatedly used in clips on the site while Lil Nas X\u2019s Old Town Road was popularised through a viral dance challenge. </p> <p>Soni\u2019s passion for magic shines through on his clips. I realise that if I want to be a big TikToker, I need a focus. I choose \u201cLondon lockdown nature moments\u201d as my subject. I figure that seeing flowers, bees and beautiful trees thrive in the green spots near where I live is exactly what people want to see.</p> <p>I check on my first two videos. Weirdly, fish storage is outperforming the fox. I pull together another video from clips and pictures of a walk I had taken in a secluded wood as part of my government-approved walk. A friend gives me a tip about some nearby fields and I plan to head there the next day for my daily exercise.. But when I wake up, I feel camera shy. I had not worn makeup in the previous posts and am suddenly self-conscious.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cfc62894653f470209cea93ec8a58d0632bc8b4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfc62894653f470209cea93ec8a58d0632bc8b4f/0_101_1242_1771/701.jpg\" alt=\"Abi Else.\" width=\"701\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abi Else.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image provided by Abi Else</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI try to go makeup-free, or not look so great some days,\u201d says Abi Else, AKA <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/aaaaaaaaaabi/?hl=en\">@aaaaaaaaaabi</a>, a 22-year old TikToker from Brighton who focuses on style. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that younger people know that it\u2019s fine to not look perfect all the time.\u201d Pressure to conform to certain beauty standards is one of a range of pressures women face online; their appearance is often targeted in the abuse they receive. And TikTok has come under fire after reports that moderators were told to suppress videos from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/17/tiktok-tried-to-filter-out-videos-from-ugly-poor-or-disabled-users\">ugly, obese, poor and disabled</a> users. TikTok claims the policy was to prevent bullying and has since changed its guidelines.</p> <p>Else, however, says her 80,000 followers are \u201creally nice ... When I\u2019ve had videos go viral, that\u2019s when all the hateful comments come in. I think a lot of the time it\u2019s because it\u2019s a young audience. They don\u2019t understand that it is actually someone on the other side.\u201d</p> <p>She tells me that it is important to engage with your audience and let them get to know you. Else likes to ask her audience questions so they feel part of the clips. I shoot a video of me in a tree with a fact about London\u2019s green spaces so that my new followers (all two of them) can get a sense of who I am. The next day I find it is my best performing video so far. Well, after the one about fish.</p> <p>If anyone can tell me about how to build an audience based around personality, it is Perrin Hooper, AKA <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@persworld?lang=en\">@persworld</a>, an 18-year-old TikToker with 380,000 followers. Hooper\u2019s style is to talk straight to camera and muse on life \u2013 a video diary with the odd dance thrown in. Hailing from Cornwall, Hooper says: \u201cWhere I live, social media is your main way of reaching out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7d5155f21ec7a791a4a2c0c528a3791208ddffab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d5155f21ec7a791a4a2c0c528a3791208ddffab/45_801_2278_2278/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Perrin Hooper.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Perrin Hooper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image provided by Perrin Hooper</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hooper spends roughly three days a week working on TikTok, and the rest of the week is spent running an Etsy store selling pendants and other crafts. Recently, Hooper \u2013 who uses the pronoun they \u2013 has started producing and selling their own merchandise, a project they are working on with their mother. Mum does the \u201cnitty gritty, stuff like costs, margins, packaging\u201d while Hooper takes care of the creative side of things.</p> <p>Despite its focus on young people, TikTok as a family business is not uncommon. One of the most famous TikTok families is the Harfins (<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@refelicity?lang=en\">@refelicity</a>) \u2013 AKA Felicity and her sons, Finlay and Harrison \u2013 from Edinburgh, Scotland. Their 1.8 million followers watch the family play pranks, dance, cook and generally muck about. Felicity, a former marketer, runs the account and has helped to turn it into a business giving clients \u2013 from Mattel to the Brits \u2013 the chance to be mentioned or promoted in their videos. Indeed, it is now Felicity\u2019s main job. But it was the boys who initiated the project. \u201cThey grew up watching videos online and always wanted to create themselves.\u201d It took them years to persuade her. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise how much fun it was going to be.\u201d</p> <p>Felicity says that TikTok has given them \u201csomething creative to do as a family\u201d. But the Harfins are often recognised in their daily life \u2013 and her sons are growing up internet-famous.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve had to learn younger than most about behaviour in public. People film them, so they\u2019ve learned not to do something they\u2019d be worried about being put online.\u201d</p> <p>I am curious about Felicity\u2019s opinion on TikTok\u2019s safety protocols, which have been the subject of sustained criticism from children\u2019s charities. The concerns centre around how quickly inappropriate content spreads, owing to the very algorithm that defines the app. One such example is the #kidnap hashtag, which saw boys pretend to kidnap girls or girls pretend to be kidnapped. It\u2019s acting, but such graphic themes are usually the preserve of 18-rated movies, not a fleeting challenge of schoolchildren.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1003802bca1135b62b5d4ca5b340fa47b2855c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1003802bca1135b62b5d4ca5b340fa47b2855c2/0_0_4096_2299/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Harfin family.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"561\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Harfin family.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that criticism is limited to TikTok,\u201d she says, noting that YouTube is \u201cfar worse\u201d and that TikTok has \u201csorted out\u201d a lot of its problems. TikTok recently raised the age for using its live broadcast function from 13 to 18 after it was reported that predators were using the feature to groom children. It has also added functions such as restricted mode and family safety mode, which allow parents and children\u2019s accounts to be linked.</p> <p>After we speak, Hooper sends me some suggestions to improve my ratings \u2013 they advise I try a voiceover so people can hear me and to shoot vertically rather than in landscape. I have a brainwave. What better way to show TikTok more of myself, focus on nature and join in with the stay-home trends than with a guided tour around my garden \u2013 from the cherry tree to the chewed-up slippers the foxes leave each night.

  "<p>Germany\u2019s health authorities are appealing to medically qualified migrants to help them tackle the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>As increasing numbers of doctors and nurses fall ill or are quarantined, the shortage of medical staff is putting pressure on a usually well-resourced health service.</p> \n<p>Government initiatives have already increased the number of intensive care beds from about 24,000 to 40,000, most of them with ventilators. Staff are being retrained and non-essential operations across the country have been cancelled.</p> \n<p>But the health system still needs more medical personnel to care for patients, increase the levels of testing, and track down people who have been in contact with those who are sick. The Robert Koch Institute, which advises the government on public health, has said 2,300 doctors are believed to be off sick or in quarantine. But with no central collation of data, the real figure is believed to be much higher. In the state of Bavaria alone, 244 doctors\u2019 practices have had to close because of coronavirus infections.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://match4healthcare.de/\">Match4Healthcare</a>, a website backed by medical authorities which was created by a volunteer team of students and hackers, seeks to match healthcare workers and volunteers \u2013 both citizens and foreigners living in Germany \u2013 to clinics and care homes needing support.</p> \n<p>The eastern state of Saxony is at the forefront of a campaign calling on foreign doctors, including the thousands of refugees who arrived in 2015, to help. According to the Facebook group Syrian Doctors in Germany there are 14,000 Syrian doctors waiting for their qualifications to be approved.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are keen for anyone to get in touch who is in a position to help,\u201d said a spokesman for the medical association in Leipzig, Saxony. \u201cIt could be someone who does not yet have their medical licence, but is on their way to getting it,\u201d he said. \u201cTo date around 400 have been in touch.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/germanys-devolved-logic-is-helping-it-win-the-coronavirus-race\">Germany's devolved logic is helping it win the coronavirus race</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Saxony, with a population of just over 4 million, has not been as badly hit by the virus as other regions, but concern is growing.

The AfD rose to prominence \u2013 becoming the largest opposition in parliament in 2017 \u2013 on the back of voter anger over Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to allow almost 1 million refugees into the country in 2015.</p> \n<p>The chancellor\u2019s resistance to closing Germany\u2019s borders prompted a huge backlash against her Christian Democrats\u2019 refugee policy, with many accusing Merkel of undermining national security. Now, although the government was initially reluctant to do so, closing the national border to most neighbouring countries is regarded as a matter of national safety, to prevent the spread of coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Opponents of the government\u2019s open door policy argued refugees would be a drain on the economy and compromise national security. Those in favour said that, as the majority were young, they would help plug a growing skills shortage caused by an ageing population.</p> \n<p>Safwan Adnan Ali arrived from Syria in July 2016.

Labor leader Jodi McKay said only 16% of landlords in NSW pay land tax, and the package \u201cleaves out tens of thousands of people\u201d.</p> <p>Leo Patterson Ross, senior policy adviser at the NSW Tenants\u2019 Union, said he welcomed the package but key details in the final phrasing would be crucial.</p> <p>Under the currently announced scheme, sharehouses where tenants lose income but the household income is not below 25% are not eligible, and there are no direct cash payments to either tenants or landlords.</p> <p>\u201cBecause the government has gone for a fairly complex route, the detail in the regulations is going to make a difference,\u201d Patterson Ross told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>\u201cThe phrasing of that is important \u2013 if it is says you \u2018have to make sure it is affordable\u2019 to the tenant, that will change the dynamic, compared to if it is just \u2018you have to consider it\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a></figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said that a negotiation-based system would need further measures to make sure rent was reduced proportionate to a tenant\u2019s lost income, and landlords received concessions from banks to pass on to tenants.</p> <p>\u201cThe worry is that there will be people who try and negotiate \u2013 and this is for the landlords as well \u2013 who don\u2019t feel able to move far enough to make it affordable for tenants and banks and insurance companies. And the negotiation will fall down. And it is not clear to us that the tenant will be able to retain their home.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re always concerned with these situations with individuals talking to each other that the power balances inherent between landlord and tenant aren\u2019t addressed.\u201d</p> <p>Under the announced details, NSW Fair Trading will provide dispute resolution if landlords and tenants cannot agree on a rent reduction.</p> <p>In the Australian Capital Territory, the rent relief package asks owners to grant 25% rent reductions, and for tenants and owners to split the cost 50/50.<a href=\"https://www.cmtedd.act.gov.au/open_government/inform/act_government_media_releases/barr/2020/act-economic-survival-$214-million-in-support-for-our-hospitals,-local-businesses-and-households\"> This is capped at $1,300 a quarter</a> \u2013 which means a potential total of $200 rent relief a week.</p> <p>Under the NSW scheme, tenants will not need to pay back rent reductions they are given. But Patterson Ross said there was a misconception among owners that a tenant could only be given a deferral of rent \u2013 to be paid later.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018Negotiate in good faith\u2019 should mean that the landlord take into account the tenant\u2019s position and are prepared to offer packages that relate to that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat it shouldn\u2019t mean, as a blanket rule, is a rent deferral. Unless the tenant expects to have a higher income after Covid-19 than they did before Covid-19, it makes no sense to defer rent. Something like the commercial model, which is part waiver part deferral makes sense.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/14/jobkeeper-payment-wage-subsidy-employers-employees-eligibility-work-casual-ato-jobseeker-payments-supplement-support-package\">Jobkeeper payment: am I eligible? Here's everything you need to know to register</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe government are telling people to still pay your rent, the arrears are still going to accrue. That is being read that the rent negotiation is always going to be a payback scheme. That is not necessarily true.\u201d</p> <p>In Western Australia, premier Mark McGowan announced on Tuesday that he would introduce legislation for a relief package that includes a six month eviction moratorium, a freeze on rent increases, and no interest on rent arrears \u2013 but would not include rent reductions.</p> <p>In Victoria, the CEO of Tenants Victoria, Jennifer Beveridge, said the state needed to move quickly on its own rent relief package.</p> <p>\u201cPrime minister Scott Morrison made it clear it is up to states and territories to put in place the evictions moratorium,\u201d she said. \u201cIn Victoria, we are still waiting for action from Premier Daniel Andrews.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cTwo-thirds of the people we have heard from were turned down when seeking rent relief from their real estate agent or landlord. Many have received notification of rent increases. In addition to the evictions moratorium, Tenants Victoria is asking the Victorian government to put in place a freeze on rent increases and additional protections against eviction for non-financial reasons.\u201d</p> <p>In NSW, the Tenants\u2019 Union<strong> </strong>are also calling for banks to provide more mortgage deferrals and relief for owners so they can pass on savings to tenants. Patterson Ross said the focus on only land tax was too narrow, and that state and federal governments should look at other kinds of payments.</p> <p>\u201cA minority of landlords pay land tax, and very, very few units would have an unimproved land value of $734,000,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe also think the banks can do better on mortgage deferrals \u2013 the interest repayments should be paused. The difference is the mortgage is payment for an asset, which the landlord will still have. Tenants are paying for a service.</p> <p>\u201c[Land tax] is something that the NSW government can do. It\u2019s a lever they can pull. But clearly the big levers are the mortgage, the insurance company telling landlords not to negotiate. Really, the commonwealth still has a role to play here. Tell the banks to do better on their mortgage relief package, tell the issuance companies to not have such a hard line negotiation position.\u201d</p> <p>He said that a more proportional, bottom-up structure of rent relief would be more efficient.</p> <p>\u201cThe tenant should put their hand up and say \u2018I need help\u2019, which triggers a rent reduction, which triggers a reduction in the other costs for owners. At the moment, coming from the top down, it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><strong>Because of the coronavirus, I am </strong><strong>staying </strong><strong>in my late mother\u2019s home with my husband, his brother and wife, and our young children.

  "<p>In any normal year, a sixth-form teacher would be pleased to be handed three four-page, well-researched essays by an exam candidate.

She thought she would get 60 and not the 75 she needed for an A*,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBut the rule is fair because some students have much better resources to work at home than others, and there would be too much scope for cheating,\u201d added the teacher, who has been told by his senior leadership team not to comment publicly on plans to grade students.</p> <p>Teachers tell of students in tears because the cancellation of exams means they have lost the chance to raise their grades with Easter revision.</p> <p>Fortunately, say assessment experts, students need not be downhearted. They say this year\u2019s results will be based on teachers\u2019 recommendations, called \u201ccentre assessment grades\u201d, plus statistical moderation by examiners, who can change the grades up or down. This <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/03/gcse-a-level-grades-coronavirus-crisis-teacher-assessment-ofqual\">combination</a>, they say, is likely to be fairer than the usual exam system.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/07/when-the-covid-19-crisis-finally-ends-uk-schools-must-never-return-to-normal\">When the Covid-19 crisis finally ends, schools must never return to normal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis done well by teachers with integrity is the fairest method, and beats the reliability of the current exam system hands down,\u201d says Dennis Sherwood, who monitors assessment systems and has worked as a consultant at Ofqual, the exams regulator. </p> <p>A better exam system may be a welcome legacy of the coronavirus pandemic, he believes. \u201cIf we can demonstrate that teacher assessment works, is trusted, and can be done a lot more quickly and be less costly with a lot less emotional wear and tear for students, we are in a much better position in coming years to evolve something better than the present system.\u201d</p> <p>He says Ofqual\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.hepi.ac.uk/2019/01/15/1-school-exam-grade-in-4-is-wrong-does-this-matter/\">own research</a>, published in November 2018, shows that about 200,000 \u2013 a quarter \u2013 of A-level grades would be changed if the scripts were re-marked by a senior examiner. For GCSEs, 1.3m grades did not match, again one in four.</p> <p>While it may shock the public to realise just how unreliable grades can be, it is no surprise to most teachers. \u201cI am aware every year, particularly with my subject, psychology, that the outcomes vary to a degree I have never been able to predict,\u201d says the head of social sciences at a large academy school in the south of England.</p> <p>\u201cExams themselves do not provide a highly reliable outcome. Nor are results over the years necessarily stable. One year we had 80% A or A* for A-level, and the next year it went down to 20%. It comes down to the luck of which questions come up on the paper and how the scripts are graded.</p> <p>\u201cFor a lot of us, grades are linked to our sense of wellbeing and efficacy. Ten years ago I felt they were my grades as well, but I don\u2019t feel that any more, I have learned to accept that I cannot control the outcomes. All I can do is teach as well as I can.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is that this year I have been asked to put in the grades myself. I\u2019ve been talking to other people in the same boat and we don\u2019t like it, because our job is to be alongside the student, helping them to do as well as possible,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Usually exam papers are marked by examiners and then, once the overall picture emerges, the different exam boards decide the number of marks needed for each subject grade. They work out how many candidates will get each grade and submit the estimates to Ofqual. The regulator then collates the data from all the boards to check that the proportion of, say, A grades awarded nationally is in line with previous years and fits with the information it holds about the prior attainment of the cohort.</p> <p>This year teachers will recommend what grades students should be awarded and put students in rank order within the grades \u2013 the ones most likely to achieve that grade at the top, and the weakest near the grade boundary at the bottom. To deliver the fairest outcomes, Sherwood suggests students should be ranked first, and then the grade boundaries determined to reflect the school\u2019s previous results in the qualification.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/03/gcse-a-level-grades-coronavirus-crisis-teacher-assessment-ofqual\">Exam regulator unveils GCSE and A-level plans for coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ofqual tells teachers they should take a student\u2019s prior performance over the course into account, but suggests results in previous examinations should be used \u201cat centre level\u201d to judge the ability of the class and year group, not the individual candidate. In other words, an A-level student should not be marked down for their GCSE results.</p> <p>A student working at an A grade during the year and hoping to raise it to an A* by the exam date, may still get the coveted top grade if the school got five A* grades last year and thinks he or she is one of their top five students.</p> <p>Teachers have been told not to tell students what grades they are submitting, because they may not be the final ones. It could leave teachers open to bribery, abuse or even legal action. Ofqual has yet to announce how students will be able to appeal grades they feel are unfair.</p> <p>A head of English, who wants to remain anonymous, says his department will not be relying much on teacher opinions, but on aggregated data showing how well the candidates performed in mocks, tests and assignments compared to each other.</p> <p>\u201cResults are capped by the proportion of grades awarded in previous years, so if you got five A*s last year, that\u2019s what Ofqual will expect to see. It means that you have to be very careful, if you move someone up on a hunch they would have done better in the actual examination, you are moving someone else down,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Teachers also should be aware that research has consistently demonstrated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/fears-that-cancelling-exams-will-hit-black-and-poor-pupils-worst\">unconscious teacher bias </a>against some groups based on race, class, gender and even personal qualities such as attractiveness, he explains.</p> <p>There will be anomalies for some schools. Putney High, an independent school in London, for example, last year added Fashion and Textiles to its art and textile A-levels; only six girls chose it, with half getting an A* grade and half a B, making an A grade average. This year, with numbers doubling, the school expects two-thirds to get an A* and one third an A.</p> <p>\u201cThis year\u2019s is a very strong cohort and they deserve the grades but will the exam board look at last year\u2019s results, think we have been too generous, and put their grades down? That would be very unfair,\u201d says Stuart McLaughlin, the school\u2019s head of textiles.</p> <p>Fast-improving schools could also miss out if their grades are mapped to those awarded before, as could those where the intake changes, such as a boys\u2019 school admitting girls to the sixth form. But a spokesman for Ofqual said it was still consulting on its model of \u201cstandardisation\u201d that could take such circumstances into account.</p>",
  "<p>Seamus Oates was deciding whether to keep his schools for vulnerable and difficult children open during the coronavirus crisis when an email from a teaching assistant dropped into his inbox.</p> <p>\u201cDear Seamus,\u201d it read. \u201cI have to admit I haven\u2019t been overly concerned [about Covid-19].

According to the <a href=\"https://kareningalasmith.com/counting-dead-women/\">Counting Dead Women campaign</a>, since lockdown on 23 March at least 10 women and children have been killed by men they knew. Six more killings of women by men in that period are yet to be confirmed as domestic homicides. As well as domestic homicides, Dwyer warns that \u201cwhat we\u2019re also going to see is an increase in suicides \u2013 people who really want to flee but can\u2019t and feel they have no other choice\u201d.</p> \n<p>Solace\u2019s 23 refuges across the capital are now completely full, and because nobody can move on from the 159 spaces, none of its 45 self-contained units are coming free.</p> \n<p>So will the extra \u00a32m from the government be enough? \u201cFor any individual charity focusing on violence against women and girls, that amount would be huge because we run things on a shoestring,\u201d Dwyer replies. \u201cSpread across the whole country, it\u2019s pitiful.\u201d</p> \n<p>She thinks the money will mainly be spent on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/09/uk-domestic-abuse-helplines-report-surge-in-calls-during-lockdown\">national domestic abuse helpline</a>, which refers women on to organisations like Solace to provide a roof over victims\u2019 heads. \u201cRegarding accommodation, we\u2019ve sent numerous letters to various secretaries of state, including Priti Patel, and had no response to any of them,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe welcome the inclusion of tackling perpetrators in her announcement, suggesting that they should be the ones to leave, and would like to see how the home secretary plans to put this into practice. In the meantime, we are still funding accommodation from our emergency appeal for those women and children who have managed to flee.\u201d</p> \n<p>Since the lockdown began, Solace has had to pay for emergency accommodation for 10 women who have fled their homes, including a heavily pregnant Muslim woman with three children who was turned away for help by a council housing department. </p> \n<p>It wouldn\u2019t step in because the government advice has been that nobody should move \u2013 so housing officers are interpreting that as everyone should go home, Dwyer explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a madness, and it\u2019s really terrifying us that we are still seeing people turned away at this time.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a69d5c0b-bac3-4d08-9162-6d08a24a974e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/69XVUWvb3fM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>All her organisation\u2019s face-to-face support to help traumatised victims make safety plans, or organise the best way to flee, has had to go online.

The charity, which has an annual income of just under \u00a312m, is burning through money it has not budgeted for.</p> \n<p>Solace and the Public Interest Law Centre <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/31/call-for-uk-domestic-violence-refuges-to-get-coronavirus-funding\">wrote a letter </a>last month asking the government to provide emergency funding for domestic abuse organisations during the pandemic. \u201cRight now, we need money. If we don\u2019t get that funding, more people will die,\u201d she says. </p> \n<p> Dwyer is trying to anticipate the level of funding needed both now but also after the crisis, when she expects services to be inundated.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven in the healthiest relationship, being cooped up is extra pressure. We\u2019ve now got a situation where perpetrators may never have worked from home and end up becoming even more abusive. Then if you\u2019ve got someone using it as an opportunity to further isolate you, saying \u2018we need to self-isolate, we can\u2019t go out\u2019 \u2013 well, it\u2019s really difficult. And we don\u2019t know how long this will go on for.\u201d Victims only have bad options, she points out. \u201cEither you leave and become homeless, or you end up sleeping somewhere really unsafe, or you stay at home and risk your life.\u201d</p> \n<p>And as the risks soar for victims, so too does the pressure on staff at domestic abuse charities. They are now cleaning refuges daily but have not been able to access <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/nhs-staff-protection-doctor-ppe-coronavirus\">personal protective equipment</a> (PPE), despite a number of suspected Covid-19 cases.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhole houses have had to self-isolate, but they have not been tested, despite some people being very unwell,\u201d says Dwyer.

  "<h2>Top story: Trump in White House tantrum</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray here, pleased to be delivering the Briefing once again after our Easter hiatus.</p> \n<p>People in Britain have been warned that there is \u201ca long way to go\u201d before lockdown measures are likely to be relaxed, with the government and its chief scientific adviser suggesting they could last another month. Dominic Raab, who is deputising for the recovering PM, Boris Johnson, said it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/raab-suggests-uk-lockdown-could-last-at-least-another-month\">\u201cabsolutely crucially important\u201d not to let up at this point</a>. The head of the World Health Organization has urged caution over moves to lift lockdown conditions, as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/global-covid-19-cases-near-2-million-as-putin-warns-russia-faces-extraordinary-crisis\">global number of infections approaches 2 million</a>. Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, has warned the situation there is getting worse rather than better, while China says its neighbour has failed to control imported cases. \u201cThe Chinese people have watched Russia become a severely affected country,\u201d said an editorial in China\u2019s state press. To get you up to speed quickly here is our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-latest-14-april-at-a-glance\">latest at-a-glance summary</a>. </p> \n<p>Donald Trump has declared in a White House briefing that his \u201cauthority is total\u201d when it comes to lockdown rules during the coronavirus pandemic. The president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/trump-us-coronavirus-briefing-latest-media\">delivered a bizarre performance</a> in which he played a campaign video produced by White House staff \u2013 in a possible violation of election laws \u2013 that consisted of Fox News clips praising his response. Trump\u2019s assertion of sweeping powers over the states has been rejected by legal analysts as a gross misreading of the US constitution, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/11/trump-states-governors-clashes\">assures the states of autonomy</a>.

They have maintained the all-important flow of credit. During major crises, we are reminded that at the heart of the profit-driven, private financial economy is a public institution, the central bank. Because it is the ultimate backer of the currency, its budget is unlimited \u2013 and the last six weeks have seen a bout of intervention without precedent. A giant public safety net has been stretched out across the financial system by the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England. This is the story of how global financial meltdown was averted by central banks taking decisions that, just a month earlier, they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/how-coronavirus-almost-brought-down-the-global-financial-system\">would have dismissed as utterly impossible</a>.</p> \n<h2>Sport</h2> \n<p>Bradley Wiggins and Mark Cavendish have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/13/bradley-wiggins-mark-cavendish-british-cycling-tokyo-olympics\">aimed stinging criticism at British Cycling</a>, the sport\u2019s national governing body, in a Q&amp;A session on Instagram.

  "<p>In the third week of March, while most of our minds were fixed on surging coronavirus death rates and the apocalyptic scenes in hospital wards, global financial markets came as close to a collapse as they have since September 2008. The price of shares in the world\u2019s major corporations plunged. The value of the dollar surged against every currency in the world, squeezing debtors everywhere from Indonesia to Mexico. Trillion-dollar markets for government debt, the basic foundation of the financial system, lurched up and down in terror-stricken cycles.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/04/coronavirus-global-financial-collapse-prevented-podcast\">How coronavirus almost brought down the global financial system \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the terminal screens, interest rates danced. Traders hunched over improvised home workstations \u2013 known in the new slang of March 2020 as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/global-traders-creating-the-ultimate-work-from-home-rona-rigs\" title=\"\">Rona rigs</a>\u201d \u2013 screaming with frustration as sluggish home wifi systems dragged behind the movement of the markets. At the low point on 23 March, $26tn had been <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2020/03/22/goodbye-dow-30000-hello-dow-10000/#559a9620ff50\" title=\"\">wiped off</a> the value of global equity markets, inflicting huge losses both on the fortunate few who own shares, and on the collective pools of savings held by pension and insurance funds.</p> <p>What the markets were reacting to was an unthinkable turn of events. After a fatal period of hesitation, governments around the world were ordering comprehensive lockdowns to contain a lethal pandemic. Built for growth, the global economic machine was being brought to a screeching halt. In 2020, for the first time since the second world war, production around the world will contract. It is not only Europe and the US that have been shut down, but once-booming emerging market economies in Asia. Commodity exporters from Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa face collapsing markets.</p> <p>It is now clear that we can, if circumstances demand, turn the economy off. But the consequences are catastrophic. Across the world, hundreds of millions of people have been thrown out of work. From the street hawkers of Delhi to the personal trainers of LA, the service sector \u2013 by far the most important employer in the modern economy \u2013 has been poleaxed. Never before has the global economy suffered a shock of this scale all at once. In the US alone, at least 17 million people have lost their jobs in the last three weeks. A severe global recession is now inevitable.</p> <p>The crucial question is how much of the world economy will survive the lockdown, and this depends on the availability of credit. Business runs on credit. The bits of the economy that do continue to function \u2013 the warehouses, the mobile phone providers and internet firms \u2013 all need credit. Wage bills for those still working are financed through credit. Even greater is the need of those who are not working. If they can\u2019t get loans, bills will go unpaid, which spreads the pain. To survive the lockdown, millions of families and firms around the world are relying on grants and loans from the state. But tax revenues have collapsed, so states need credit, too. Across the world we are witnessing the largest surge in deficits and government debt since the second world war.</p> <p>But who do we borrow from? Banks, financial markets and money markets provide the financial fuel of the world economy. Normally, credit is sustained by the optimistic promise of growth. When that dissolves, you face a self-reinforcing cycle of collapsing confidence, contracting credit, unemployment and bankruptcy, which spreads a poison cloud of pessimism. Like an epidemic, if left uncontrolled, it will sweep all before it, destroying first the financially fragile and then much else besides. It is not for nothing that we speak of financial contagion.</p> <p>What began with the lockdown in Wuhan in January is more intense and more fast-moving than any recession we have seen before. In a matter of weeks we have been confronted with an economic outlook that is as grim as at any moment since the 1930s. But it could have been even worse. Imagine a situation in which, on top of the pain of the lockdown and the hellish scenes in hospital wards, we also face calls for austerity because the government cannot safely finance extra spending. Imagine that interest rates were surging, and the terms for credit cards, car loans and mortgages were suddenly getting stiffer. All of this may still happen. It is already happening to the weaker economies around the world. But for now at least, it has not happened in Europe and the US \u2013 even after the turbulence of March 2020, when the pandemic hit with full force.</p> <p>What Europe and the US have succeeded in doing is to flatten the curve of financial panic. They have maintained the all-important flow of credit. Without that, large parts of their economies would not be on life support \u2013 they would be stone dead. And our governments would be struggling with a financial crunch to boot. Maintaining the flow of credit has been the precondition for sustaining the lockdown. It is the precondition for a concerted public health response to the pandemic.</p> <p>During major crises, we are reminded of the fact that at the heart of the profit-driven, private financial economy is a public institution, the central bank. When financial markets are functioning normally, it remains in the background. But when they threaten to break down, it has the option of stepping forward to act as a lender of last resort. It can make loans, or it can buy assets from banks, funds or other businesses that are desperate for cash. Because it is the ultimate backer of the currency, its budget is unlimited. That means it can decide who sinks and who swims. We learned this in 2008. But 2020 has driven home the point as never before.</p> <p>The last six weeks have seen a bout of intervention without precedent. The results have been momentous. A giant public safety net has been stretched out across the financial system. We may never know what went on behind the closed doors of the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England during those critical moments in March. So far, only <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-09/some-ecb-officials-had-doubts-about-emergency-bond-purchases\" title=\"\">muffled sounds of argument</a> have reached the outside. But as the virus struck, the men and women in those three central banks held the economic survival of hundreds of millions of people and the fate of nations in their hands. This is the story of how global financial meltdown was averted by central banks taking decisions that, just a month earlier, they would have dismissed as utterly impossible.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The financial markets scan the world for risk. Even the slightest disruption in the vast networks of finance, production and trade offers the opportunity for profit or the threat of loss. So the news on 23 January, that the outbreak of an unknown virus was serious enough for the Chinese authorities to impose a gigantic quarantine, hit the traders on their Bloomberg terminals hard. Bank economists struggled to get a grip on the dimensions of the problem. Would this be a minor disruption like Sars in 2003? Or were we facing the nightmare scenario of the Hollywood film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/30/what-can-we-learn-about-coronavirus-from-watching-contagion\" title=\"\">Contagion</a>?</p> <p>In late January, investors began to move more and more money out of things like commodities and shares in companies, and into the relative safety of government bonds. What comforted them was the idea that the virus was a problem contained in China. The day that illusion burst \u2013 the day that investors realised that Covid-19 was becoming a global pandemic \u2013 was Monday 24 February. Over the weekend the Italian government had announced that it was imposing a quarantine in parts of northern Italy. It was the first place in the west to do so.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9a900558f352fc351fe1067ee4b65cb30b726ecc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a900558f352fc351fe1067ee4b65cb30b726ecc/0_0_5312_3541/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Around the time Italy imposed a national lockdown in early March, investors worldwide began to panic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Around the time Italy imposed a national lockdown in early March, investors worldwide began to panic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessandro Serran\u00f2/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ever since the financial crisis of 2008, Italy\u2019s economy had been stagnating. Both its banks and its public finances were in a precarious state. Italy\u2019s debt levels were high enough to cause bond markets to periodically panic. Now the country would become the frontline in the virus fight. The coronavirus would test the solidarity of the eurozone at its weakest link.</p> <p>At this point, not everyone was taking the threat seriously. The caseload in the US still looked tiny. Donald Trump dismissed the virus as a \u201cscare\u201d. But investors were now seriously worried. Over the week that began on 24 February, America\u2019s main stock market index, the S&amp;P 500, lost 10% of its value. The chair of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, was concerned enough to signal that he would soon be bringing forward a cut in interest rates, in order to stimulate consumption and investment. It was a conventional reaction, but Covid-19 was no longer looking like a conventional threat.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>By early March, whatever complacency had prevailed was long gone. The death toll in northern Italy was rising into the hundreds and it was only a matter of time before the government in Rome would be forced to declare a nationwide lockdown.</p> <p>Investors around the world started to panic. In times of uncertainty, they want safe-haven assets. What makes a government bond a safe investment is not only the financial standing of the borrower, but the depth of the market in which lenders can sell them if they want to get their money back sooner. There is no deeper market than that for US Treasuries, as US government bonds are known. The greater the demand for safety, the lower the interest rate the US government generally has to pay to borrow. In the first week of March, those rates were at record lows.</p> <p>For the rest of the world economy, this run to safety was an alarming signal. One sector that knew it was heading for trouble was oil. When the global economy slows, so does the demand for energy. The oil industry of the 21st century consists, on the one hand, of large, state-controlled producers \u2013 above all the Opec group dominated by Saudi Arabia and Russia \u2013 and, on the other hand, of the US\u2019s upstart fracking industry. To match falling demand for oil, the Saudis wanted to cut overall production and thus prop up the price. For this they needed the agreement of the other big producers, but Russia refused to go along with them. As Moscow saw it, cutting production with a view to propping up prices was an invitation to American shale producers to fill the gap. If the politics of climate change meant that the future really would bring a transition away from fossil fuel, winning the end game involved seizing as much of the market as possible for as long as oil was being pumped. So Russia decided not to cut production, but to launch a price war. Not wanting to be outdone, over the weekend of 7-8 March, Saudi Arabia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/saudi-arabia-oil-price-war-production-increase-aramco\" title=\"\">took up the challenge</a>. It announced that it would be maximising production and discounting its prices.</p> <p>On Monday 9 March, as markets opened, oil prices plummeted. The benchmark Brent crude fell 24% by the end of trading. By the end of the month its value had halved. From the point of view of the financial markets, the ferocity of the competition in the oil industry was a harbinger of things to come. Falling demand would force industry after industry to either slash prices or contract production. Either way, it was bad news for profits.</p> <p>When trading opened on Wall Street that morning, the situation was so dire that the circuit-breakers \u2013 automatic stops to trading that are triggered when prices fall by a certain amount \u2013 were soon activated. This was supposed to slow a wild selloff. But it sent a message of panic. As soon as trading resumed, everything sold.</p> <p>A rout like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/09/markets-plunge-crash-financial-crisis-coronavirus-ftse-italy-oil-price-dow-business-live?page=with:block-5e663c6f8f085f0b8d944e59\" title=\"\">the one that began on 9 March</a> has a perverse logic. When fund managers face withdrawals from the people whose money they manage, they need cash and have to choose which assets to sell first. They might prefer to sell the riskiest investments, but those can be disposed of only for a large loss. So instead, they attempt to sell their most liquid and safe assets \u2013 government bonds. That means the prices of those bonds fall, dragging them into the maelstrom. This has the knock-on effect of unravelling a basic relationship on which many investors rely: typically, when shares go down, bonds go up, and vice versa. So to protect yourself against risk, you buy a portfolio made up of both. If everything works as it\u2019s supposed to, the swings should balance each other out. But in the panic that began on 9 March, this was no longer happening: rather than balancing out, the price of shares and bonds were collapsing together. The only thing that anyone wanted to hold was cash, and what they wanted most of all were dollars. The surging US dollar in turn spread the pressure worldwide to everyone who owed money in that currency.</p> <p>The Fed had desperately tried to halt the run. To signal its willingness to support the economy and ease the pressure on the world economy from the strong dollar, it had <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/emergency-rate-cuts-events-caused-past-fed-coronavirus-timeline-when-2020-3-1028964493#1-october-2008-lehman-falls1\" title=\"\">brought forward</a> an interest rate cut that had been expected for the middle of the month. But with the darkening horizon, lower interest rates did little to help. Who would borrow or invest under such circumstances? Confidence was broken. Just how badly would become clear over the following two weeks.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>It was a cruel twist of fate that Italy was the first European country struck by the virus. Italy has a sophisticated medical system; Lombardy, the region worst affected by the virus, is among the richest places in the world. The weakness lies in the country\u2019s public finances. To fight the crisis, Italy needed to be spending money on public health and to support the economy during the lockdown. But would the corset of the euro give it the leeway?</p> <p>The problem was that spending to meet the coronavirus crisis would raise Italy\u2019s public debts. The more indebted you are, the higher the price you pay to borrow. For a European government, that premium is measured by the difference, or \u201cspread\u201d, between your interest rate and that paid by Germany, the highest-ranked borrower in Europe. With its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/05/eu-could-fine-italy-3bn-for-breaking-spending-and-borrowing-rules\" title=\"\">pre-crisis debt</a> at just under 135% of GDP, Italy was perilously close to the point at which rising spreads would drive up its deficit and thus, in a vicious circle, make its debts less and less sustainable.</p> <p>To ensure that investors stay calm, it is the job of central banks to act as the buyer of last resort. But because Italy is a member of the eurozone, it no longer has an independent national central bank that can buy its debt. Its monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank, which is prohibited from directly buying a member country\u2019s newly issued debt. That left the Italians exposed. As the coronavirus crisis intensified in late February and investors became concerned by the prospect of greater state spending, the spread to German interest rates increased. If they rose too far, Italy would face not only a public health disaster but a financial crisis, too. What could Europe do to help?</p> <p>Italy already had reason to feel abandoned by its European partners: they had done little to help it tackle its chronic unemployment problem, or to take in the refugees arriving from north Africa. The coronavirus was a new test. The signs were not good: other member states were grudging in their reaction to Italy\u2019s appeals for help. But what really mattered, for the country\u2019s financial survival, was the stance taken by the ECB.</p> <p>Under its former president, Mario Draghi, the ECB had emerged in the course of the last financial crisis as the pivot of the European economy. Draghi\u2019s promise to do <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/26/eurozone-crisis-greece-bailout-barroso#block-501117ec95cb1d4f92af2233\" title=\"\">whatever it takes</a> to hold the eurozone together, uttered at the height of the crisis in July 2012, has become a mantra of modern economic policy. Faced with a financial panic, restoring confidence is key \u2013 and because a central bank is in charge of issuing currency, it is the only crisis-fighter with truly unlimited firepower.</p> <p>Northern European fiscal and monetary conservatives had always been suspicious of Draghi\u2019s interventions, which they saw as a way to transfer Italy\u2019s liabilities on to Europe\u2019s balance sheet. And his <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ecb-policy/draghi-ties-lagardes-hands-with-promise-of-indefinite-stimulus-idUKKCN1VW2SR\" title=\"\">final round</a> of bond-buying, in 2019, proved particularly controversial. By the time he ended his stint at the ECB that autumn, it was all Angela Merkel\u2019s government in Berlin could do to ensure that there were no unseemly scenes at his retirement party.</p> <p>Christine Lagarde, the former finance minister of France and IMF boss, took over as head of the ECB in October 2019, and inherited Draghi\u2019s extraordinarily difficult position. Now she would have to demonstrate that she could handle a major financial crisis. The ECB press conference on 12 March was the crucial test.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1d392f4089b34020b6fcf7cf2f1e1c553ebcffba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d392f4089b34020b6fcf7cf2f1e1c553ebcffba/0_0_3500_2727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christine Lagarde seen in a German TV broadcast of the ECB\u2019s coronavirus press conference on 12 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"779\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christine Lagarde seen in a German TV broadcast of the ECB\u2019s coronavirus press conference on 12 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ralph Orlowski/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The ECB had good news for Europe\u2019s banks: they would receive a huge amount of low-cost funding. It was also going to buy an additional \u20ac120bn in assets \u2013 although if that was spread across the members of the Eurozone, as the rules demanded, it would hardly give Italy the support it needed. But the critical moment came when Lagarde was asked a question about the ECB\u2019s attitude to sovereign debt. Her <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-04-06/coronavirus-lagarde-s-810-billion-u-turn-came-in-just-4-weeks?srnd=premium\" title=\"\">response</a> was remarkable. \u201cWe are not here to close spreads,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not the function or the mission of the ECB. There are other tools for that, and there are other actors to actually deal with those issues.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpreads\u201d meant Italy. And what Lagarde seemed to be saying was that it was somebody else\u2019s problem. But if the ECB wasn\u2019t going to help Italy, who would? Did it really expect the other member states of the eurozone to string together a fiscal safety net for Italy? Obviously, given the bad blood between Italy and the northern Europeans, Lagarde had to walk a fine line. But with hundreds of people dying every day, with global financial markets in a state of repressed panic, was the ECB seriously suggesting that it would wait for Berlin, Paris and Rome to settle their differences before putting out the fire? It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ecb-announces-plan-to-help-eurozone-banks-withstand-coronavirus\" title=\"\">breathtaking</a>.</p> <p>For investors, Lagarde\u2019s comment came like a bolt of lightning. And within minutes, she started to backtrack. She went in front of the cameras to promise that the ECB would use the flexibility of its \u20ac120bn programme to prevent the fragmentation of the euro area \u2013 code for helping Italy. But the damage was done. The markets slumped, and the price that Italy had to pay to borrow leaped: averaged out, the spread moved by 0.65%. That may not sound like a big difference, but when applied to a mountain of debt the size of Italy\u2019s, it raises the interest bill by <a href=\"https://thegeneraltheorist.com/2020/03/15/loose-lips-cost-ships-lagardes-language-and-italys-eur14-billion-bill/\" title=\"\">as much as \u20ac14bn</a> for just one year. It was the last thing Italy needed. In a rare public rebuke, both Paris and Rome distanced themselves from the ECB. The crisis was pulling Europe further apart.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>After five terrifying days of market turmoil, the weekend of 14-15 March was a moment for central banks around the world to coordinate their response. What everyone wanted was dollars, so it was above all the Federal Reserve that needed to take the lead. And as its chair, Powell did. He called an unscheduled press conference for the afternoon of 15 March. What he announced was remarkable.</p> <p>With immediate effect, the Fed was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/15/federal-reserve-cuts-interest-rates-near-zero-prop-up-us-economy-coronavirus\" title=\"\">cutting interest rates to zero</a> \u2013 something it had done just once before, at the height of the crisis in 2008. To stabilise the US Treasury bonds market, it would be buying $700bn in a new round of so-called quantitative easing. And it would start big, buying $80bn by 17 March. In the space of just 48 hours, it would spend more on treasuries than the Fed spent in most months in the aftermath of 2008.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f17764cd536915f3b57efb88144f5c1a9dca6b32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f17764cd536915f3b57efb88144f5c1a9dca6b32/0_0_6240_4160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The New York Stock Exchange on 16 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The New York Stock Exchange on 16 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These were measures for the US economy. But the coronavirus was a global problem. The flight to safety and the ensuing rise in the dollar had put pressure on everyone who had borrowed in the US currency. So, to ensure that dollars could be piped to every financial institution in every major financial centre in the world, the Fed announced that it was <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-swaps/fed-increases-frequency-of-swap-line-operations-with-other-major-central-banks-idUKKBN21726G\" title=\"\">improving the terms</a> on the so-called liquidity swap lines \u2013 deals by which the major central banks agree to exchange dollars for sterling, euros, swiss francs and yen in unlimited amounts.</p> <p>Powell was deploying the main weapons of the 2008 crisis with far greater speed than his predecessors ever had. But it was still not enough. When the markets opened the next day, 16 March, the fall was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/16/markets-hit-by-further-losses-despite-us-interest-rate-cut-willie-walsh-ba-coronavirus\" title=\"\">vertiginous</a>. The circuit-breakers are supposed to come into effect if the market falls by more than 7%. That morning, the fall was so quick that the S&amp;P 500 dropped by 8.1% before trading could be stopped. The so-called fear index, VIX \u2013 a measure of market volatility \u2013 surged to levels last seen in the dark days of November 2008.</p> <p>The fear in the markets was now feeding on itself. If the Fed\u2019s magic of 2008 no longer worked, then what would?</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The foreign exchange market, where currencies are traded, is the biggest market in the world. And the place where the most transactions are booked is the City of London. On an average day, transactions back and forth total $6.6tn. But on Wednesday 18 March, there was only one trade: people wanted to sell everything. The only thing they wanted to buy were dollars. Every other currency was falling.</p> <p>The central banks\u2019 failure to calm the markets had set the stage for the worst days of the panic. Coronavirus cases were piling up in Europe more rapidly than at the peak of the crisis in Wuhan. Hedge funds were placing multi-billion-dollar bets that the recession in Europe would be protracted. Blue chip companies like Apple were facing stiff premiums to borrow for as little as three months ahead. Even gold, a classic safe haven, was selling.</p> <p>That Wednesday, on his third day as governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey organised a press conference in an effort at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/19/stock-markets-fall-ecb-coronavirus-stimulus-sterling-oil-prices-ftse-dollar-business-live?page=with:block-5e739e0d8f085c6327bc32ab#block-5e739e0d8f085c6327bc32ab\" title=\"\">reassurance</a>. But as he was speaking, sterling plunged by 5% to its lowest level since 1985. Meanwhile, the market for UK government bonds, also known as gilts \u2013 the oldest major asset market in the world \u2013 was witnessing unprecedented turmoil. It was, in Bailey\u2019s understated phrasing, \u201cbordering on the disorderly\u201d.</p> <p>In response, the Bank of England monetary policy committee met the next day in emergency session and announced that the Bank would be buying \u00a3200bn in gilts. Unlike in 2008, it would not be doing so on a prearranged schedule. As Bailey explained: \u201cWe will act in the markets promptly and rapidly as we see appropriate.\u201d This was no time for timetables. The central bank was, by its own admission, flying by the seat of its pants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9a2f52d27f5e8cae8f0fcceaee2c9c1738dda8aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a2f52d27f5e8cae8f0fcceaee2c9c1738dda8aa/0_61_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On an emergency conference call on the evening of 18 March, the ECB executive board decided that it, too, needed to act. Under a <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200318_1~3949d6f266.en.html\" title=\"\">pandemic</a> <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200318_1~3949d6f266.en.html\" title=\"\">emergency</a> <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200318_1~3949d6f266.en.html\" title=\"\">purchase</a> <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200318_1~3949d6f266.en.html\" title=\"\">programme</a>, it announced that it would begin by buying \u20ac750bn of government and corporate debt. But the ECB was willing to go even further than that. It said that, if necessary, it would revise some of its \u201cself-imposed limits\u201d.</p> <p>For an institution as hidebound as the ECB, this amounted to a revolution. Self-imposed limits \u2013 inflation targets, rules on which European government\u2019s debt it could buy and in what quantities \u2013 are what the ECB lives by. It is clear that conservative members of the bank\u2019s governing council <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/accounts/2020/html/ecb.mg200409_1~baf4b2ad06.en.html\" title=\"\">continued to resist such a move</a>. But in the end it was the turmoil in the markets that decided the issue. The ECB needed to send a signal of determination. If Lagarde had fluffed her \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d moment, the ECB was now at least promising to do whatever was necessary.</p> <p>By the end of the third week of March, 39 central banks around the world, from Mongolia to Trinidad, had lowered interest rates, eased banking regulations and set up special lending facilities. To ease the pressure on emerging markets, the Fed widened the network of liquidity swap lines to cover 14 major economies including Mexico, Brazil and South Korea. This was a remarkable wave of activism. But the pandemic itself was only beginning to bite. Central banks could cushion the financial shock, but not address the actual economic implosion, let alone the health crisis.</p> <p>European governments had been quick to move. Germany had thrown aside its fiscal caution and was committed to a <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.de/20200406/german-government-to-guarantee-100-percent-of-loans-to-smaller-firms-in-coronavirus-aid-package\" title=\"\">gigantic programme</a> of government guarantees for business lending. But this made all the more glaring the gap to Italy and Spain, which were not only hardest hit by the virus, but also constrained by the financial legacy of the eurozone crisis. They did not want to risk sliding back into a debt crisis.</p> <p>In the US, the Fed had leaped into action. But where were the politicians? Congress was distracted by the upcoming presidential election. What was needed was an unprecedented rescue package for an economy in freefall. How were Republicans and Democrats to reconcile fundamental differences over health care and unemployment insurance, or the notorious cronyism of the president and his clan? Since the Democrats had won control of the House of Representatives in 2018, legislation had been largely paralysed. Now, in the face of a tsunami of job losses, the two parties had to come to an agreement.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>As trading began in Asia early on the morning of Monday 23 March, the news from Washington made it clear that there had been no deal on Capitol Hill. The futures markets plunged so violently that circuit breakers were activated again \u2013 by now this had happened an unprecedented five times in two weeks. If it wanted to avoid a meltdown when Wall Street opened, the Fed would have to make another move.</p> <p>Until this point, Jerome Powell had been moving in the shadow of his predecessor, Ben Bernanke, who had been Fed chair in 2008. But by 23 March, Powell had activated all the basic elements of the 2008 repertoire \u2013 slashing interest rates, using quantitative easing, supporting money markets. But it had not worked, partly because it could not reach the source of the crisis itself \u2013 that is, the virus and the lockdown \u2013 and also because it was not reaching the bit of the credit system that was most vulnerable in 2020: the borrowing by big corporations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5bf09ffecba39cac687aba04e5611469e2d4e1e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bf09ffecba39cac687aba04e5611469e2d4e1e8/0_181_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Fed has always steered clear of corporate debt, which it considered politically sensitive. If you bought debt from individual firms, you were vulnerable to accusations of favouritism. If you bought a cross-section of debt you ended up holding many very poor-quality loans. But by the early hours of 23 March, it was clear that something had to be done to stabilise the corporate debt market. Since 2008, bonds issued by non-financial corporations have surged from $3.3tn to more than $6.5tn. If their value fell too far, US corporations would not only face shutdowns and a complete loss of revenue, but also a crippling credit squeeze.</p> <p>Ideally, the Fed would have made a grand announcement in conjunction with a Congressional stimulus package. But by the evening of 22 March, it was clear that the package being proposed by the Republicans was unacceptable to the Democrats. It might take days for them to square the difference. The financial markets would not wait.</p> <p>On 23 March, 90 minutes before markets opened, Powell made his move. He announced that the Fed was setting up legal entities \u2013 off the books of the Fed, but guaranteed by it \u2013 that would have the capacity to buy highly rated corporate debt, or at least any debt that the ratings agencies were still willing to declare investment-grade. In effect, the Fed was establishing itself as the backstop to the trillion-dollar corporate bond market. The Fed ramped up its asset-purchase programme, to an astonishing $375bn in Treasury securities and $250bn in mortgage securities in a single week.</p> <p>It was an extraordinary move to widen the scope of central bank intervention into the corporate economy. And it was understood as such by the markets. Since the start of the year, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones, as well as the FTSE 100, had lost 30% of their value. That day, they began to recover.</p> <p>Two days later, on 25 March, backing arrived from Congress when the Senate passed its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\" title=\"\">giant package of $2tn</a> \u2013 more than twice the size of the stimulus bill passed in 2009. It provided funds to top up unemployment insurance, to support small businesses and the US\u2019s privatised hospital system. Crucially, it also set aside $454bn to cover Fed losses. Since most loans would not be expected to go bad, this would enable the Fed to make more than $4tn in loans, if necessary.</p> <p>In the US, the public health campaign against the virus was still a shambles. But as far as economic policy was concerned, the full power of the American state was now being deployed behind the emergency programme. And the Fed was also acting as a provider of dollar liquidity to the world economy. In the UK, too, the Treasury and the Bank of England were working closely to link the huge increase in government spending to efforts to stabilise financial markets.</p> <p>But in the eurozone, that kind of coordination was lacking. The ECB had managed to stop the immediate panic. Yet there was still the question of whether the member states could come up with a financial plan to support their hardest-hit neighbours, Italy and Spain. The obvious solution was to issue debt jointly to fight the crisis together \u2013 an idea raised repeatedly during the eurozone crisis, when it had been bitterly resisted by a conservative northern European coalition led by Germany. This would ensure that Italy was not constrained by its pre-existing financial weakness.</p> <p>For a coalition of nine states led by France, Italy, Spain and Portugal, the case was obvious. On 25 March they called for a \u201ccommon debt instrument\u201d to fund a crisis response. The ECB threw itself energetically behind the proposal. But, once again, the Netherlands and Germany <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/11/eu-coronavirus-relief-deal-enemies-debt-eurozone\" title=\"\">refused to budge</a>. The issue was shoved off into the Eurogroup, a meeting of the eurozone\u2019s finance ministers, where the outline of a deal did finally emerge two weeks later. By then the immediate panic had passed. As Lagarde and her central banking colleagues had feared from the outset, it was on their shoulders that the stability of the eurozone continued to rest.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Will the massive financial firewalls built by central banks on both sides of the Atlantic be enough to withstand the bad news that is headed our way over the coming weeks and months? It is too early to tell. But the first test came on Thursday 26 March, when the US Department of Labor announced that, in a single week, 3.3 million Americans had signed on for unemployment insurance. It was completely unprecedented. A graph stretching back half a century simply turns upwards in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-unemployment-rate-coronavirus-business\" title=\"\">vertical surge</a>. In the next two weeks, another 13.5 million people would be added to the insurance rolls. And there was no end in sight. America is on pace for national unemployment to reach 30% by the summer \u2013 greater than during the Great Depression of the 1930s.</p> <p>The shutdown spelled disaster for millions of American families, at least half of whom have no financial reserves to speak of, and for businesses up and down the land. How would the markets react? Astonishingly, they ended 26 March up 5%. The largest surge in unemployment ever recorded in history was met with a relaxed shrug.</p> <p>Why weren\u2019t investors more terrified? Because the scale of Congressional stimulus made clear that, no matter how divided American politics were, that wouldn\u2019t stand in the way of a huge surge of spending. And the Fed, for its part, would make sure that the huge flow of new debt was absorbed, if necessary on to its own accounts. The private credit system, the government budget and the balance sheet of the Fed were welded together in a closed loop.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>What the Fed, the Bank of England and the ECB managed to do in March was prevent the damage caused by the shutdown being made even worse by an immediate collapse of corporate credit. At the same time, by stabilising sovereign debt markets, they have enabled a huge surge in public spending to fight the crisis and cushion its social and economic side effects. To do this they have both widened the safety net to parts of the financial system never before protected, and intervened on a scale far greater even than in 2008.</p> <p>In the final days of March, the Federal Reserve was buying Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at the rate of $83bn per day, or just shy of $1m per second. On 9 April, at the same moment as the latest horrifying unemployment numbers were released, it announced <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200409a.htm\" title=\"\">another $2.3</a><a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200409a.htm\" title=\"\">tn</a> in support targeted specifically at municipal debt and lower-grade corporate debt. That same day, the Bank of England adopted an even more radical approach. Rather than going through the process of having the Treasury issue debt that would then be bought by the central bank, it announced that it would be offering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/bank-of-england-to-finance-uk-government-covid-19-crisis-spending\" title=\"\">direct monetary finance</a> to the government, to provide it with whatever funding it needed. This would be temporary, but it was still a radical move. The government\u2019s current account at the Bank of England would be repurposed to allow, if necessary, tens of billions of pounds in coronavirus spending. The last time the British government resorted to this mechanism was at the height of the crisis in 2008.</p> <p>What we have seen in the financial system, over the past few weeks, is a victory of sorts \u2013 but it is a defensive one. Once again, we are propping up a fragile, profit-driven system to avoid something even worse. It is also a victory limited in scope.</p> <p>By flattening the curve of financial panic, the central banks of advanced economies have managed to ensure that life under the lockdown is not made even more unbearable by the shutting off of credit to business and households. They have also ensured that the public health response to Covid-19 can proceed at any scale that is required. Within Europe, there are questions about the differences between eurozone members: Germany has been able to deliver a conspicuously larger fiscal response to the crisis than have Italy or Spain. But those inequalities pale next to the problems facing much of the rest of the world. There the crucial supply of credit is being cut off even before coronavirus cases begin to mount, meaning, once again we have confirmed that the global financial system is hierarchical. At the apex stands the US Federal Reserve. The ECB, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England and their advanced-economy counterparts all enjoy the Fed\u2019s direct support. Thanks in no small part to that support, the advanced-economy central banks enjoy great latitude in propping up their credit systems. They might face moderate movements in their currency\u2019s exchange rate, but no devastating financial squeeze.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/how-will-the-world-emerge-from-the-coronavirus-crisis\">\u2018We can\u2019t go back to normal\u2019: how will coronavirus change the world?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That is what the emerging-market economies have been suffering since February.

  "<p>After the early and unedifying bog-roll panic, the real shortage of the pandemic became clear: flour. Dried yeast, inevitably, was the next casualty. Price gougers on eBay were quick off the mark; by the middle of last week, a 1.5kg bag of plain flour (usually about \u00a31.50) was going for \u00a319. A pot of yeast (normally 98p) was almost a tenner. As supermarket shelves emptied, corner shops came into their own. They had stocked these store-cupboard essentials all along \u2013 who knew?</p> <p>The problem is partly operational. About 96% of flour from large millers is produced in bulk for bakers and food manufacturing, and that demand has stayed relatively stable. Demand from home bakers may have doubled, but since it was only 4% of the total, it is not the flour that is lacking so much as the ability to package smaller units in greater numbers. Across the country, most mills are running at full capacity, 24 hours a day. They are producing 4m bags a week, whereas previously they were producing 2m \u2013 yet it is still not enough.</p> <p>Smaller mills \u2013 catering to artisanal and microbakeries, as well as offering online orders to domestic bakers \u2013 ran out of flour. John Lister, the managing director of <a href=\"https://www.shipton-mill.com/\">Shipton Mill</a> in Gloucestershire, was having a rare day off on Easter Sunday and described the firm\u2019s conundrum. \u201cThere is only one speed, and that\u2019s pretty slow. If you tried to speed it up, the flour would become like gravel.\u201d Whereas an industrial mill produces 20 tonnes an hour, Shipton deals in kilos. \u201cIn a week, we would normally get about 400 microbakeries, as well as home bakers, placing an order online. We had a hilarious situation where we woke up one morning three weeks ago and found 10,000 orders on our website. At first we were laughing, then we were crying. We had to close down the online shop, but we couldn\u2019t work out how to stop orders coming through. It was like a dyke with a hole in it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"45f38cfabef216a9b4f6fed0aec7abff83fd5006\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45f38cfabef216a9b4f6fed0aec7abff83fd5006/0_0_3541_5313/667.jpg\" alt=\"Shipton Mill wholemeal flour\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It is difficult for smaller mills such as Shipton Mill to increase output: \u2018There is only one speed, and that\u2019s pretty slow.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Ingram/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It may turn out that it is easiest to tackle the problem by supplying shops with larger-than-usual sizes for domestic use, although whether anyone\u2019s enthusiasm for sourdough holds up when faced with a 16kg sack of flour is \u2026 wait, what am I saying? People would love that. They would rehome pets just to make space for it.</p> <p>Bread-making has become our port in the storm. With the world turbulent, unpredictable and, above all else, outside our control, baking loaves has become not only an act of self-sufficiency, but also one of agency: you are creating a place where the old rules still work. But there is so much more to it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/06/jeanette-winterson-nigella-lawson-classic-cookbook\">Nigella Lawson</a>, the ur-baker of the modern era, who evangelised these skills at the end of the last century, when carbs and slow cooking had fallen out of fashion, understands the impulse. \u201cOne of the ways to interrupt anxiety is to let other senses take over,\u201d she says. \u201cTouching things, smelling something, listening. Baking really has so much of that, because when you\u2019re kneading dough, or you\u2019re stirring a bowl, you are really immersed in the world of the senses. And that\u2019s really very important, because otherwise you\u2019re trapped in your mind, and that isn\u2019t right now a very comfortable place.\u201d</p> <p>Baking gives your day a structure, and fills the bizarre acreage of time that some of us have with manageable yet important waypoints: perhaps you have to wait four hours for your sourdough to prove, but at least those four hours have a beginning and an end. The thing to fight in a lockdown is drift, the sense (as my brother said the other day) that there is no longer any AM or PM, just coffee time and wine time.</p> <p>Allied to this is the immense sense of achievement, greater that the simple loaf in front of you. Lawson quoted the marvellous 70s cookery writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/21/ofm-classic-cookbooks-margaret-costa-four-seasons-cookery-book\">Margaret Costa</a>, who was born during the first world war: \u201cIt makes the baker see herself in an almost biblical light, as a valiant woman, whose children shall rise up and call her blessed.\u201d</p> <p>Ah yes, those pesky kids. When you have four walls and even half that number of children, any activity that isn\u2019t just mess, waste or nihilism (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/05/cbeebies-the-clean-green-slightly-bonkers-world\">C</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/05/cbeebies-the-clean-green-slightly-bonkers-world\">Beebies</a>) takes on a magical quality. You can make biscuits, but that is an hour at most and a ton of sugar. Baking bread can kill the entire afternoon.</p> <p>Lawson says this is more than a practical pursuit, however: \u201cWe all have a nostalgia for the childhood we didn\u2019t have, and you\u2019re creating that idealised space, as well as occupying your kids and trying to keep back the panic you may feel.\u201d It is also \u2013 newsflash, social media show-offs \u2013 not very difficult. \u201cWhen I wanted to do [her cookbook How to Be a] Domestic Goddess, everyone said to me: \u2018But no one bakes any more.\u2019 I think, for a lot of us who grew up cooking, we thought baking was something arcane and difficult. It\u2019s actually much easier. It\u2019s so much less frenetic. There tend to be fewer things going on than when you\u2019re cooking a meal and have this proliferation of pans.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All bread bakers feel united. People are baking bread in many different languages</p> <footer> <cite>Nigella Lawson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was working up a theory about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-great-british-bake-off\">The Great British Bake Off</a> being very closely allied to the Keep Calm and Carry On nostalgia aesthetic, so that, in a national crisis, baking becomes this quasi-patriotic act. Lawson quickly scotches all that. \u201cI think it\u2019s the opposite. All bread bakers feel united. People are baking bread in many different languages.\u201d This is why I admire Lawson. </p> <p>The place of bread in culture may have changed over the course of history, but it has never lost its resonance, as the food historian Polly Russell says. \u201cThe Assize of Bread and Ale in 1266 was one of the first food-supply regulations, basically adjusting the price of bread according to the price of wheat. It was to prevent people \u2013 bakers and millers \u2013 from profiteering, and it was socially crucial, because a labourer would be spending about half of their weekly income on bread. When prices go up, tensions go up very quickly as well.\u201d</p> <p>While there is no modern corollary in food, there is an obvious one in fossil fuels, with political parties vying to peg the wholesale price of gas to the retail price. Pre-industrialisation, bread was society\u2019s fuel and, as such, the driver of civil disorder: the French Revolution and the English bread riots of the 1790s are indistinguishable in provenance, even though their separate outcomes have given them very different profiles. The punishment for fraudulent bakers, who shortchanged their customers by swapping in sawdust or whatnot, was to be dragged by a horse, with the offending loaf tied round their neck \u2013 a testimony to the deadly seriousness of the baking business. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"744e41388845d6f0e971b0661f8583806b9d4fa5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/744e41388845d6f0e971b0661f8583806b9d4fa5/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Loaf of brown bread\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Chorleywood process made white bread cheap and brown bread less so, ending the centuries-old association of brown loaves with poverty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Apomares/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Long after we discovered other, more earth-shattering, fuels, the centrality of the loaf to the nation\u2019s wellbeing persisted. Russell continues: \u201cQuite recently, in the second world war and afterwards, there was the national loaf, which was a rationing manoeuvre.\u201d The loaf, introduced in 1942 and abolished in 1956, had a higher level of wheat extraction, so it contained more bran and grain \u2013 this not only stretched out wheat supplies, but meant the loaf was more nutritious, if denser, she says. This drab, wholemeal, stolid loaf became the symbol of this drab, wholemeal, stolid life. \u201cIt became associated with people feeling depressed,\u201d says Russell.</p> <p>For seven or eight centuries, white bread was associated with the rich and brown bread with the poor. This flipped in the 60s with the advent of mass production and the Chorleywood process, a method of bulk fermentation that speeds everything up, producing delicious squishy white processed bread that plays havoc with your guts. Thenceforth, white bread was cheap, brown bread less so. In this crisis, we have gone back to first principles \u2013 many people prefer the white brea they have made themselves. It is a great leveller.</p> <p>Some of this is idealised: for one, I don\u2019t find making bread as easy as all that. Homemade bread can be very solid, especially sourdough (Russell\u2019s tip: make sure your starter culture is lively enough by dropping a spoonful of it into water before you start; it should float). Also, my children don\u2019t rise up and call me blessed. They rise up and call me boomer. Yet the loaf has such an important place in our psyche: through it we can trace our society back to its first markets, its earlier moral contracts; making it, we can imagine ourselves back in control, providing for our families, passing on our knowledge; experimenting with it, we can briefly fancy ourselves chemists. It is a still point in a turning world. And you can eat it.</p>",

The series has inspired the sort of frantic online rabbit-holing not seen since the glory days of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/lost\">Lost</a>. It\u2019s the show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/westworld--episode-by-episode\">Westworld</a> wishes it was. Its reception in the US has shown what British viewers can expect when it begins on BBC Two this week: give it enough time and it will consume your every waking thought.</p> <p>And yet the strangest thing about Devs is that the beating heart of this very serious show is Nick Offerman. Yes, Nick Offerman from comedy. Nick Offerman from <a href=\"https://offermanwoodshop.com/\">woodwork</a>. Nick Offerman from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/14/how-we-made-parks-and-recreation-amy-poehler-nick-offerman-mike-schur\">Parks and Recreation</a>, the satirical US series about an Indiana town\u2019s parks department in which he played Ron Swanson, the libertarian, anti-government boss striving to make his department as ineffective as possible.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have a lot of experience of making people laugh. But also making them cringe, vomit and sob</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Speaking from his home in LA, where he\u2019s under lockdown, Offerman seems as surprised about this career turn as anyone. \u201cAny farm boy like myself, that packed up and went off to theatre school, is chasing the dream of working with a person like Alex,\u201d he says. \u201cI was working at my woodwork shop when I got the call that he wanted to meet with me, and I teared up a little bit. In my world, it was not expected that someone like Alex would turn his gaze in my direction.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, it\u2019s perfect casting. Offerman plays Forest, a conspiratorial tech CEO so ravaged with grief for his dead daughter that he\u2019s built a giant statue of her on the grounds of his campus. Amaya, his quantum computing company, is being investigated by engineer Lily Chan, who believes it is responsible for the disappearance of her boyfriend. Although Forest starts the series as an out-and-out villain (and it\u2019s great to see Offerman use his physical heft for something other than excessive meat consumption), we gradually see a more humane side as we understand the rationale for his time-bending invention.</p> <p>How does he feel about the central theme, the question of whether we live in a deterministic universe? \u201cI love ruminating about the big existential questions,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I was brought up in a family of salt-of-the-earth public servants, in the middle of Illinois, in the middle of America. I can wrap my head around the science of determinism, but in my everyday life, it\u2019s the last thing I can think about because I\u2019m usually in the middle of choosing the sandwich I\u2019ll be having for lunch \u2013 and then the slightly larger, warmer sandwich I\u2019ll be having for dinner.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a60c59d997dd881e0a9aa4663c095394a0bed751\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a60c59d997dd881e0a9aa4663c095394a0bed751/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alison Pill and Nick Offerman in Devs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Big questions \u2026 Alison Pill and Nick Offerman in Devs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raymond Liu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a very Offerman answer, rooted in both good-hearted Americana and food. Time and time again during our interview, he\u2019ll return to these twin wells, bringing up the morals that were instilled in him by his family and comparing TV reviews to various types of fast food (\u201cWho put gruyere in this cheeseburger? Are you insane? One star!\u201d).</p> <p>Offerman, 49, was born in the tiny village of Minooka to a mother who was a nurse and a father who taught social studies at high school. He\u2019s one of four children and much of his growing up was done on a soybean farm, which is just the sort of quirky background detail that could belong to his most famous character. In fact, if you close your eyes, you feel like you could be talking to Ron Swanson. And this might be becoming a problem.</p> <p>Although Parks and Recreation finished half a decade ago, people still have a tendency to see Offerman through the lens of Swanson. It\u2019s understandable \u2013 the character incorporated many of Offerman\u2019s traits: his flair for woodwork, his talent with a saxophone and his outward projection of gruff manliness. It\u2019s a comparison that Offerman has played up, with books like <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/314287/paddle-your-own-canoe-by-nick-offerman/\">Paddle Your Own Canoe</a> and a standup tour called <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/70299862\">American Ham</a>. But enough is enough. On his most recent comedy tour, Offerman took to singing a song entitled I\u2019m Not Ron Swanson, which contained the lines: \u201cHe can eat a big-ass steak for every single meal / \u2019Cause his colon is fictitious, while mine is all too real.\u201d</p> <p>Was the song born of frustration? \u201cIt\u2019s a little complicated,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause people want to conflate me with Ron Swanson\u2019s politics. He\u2019s a staunch libertarian, and I\u2019m interested in everybody having healthcare or being paid a living wage. When I used to look at social media more closely, there would be angry fans saying, \u2018I brought my shotgun to your comedy show and it turns out you\u2019re a total snowflake.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6b6044b9498521f77c7d22ea207a2de46a96cbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6b6044b9498521f77c7d22ea207a2de46a96cbc/39_76_2655_1593/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2026 alongside Amy Poehler in Parks and Recreation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green shoots of genius \u2026 alongside Amy Poehler in Parks and Recreation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In truth, the two are poles apart. Offerman took two semesters of ballet. He toured Japan doing kabuki theatre. He repeatedly refers to himself as the black sheep of the family, who cries easily and believes Yoko Ono <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpCQ5yWUx7g\">is a misunderstood genius</a>. He\u2019s thoughtful and articulate on gender and race, and very concerned with the issue of sustainable food.</p> <p>There were other downsides to playing Swanson, too. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go to a restaurant. No matter what I ordered, they would put an inch-thick layer of bacon on my plate. I\u2019d order a cheeseburger and they\u2019d make me a one-pound cheeseburger. And I would give them a thumbs-up and hear my cardiologist screaming in my head.\u201d</p> <p>Yet there have always been many sides to Offerman. As well as the tours, the books (four in seven years), his parallel career running a woodshop in LA, and the <a href=\"https://www.earwolf.com/show/in-bed-with-nick-offerman-and-megan-mullally/\">intimate podcast</a> he and his wife Megan Mullally host from their bed, Offerman has amassed a wildly varied filmography. There has been voice work in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/14/ice-age-collision-course-review\">Ice Age</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/13/the-lego-movie-review\">Lego</a> movies, prestigious Oscar bait in the form of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/19/the-founder-review-michael-keaton-mcdonalds-biopic\">The Founder</a>, and such heartfelt little indie films as 2018\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/03/hearts-beat-loud-review-warm-indie-drama\">Hearts Beat Loud</a>. Then there are TV appearances in Curb Your Enthusiasm, Will &amp; Grace and Fargo.</p> <p>\u201cI come from theatre,\u201d he says, referring to Defiant Theater, the experimental Chicago company he co-founded in the early 1990s, winning rave reviews for productions that included everything from Shakespeare to Stephen King. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a street theatre actor, that means you try to perform in a myriad of genres. Whatever\u2019s on that season. So you might do a Sam Shepard play, then maybe a musical. I have a lot of experience on stage of making people laugh certainly \u2013 but also making people cringe, vomit and sob.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Devs feels like his greatest leap so far. It\u2019s a tremendous performance that sees Offerman shuttling between menace, vulnerability, goofiness and outright terror. Perhaps most impressive is the way that, as of a character who can see the future and therefore can never be surprised, he\u2019s able to give such a relatable human performance. Given its themes, the show is bound to alienate as many people as it beguiles \u2013 something Offerman seems fully aware of.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a great novel,\u201d he says. \u201cWith a lot of people you can say, \u2018Oh, you should read this Murakami book.\u2019 And they\u2019ll say, \u2018Are you insane? What is this Windup Bird Chronicle? This is madness.\u2019 But then there will be 15% of people that say, \u2018Oh my god, that was the best book I\u2019ve ever read.\u2019 There is a quote I wear on my sleeve that goes, \u2018If you\u2019re not offending 33% of your audience, then it\u2019s not art.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f23da1707ab1decf615009f6337849863d42b54b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f23da1707ab1decf615009f6337849863d42b54b/259_594_2922_1753/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2026 Offerman (right) with Karl Glusman in Devs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beguiling \u2026 Offerman (right) with Karl Glusman in Devs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raymond Liu/BBC/FX Networks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This does not seem like a particularly optimal time to be promoting a TV series, with the world gripped by coronavirus. Does it feel strange? \u201cWell, it does,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, everything is kind of strange. For those of us whose work involves outputting any sort of content to an audience, everything has to be couched with sensitivity to the tragedy unfolding all around us.</p> <p>\u201cFortunately, the greater percentage of us will get through this. A lot of people are suffering and perishing at the hands of the deadly virus. But there are exponentially more people suffering and dying because of the incredible bed-shitting that our administration has performed. The failure \u2013 the face-plant of our government in the face of this pandemic \u2013 has been unbelievably embarrassing and shameful. And continues to be so. I mean, that sad clown just continues to dance and bleat as though the stock market will somehow save him from the incredibly gory butcher\u2019s bill he is being presented with.\u201d</p> <p>He takes a breath. \u201cBut to answer your question, I\u2019m glad \u2013 because I think our show is just magnificent.\u201d</p> <p>Offerman is a reassuring man to talk to in a crisis. There\u2019s a lot of solace to be had in his mixture of political fury and good-natured idealism. \u201cAs an eternal optimist,\u201d he says, \u201cmy hope is that something might come out of this time of reflection, where we\u2019re all being made to hold still for a while. Perhaps when it\u2019s over, we will walk outside and look at a tree, or reacquaint ourselves with squirrels and birds in our neighbourhood, and say, \u2018Oh, there is beauty, there is worth, there is incredible value to the world and to life. And it doesn\u2019t come through my phone, it doesn\u2019t come through consumerism, it doesn\u2019t come from capitalism.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Another deep breath. \u201cI had the good fortune of growing up in a frugal and loving family, so I understood that we can have a beautiful and rewarding life without having three Porsches in the garage. Having three Porsches is not actually that great, because you have to pay to maintain three Porsches. But if you instead get together with your family and build a canoe or a rowboat, you only need one of those. And you can have fun all year.\u201d</p> <p>What a total snowflake.</p> <ul> <li><p>Devs starts on BBC Two at 9pm on Wednesday 15 April.</p></li> </ul>",

Hong Kong issues tracking wristbands to international arrivals that connect to a StayHomeSafe mobile app and a registered \u201cquarantine address\u201d, while Singapore\u2019s TraceTogether app, which uses Bluetooth to find people within two metres of someone diagnosed with Covid-19 for half an hour or more, has been made open source to allow other countries to copy it.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/nhs-coronavirus-app-memo-discussed-giving-ministers-power-to-de-anonymise-users\">NHS coronavirus app: memo discussed giving ministers power to 'de-anonymise' users</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Contact-tracing has been especially effective in South Korea, which has employed GPS data, CCTV footage and and credit card records to identify and warn suspected victims of the disease. But the country\u2019s surveillance push would not have been effective without widespread testing, experts said, allowing officials to quickly confirm new coronavirus cases.</p> \n<p>The adoption of tracing apps and other electronic surveillance measures has become a live issue of concern in Brussels, where member states have been warned of the risk to the EU\u2019s \u201cfundamental rights and freedoms\u201d.</p> \n<p>Authorities in Poland, the Netherlands, Spain, Ireland and the UK have all either expressed an interest or started to roll out mobile phone apps to help them track and trace those infected with the virus.</p> \n<p>The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced plans on Sunday for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/nhs-coronavirus-app-memo-discussed-giving-ministers-power-to-de-anonymise-users\">Bluetooth-based app</a> that will warn users if they have recently been in close proximity to someone suspected to be infected with the coronavirus.

Officials last month said they would use mobile apps, employ CCTV cameras with facial recognition, QR codes, mobile phone data and credit card records in a digital surveillance menu that opposition members had termed a \u201ccybergulag\u201d.</p> \n<p>Most quarantine violations are, however, still exposed by physical surveillance, meaning police patrols and roadblocks on the streets. Pavel Chikov of the Agora International Human Rights Group noted that a more sophisticated system could be \u201ctoo expensive\u201d for many of the country\u2019s regions to employ. In Tatarstan, an SMS permission system looked suspiciously similar to a local parking app, suggesting the government may just have adapted the technology.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>When Moscow did finally roll out its QR-code system this week, the website quickly crashed, and remained down on Monday morning.

As the nation began Holy Week, Hardalias chastised priests and bishops who continued to hold services in violation of the recommendations of the Holy Synod, the church\u2019s ruling body, and government orders for \u201cputting people\u2019s lives in danger\u201d. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThey must finally understand that they are not more Christian than the rest,\u201d he said insisting that this Easter would be different, with Greeks staying at home so that the country \u201ccould break the virus\u2019 chain of transmission\u201d. </p> \n  <p>Rogue clerics have been increasingly in the government\u2019s sights amid reports of clerics opening church doors despite the nationwide ban. In a startling snub, for which he has shown no remorse, the Bishop of Corfu, Nektarios, held a service on the island at the weekend attended by a local mayor, a senior municipal councillor and at least three other people. The rite of Holy Communion was also conducted, as is tradition in the Orthodox church, from a shared chalice. The bishop, who was forced to appear before a public prosecutor today, will be tried, along with the two officials who attended the service, on 25 May.

warning that as much effort must be made to fight the virus in care homes as in the NHS, <strong>Robert Booth</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s social affairs correspondent, writes.<br></p> \n  <p>Snapshot data from varying official sources shows that in Italy, Spain, France, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland\">Ireland</a> and Belgium 42%-57% of deaths from the virus have been happening in care homes, according to a report by academics based at the London School of Economics.</p> \n  <p>Published official data for deaths in care homes in England and Wales are believed to significantly underestimate fatalities in the care sector, with the Office for National Statistics currently only accounting for 20 Covid-related deaths in all care homes in the week ending 27 March. Fresh figures are due out on Tuesday, but are unlikely to be be up to date.</p> \n  <p>Last week, the industry body Care England told the Guardian the figure was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/covid-19-hundreds-of-uk-care-home-deaths-not-added-to-official-toll\">likely to be approaching 1,000</a>, with deaths reaching into double figures at numerous homes. Over the weekend, fresh death tolls emerged, including 12 fatalities of residents at the 71-capacity Stanley Park care home in County Durham.
