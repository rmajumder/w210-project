  "<p>The traffic has left Katie Dahlon in an unusually good mood. It usually takes her 56 minutes to reach her home in the Pico-Robertson neighborhood in Los Angeles from her work in Santa Monica when she leaves at 5pm. Yesterday, it took 23 minutes. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy,\u201d says Dahlson. \u201cThe sidestreets aren\u2019t that different, but the 10 freeway is empty.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/california-coronavirus-shelter-in-place-bay-area\">California: millions told to 'shelter-in-place' to stop spread of coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She\u2019s not the only one commenting on the unnatural quietude of commuting in Los Angeles.

Officials are also banning gatherings of over 50 people following a recommendation made by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday.</p> <p>All of this means the freeways appear cleared out. Travel is all about something called derived demand, UCLA transportation researcher <a href=\"https://luskin.ucla.edu/person/michael-manville\">Michael Manville</a> says. \u201cBasically, we don\u2019t hop in our cars for the fun of it. We go because there\u2019s a destination calling to us \u2013 for work, for leisure, to see our friends, and so on.\u201d</p> <p>In addition, a relatively small proportional reduction in travel can lead to a large increase in speed,\u201d Manville says. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the case that the amount of reduction in travel is less than it seems to the naked eye,\u201d he adds.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/california-governor-directs-all-bars-nightclubs-wineries-close-coronavirus\">California governor directs all bars and nightclubs to close as coronavirus spreads</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a nutshell, it\u2019s those last few vehicles getting on a road that slow everyone down. If you don\u2019t have those, the overall speed goes up quite a bit, and the volume does too. Manville says he\u2019s waiting to see sensor data from the California department of transportation, but it\u2019s probably likely that both the number of trips is declining and people are experiencing fewer bottlenecks on the roadways.</p> <p>This experience is unlikely to reshape Angelenos\u2019 relationship to the road, even when things eventually go back to normal, Manville says. That\u2019s because the roads primarily play a mediating role between us and the places we want to go. \u201cIt would be one thing if we were under an order to still go to places, but not in cars \u2013 some of us would find we like walking or biking. But there\u2019s no reason to think we will develop a different travel habit while we\u2019re sitting on our couches.\u201d</p> <p>The past few weeks have demonstrated how relatively small reductions in cars can generate big increases in road performances, Manville adds. Even when just a few businesses asked workers to stay home, congestion was down quite a bit. \u201cThat has lessons for us, because it does remind us that when things get back to normal, policies that nudge just a few people away from a trip at a busy time can have a huge impact.\u201d</p>",

We must not kid ourselves, these are the first steps in a temporary, but long fight.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>But the ministers are facing calls to go much further, such as developing an EU-wide stimulus package and making available an EU credit line to indebted countries.</strong></p> <p>In an open letter, Socialist and Democrat MEPs, the second-largest group in the European parliament, call for \u201ca proper stimulus package agreed at the European level\u201d, financed by the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone bailout fund. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We call for a European-wide COVID-19 Economic Recovery Plan, with a consolidated and coherent strategy for the rapid mobilisation of the different available EU instruments to support people, SMEs and businesses. </p> <p>This must include the European Central Bank, the European Investment Fund, the European Stability Mechanism and other banking union tools. The sooner this is done the better, so we can limit the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19. </p> </blockquote> <p>Green MEPs have delivered a similar message, but put emphasis on accelerating the European Green Deal, a sweeping plan to transform Europe\u2019s economy to drastically reduce emissions. </p> <p>They write:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The economic challenge that represents the Coronavirus outbreak has also to be seen as an opportunity to undertake in the context of the EU Green deal an urgent reorientation of the EU economy as the current crisis reveals the fragility of a carbon-intensive system built on highly interconnected and specialised global supply chains.</p> </blockquote> <p>Both groups want an EU-backed credit line for indebted countries, intended to prevent markets betting against countries such as Italy will be forced to borrow more to deal with the crisis.</p> <p><strong>But not everyone is convinced now is the time for a general stimulus package.</strong></p> <p>Clemens Fuest, president of the ifo institut and adviser to the German government, told the Observer that encouraging social consumption makes \u201cno sense\u201d when people are being discouraged from going to bars and restaurants.</p> <p>He said eurozone ministers should issue \u201ca general signal of solidarity\u201d i.e a statement of support to indebted countries, rather than a precautionary credit line. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6f8ed58f088d757559447a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T14:54:32.160Z\">2.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Dow now at its lowest since 2017</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Dow Jones industrial average has now slumped to its lowest since spring 2017.</strong></p> <p>Having almost hit 30,000 points in February, it has now shed roughly 30% of its value in the last month -- down to around 21,000.</p> <p>This means that much of the gains racked up under Donald Trump (and boasted about by the president) have been wiped out by Covid-19:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ac0f449a4211b808cd741cb22be8a7c563e3c37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ac0f449a4211b808cd741cb22be8a7c563e3c37/0_0_1379_587/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Dow over the last five years\" width=\"1000\" height=\"426\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Dow over the last five years</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Refinitiv</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6f8f5b8f088d7575594482\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T14:42:41.903Z\">2.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The markets have completely lost faith in the idea that the global economy could bounce back from the shock of Covid-19.</strong></p> <p>Instead, they seem to be pricing in a slump - followed by stagnation.

Since then, a growing number of firms and individuals have changed their travel behaviour, with greater numbers of people working from home. This has led to an acceleration in the reduction in passenger numbers to around 19% on London Underground and 10% on buses compared to the same week the previous year, with days later in the week showing reductions larger than that average.</p> <p>This is an evolving situation and the financial impact is difficult to predict.

  "<p>A week is a long time in a coronavirus pandemic. Within days of Boris Johnson and his advisers announcing that anyone with symptoms of a cold should stay at home for seven days but otherwise live life as normal, the prime minister came out with a series of bombshells that will effectively confine most of the population to their homes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/life-lockdown-parma-italy-coronavirus\">Orderly, dour, cowed: how my beloved Italy is changed by coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What changed was new data on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/italian-doctor-an-experience-i-would-compare-to-a-world-war\">the impact of Italy\u2019s out-of-control epidemic on its health service</a>. Basically, it is catastrophic, with 30% of hospitalised patients having to be admitted to intensive care. The teams of modellers at Imperial College and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who advise government <a href=\"http://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/196137/crunching-numbers-coronavirus/\">crunched those numbers</a> \u2013 and the death toll and pressure on the NHS that came out were unacceptable.</p> <p>Prof Neil Ferguson at Imperial College\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis\">MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis</a> and colleagues found that the mitigation strategy, as they called it \u2013 or scenario 1 \u2013 that the government had just announced would lead to 260,000 deaths. That would be not just deaths from the virus, but from other illnesses that the NHS would be too hard-pressed to treat.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/\">Their modelling looked at all the interventions</a> that might help drive down the infections and deaths. There were five, they said, that would have an impact:</p> <p>\u2022 isolating people with a cough and temperature at home for seven days.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/checklist-zip/giv-3902ZJMvttImTJct\" data-alt=\"Graphic - how the UK's policy compares with other European countries'\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/checklist-zip/giv-3902ZJMvttImTJct\">Graphic - how the UK's policy compares with other European countries'</a> </figure>  <p>\u2022 quarantining families where somebody has symptoms for 14 days, to allow time for any symptoms in the others to show.</p> <p>\u2022 social distancing, involving cutting the normal contacts people make at home, school or work by three-quarters.</p> <p>\u2022 social distancing for everyone over 70, by asking them to stay at home.</p> <p>\u2022 closure of schools and universities.</p> <p>Last week\u2019s mitigation strategy was about people staying home for seven days with symptoms. It was said that quarantine for families plus keeping the over-70s at home would probably follow. That package would reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and cut deaths by half. But, the researchers said, \u201cthe resulting epidemic would still likely result in 260,000 deaths and therefore overwhelm the health system (most notably intensive care units)\u201d.</p> <p>So now we have scenario 2, which the modellers call suppression. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/pm-tells-britons-to-avoid-non-essential-contact-with-others\">It takes things much further</a>, adopting all the measures except closing schools and universities. And school closures, said Ferguson, are probably also on the cards before too long.</p> <p>Ferguson and his colleague Prof Azra Ghani liken the new measures to China\u2019s actions, which succeeded in driving down the epidemic to very low numbers. But unlike in China, anything that happens in the UK will be voluntary. The government will need population buy-in for this to work.</p> <p>The bad news is that although it will keep death rates down to 20,000 or possibly just a few thousand, said Ferguson, we are looking at these social curbs through to July or August \u2013 and even when the brakes are taken off, they may have to be slammed back on again. The virus will not have disappeared and could resurge. Only a small proportion of the population will have been infected, recovered and become immune.</p> <p>The government\u2019s earlier hopes that it could rely on large proportions \u2013 maybe 60% \u2013 of the population getting ill, getting better and becoming immune <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/herd-immunity-will-the-uks-coronavirus-strategy-work\">to build up some herd immunity</a> in the UK population \u2013 something many experts thought was dangerous \u2013 are dashed by the new strategy.</p> <p>Herd immunity is normally created by vaccinating large numbers of children, safeguarding those who cannot be inoculated. Nobody has ever tried to do that by allowing infection with a disease before \u2013 and now, it appears to have been recognised that it\u2019s not safe to try.</p>",
  "<p>Sevilla midfielder \u00d3liver Torres was at home making dinner when the match he had looked forward to more than any other was supposed to be kicking off, a \u201cmagic moment\u201d that didn\u2019t arrive. Across the city that hosts the biggest, noisiest derby there is, the Real Betis goalkeeper Joel Robles was preparing food and bed for his daughter, who is six months old. For 90 minutes, they like to say, the whole of Seville stops. This time it stopped for much longer, and so did the rest of Spain. How much longer, no one knows.</p> \n<p>Torres and Robles were due to face each other on Sunday night, but the S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n stood empty and so did the streets, bar the occasional police car passing to ensure no-one was out. The country was on lockdown because of coronavirus. There was effectively a curfew only this one was all hours and so they, like everyone else, were stuck at home. Betis striker Borja Iglesias and Sevilla defender Sergio Reguil\u00f3n, though, did face each other: from their sofas, online and on Fifa, they played the derby. Broadcast live, Betis won and Borja scored, which was convenient.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/15/ezequiel-garay-among-five-involved-with-valencia-positive-for-coronavirus\">Ezequiel Garay among five Valencia staff found to be positive for coronavirus</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Sixty thousand people tuned in to watch. There was nothing else to do.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest game of the year, for the city, for all our fans, and it would have started at nine,\u201d Torres said. \u201cI\u2019m at home, thinking about what might have been,. What I would be feeling, what would have been happening, all those people supporting you. You miss football anyway, so imagine a game like this. This was a magic moment for me: it was going to be the first time I lived the Seville derby at the Pizju\u00e1n.\u201d</p> \n<p>But the stadium, like all the rest, was empty. Like everywhere, in fact. In Madrid, children had been sent home from class on Wednesday and soon the rest of the country followed. Schools and stadiums: made to be full, noisy and alive, there may be no building on earth that feels more wrong when there\u2019s no one inside, like skeletons. Kids were off school and it was sunny out so to start with they went where they were always going to go. Which meant that the next day, parks were closed too.

Valencia have five positive cases, three of them players: Ezequiel Garay, Jos\u00e9 Luis Gay\u00e1 and Eliaquim Mangala. Alav\u00e9s have two among the staff: the players will all be tested on Monday. It\u2019s not in their hands.

At first some, lamentably, seemed to be treating it as such. Some departed cities heading for the coast. No more. There are army vehicles on the roads. This is real, even if it remains surreal. The numbers are terrifying \u2013 not least because no one believes they are the real numbers. How could they be? And how, and when, does this end?</p> \n<p>It sounds daft but you don\u2019t expect the apocalypse on a glorious sunny day. It was lovely out, but you couldn\u2019t be there. Police cars circulated slowly. Take the rubbish out, spend 30 seconds beyond the confines of your front door, and you feel like a fugitive so you scurry home fast. That was Sunday \u2013 although a lot of it broke down again on Monday as many made their way to \u201cessential\u201d work, making so much of the weekend\u2019s precaution seem pointless.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c9b20c45-fe7e-40fc-bc93-679d828e8f24\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Everyone was inside. Spain is also the noisiest country in the world, or so they say, which made the silence louder. \u201cThese are strange days,\u201d Torres says. \u201cIt creates a kind of psychosis because you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on and you\u2019ve never experienced a situation like this.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some came together even as they were forced apart. All across the country there are videos of blocks where from balconies and windows they sing songs, play games, shout across to each other. At 10pm on Saturday and Sunday, what would have been half time in Celta-Villarreal and the Seville derby, people came to their balconies and applauded doctors, nurses and health professionals, underpaid and underresourced heroes.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/16/bundesliga-coronavirus-crisis-german-football\">Bundesliga attempts to cover all bases in ever-changing crisis landscape | Andy Brassell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Text messages are filled with daft jokes \u2013 which quickly dry up when positives are confirmed in the group \u2013 as well as books to read, films to watch, series to download, things to do. Friends made great suggestions that will be enjoyable discoveries. Self-discovery too, perhaps. Is it silly to think we might be better after this? But, then, concentrating isn\u2019t easy when that phone is there at your side, news coming in, getting worse by the minute.</p> \n<p>Could that sporting addiction even be broken, football\u2019s grip slipping? Unlikely, and the evidence so far suggests not. It\u2019s too easy to say sport doesn\u2019t matter: it does matter, it does mean something, if only because we ascribe it meaning. It takes you someplace better. It fills our lives, and without it there is a hole there. Right now, everyone could so with something to fill that space. And football tried, even in the absence of games.</p> \n<p>On Saturday, Legan\u00e9s live-tweeted their match against Valladolid \u2013 a huge relegation six-pointer which didn\u2019t happen. It was a public service broadcast, designed to send a message too. Legan\u00e9s won, which Valladolid suspected they would and which they could afford to laugh about after, 90 minutes filled with something enjoyably silly.</p> \n<p>\u00d3scar scored the winner, \u201ctaking advantage of the social distancing\u201d advised because of the virus. The VAR intervened almost 30 times. Cadena Ser radio released commentary of the goal that wasn\u2019t and AS wrote a match report, thanking Legan\u00e9s for the laughs. God knows, everyone needed it. Other clubs did similar things, social media taking them into homes that people couldn\u2019t leave. Real Oviedo replayed their 1992 win over Madrid. Better times.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"db57c6ac-ff46-42b4-a4e6-abbb8a2f834b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lJX1IKXHDIM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Asked how he was getting on, the captain of a first division club said: \u201cday one, fine \u2026 let\u2019s see on day 15.\u201d Another admitted he was climbing the walls already. Like anyone else, footballers get bored, maybe even more so. Sportsmen don\u2019t do sedentary. So, what do they do? \u201cWatch series, read a bit, try to find a way of making use of the time,\u201d Torres says.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy daughter keeps me entertained,\u201d Robles says, \u201cbut it\u2019s hard to get your mind around that you\u2019ll be stuck inside for 15 days, or more; it\u2019s not easy. I\u2019m on Netflix and films and watching a lot of telly, just like anyone. I\u2019ve been going out onto the balcony too. You\u2019ve got to get some air, a bit of sunshine. It\u2019s not good to be indoors on the sofa all day.\u201d</p> \n<p>Clubs have sent training programmes. Legan\u00e9s even made theirs open to the public, the fitness coach Pol Llorente leading online sessions each morning. It\u2019s fun and the players are getting involved, joking and winding each other up, but it\u2019s not the same of course.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s important not to lose muscle tone so you do some aerobic work, keep your strength up, because we have to be ready if and when they tell us we\u2019re starting again,\u201d Robles says. There\u2019s no goalkeeper training as such but it won\u2019t be long, he laughs, before he reaches the point when he gets his girlfriend to throw a ball at him and he\u2019s diving across the living room, making saves on the sofa.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have to be responsible, look after ourselves, train as best we can,\u201d says Torres. \u201cAnd that includes your mind \u2013 that\u2019s important. The main thing is listen to the health authorities and stay at home because if they say that\u2019s the best thing, it\u2019s the best thing. It\u2019s a real pity to miss the derby but we have to work at home and be ready because hopefully it will be back \u2013 and we have to be back too.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It wasn\u2019t anything close to the nationwide online coronavirus triage and testing tool that Donald Trump had promised. But on Sunday evening, a <a href=\"https://www.projectbaseline.com/study/covid-19/\">website</a> allowing residents of two northern California counties to enter symptoms and, if eligible, make an appointment for coronavirus testing went live.</p> <p>By Monday morning, however, the project by Verily \u2013 a sister company to Google under the corporate umbrella of Alphabet \u2013 had reached capacity, and users were informed that no more testing appointments were available.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"052734a0884eccb0ad172b6e64368d9eb52720f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/052734a0884eccb0ad172b6e64368d9eb52720f3/0_0_2368_1568/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Verily\u2019s Prokect Baseline COVID-19 testing tool.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Verily\u2019s Prokect Baseline COVID-19 testing tool.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Verily</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The site\u2019s modest utility and scope stands in stark contrast to what had been promised on Friday, when the president <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-news-conference.html\">announced</a> in a news conference that Google had 1,700 engineers working on a website that would \u201cbe very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s concept was news to the nation \u2013 and to Google, which had <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/coronavirus-donald-trump-google-website/\">no such website</a> in the works. Verily, which grew out of Google\u2019s research and development organization Google X but is now a separate company, was indeed working on a triage website, but it was only in the early stages, and only intended for California.</p> <p>Verily staff worked through the weekend, but the launch has not been without issues. In addition to being limited to two counties in the San Francisco Bay area, the tool is only available in English and to people above 18 years old.</p> <p>The survey begins by asking users if they are \u201ccurrently experiencing severe cough, shortness of breath, fever, or other concerning symptoms?\u201d People who answer this question \u201cyes\u201d are told that \u201cin-person Covid-19 testing through this program is not the right fit\u201d. They are advised to seek medical attention.</p> <p>The answer is not a mistake \u2013 testing sites are not appropriate venues for people with severe symptoms to seek medical care \u2013 but it appears to have caused <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/1239558949474451459\">confusion</a> among some users.</p> <p>\u201cWe are early in this pilot and are going to be learning more that will help us refine this Covid-19 risk screening and testing,\u201d a spokeswoman for Verily said. \u201cWe\u2019re beginning by screening and testing individuals at high risk of Covid-19.\u201d</p> <h2>Privacy and data concerns</h2> <p>The Verily tool has also raised questions about privacy and data use. The tool was built using Verily\u2019s Project Baseline platform, a pre-existing product that allows individuals to enroll in clinical studies. As with Project Baseline, users are required to login with a Google account, so they must either use one they already have or create one.</p> <p>Verily sought to assuage concerns in lengthy written responses to questions about data usage from the Guardian. The company said that users of the Covid-19 tool will be given the choice to enroll in Project Baseline after they receive their test results, but will not be automatically signed up for the program. If users decline, their data will not be used for research \u201cother than by the California Public Health authorities for this public health emergency\u201d, the company said.</p> <p>Verily further said that no data from the project will be used for advertising purposes, and that it will \u201cnever be joined with individual\u2019s data stored in Google products without your explicit permission\u201d.</p> <p>Information that individuals enter into the site may be shared with certain third parties, however. Verily said that its own staff, as well as \u201cvolunteers from Google\u201d who are working on the project, will have access to data to help schedule tests and return results.</p> <p>Who those authorities are and how the information would be shared remains unclear.</p> <p>\u201cThe information individuals provide may also be shared with the healthcare professionals who collect their specimen, the clinical laboratory that processes their specimen, and public health authorities that assist with this testing program for purposes related to performing tests, communicating test results, administering and improving the testing program and for public health purposes,\u201d the company said.</p> <p>\u201cThe bottom line is that we\u2019re talking about a very unclear and vague situation where a private entity that has unclear ties to both the state government and possibly the federal government will be collecting what would normally be considered protected health information from individuals,\u201d said Lee Tien, a senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know enough to know how information that is gathered through this site is collected or used.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne worries that when something like this is put together in a hurry, that it\u2019s not going to provide the strongest level of privacy protection,\u201d Tien added.</p> <p>The Guardian has asked Verily whether it has signed a memorandum of understanding with California authorities delineating the data flows. Verily has not yet responded to a question about whether the tool is covered by Hipaa, the US law protecting the privacy of medical records.</p> <p>The intense pressure on Verily stemmed from what appears to have been a high-level game of telephone between the Trump administration and Verily.</p> <p>Trump heard about Verily\u2019s project through Jared Kushner, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/politics/trump-google-coronavirus.html\">New York Times</a> reported. Kushner had discussed the concept with Andy Conrad, the chief executive of Verily, and expressed enthusiasm for the idea, but neither Google nor Verily was prepared for the president\u2019s announcement of the pilot project as a fait accompli.</p> <p>Since Friday, Google has worked to make the president\u2019s false statements into a reality. On Saturday, it <a href=\"https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/covid-19-how-were-continuing-to-help\">announced</a> that it would partner with the US government to develop \u201ca nationwide website that includes information about Covid-19 symptoms, risk and testing information\u201d. That website is expected to launch \u201clate Monday\u201d and appears designed to be a kind of clearinghouse for \u201cauthoritative information\u201d about the pandemic, with links to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).</p> <p>Google is also placing a link to \u201ccoronavirus tips\u201d directly on its homepage. The top result for users who click through is a large infographic with simple advice from the WHO to slow the spread of the disease.</p>",
  "<h2>Arsenal</h2> \n<p>The club has been in lockdown since Thursday night, when their head coach, Mikel Arteta, received <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/12/mikel-arteta-tests-positive-coronavirus-arsenal-head-coach-premier-league\">a positive test result</a> for coronavirus. Around 100 employees, including the first-team squad and coaching staff, are self-isolating while the London Colney and Hale End training centres have been closed. No further positive tests have been disclosed but staff throughout other areas are working from home. Training is set to resume on 24 March but that depends heavily on what is a rapidly developing situation. In the meantime players have been given individual training programmes; some have their own gyms at home but equipment has been sent to those who need it. Arsenal\u2019s executive team are holding meetings every morning; the club is actively involved in the discussions surrounding the season\u2019s future but no conclusions have yet been drawn. <strong>Nick Ames</strong></p> \n<h2>Aston Villa</h2> \n<p>No Villa players have suffered any symptoms and the squad trained as normal on Monday, and other essential \u201cperformance-related\u201d staff also worked as usual. The rest of the club\u2019s staff were allowed to work from home or given time off. The club say people\u2019s health is paramount and they have not yet formulated a firm view as to what should happen if the season is not able to resume on 3 April. Pepe Reina, on loan at Villa from Milan, said in an interview in Spain that the season should have been suspended sooner. \u201cIt was crazy to keep playing,\u201d the keeper was quoted as telling Marca, adding: \u201cThe leagues should only start again when everything calms down ... and the most logical thing is to postpone Euro 2020 to next year.\u201d <strong>Paul Doyle</strong></p> \n<h2>Bournemouth</h2> \n<p>The goalkeeper Artur Boruc and four first-team staff remain in self-isolation after reporting symptoms, but none have been formally tested for Covid-19 as per government guidelines. Players are due to resume training for their fixture against Newcastle on 4 April next Monday. Until then, players are preparing remotely after being given tailor-made training programmes, while injured players such as Chris Mepham and Charlie Daniels have been permitted to report for treatment on a staggered basis. Eddie Howe met with club doctor Craig Roberts on Friday morning and, while there are no firm travel restrictions, the Bournemouth manager has advised his players to act sensibly and in line with government guidance. The club\u2019s chief executive, Neill Blake, is set to represent the club at the league\u2019s emergency meeting on Thursday. <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af8876baeea3572787120f3119ee804d54c3f40a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af8876baeea3572787120f3119ee804d54c3f40a/0_220_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Artur Boruc is in self-isolation after reporting coronavirus-like symptoms.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Artur Boruc is in self-isolation after reporting coronavirus-like symptoms.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robin Jones/AFC Bournemouth via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Brighton</h2> \n<p>Graham Potter\u2019s squad are continuing to train despite the hiatus, and the fact that five members of the club\u2019s staff entered self-isolation last week as a precaution. \u201cThere is a contingency plan in place,\u201d said Paul Barber, the club\u2019s chief executive and deputy chairman who caused some controversy over the weekend when he admitted he could be in favour of Leeds and West Brom joining a 22-team top-flight next season. \u201cI think that is a possible option,\u201d he said on Football Focus. \u201cTo leave the 20 teams in the Premier League as it is would obviously help us and would help others, but to bring the top two teams from the Championship up, give us a larger league for next season \u2026 it has some merit. We are in an unprecedented time and we may need an unprecedented solution for this particular problem.\u201d <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/mar/16/beware-sporting-disaster-capitalists-crisis-go-to-waste\">Beware sporting disaster capitalists not letting this crisis go to waste</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Burnley</h2> \n<p>All academy football from under-16s down has been stopped until further notice but otherwise it is business as usual. Sean Dyche and his players are still in training at Barnfield, office and admin staff are reporting for work and corporate events are still being held at Turf Moor. There has been increased screening at the training ground and stadium as the club follows government and Premier League advice on the pandemic. The club will accept any decision the authorities take on the future of the Premier League season, but is understood to be in favour of the campaign being completed. <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> \n<h2>Chelsea</h2> \n<p>Chelsea are in lockdown, their players and coaching staff in self-isolation and part of their training ground closed, after Callum Hudson-Odoi\u2019s positive test for the virus last week. So, in that context, it was shocking to see pictures of Mason Mount on Sunday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/16/mason-mount-warned-by-chelsea-after-breaking-coronavirus-self-isolation\">having a kick-around with friends</a> at a football centre in north London. For Chelsea, exasperation does not cover it and the club have reminded all of their players of why it is so important to follow government advice. Hudson-Odoi\u2019s test result came back on Thursday night but he had shown signs of a cold from the beginning of last week and had stayed away from the training ground since then. He was feeling fine by Wednesday night, his symptoms having been mild. Chelsea\u2019s players are scheduled to return to training on Sunday but, as with everything, it is subject to change at a moment\u2019s notice. <strong>David Hytner</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6744794ae4538c9cf93944b6edb145bee61109c6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6744794ae4538c9cf93944b6edb145bee61109c6/0_257_3336_2002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson gives an interview for BBC Sport.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson may be affected by government guidelines for people aged over 70.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Lee/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Crystal Palace</h2> \n<p>The decision to close the first team and academy training grounds in Beckenham on Monday for a week was taken as a precautionary measure, and players have been given individual fitness plans to carry out at home until further notice. Given proposals that the government could soon ask all people over the age of 70 to self-isolate, Palace will have concerns over 72-year-old Roy Hodgson, the Premier League\u2019s oldest manager. Co-chairman Steve Parish offered a tongue-in-cheek response after being asked how the Premier League should finish off the season. \u201cFinally a sensible solution,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CEO4TAG/status/1238793800228712448\">he tweeted</a> after another user suggested basing the final standings on the form table for the past three matches. That would give Palace a first league title and leave Liverpool down in sixth place. <strong>EA</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c9b20c45-fe7e-40fc-bc93-679d828e8f24\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Everton</h2> \n<p>All staff, players and coaching team included, have been advised to stay away from all club sites until further notice. The decision was taken after an unnamed player reported a high temperature on Thursday. The player\u2019s condition has improved but he will remain in self-isolation for a total of seven days. Others are following individual training programmes at home and have been advised to stay away from public places unless absolutely necessary. As things stand, it will be 22 March before the first team squad resume training at Finch Farm. The club\u2019s stated position on the league season is as follows: \u201cEverton is committed to working alongside the Premier League \u2013 and all of its clubs \u2013 to make a collective decision in the best interests of the wellbeing of our country. The first priority must always be public health as we battle the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d <strong>AH</strong></p> \n<h2>Leicester City</h2> \n<p>No other players have reported feeling unwell after three went into seven days of self-isolation with very mild flu-like symptoms. The whole squad have been given several days off since the league was put on hold and are not scheduled to resume training before Thursday\u2019s meeting, where plans for the rest of the season may become clearer. The club, who sit third in the table and are on course for Champions League qualification, say they must operate as if their match at Everton will go ahead on 6 April and do not believe there is any need yet to take a public stance on what should happen if that is not possible. <strong>PD</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B9uhHKMAJo9/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Club officials will make representations to the various federations and governing bodies when talks take place, and sporting integrity will be central to Liverpool\u2019s position. In the meantime, players will follow individual training programmes at home having been advised to stay away from Melwood since Friday. They are due to return this month providing the season does resume from 3 April. Injured players are allowed access to Melwood but their rehabilitation schedules are being restricted and staggered to minimise contact. All players have been advised not to travel abroad. <strong>AH</strong></p> \n<h2>Manchester City</h2> \n<p>City players have been training at home over the weekend with Gabriel Jesus, Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Jo\u00e3o Cancelo and David Silva posting images on Instagram of themselves working out. Although Benjamin Mendy self-isolated after fears his father may have the coronavirus, it is understood he has been cleared. Cancelo also published a picture of himself and a baby with the legend: \u201cThe best quarantine.\u201d Whether this is a clue regarding the state of Pep Guardiola\u2019s squad is unclear; the club are remaining tight-lipped regarding whether they will be training together as usual. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/16/national-league-shuts-down-as-fa-puts-all-english-grassroots-football-on-hold\">National League shuts down as FA puts all English grassroots football on hold</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Manchester United</h2> \n<p>The players have been given a few days off by Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r after Thursday\u2019s 5-0 win at Lask and are due back on Tuesday to continue training as normal at the club\u2019s Carrington base. This is the plan for the foreseeable future unless government advice changes. A number of precautions are in place to decrease the potential for the disease being caught across the club. A statement said: \u201c[There are] strengthened hygiene procedures and additional limits on access to our Aon Training Complex, where visitors will be asked to complete questionnaires about their recent travel and potential exposure to coronavirus.\u201d <strong>JJ</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6a6f4de7f347478af717f9f3e50afd774a3ddd6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6a6f4de7f347478af717f9f3e50afd774a3ddd6/0_0_3496_2098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester United players at their training centre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">External visitors to Manchester United\u2019s training centre have been asked to give details of their recent travel.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images via Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Newcastle United</h2> \n<p>The club have closed their training ground to virtually everyone for two weeks, although injured players are expected to attend for physiotherapy. The club\u2019s nearby academy has also been shut for a fortnight. That training ground has been regularly deep-sprayed since Christmas, when a few players and coaches developed a different virus, and that will continue. No Newcastle player or staff member has the virus or is isolating and every player has a personal training programme to follow at home. Steve Bruce is open-minded about players travelling abroad during their two-week break but wants any case to be assessed individually with the club doctor. The plan is for training to resume on Monday week. Bruce believes the season should be completed if possible but suspects it could be six or eight weeks before it restarts. Newcastle had been preparing for what they regarded as an inevitable shutdown for the past four weeks and individual training player programmes were ready. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> \n<h2>Norwich City</h2> \n<p>Norwich\u2019s players have been given time off, which is largely being spent with their families. Injured players are continuing their rehabilitation programmes but the club\u2019s stance is to assess the situation as time goes on, with training recommencing accordingly if the season does in fact restart on 4 April. No positive tests for coronavirus or cases of self-isolation have been disclosed. The club\u2019s season is on a knife-edge given Norwich\u2019s position at the foot of the Premier League but with a number of winnable games left. No judgment has been made, publicly or in private, about how they feel it should proceed. <strong>NA</strong></p> \n<h2>Sheffield United</h2> \n<p>The Blades have not trained since last week and are keeping their plans for this week dynamic. \u201cIt\u2019s a fluid situation,\u201d said one official on Monday afternoon, explaining he was not sure when training would resume. \u201cThe priority is to keep everyone safe so we are keeping things under constant review.\u201d The club has suspended indefinitely all non-essential business and closed all offices at Bramall Lane at least until next week. <strong>PD</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c16708d78122ede823848f9e160e1147a9035a6a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c16708d78122ede823848f9e160e1147a9035a6a/900_0_1800_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Southampton\u2019s Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl at West Ham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Southampton\u2019s Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl has said his club will do \u2018everything possible\u2019 to stop the spread of the coronavirus.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toyin Oshodi/ProSports/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Southampton</h2> \n<p>All players reported to training on Monday morning as expected but the club has tightened restrictions at their Staplewood training campus and at St Mary\u2019s. A deep clean has been conducted at both the training ground and the stadium sites. Staff that work elsewhere across the club, such as foundation projects and development centres, are being managed on a case-by-case basis, with necessary precautions taken. Customer-facing areas of the club such as the ticket office and stadium store are closed until further notice. No players have reported symptoms but former player Manolo Gabbiadini, now of Sampdoria, tested positive for Covid-19 last week. \u201cWe have to do everything possible to make sure that the virus is not spreading so quickly,\u201d said Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl on Thursday. \u201cThis is the goal we all have.\u201d <strong>BF</strong></p> \n<h2>Tottenham</h2> \n<p>Tottenham have seen no symptoms of the virus among their players and they trained as normal on Monday, with Son Heung-min back among their number after a 14-day period of self-isolation. The winger had returned to his native South Korea \u2013 which has been badly affected by Covid-19 \u2013 to undergo surgery on a fractured forearm. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and his players will continue to work as usual, although they will now be able to factor in a few days off because of the postponed matches. The club\u2019s training base in Enfield is fully operational and the hierarchy\u2019s view is that they want to find a way to complete the season. <strong>DH</strong></p> \n<h2>Watford</h2> \n<p>Watford\u2019s players last trained on Friday and are due to return on Wednesday after a short break. No decisions have been taken about a long-term training regime, which is obviously dependent on the overall situation and the health of the players, the coaching staff and their families. All players and coaches are understood to be in good health currently \u2013 three tested negative for coronavirus last week \u2013 though some administrative staff are off work as a precaution. It is felt that a decision regarding the fate of this season would be useful and allow the necessary preparation to begin but that it is unlikely the requisite 14 league clubs will agree on any one outcome this week. <strong>Simon Burnton</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ffacaaedc1750fe39b64890f1ea2bbb7f035b16\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ffacaaedc1750fe39b64890f1ea2bbb7f035b16/0_233_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"West Ham\u2019s home game with Wolves was part of the Premier League weekend programme called off on Friday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">West Ham\u2019s home game with Wolves was part of the Premier League weekend programme called off on Friday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steven Paston/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>West Ham</h2> \n<p>Karren Brady, West Ham\u2019s vice-chair, says the \u201conly fair and reasonable thing to do is declare the whole season null and void.\u201d The club\u2019s manager, David Moyes, and his assistants were forced to self-isolate for seven days after coming into contact with Mikel Arteta, who has tested positive for the virus, but they did not display any symptoms and neither have any of the players. West Ham have overseen a \u201cdeep clean\u201d of their stadium and all training facilities, with the players due back in later this week. All training will be in the open air, with input from the medical team.<strong> DH</strong></p> \n<h2>Wolves</h2> \n<p>No Wolves player has reported any symptoms that would require isolation or treatment, and Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo and his team continue to train as normal at Compton Park. But the rest of the club has practically been placed into lockdown, with Molineux closed at least until 4 April, all administrative staff ordered to work from home and the club shop, ticket office and conference facilities shut. The chairman, Jeff Shi, posted a message on the club\u2019s website urging fans not to \u201cunderestimate\u201d the virus, explaining that his discussions with family and colleagues in China \u201cafford me an acute awareness of the virus\u2019s threat and impact\u201d. <strong>PD</strong></p>",

In July, 2019, Disney announced that R&amp;B singer and actor Halle Bailey would play Ariel in the live action remake of their hugely successful 1989 film,<em> </em>The Little Mermaid. The backlash was predictable with petitions claiming that a black mermaid was \u201ca betrayal of Ariel\u2019s original creator\u201d.

The powers are due to lapse when the outbreak diminishes.</p> \n<p>Asked earlier on Monday if the government might need to do more to help the lowest paid, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cI would point you back to the measures in the budget.\u201d</p> \n<p>These included waiving the usual seven-day wait for employment support allowance (ESA), and making statutory sick pay (SSP) available immediately, instead of after four days.

  "<p>Bail out the airlines? Clearly, some form of government support <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/16/ryanair-cancels-80-per-cent-of-flights-and-does-not-rule-out-full-grounding-coronavirus\">may be needed soon</a>, but a bailout is a misleadingly broad term. Ministers should keep a couple of principles in mind as they respond to ill-defined calls for help.</p> <p>First, financial assistance \u2013 which could be loan guarantees or secured lines of credit \u2013 is best offered on an industry-wide basis on equal terms to everybody. Those terms also have to be extremely favourable to the state. If an airline wants a state loan secured against an aircraft, for example, it cannot expect that aircraft to be valued at pre-coronavirus prices.</p> <p>Second, be strict about who you\u2019re trying to support. It is not the shareholders. If owners have sanctioned business models with little equity or cash protection or unsecured assets, their losses cannot be underwritten by the public purse. Why should the Italian taxpayer cough up another \u20ac600m to rescue Alitalia, a financial basket case long before coronavirus? Even if the underlying business of an airline is viable, the price for shareholders could be steep \u2013 loss of ownership control.</p> <p>The good news, of a sort, is that strong airlines think they can absorb a fair amount of shock. As they grounded most of their fleets, easyJet, Ryanair and IAG, owner of British Airways, made a show of their supposed financial virility.</p> <p>EasyJet said it has a \u00a31.6bn cash balance, an undrawn credit facility of $500m (\u00a3402m) and mortgage-free aircraft worth \u00a34bn. Ryanair paraded cash and cash equivalents worth \u20ac4bn. IAG said it has \u20ac7bn in cash plus \u20ac1.9bn of finance facilities. It not clear how quickly those resources would be depleted during an extended period of no flying, but at least the companies seem to have the right approach: they know their own funds are first in line.</p> <p>Meanwhile, some non-lending methods of support look simple to grant. It\u2019s fair for airlines to ask that their rights over landing slots be secured until the turmoil passes; it\u2019s not as if other airlines are itching to launch new flights to nowhere. There\u2019s also an argument for suspending air traffic control charges during the recovery phase, whenever that arrives. As for a suspension of air passenger duty, governments can take a view when there are passengers again.</p> <p>In the meantime, ministers need to tread carefully: as Virgin Atlantic demonstrated, the airline folk who will need most protection in the weeks ahead will be the employees. Keep your eye on them.</p> <h2>Is this a good moment to shut down the stock markets?</h2> <p>If stock markets are only delivering confidence-sapping readings, why not close them for a while?</p> <p>After yet another big \u201cdown\u201d day for share prices, the idea might sound appealing. Let every investor, saver and pension fund trustee take a time-out from staring at red screens. It would be the ultimate circuit-breaker. Instead of a 15-minute halt to trading, as happened again on Wall Street on Monday after an opening fall of 7%, everyone could go away and reflect on the long-term.</p> <p>A moment\u2019s thought, though, says it would be a terrible idea. First, the only guaranteed outcome would be more panic. There would be an immediate spill-over into markets that matter more for the functioning of economies in the real world, such as government debt.</p> <p>Second, even if almost nobody is currently using stock markets for the traditional purpose of raising fresh capital, share prices are still giving useful price signals. One of the most important came when stocks tumbled last week after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/mar/12/trump-bid-to-calm-crisis-simply-caused-more-financial-chaos\">President Trump tried to reassure the US public</a> that his administration was on top of events. Investors\u2019 verdict \u2013 that the president was still underestimating the size of the healthcare crisis \u2013 was brutal but necessary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>One can \u2013 just \u2013 imagine circumstances in which closure might be advantageous: if governments around the globe were about to unveil a coordinated fiscal strategy to reinvigorate economic activity. A temporary suspension, if followed by a truly impressive fiscal barrage, might add to the sense of a reset and encourage a whoosh of confidence.</p> <p>The trouble is, such a joined-up global approach is currently hard to imagine. The market\u2019s lukewarm response to the G7 finance ministers\u2019 vague statement on Monday about doing \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d was another useful indicator: there was an absence of detail, which is the bit that matters. The market picture may be ugly, but one still has to look.</p>",

During a time of global crisis we need to be working as closely as possible with our closest allies rather than being at loggerheads over a trade deal.</p> \n   <p>If we are delaying elections then we are acknowledging we need to work to protect the public first and foremost rather than stick to political timetables, and Brexit is no exception.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Womack says the transition period should be extended for a year. This is allowed under the withdrawal agreement, provided a decision is taken before July.</p> \n  <p>It seems inevitable that the transition will have to be extended, although ministers are not saying that at this point. Only last Thursday Michael Gove was telling MPs that an extension was being ruled out.

They should have more family contact, not less, he said.</p> \n  <p>And, even though this has been characterised as people being asked to stay at home, he said that people would not have to stay at home all the time: He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We will almost certainly, as a four-country UK, we will move to a position in the next few weeks where we will ask those groups [the over-70s and those with pre-existing conditions] to not stay at home in the social isolation way that we are telling the symptomatic to do so, but to reduce their social contact.</p> \n   <p>It might be mosques, it might be churches, it might be bingo ... and pubs [that people have to avoid]. What we are not suggesting, unlike those with symptoms, is that those people would cut off family contact and not be able to receive visitors.</p> \n   <p>In fact, quite the opposite, we expect family contact to increase in that group so that those people will be looked after.

Only 11 days ago Boris Johnson was saying that as far as possible <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/05/chief-medical-officer-chris-whitty-questioned-by-mps-live-news?page=with:block-5e60df108f08c2df6d273b17#block-5e60df108f08c2df6d273b17\">it should be \u201cbusiness as usual for the overwhelming majority of people in this country\u201d. </a>Only five days ago Rishi Sunak delivered a budget that featured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/11/budget-2020-rishi-sunak-pmqs-boris-johnson-chairs-cabinet-ahead-of-rishi-sunak-unveiling-his-first-budget-live-newsrish?page=with:block-5e68f9068f087df56e4c6829#block-5e68f9068f087df56e4c6829\">a total coronavirus rescue package worth \u00a330bn. </a>Less than a week later, with sections of the economy grinding to a halt, that is starting to look well short of what\u2019s needed. <strong>Mel Stride,</strong> the chair of the Commons Treasury committee, said as much on the Westminster Hour last night. He told the programme: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The forecast upon which the budget rests is already well out of date, it doesn\u2019t show booming growth over the following years anyway. If this continues and there is a fundamental and deep and longer term impact, there will be some very difficult decisions to take around borrowing, taxing and spending.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>It must be serious because No 10 let <strong>Grant Shapps</strong>, the transport secretary, give an interview to the Today programme this morning. Here are the main points he made.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Shapps suggested rail companies could soon be allowed to run reduced services. </strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51896169\">Rail companies have been asking for their franchise obligations to be reduced because passenger numbers have been plummeting</a>.<strong> </strong>Asked about this, Shapps said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are working with [the rail companies] to see what it is that we need to do to sustain them. People still need to be be able to travel. Some of that is about how many trains are put on the line at any one time. I\u2019m meeting with the train companies this week.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if that meant companies being freed from some of their current obligations, he went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is quite clearly an exceptional international moment in time, international crisis. And we need to be flexible as a country to react to that. And I\u2019ll be driven by, amongst other things, the demand. There is no point running ghost trains any more than there\u2019s any point in running ghost planes. But those are conversations which are ongoing. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>By \u201cghost planes\u201d Shapps was referring to rules that require airlines to fly planes, even if they were empty, just to preserve their landing slots. He claimed that he had been successful in obtaining a dispensation from these rules from the EU. </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the government would be considering measures to help the airline industry.</strong> He said that he had been speaking to the aviation industry over recent days, and that he would be taking their proposals to an economic business and response committee being chaired by the chancellor to discuss what the government could do to help. Asked what the government would do, he said the industry had \u201ca variety of different asks\u201d. He did not say how the government would respond, but he said the industry was \u201cclearly right at the forefront of this\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/coronavirus-uk-over-70s-to-be-asked-to-self-isolate-within-weeks-hancock-says\">when the government wanted the over-70s to stay at home, </a>it would be asking them to do that, not telling them that they had to.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He stressed that the advice to the over-70s would not rule out their going out in any circumstances.</strong> Asked if people would be free to go out, for example, to walk the dog, he said: </li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That\u2019s exactly right ... It is the case that people will be able to go out and walk the dog.

It looks as though London is now a few weeks ahead,\u201d said Johnson.</p> <p>\u201cSo to relieve the pressure on the London health system and to slow the spread in London, it is important that Londoners now pay special attention to what we are saying about avoiding non-essential contact and to take particularly seriously the advice about working from home and avoiding confined spaces such as pubs and restaurants.\u201d</p> <h2>Where is the virus in London?</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/f94c3c90da5b4e9f9a0b19484dd4bb14\">highest number of cases</a> have been recorded in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which has seen 43 cases, while Hackney/City of London has seen 20, and Tower Hamlets, home to Canary Wharf but also to one of the most deprived communities in Britain, has recorded just nine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/pm-tells-britons-to-avoid-non-essential-contact-with-others\">PM tells Britons to avoid non-essential contact with others</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>What impact will it have on the capital?</h2> <p>From tomorrow, expect the streets to be deserted. Many offices have already introduced an element of remote working, and although the government\u2019s announcement is not legally binding, it will carry a lot of weight with responsible employers.</p> <h2>Is London following a global pattern for capital cities?</h2> <p>Yes and no.

  "<p>The California governor, Gavin Newsom, has directed the closure of all bars, wineries, nightclubs and brewpubs in the state and called for all seniors age 65 years or older to stay in home isolation to curb the spread of coronavirus.</p> <p>The directive came on Sunday as it was announced that the virus had killed six people in California, with 335 cases confirmed \u2013 now the third-largest number of cases in the nation, after Washington and New York.</p> <p>\u201cThese are profoundly significant steps and they are significant steps from two days ago,\u201d Newsom said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CAgovernor/status/1239291671939919872\">in a news conference</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re guided deeply by what\u2019s happening, not just by anxiety, not just by fear, but by a very pragmatic response to meet this moment without creating other unintended consequences.\u201d</p> <p>The announcement affects a $2.8bn nightlife industry, with an estimated <a href=\"https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-trends/market-research-reports/california/accommodation-food-services/bars-nightclubs-in-california.html\">4,765 businesses in California</a>. While Newsom directed the closure of all bars, wineries, nightclubs and brewpubs, he allowed restaurants to stay open, but at half-capacity, acknowledging that people need access to food.</p> <p>The call for seniors and Californians with chronic conditions to self-isolate will affect at least 5.3 million people. Newsom said the state is working on ensuring that those in self-isolation will be able to have meals, medication and other needs delivered to them.</p> <p>Newsom also tightened the guidelines on visitation to seniors, limiting them only to end-of-life visits, including in hospital settings.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to prioritize our focus,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cThe most important thing is to protect our most vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>All Newsom\u2019s directives have been guidelines, not orders.

Last week, state public health officials called for large gatherings of 250 people or more to be rescheduled or canceled. On Monday, 51% of the state\u2019s school districts will close school for 85% of the state\u2019s students, Newsom said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/13/california-coronavirus-response-schools-disneyland\">California schools closed and events cancelled as state escalates coronavirus response</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Newsom said he felt that California has not reached the point of a \u201cpolice state\u201d where officials need to enforce such guidelines. \u201cIf you want to set up a framework of martial law ... we have the capacity to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are not in that moment feeling like that is a necessity.\u201d</p> <p>He pointed out that statewide, \u201cpeople moved to embrace our last guidance at scale\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNot only did cities and counties embrace our last guidance, they brought our last guidance in at a more granular level,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m confident these guidelines will be well-received and will be appropriately enforced.\u201d</p> <p>Following Newsom\u2019s announcement, Eric Garcetti, the Los Angeles mayor, took the guidelines a step further and ordered the closure of all bars and nightclubs that do not serve food, as well as all movie theaters, gyms, fitness centers, arcades, live performance venues and bowling alleys. All restaurants were also prohibited from allowing dining in.</p> <p>Newsom also announced efforts to expand testing capacity and to bring hundreds of new hospital beds online in the coming days in temporary facilities. He said the state was working to procure hotels and motels for the homeless population living in encampments, as well as an additional 450 trailers.</p> <p>Bars and restaurants across California have already been hit by the economic slowdown caused by the virus.

Staff at other local bars which were still open said that there were many unanswered questions about the governor\u2019s guidance. Would anyone actually enforce it, and come to bars to tell them to shut down? If bars started serving food, could they remain open as restaurants?</p> <p>Many restaurants were struggling despite being allowed to remain open, said Ignacio Perez, one of the owners of Chica, an Oakland restaurant that serves Mexican American food. Even before the governor\u2019s announcement, business had fallen 50% this week in Oakland, and 75% at his restaurant in San Francisco, he said.</p> <p>Other bars had pre-empted the governor\u2019s guidance after deeming the risks to the community of staying open to be too great. Jirka Jireh, the manager of natural wine shop and bar Ordinaire, said the closure of all bars and restaurants in Paris was a tipping point \u2013 while the business plans keep its retail wine shop open, they stopped serving drinks on Saturday.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking it day by day,\u201d said Jireh. Some regulars have come in to buy cases of wine and tipped 20%, to help support the employees. <br><br>Cormac Lachaal, a bartender at Ordinaire, said he saw the value of the governor\u2019s guidance. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary to take public health into account and create boundaries for people,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At an Oakland dive bar, some regulars had heard the news that afternoon and immediately headed in \u201cfor one last drink\u201d, said bartender Emma McDonald. \u201cIt\u2019s weird. Bars are the places to go no matter what happens,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She had a container of bleach wipes behind the bar that afternoon, and said she had even sanitized the dominoes.</p> <p>McDonald was unsure if she would be working tomorrow, or what lay ahead for the industry and its customers. Only one thing, she said, was clear: \u201cWe\u2019re all in limbo together, listening to music.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Sales of guns and ammunition are soaring across the US as fears of possible social unrest amid the coronavirus crisis are prompting some Americans to turn to firearms as a form of self-protection.</p> \n<p>On the west coast, long lines of customers were queueing up outside gun stores to stock up on deadly materials.

There was almost no interest in hunting rifles. Instead, people were opting for target guns and there was big demand for AR-15 semi-automatic assault-style rifles.</p> \n<p>Asked why he thought the spike was happening, Hyatt replied: \u201cFinancial meltdown, pandemic, crime, politics \u2026 you throw it all into the pot, and you have one hell of a mess.\u201d</p> \n<p>A major online dealer of ammunition, Ammo.com, has put out figures for sales from 23 February to 4 March that give an indication of the scale of the surge. In that 11-day period sales increased 68% compared to the 11 days up to 23 February.</p> \n<p>Sales were especially pronounced in North Carolina and Georgia, which experienced a leap of 179% and 169% respectively. Other states with large increases included Pennsylvania, Texas, Florida, Illinois and New York.</p> \n<p>In a statement, Ammo.com\u2019s marketing manager, Alex Horsman, said: \u201cWe know certain things impact ammo sales, mostly political events or economic instability when people feel their rights may end up infringed. This is our first experience with a virus leading to such a boost in sales.\u201d</p> \n<p>Apart from general anxiety surrounding coronavirus, some gun sale spikes appeared to have specific causes. <a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/2020/03/coronavirus-gun-sales-washington-california-asian-americans/\">The Trace reported</a> that in Washington state and California, locations of early outbreaks of the virus, gun sales increased acutely propelled by Asian Americans fearful that they could face xenophobic and racist violence against their families given that the original source of coronavirus was China.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are panicking because they don\u2019t feel secure. They worry about a riot or maybe that people will start to target the Chinese,\u201d David Liu, a Chinese-American gun dealer outside Los Angeles, told the Trace.</p> \n<p>Amid the rush to stockpile lethal weapons, there were concerns for the safety of children. A sudden increase in guns and rifles in domestic homes could put children at risk through lack of safe storage.</p> \n<p>Firearms are already the second most prevalent killer of children in the US after car crashes. In the 14- to 17-year-old bracket, gun injuries are the highest single cause of death, according to research from the <a href=\"https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2019posts/the-facts-on-the-us-children-and-teens-killed-by-firearms.html\">University of Michigan school of public health</a>.</p>",

While it comes with a grand sci-fi theme, Star Realms\u2019 real draw is its simple deck-building system, where you start with a handful of cards and gradually upgrade them as you add more lethal ships to your interstellar navy.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.bargainmax.co.uk//santorini-board-game.html\">Santorini</a></strong></h2> <p><strong>\u00a346.99, age 8+, 20 minutes</strong><br>The Greek gods have decided to construct a beautiful town on the island of Santorini, and this brainy construction game tasks players with building clusters of towers to please the deities.

  "<p>Hundreds of workers at Britain\u2019s biggest homelessness charity have started a three-day strike in a protest about working conditions and the treatment of vulnerable migrant rough sleepers whose details the charity shared with the Home Office.</p> <p>Staff at <a href=\"https://www.mungos.org/\">St Mungo\u2019s</a> have gone on strike after a year-long dispute about the charity\u2019s sickness policy and concern about the ratio of junior to more senior workers. Strikers are on picket lines in London, Bristol and Brighton. Union officials estimate that about 200 staff have joined the strike \u2013 the first at the charity since 2014.</p> <p>Workers fear the staffing policy opens the door to a cheaper workforce on worse pay and terms and conditions. They claim that the working arrangements proposed by managers will undermine safety.</p> <p>Staff have also expressed concern about the charity\u2019s information sharing about migrant rough sleepers with the Home Office, a practice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/05/st-mungos-homeless-charity-helped-target-rough-sleepers-to-deport\">exposed by the Guardian</a>.</p> <p>Members of Unite rejected calls from the charity\u2019s chief executive, Howard Sinclair, to suspend the strike because of coronavirus, instead saying they are following government guidance. They say that St Mungo\u2019s chiefs rejected a compromise offer on staffing ratios.</p> <p>Unite regional officer Tabusam Ahmed said: \u201cSt Mungo\u2019s workers have tried their utmost to arrive at a reasonable settlement with their employer and have been rejected at every turn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2020/mar/13/life-after-homelessness-when-they-found-me-a-flat-i-felt-nothing-could-stop-me\">Life after homelessness: 'When they found me a flat, I felt nothing could stop me'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFor our members, the safety of their clients is their number one priority and they are taking strike action with very heavy hearts, but believe it is the only way to defend the future of St Mungo\u2019s services.\u201d</p> <p>One anonymous St Mungo\u2019s worker published <a href=\"http://www.housingworkers.org.uk/readnews.html?con_id=752\">a blog</a> about why they were striking and described \u201ca gutting feeling of disappointment, shame and guilt\u201d when St Mungo\u2019s admitted to sharing information with the Home Office about some migrant rough sleepers, after initially denying this. Last year the charity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/05/charity-st-mungos-says-sorry-for-giving-rough-sleepers-details-to-home-office\">apologised</a> for doing this.</p> <p>St Mungo\u2019s provides beds each night for 2,850 homeless people, in 120 hostels. Its annual turnover is \u00a3112m. It has accused Unite of opposing changes to how teams are staffed.</p> <p>Sinclair said the charity had \u201cdone everything possible\u201d to stop the strike and made compromises. He said the charity\u2019s main focus was on organisation-wide planning around the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cWe want Unite to call off their strike immediately,\u201d he said. \u201cWith coronavirus, we know the focus of our staff, union or non-union members, will be even more on the welfare of our vulnerable clients.</p> <p>\u201cThe right to life is more important than the right to strike, and organising pickets and rallies outside, while clients need support in services and when they are rough sleeping seems incredibly misjudged.\u201d</p> <p>Benjamin Morgan, who runs the EU homeless rights project at the Public Interest Law Centre, said: \u201cThis industrial action shows homelessness workers are making links between their own work conditions and the failure of managers to stand up for the rights of rough sleepers. St Mungo\u2019s helped create a \u2018hostile environment\u2019 for homeless people by sharing personal data with the Home Office without consent.</p> <p>\u201cBy doing so, they forfeited the trust of vulnerable migrants, making the work of outreach teams more difficult. Charities should never be sharing service users\u2019 information for immigration enforcement purposes.\u201d</p> <p>A St Mungo\u2019s spokesperson said on Monday: \u201cSt Mungo\u2019s major challenge today is pandemic planning and all our resources should be focused on this. This is what our clients, staff and communities expect</p> <p>\u201cUnite officials have chosen to push ahead with their strike this week. We asked Unite to postpone their action, with no preconditions, which they have so far refused to do.</p> <p>\u201cThis is really not the week to go out on strike and we ask Unite officials again to postpone during this unprecedented time. Our services have run as we expected today and we were able to provide staffing in line with our contingency plan. The safety and security of our clients remains our number one priority.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The start of Britain\u2019s<strong> </strong>Coronavirus Week #2, now, with a good handful of us in self-isolation and a good amount of us very actively not: supermarkets plundered, businesses still not quite knowing whether to let people work from home, the diagnosed cases significant but currently manageable, the country on a precipice, and before all of this hits us as hard as it has other European countries, the one question burns: will the government\u2019s gamble to not engage in mass testing or draconian lockdowns make things worse or better?<strong> </strong>And in that question, one harsh and jewel-like truth: coronavirus is Brexit now.</p> <p>You remember <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>, don\u2019t you? A while ago now. Started in 2016 as a joke and then it backfired so hard we had to have Theresa May as prime minister. Brexit is done now \u2013 in that we have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/31/brexit-day-britain-prepares-leave-eu-live-news-updates\">exited Europe</a> and ruined three consecutive Christmases by arguing about it. But just as we were going to get down to the nitty-gritty of actually going into free-trade freefall, coronavirus happened. And \u2013 seamlessly \u2013 the point-scoring back-and-forth of domestic Brexit arguments has moved on to that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/uk-covid-19-strategy-questions-unanswered-coronavirus-outbreak\">The UK\u2019s Covid-19 strategy dangerously leaves too many questions unanswered | Anthony Costello</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It started with the government\u2019s official response last week, where Boris Johnson announced the first round of a strategy designed to limit coronavirus impact, which was basically \u201clisten quite a lot of people are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-johnson-warns-many-more-families-are-going-to-lose-loved-ones-video\">going to die</a>, figure it out among yourselves\u201d.</p> <p>Whatever you think of the current government \u2013 and I can\u2019t say I\u2019m a fan \u2013 the way the current state of discourse is set up means basically any announcement of action on Johnson\u2019s part would be under feverish scrutiny so, in a way, it\u2019s better for them to announce pretty much nothing than to even really try. Johnson could have demanded an enforced lockdown and on-the-spot fines for breaking quarantine; turned hotels and empty buildings into NHS hospitals; announced rent and mortgage suspension across the board and hazmat teams patrolling the street with antibac sprays, and somebody would still kick off about something. One of those \u201cintense cleanliness is actually bad for you\u201d, natural-deodorant-and-a-weekly-shower lot would do an excoriating Twitter thread, and he\u2019d be finished. Better to half-try and fail than try hard and fail, I always say, and it\u2019s good to see government strategy follow suit.</p> <p>But then this does immediately create two defined opposing groups: on one side, mindless tub thumpers of government agenda who would back anything Johnson says because he broadly represents them (in the Brexit analogy, these are the most likely to stand over a mass grave and say, \u201cCoronavirus won, get over it\u201d); on the other, people who would like to hear a bit more from the scientists, please. But because \u201cscience\u201d is not a precise set of guidelines but rather a sort of intelligent squabble, there are currently various opposing views on both the severity of Covid-19 and the best way of dealing with it, and it means we now have terms such as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/epidemiologist-britain-herd-immunity-coronavirus-covid-19\">herd immunity</a>\u201d and \u201c80% infection rate\u201d and \u201csecond wave\u201d being thrown around by people who, and I\u2019m speaking from personal experience, have read about three-and-a-half articles about it. In that sheer void of actual knowledge, the best arguments form.</p> <p>I suppose a lot of it boils down to the strange British disdain we have for experts. We really don\u2019t like people who know things. Perhaps it\u2019s because they challenge the inherent idea that being British is this weird universal get-out-of-jail-free card that can be played in any situation \u2013 being in the single market, winning a war, cheerfully going on holiday during a pandemic \u2013 and, in the midst of a economic-political-biomedical crisis where everyone is a half-expert and nobody is a full one, having a deep-set confidence that you can defeat a virus just by being more British than it is does have an oddly significant currency.</p> <h2>While there are dogs playing Jenga, there is still hope</h2> <p>There was a fun and interesting look at what life would be like if football stopped existing this weekend, and that is: great swathes of the population would have literally no idea how to spend a Saturday afternoon, and a number of men would now have absolutely nothing left to say, to anyone, because they can no longer speculate how much Sadio Man\u00e9 might be worth in an open market. This is bad. It seems good, but it\u2019s bad.</p> <p>I understand why the football authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/mar/13/premier-league-and-british-football-set-for-shutdown-due-to-coronavirus-live\">chose to postpone league games</a> (certain non-league games <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2020/mar/15/non-league-football-carries-on-for-now-in-pictures-football-coronavirus\">still went ahead</a>, which I mention only because there is a certain type of person, Lads Who Know About Non-League, who won\u2019t give up until they find my address and come to my house and tell me, in their Peaky Blinders caps and with their pints of Camden Hells, that non-league games still went ahead, actually), and agree that it was the right thing to do. But I do think it is bad that it happened, because it exposed how vulnerably reliant we all are on sport to stay sane. People are so desperate for entertainment that they are bemoaning F1 being cancelled, for goodness\u2019 sake. We thought the apocalyptic horsemen would be Pestilence, War, Famine and Death, but it\u2019s actually just Being so Starved for Entertainment That You\u2019d Degrade Yourself By Rooting for Lewis Hamilton to Tactically Overtake His Own Teammate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc6f0e30228f282ae6d0f03a735b0ab2df77d1ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc6f0e30228f282ae6d0f03a735b0ab2df77d1ff/0_239_4889_2935/1000.jpg\" alt=\"sadio mane\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When the dust settles, nobody will really notice if Liverpool (Sadio Man\u00e9 pictured) have won or lost the title.

You don\u2019t consider how many of the normal people around you are constantly preoccupied by sport. Football, for example, is a week-long cycle \u2013 anticipation for a match, the match itself, the crushing and humiliating loss (me: Arsenal fan), the discussion about how not to lose next time, the forward-looking anticipation of summer, the constant idea that one defensive-minded midfield signing from Serie A will fix everything; all of these wheels, constantly whirring, occupying hours of time \u2013 and without it: nothing.</p> <p>Videos of a more-locked-down-than-us Italy has people joyously singing together off their balconies for solidarity and entertainment, which is fine for Italians, but very simply will not work here. Britain needs two things running in the background as a constant \u2013 an ongoing polemical discussion we can get so mad about that we raise our voice too much and ruin a dinner party, and a live sporting event with very little impact on the rest of the league. My theory is this: in the next two weeks, we will, through some great unseen groupthink, decide on a couple of non-sports that don\u2019t require audiences to become obsessed with and broadcast on Sky \u2013 marble runs are an early contender, or paper planes thrown out of skyscrapers, or maybe dogs playing Jenga \u2013 and they will become our new religions.

  "<p>In flagrant disregard for the old adage about the show going on, the entertainment industry has ground to a halt. Reports of coronavirus outbreaks put a stop to production on everything from the teen soap du jour to a high-profile Elvis biopic. (Get well soon, Hanx.) With movie theaters shut down across the globe, studios have pulled their big-ticket releases en masse with an eye on a more clement climate by late summer or fall. Even if the theaters were still running, it\u2019d be a moot point, given the populace\u2019s general reluctance to leave the house for any high-density social areas. Everyone\u2019s hunkering down to spend what could be a very long stretch of time at home, and in terms of movies, that can mean only one thing: these are boom times for streaming.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/30/what-can-we-learn-about-coronavirus-from-watching-contagion\">When old films go viral: how coronavirus gave Contagion an unexpected afterlife</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The usual lineup of publications have all run their own guides to ideal quarantine viewing options, whether that means the absurd pleasures of fiasco Meet Joe Black, the soothing comforts of the Nancy Meyers canon, or the germaphobe terror of Safe. Others have taken this as an occasion to revisit films that speak more directly to the phenomenon at hand; screening rentals and downloads of Stephen Soderbergh\u2019s disaster thriller Contagion have soared, as have considerations of its chillingly realistic simulation of a pandemic. On Twitter, colleagues have recommended Ling Ma\u2019s recent novel Severance and the 2011 cult sci-fi thought experiment Perfect Sense, more dystopian accounts of worldwide sickness.</p> <p>The 1995 film Outbreak \u2013 the original release of which hits the 25-year mark this week, a creepy cosmic wrinkle of chance \u2013 has also enjoyed a huge surge in streaming views (as of writing, it\u2019s the third most watched film on Netflix in the US) as its subject matter grows increasingly, stomach-churningly relevant. It would appear to be a perverse quirk of the modern human condition that compels us to seek out media foregrounding that which upsets us, but this has been hardwired into our pathology for millennia. Viewers have been flocking to these films for a sanctioned version of exposure therapy, in which an inconceivable menace can be experienced and survived.

Such films as Contagion and Outbreak \u2013 or less literal projections, like the zombie armageddon of 28 Days Later \u2013 allow audiences to vicariously live through the end of days and survey what will be left after. It\u2019s a form of emergency preparedness for the mind, rendering thinkable the unthinkable and theorizing where the average person\u2019s place in all of it might be. It\u2019s a disquieting way to kill two hours, as affirmed by the sheen of dread covering every \u201cI rewatched Contagion today, oh boy\u201d essay. All the same, it theoretically leaves the viewer a bit tougher and more inured to whatever horrors may still come.</p> <p>But I\u2019d contend that there\u2019s a faint futility to analyzing apocalypse viewing of any sort, because when something occupies as much mental real estate as the widespread panic of Covid-19, everything becomes apocalypse viewing. If it\u2019s impossible not to spend every waking hour obsessing over the precarious state of the public\u2019s health, it\u2019s likewise impossible not to project those anxieties on to anything one might choose to watch.</p> <p>To speak anecdotally: just last night, I did what all the reports said to do and tore my eyes away from the news to spend time on the couch with my loved ones. The safe refuges of Mad Men and 30 Rock reruns, however, didn\u2019t afford the instant morphine wave of relief they usually do. Any premise or plot development could be contorted into an unnerving parallel with the viral elephant we desperately wanted to keep out of the room.</p> <p>Don Draper has a panic attack after his shameful secrets are nearly outed for the umpteenth time, and his shaking feverish sweats bring to mind only one thing. Liz Lemon advises Jack Donaghy that his elderly mother may not be long for this world, and that he would do well to get whatever closure he can with her while there\u2019s still time \u2013 that one doesn\u2019t even require much of a stretch. With the stakes this high, anything and everything can be a hypochondriac trigger.</p> <p>For the first time of my life, moving pictures have proven insufficient consolation from the day\u2019s stresses. At times like this, the viewing equivalent of the fight-or-flight response should drive the Homo sapiens toward the full-on confrontation of disaster movies as a method of gaining control or the warming effects of escapism as a haven of denial. But even those of us usually in the escapism camp can only take that defense so far. It\u2019s starting to seem like the only real therapy is the detached, unplugged, attention-commanding simplicity of chopping vegetables.</p>",

The police themselves claim they did everything in their power to restore law and order. But those who took part in the riots on the Hindu side tell a very different story.</p> <p>The catalyst for the riots is widely acknowledged to have been a comment by Kapil Mishra, a BJP leader, who on 23 February issued a public ultimatum declaring that if the police did not clear the streets of a protest against a new citizenship law seen as anti-Muslim, his supporters would be \u201cforced to hit the streets\u201d.</p> <p>Ravinder, a 17-year-old who works in his father\u2019s property business and is part of India\u2019s lower-caste Gujjar community, said he and other young Hindu men had heard Mishra\u2019s call to action against the Muslim community, and began to mobilise on the morning of 24 February without any fear of police reprisal.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a clear instruction of catch-and-kill action against any Muslim we could spot,\u201d said Ravinder. \u201cI was in a group of around 15 boys. Many senior brothers said to us that police would not take any action against any member of our community and we could attack the people on the other side [Muslims] the way we liked.\u201d</p> <p>Ravinder described how he and a group of seven men had captured a Muslim rickshaw driver in his 40s, beaten him with wooden sticks and metal rods until he appeared dead, and then threw him in an open drain while police stood by. He also said the police had instructed them to destroy the CCTV cameras as they marauded through the streets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b899d31965cc2773912b9cc4a2b320e9b66c450c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b899d31965cc2773912b9cc4a2b320e9b66c450c/0_0_3500_1970/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A car park in Delhi\u2019s Shiv Vihar locality which was complete burnt by rioting mobs during the outbreak of violence in the last week of February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A car park in Delhi\u2019s Shiv Vihar district, which was set alight by mobs during February\u2019s riots.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaikh Azizur Rahman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSome policemen were standing just a few metres away,\u201d said Ravinder. \u201cThey did not say anything to us.

The Brahmin, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had witnessed young Hindu men in his neighbourhood, who were all BJP supporters, declare that the \u201cpolice brothers are with us\u201d as they gathered stones, iron rods, knives, machetes, wooden sticks and guns ready to attack Muslims.</p> <p>\u201cThe men were displaying weapons openly,\u201d the priest recounted. \u201cOne young man with a pistol shouted: \u2018Brothers, we are on a mission in the interest of the nation.

It was clear that police were on our side,\u201d he added.</p> <p>While the authorities have denied that police were in any way involved in the violence, video footage captured during the riots and corresponding witness testimony shows police accompanying and encouraging the Hindu mobs or even taking part in pelting Muslims with stones and destroying CCTV cameras.</p> <p>One piece of mobile phone footage, which went viral laid bare the anti-Muslim bigotry of Delhi police. On 24 February, in one of the first clashes of the riots, police officers were captured beating five Muslim men who had not taken part in any violence. They kicked and hit them with sticks until their bodies were limp and broken, and then as the wounded men lay in the street, police forced them to sing the national anthem to prove their \u201cloyalty\u201d to India.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dcdb591ac13c5a70dd87fd73813e8376c830c564\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dcdb591ac13c5a70dd87fd73813e8376c830c564/0_0_4500_2533/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rafiq lying in bed at home in the Kardampuri locality of Delhi.

He died in hospital the next day from internal injuries, though his family has still not been given the report of the postmortem examination.</p> <p>Sitting on the floor of the one-room house she shared with Faizan, his mother, Kishmatoon, 61, could not contain her grief, stroking the bed where he had once slept. \u201cHe was completely innocent,\u201d she wept. \u201cThey cannot show any evidence which shows my son did anything unlawful that day.

But it\u2019s important not to <em>yadda</em><em> yadda</em> away the years in between, when his sophomore slump (1991\u2019s Kafka) extended to a junior slump (1993\u2019s King of the Hill) and a senior slump (1995\u2019s The Underneath), and he seemed lost in a wilderness of his own design. Arguments can (and should) be made for his work during this period \u2013 the Depression-era drama King of the Hill is one of his best films, and all three are varied and conceptually adventurous \u2013 but Soderbergh himself felt so discombobulated by failure that he wrote, directed, starred, edited and photographed 1996\u2019s Schizopolis, an experimental doodle, just to give his career a hard reboot. Two years later, he made the superb Elmore Leonard adaptation Out of Sight for Universal Pictures, and he was off and running again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/25/dark-waters-movie-dupont-company-toxic-chemicals\">Can a movie bring about major corporate change?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Soderbergh started 2000 with Erin Brockovich and ended it with Traffic, both earning him best director nominations at the Oscars (he won for the latter), it almost felt calculated, like he had made a bet with himself that he could pivot from indie iconoclast to commercial juggernaut over the course of a four-year period. As many of the era\u2019s biggest stars \u2013 George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon chief among them \u2013 strolled out to the Fountains of the Bellagio in Las Vegas at the end of his Ocean\u2019s Eleven remake in 2001, it was the capper to a time when Soderbergh had cracked the code, squaring his sensibility with mass-market entertainment.</p> <p>Soderbergh would go back to the lab soon afterwards with the digital experimentation of Full Frontal and Bubble, and studio films such as Solaris and Ocean\u2019s Twelve, which were much further afield. Now 20 years old, Erin Brockovich stands out as the closest Soderbergh has gotten to making an old-fashioned star vehicle, one that\u2019s issue-driven to a point, but more about harnessing the power of Julia Roberts, who dominates every scene she\u2019s in \u2013 which happens to be almost all of them. Soderbergh\u2019s wizardry with the environmental procedural owes much to All the President\u2019s Men, a touchstone for many of his films about how complex systems work, from the drug war (Traffic) to viral outbreaks (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/30/what-can-we-learn-about-coronavirus-from-watching-contagion\">Contagion</a>) to financial fraud (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/18/laundromat-review\">The Laundromat</a>). But he\u2019s also doing for Roberts what Alice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Anymore did for Ellen Burstyn or Norma Rae did for Sally Field, giving her a platform to be her best and biggest self.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"382f9038a7ffec16ce4502641a25246c6b224d38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/382f9038a7ffec16ce4502641a25246c6b224d38/0_0_2745_1837/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Finney and Julia Roberts in Erin Broockvich\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert Finney and Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Working through a succession of wardrobe changes to rival a pop star\u2019s arena show, Roberts plays Brockovich as a casual-Friday provocateur who uses plunging necklines and miniskirts to terrorize her adversaries. And if that\u2019s not enough to intimidate them, she backs it up with salty invective. As the film opens, she\u2019s an unemployed single mother of three who\u2019s trying to fake her way through job interviews, confident enough that her work ethic and people skills will allow her to learn on the fly. When her attempt to get legal restitution for a car accident doesn\u2019t pan out, Brockovich simply turns up at her lawyer\u2019s office and bullies him into giving her a job.</p> <p>The bulk of Erin Brockovich is about the class-action lawsuit she and the lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), bring against Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) for contaminating the groundwater of its plant in Hinkley, California, with a chemical called hexavalent chromium. Through her initiative and drive, she picks up a client base plagued by medical problems and shimmies her way through the county water board offices to find the damning files to prove that PG&amp;E acted with deliberate malice. She also dates a biker (Aaron Eckhart) next door. His name is George. He watches her kids.</p> <p>As written by Susannah Grant, Erin Brockovich seems deliberate in turning George into the type of perfunctory romantic partner that\u2019s common in films where men are out doing something important and the women are left to complain about their absence. Grant and Roberts turn Brockovich into the type of person who has been wronged so often that she\u2019s always spoiling for a fight, especially when she identifies other underdogs in need of an ally. It takes time for Masry to see that this steamroller can be of use to him \u2013 at least when he\u2019s not being flattened by it \u2013 and the two become a wonderful pair, the modest old legal hand and brassy go-getter who shakes him out of complacency.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d45cd221870220d22969414b398143ccd4a8d577\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d45cd221870220d22969414b398143ccd4a8d577/0_100_2932_1760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With this film and Traffic the same year, Soderbergh would prove to be a master at connecting the dots without making it seem like an information dump. In Erin Brockovich, Roberts is the spoonful of sugar that makes the medicine go down: as we learn about different types of chromium, the range of medical abnormalities, and the ins and outs of real estate documents and toxicology reports, she\u2019s ripping some poor suit with invective or using her body as a diversionary tactic. It never feels difficult to sort through the facts \u2013 and, more crucially, the emotional stakes of the case are never lost in them. That\u2019s Brockovich\u2019s gift. And that\u2019s Roberts\u2019, too.</p> <p>The lightness of Erin Brockovich is the reason why one of the biggest hits of Soderbergh\u2019s career, topped only by Ocean\u2019s Eleven the next year, succeeds but it does rob the film of a more serious sense of purpose. Soderbergh cares about the harms of corporate malfeasance, as he has proved multiple times since, but this isn\u2019t an angry film like Todd Haynes\u2019 recent Dark Waters, which views a similar case of water-poisoning as a much darker statement on how government and big business treats ordinary people. It says something that Erin Brockovich ends with its hero getting a $2m bonus check \u2013 hers is the most important triumph, and the justice she gets for hundreds of others is merely the vessel for it. Anger is a burden that Brockovich alleviates for her clients, and all that\u2019s left is the winning.</p>",
  "<p>Pandemics don\u2019t destroy societies, but they do expose their weaknesses.

The Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a foundation based in Washington DC, was established in 2017 to drive public investment in R&amp;D for pandemic treatments, but even today it complains that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/opinion/contributors/pharma-vaccines.html?searchResultPosition=1\">it has struggled to interest pharmaceutical companies</a> in research that could save countless lives.<br><br>As companies are starting to see the potential for profit in Covid-19, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/13/big-pharma-drug-pricing-coronavirus-profits/\">investment has grown</a>; like <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/115/10/2329?ijkey=cc719bb23cad9ce1a8ab5e8947978d9bdb281780&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha\">almost every drug brought to market</a>, the public sector will play a critical role in funding almost every candidate vaccine and treatment.

In the same way that we have seen the moral imperative of an NHS that guarantees equitable healthcare to all, we need to apply conditions on research funding that prohibit profiteering from Covid-19, so everyone across the globe who needs treatment can get it.

  "<p>Democratic debates in times of coronavirus make for even less interesting television than during normal times, whatever that means in the Trump era. In Sunday night\u2019s debate, Bernie Sanders had a double task. For the believers, to make a last pitch that he is the better candidate (which, in terms of the presidency, he clearly is). For the realists, his task was to push the inevitable nominee, Joe Biden, more to the left. He probably achieved neither, as Biden stole the show, by announcing (cleverly) that he will pick a female vice-presidential candidate, a progressive weak point of Sanders (who has remained unclear on this point).</p> <p>Of course, the announcement should come as little surprise, given how important women have been in the anti-Trump mobilization \u2013 the 2017 Women\u2019s March was likely the largest single-day demonstration in US history, while black and suburban women were crucial to the \u201cblue wave\u201d that brought the Democratic party the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections. And there has been broad and loud disappointment that the most diverse candidate field in any US primary has ended up with just two old white men standing.</p> <p>Social media was quick to speculate and two names came up most often: Kamala Harris and Stacey Abrams. Both women would cater to not just women but also African Americans, two crucial demographics for the Democrats in November, with African American women being proclaimed the saviors of the Democratic party in the midterm elections.</p> <p>Although Harris has many merits, she also has at least two important weaknesses. First of all, she is from California, a rather unique and ultimately safe Democratic state, and her campaign does not necessarily indicate that her appeal reaches much broader. Second, she has a problematic past in terms of social justice, which also haunted her during her campaign, and could strengthen the \u201cauthoritarian\u201d image of Biden, who has a long track record of being on the wrong side of social justice issues.</p> <p>Stacey Abrams, on the other hand, has strengths that can help Biden in the campaign, being an African American woman from the south-east (which has several potential swing states), but could also give his presidency a crucial secondary agenda \u2013 the primary agenda being the return to relatively mainstream liberal Democratic politics.</p> <p>Abrams came to fame for her campaign for Georgia governor in 2018, which she lost against the man who oversaw the elections, Brian Kemp. While she was often described as an \u201cidentity politics candidate\u201d outside of the Peach State, this was more a reflection of the ignorance, and prejudice of the journalists than of the politics of the candidate. She actually ran on a rather moderate agenda, knowing that while Georgia was in play, it is still the south, and southerners like their Democrats moderate to conservative, if they like them at all.</p> <p>But after being defeated in a race that saw more direct and indirect voter suppression than most developing democracies, Abrams did not simply roll over and concede, Al Gore-style, but instead defiantly stated: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear. This is not a speech of concession because concession means to acknowledge an action is right, true or proper. As a woman of conscience and faith, I cannot concede that. But my assessment is the law currently allows no further viable remedy.\u201d</p> <p>Since then, Abrams <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/07/stacey-abrams-georgia-suppression-voting-rights-campaign-democracy\">has founded an NGO</a> committed to fight voter suppression, called Fair Fight, and built a national network and profile, among others through her widely praised Democratic response to Donald Trump\u2019s 2019 State of the Nation. Within her network is a certain Mike Bloomberg, who has given $5m to her organization.</p> <p>Imagine what Abrams and Bloomberg could do for African American turnout in November, not so much by convincing them to vote, but by simply enabling them to vote, despite almost nationwide Republican attempts to suppress in particular minority votes. Together they have the expertise and resources to, first, organize a massive registration drive and, later, mobilization and transportation operation. If the Democrats want to defeat Trump in November, mobilization of the disenfranchised will be crucial.</p> <p>And imagine a vice-president devoted to making the US a real democracy \u2013 not <em>again</em>, no, for the first time in its long history. Abrams could use her office to be the driving force behind a nationwide fight against voter suppression, providing crucial coordination and resources to embattled local and state activists. Even if a Biden-Abrams administration would not do much more than that, this would be a massive step forward to a more progressive future.</p>",
  "<p>Judging by the empty shelves in supermarkets, many of us are planning to spend the next four months living on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/oct/03/recipe-felicity-cloake-perfect-pasta-pomodoro\" title=\"\">pasta al pomodoro</a>.

Couscous, polenta, noodles and bulgar wheat are all helpful to have around, and you might like to freeze a sliced loaf, or buy the ingredients to make your own bread. The Indian chef Maunika Gowardhan says she is never without atta flour for roti and parathas, while the author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/mar/23/black-sea-coast-turkey-food-drink-mountains-trabzon\" title=\"\">Black Sea</a>, Caroline Eden, recommends oatcakes.

Caroline Craig, author of Provence: the Cookbook, reminds me that potatoes, garlic and onions all store well in a cool, dark place, as does butternut squash. Baked beans may be short on the shelves at the moment, but they are great source of fibre and B vitamins (the nutritionist Jo Saunders, the founder of <a href=\"https://eightfood.co.uk/\">Eight, a healthy frozen-meals range</a>, calls them \u201can absolute store cupboard essential\u201d), but if you can\u2019t get them, lentils and other dried or tinned pulses and legumes can be the base for everything from hearty soups to satisfying salads.</p> <p>Tinned tuna may be hard to track down, but sardines, mackerel and anchovies are all incredibly versatile, and cured meat lasts for ages if properly stored, as will eggs and hard cheese such as parmesan.

  "<p>Experts have criticised NHS advice that people self-isolating with Covid-19 should take ibuprofen, saying there is plausible evidence this could aggravate the condition.</p> <p>The comments came after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/anti-inflammatory-drugs-may-aggravate-coronavirus-infection\">French authorities warned</a> against taking widely used over the counter anti-inflammatory drugs. The country\u2019s health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, a qualified doctor and neurologist, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/olivierveran/status/1238776545398923264\">tweeted</a> on Saturday: \u201cThe taking of anti-inflammatories [ibuprofen, cortisone \u2026 ] could be a factor in aggravating the infection. In case of fever, take paracetamol. If you are already taking anti-inflammatory drugs, ask your doctor\u2019s advice.\u201d</p> <p>NHS guidance states that people managing Covid-19 symptoms at home should take <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-advice/\">paracetamol or ibuprofen</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI would advise against that,\u201d said Prof Ian Jones, a virologist at the University of Reading. \u201cThere\u2019s good scientific evidence for ibuprofen aggravating the condition or prolonging it. That recommendation needs to be updated.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Little, a professor of primary care research at the University of Southampton, said: \u201cThe general feeling is that the French advice is fairly sensible. There is now a sizeable literature from case control studies in several countries that prolonged illness or the complications of respiratory infections may be more common when non-steroidal anti-inflammatories [NSAIDs] are used.\u201d</p> <p>A trial by Little and his colleagues, <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f6041\">published in the BMJ</a>, found patients with respiratory infections such as coughs, colds and sore throats who were prescribed ibuprofen rather than paracetamol by their GP were more likely to subsequently suffer severe illness or complications. Several other studies have linked anti-inflammatory drugs to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28005149\">worsened pneumonia</a>.</p> <p>Little said this could be because inflammation is part of the body\u2019s natural response to infection. \u201cIf you\u2019re suppressing that natural response, you\u2019re likely inhibiting your body\u2019s ability to fight off infection,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The evidence in this area was \u201cnot 100% clear\u201d and had not come directly from studies of patients with Covid-19, Little said. \u201cI personally think that given there is plausible evidence for harm, the advice should be changed.</p> <p>Should someone suffering from coronavirus with only ibuprofen in their bathroom cabinet grit their teeth and make do without? Little said despite the concerns, it would be reasonable to use ibuprofen as a last resort. For instance, if you were struggling to sleep, since getting enough rest is also important for recovery.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re desperate, particularly if you couldn\u2019t get to sleep at night,then I\u2019d take one,\u201d he said. Otherwise, he recommended sweating it out or asking a friend or family member to post some paracetamol through the letterbox.</p> <p>Charlotte Warren-Gash, an associate professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \u201cFor Covid-19, research is needed into the effects of specific NSAIDs among people with different underlying health conditions, which takes into account the severity of infection.</p> <p>\u201cIn the meantime, for treating symptoms such as fever and sore throat, it seems sensible to stick to paracetamol as first choice.\u201d</p> <p>Public Health England said there was currently insufficient information on ibuprofen use and Covid-19 to advise people to stop using ibuprofen. \u201cCurrently there is no published scientific evidence that ibuprofen increases the risk of catching Covid-19 or makes the illness worse. There is also no conclusive evidence that taking ibuprofen is harmful for other respiratory infections,\u201d it said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cMost people with Covid-19 will have a mild illness and some people may need to take medicines, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to help with raised temperature, headache and other pains; always follow the instructions on the label if you do take these medicines and do not exceed the stated dose.</p> <p>\u201cPatients who have been prescribed NSAIDs for long-term health problems should continue to take them as directed by their healthcare professional,\u201d the statement added.</p> <p>.</p>",

But if you look at the countries that we have highlighted, one concern we have in UK, in Switzerland, in Japan, it\u2019s not just about the numbers that they have reported.</p> <p>In the case of the UK it is rising very rapidly but it\u2019s not just about the numbers but the fact that these countries have abandoned any attempt at containing the spread of the virus. They have said so publicly, especially the UK and Switzerland, perhaps less so for Japan; but certainly in the case of the UK and Switzerland. I think the UK has been most public in acknowledging that there\u2019s no point containing and they are simply now at the phase of trying to delay the spread.</p> <p>So if there is no deliberate effort to contain then we anticipate that the numbers of infected cases in these countries will rise even more sharply in the coming days or weeks, and that\u2019s why we are quite concerned.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Macron to address France amid martial law rumours</h2> <p>Emmanuel Macron will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-live-updates-us-cdc-events-europe-lockdown-uk-deaths-australia-france-italy-spain-update-latest-news?page=with:block-5e6f56e58f085c6327bc0a20#block-5e6f56e58f085c6327bc0a20\">address an anxious France</a> on Monday night about the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters reports.</p> <p>According to the agency, Macron is to hold a meeting with his prime minister, top military adviser, intelligence coordinator and ministers of health, the interior and foreign affairs on the escalating health crisis, before giving a televised address at 8pm (7pm GMT).</p> <p>France has been gripped by rumours that the government is about to issue a decree stopping people from circulating and using the military to enforce it, that spread on social media on Sunday.</p>",
  "<p>In Franz Kafka\u2019s short story <a href=\"https://www.kafka-online.info/before-the-law.html\">Before the Law</a>, a man turns up at the gates of the law. He thinks that since the law is for everyone, he has a right to gain entrance, but meets a powerful gatekeeper who tells the man he must fight him in order to get in. The man prefers not to challenge the gatekeeper. He sits patiently outside the law, spending everything he has to win him over, making polite requests to be accepted but always failing to obtain permission.</p> <p>Kafka\u2019s story is a good metaphor for thinking about the relation between law and politics. The gates to the law are in theory always open. To be inside the law means to be recognised, represented and protected by the authorities that support and enforce it. Inclusion in the law, however, also requires fighting its gatekeepers, and doing so in the awareness that there are no guarantees of success. Law, in other words, depends on politics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/29/home-office-chief-sir-philip-rutnam-quits-over-priti-patel-bullying\">Home Office chief Sir Philip Rutnam quits over Priti Patel 'bullying'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Historically, the progressive left\u2019s position before the law has taken many forms including fighting its guardians, persuading them to compromise and identifying with them. But regardless of the differences of strategy, there was a shared awareness among both socialist and social-democratic movements and parties that gaining access to rights required an active struggle to challenge the status quo with a positive vision for social change. Democracy was not allegiance to a body of settled norms; it was the name of a process. With the help of that process, previously excluded groups of people - workers, women, people of colour - became subjects with rights. There was little inherently desirable or despicable about the rule of law, it was all down to whom the laws represented, and how.</p> <p>The struggle is not over, but progressives are in retreat. In the ongoing crisis of liberal democracy, only the new right seems to understand the relation between law and politics, often interpreting it in sinister ways. The right, ever more coherent in its ideology and disciplined in its organisation, is increasingly willing to challenge the guardians of the law through a relentless assault on the institutions on which the law relies to be enforced: the courts, the civil service, the press, multilateral institutions. Witness the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/29/home-office-chief-sir-philip-rutnam-quits-over-priti-patel-bullying\" title=\"\">resignation of Sir Philip Rutnam</a>, citing the involvement of the home secretary, Priti Patel, in a \u201cvicious and orchestrated briefing campaign\u201d against him and his colleagues. Or the revelations of Dominic Cummings\u2019s former plans for restructuring the BBC to turn it into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/21/dominic-cummings-thinktank-called-for-end-of-bbc-in-current-form\">British equivalent of Fox News</a>. Or the tirade of the recently appointed attorney general Suella Braverman against the Human Rights Act, and her remarks about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/new-attorney-general-wanted-to-take-back-control-from-courts\" title=\"\">taking power back</a> from the courts.</p> <p>This is not only happening in Britain. If anything, the advance of the rightwing executive in Britain is still in its baby steps. All around the world, from Poland and Hungary to the US, from Brazil to India, the right\u2019s assault on the rule of law, the related undermining of civil servants, judges and civil society activists, its censoring of the press, are all part of a campaign to exert the executive over all other branches of the state. Its ultimate aim is to turn the law into an instrument of rightwing politics, to disempower those who would still see it as a vehicle of social emancipation. What seemed a few years ago like isolated cases of attacks on minority rights, as with Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s campaign to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/hungary-passes-anti-immigrant-stop-soros-laws\" title=\"\">restrict</a> NGOs\u2019 ability to assist with asylum claims or the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-roma/hungarians-march-to-protest-pm-orbans-anti-roma-campaign-idUSKCN20H0GB\" title=\"\">ongoing segregation</a> of Roma people, are now going mainstream. Think about the dramatic rise in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/01/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-first-year-voices\" title=\"\">assassinations</a> of social activists \u2013 particularly black and indigenous people \u2013 in the months following the election of Jair Bolsonaro as Brazil\u2019s president. Or the brutal violence to which members of Muslim communities have been subjected in India, following Narendra Modi\u2019s divisive amendments of citizenship laws.</p> <p>The right\u2019s offensive on the rule of law is not surprising. Attacking the constitution, mocking abstract human rights, discrediting universal citizenship as little more than a dangerous illusion, are familiar tropes of traditional conservative thinking: from Edmund Burke\u2019s critique of the French revolution, to Joseph De Maistre\u2019s hostility to constitutionalism, to Carl Schmitt\u2019s celebration of the power of the executive to suspend legal norms. The conservative answer to the contradictions of modern societies has always been to invoke a mythical past of cultural homogeneity, and unflinching respect for the authority of tradition.</p> <p>In contrast, the left is failing. It is failing because the mainstream left has either forgotten or failed to communicate the lessons the new right has learned from it: it has abandoned the critique of capitalism, the language of class, the need for political education. It has also abandoned all efforts at international coordination with regard to strategy, means and goals. It has turned liberal parliamentary democracy into an end in itself, while losing all nuance of what the state is for, and why we need the law.</p> <p>This is not surprising. The left is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/01/labour-leadership-contest-new-factions\" title=\"\">plural and divided</a>, not just on whom to fight, but also over what, and how. On the face of these divisions, it is natural to find common ground in the protection from assault of existing laws and institutions. It is even more understandable when one has helped to shape these institutions, attempting to make them more inclusive over the decades. It is easier to celebrate individual paladins of the law, such as Lady Hale or Gina Miller, than to create the collective political force required to challenge the liberal consensus.</p> <p>The right has managed to both reappropriate its tradition and renew itself by displacing its own crumbling centre. Reluctant to do the same, the left is losing. It is losing because it has divorced politics from law. Righteous outrage is no substitute for political action. If people think all politicians are corrupt, they are not going to miss them on the Today programme. If laws are widely seen as a tool in the hands of self-serving elites, nobody is going to feel sorry when judges are called traitors, or sympathise with bullied civil servants. The assault on legality will continue to have legitimacy.</p> <p>To win, we must not passively defend the rule of law, but actively change how we do politics. The challenge lies in connecting the law \u2013 an abstract, seemingly eternal body of rules \u2013 to the realm of politics, to show which rules are worth changing and which are worth fighting for.</p> <p>By the end of Kafka\u2019s story, the man who seeks entrance to the law has become a friend of the gatekeeper. As his death nears, he wonders what would have happened if he had tried to fight. When he is drawing his last breath, the guardian leaves, and the gates of the law are permanently shut. Will the left escape his fate? There is hope, but only just.</p> <p>\u2022 Lea Ypi is a professor in political theory at the London School of Economics</p>",

Do not read unless you have watched season three, episode one.</em></p> <p>Pity poor Jurgen Klopp. Not only has the football season been suspended with his Liverpool team on the verge of the title, but he has also been murdered by an android looking for access to a super-powerful artificial intelligence. Or, at least, someone who looks <em>a lot</em> like him has.</p> <p>The hair, the specs, heck, the German accent were a little discombobulating, but then that is Westworld for you. The sci-fi drama that often seems to revel in its ability to baffle viewers is back for a third run, and this time it has gone well and truly off the reservation.</p> <p>In the opening scene, we see the Klopp-a-like murdered by an android once known as Dolores. Soon we see the same robot pitching up at a tech company in Los Angeles called Incite, apparently the new beau of an executive called Liam. Their relationship doesn\u2019t look as if it is set for life \u2013 Dolores is more interested in the AI developed by Liam\u2019s dad than his affection. By the end of the episode, she is up to her elbows in the blood of Incite employees.</p> <p>The last shot of the hour sees Dolores collapsed in the arms of a former soldier by the name of Caleb. I\u2019ll admit, when Aaron Paul appeared on screen, wearily getting out of bed in a dystopian (but lovely and sunny) LA, I let out a little cheer. For all the plot machinations of previous series, Westworld had a significant gap where the heart should have been. Already, Paul has changed the tone.</p> <p>He is also our guide through a significant new aspect to the story. For most of the first two seasons, the action was confined to Westworld, the theme park and AI lab. This season, we move into the world outside. Caleb is our guide, a former soldier on his uppers, both in terms of cash and mental health. We see him being given counselling to deal with his trauma. The problem is that the counselling is compulsory and, if Caleb drops out, his \u201cscore\u201d will drop.</p> <p>That score, perhaps a twist by the creators Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan on the social credit system being rolled out in real-life China, is a means of structuring society. Without a good score, you can\u2019t get a good job; without a good job you cannot legally survive; without a good score, all that is left for you is taking on random criminal activity. It is arranged through an app called Rico and Caleb is a registered user.</p> <p>It is because he takes on a Rico job (it is a \u201cpersonal\u201d \u2013 code for assault or murder, and he feels tricked into doing it) that Caleb finds himself holding Dolores in his arms at the end. He is not the first man to have taken pity on her, of course. In previous series, both cowboy Teddy and enthusiastic Westworld tourist William have held her in their arms, assuming they were consoling a delicate victim and not being entrapped by a powerful protagonist.

Bernard, who shares brain space with a similated Dr Robert Ford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Home Box Office (HBO)/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I enjoyed seeing a new world laid out, one with electrified clothing, designer drugs, driverless motorbikes and nightclubs that seem halfway between an orgy and an art school graduate show. Oblivious to all this, however, is Bernard, the android host who came the closest to being the show\u2019s conscience in the first two seasons.</p> <p>Bernard, who should really be known as Fornard, as he shares brain space with a simulated version of Westworld\u2019s founder, Dr Robert Ford (I know, it is complicated), has been working as a labourer on a farm that is a combination of the bucolic west and terrifying agro-gigantism. Tending to calves, then carving massive trunks of lab meat, it is a calm-enough life, but eventually Bernard has to quit it when he is recognised by two colleagues as the man responsible for the massacre of 113 people.</p> <p>That massacre, of course, was the reckoning that took place in Westworld last season, as the robots faced off against the humans (and won rather convincingly) in the park. Bernard was not responsible for it; if anything, he was trying to protect his fellow robots from harm. But that is by the by now, so Bernard presses a button, releases his inner Ford and murders his accusers before they can nab him.</p> <p>By the end of the hour, Fornard is boarding a Chinese fishing boat, set for a return to Westworld. He is going there to look for a friend, whose identity is unknown. It may well be Maeve, another noble robot who was killed in the last series, but has appeared in the trailers for this one. Whoever it is, the audience \u2013 as ever \u2013 is in need of answers.</p> <h2>Divergence and anomalies</h2> <p>\u2022 Who is occupying Charlotte Hale?

  "<p>When it comes to exercise, we all know about bottom-sculpting squats, leg- strengthening lunges, and arm-toning lifts. And why wouldn\u2019t we? After all, these exercises focus on our \u201cmirror muscles\u201d \u2013 you know, the ones we see when we look in the mirror. But what about those quick pelvic floor exercises that strengthen muscles you <em>don\u2019t</em> see? You do those too, right? Well, it\u2019s fair to say that, like ironing bed linen, it doesn\u2019t seem worth the bother. For some reason, it\u2019s always seemed a bit extra to be exercising muscles you can\u2019t see, hoping, somehow, it\u2019ll benefit you in a way you\u2019re unsure about.</p> <p>But the truth is that we need to look after all aspects of our fitness \u2013 and this includes muscles we can\u2019t see but totally and utterly rely on. \u201cPelvic floors become a hot topic in pregnancy when women are told to do their exercises and later in life when there can be more continence issues, but it appears that often the understanding of the pelvic floor stops here,\u201d says Rochelle Herz, a physiotherapist.</p> <p>The first thing you need to know? That, essentially, these muscles are the foundations of your body, forming a hammock that supports your uterus, bladder and bowel, and in their most basic form, stop these organs from falling out, something that\u2019s known as prolapse. But they do other magic behind the scenes, too, such as preventing urinary stress incontinence that can happen when you laugh, sneeze or exercise. Heck, they\u2019re even important for your sex life because an orgasm is actually a series of muscle contractions. This means the stronger your pelvic floor, the stronger your pelvic floor convulsions, and therefore the more powerful your orgasm. Who knew?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/labs/2020/tena/tena.html\" data-alt=\"exercise info\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/labs/2020/tena/tena.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">exercise info</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>Inner fitness</strong></h2> <p>The trouble is that few of us appreciate how important our pelvic floor is \u2013 until it stops working properly, that is. An estimated one in three women will suffer from urinary stress incontinence, which happens when muscles become weak and the neck of your bladder doesn\u2019t always stay closed under stress, which leads to urine leaks. This can happen when you sneeze, have a fit of giggles, or when you\u2019re coughing, running or jumping. What\u2019s more, you might be problem-free now, but that can change \u2013 even if you haven\u2019t, or aren\u2019t planning on, giving birth. Because although it\u2019s true that problems most commonly occur after childbirth when the pelvic floor weakens, and in menopause when low oestrogen levels can lead to thinning of the tissues in the pelvis, they aren\u2019t the only troublemakers.</p> <p>\u201cProblems can happen at any time in our life,\u201d says Prof Dharani Hapangama, consultant gynaecological surgeon at the University of Liverpool and researcher at women\u2019s health research charity Wellbeing of Women. \u201cConstipation from low fibre or a poor diet can cause problems with our pelvic floor, as can chronic coughing or sneezing, which you might experience as a result of conditions such as hay fever or as a result of smoking. Being overweight can increase your risk of problems, too.\u201d</p> <p>But the other big obstacle when it comes to keeping our pelvic floors healthy is that we don\u2019t talk about them. While we\u2019ve reached a point where we can talk more openly about sex, periods and the menopause, there still seems to be a secrecy surrounding our pelvic floors. \u201cMost women don\u2019t give their pelvic floor any thought unless they have incontinence or prolapse, but that needs to change,\u201d says Tania Adib, a consultant gynaecologist at the Medical Chambers Kensington in London.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to break down barriers and create more open conversations about the role of our pelvic floor so that women can not only recognise problems and get the help they need, but know what can prevent problems in the future. There needs to be more awareness of gynaecological issues from a younger age, with school-age children being made aware that we use our pelvic floor when we go to the loo, to control urine, and to get acquainted with their pelvic floor in general, so that women can talk more freely about their body parts as they age.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dbbd2155bc75c3237a5889c477b7698b42ea58aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbbd2155bc75c3237a5889c477b7698b42ea58aa/0_0_944_772/500.png\" alt=\"yoga mat stretch\" width=\"500\" height=\"409\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Feel the squeeze</strong></h2> <p>Ultimately, we all need to take a not-seen-nor-forgotten approach to our pelvic floor, and exercise it just like any other muscle in the body. And pelvic floor exercises are proven to work, not only helping to protect you against future problems but also to send nagging symptoms packing. \u201cPelvic floor exercises should be done throughout your life \u2013 men as well \u2013 and not just during life stages associated with hormonal changes,\u201d says Herz.</p> <p>As with so many things in life, a little-but-often approach is the key. To make it a daily habit, identify something you do regularly \u2013 whether that\u2019s washing your hands, making a morning coffee, or putting on makeup \u2013 and tag your pelvic floor exercises on to them. The app <a href=\"https://www.tena.co.uk/lightsbytena/tips-and-training/pelvic-floor-fitness-app\" rel=\"nofollow\">MyPFF</a> is great if you need a reminder \u2013 it also includes exercise tutorials.</p> <p>On top of this, avoid getting constipated. Although it might seem unrelated to bladder health, if you\u2019re blocked up, this will put an added layer of stress on your pelvic floor muscles, which, over time, can cause problems. \u201cEat a healthy, balanced diet with plenty of fibre and ensure you drink enough liquid so that you avoid constipation and have regular bowel habits,\u201d says Adib. \u201cExercises such as pilates and yoga can potentially be beneficial, too, as you are often encouraged to engage your pelvic floor in the classes. Being more mindful of your pelvic floor in general, being aware of it working, can only be a good thing.\u201d</p> <p>Are you having problems with your pelvic floor, or feel as if exercises aren\u2019t working? Talk to your GP, as they can refer you to a women\u2019s health physiotherapist, who can help you learn how to engage and relax your pelvic floor properly. Likewise, if something down there just doesn\u2019t feel right, you\u2019re suffering from pelvic pain, pressure or heaviness, see your GP to get other health issues ruled out and advice that\u2019s tailored to your needs. It\u2019s time to start a pelvic floor revolution.</p> <p><em>As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

  "<p>Juggling work and kids is always a challenge, but now with the coronavirus shutting down schools, Dusti Arab knows she\u2019s facing a reckoning. A mother of two living in the greater Portland, Oregon, area, Arab had just stopped working in an office and was looking forward to being able to focus on the small marketing agency she runs from her home when coronavirus hit. \u201cThis thing destroyed everything I had going on,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything\u2019s a disaster here.\u201d</p> \n<p>So far she has had to cancel a long-held vacation plan to Europe and figure out how to accommodate her kids on what she now expects will be a very extended spring break. \u201cMy kids go to two different schools and are in different districts, so I\u2019m managing a lot, trying to make sure my family and extended family are prepared for this,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Her husband, who typically works out of an office in downtown Portland, will also be working from home for at least the next two weeks, per company mandate \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t fix her problems. \u201cHe\u2019s great with helping with rides and getting the kids back and forth,\u201d she said, \u201cbut this is primarily going to fall on my shoulders.\u201d</p> \n<p>Arab is one of millions of women who will find themselves needing to step up their roles at home as the coronavirus spreads. Study after study has shown that even as women have stepped forward in the workforce, in married heterosexual couples women still shoulder the bulk of household chores. (A Gallup poll from January found women were more than seven times as likely to care for their children on a daily basis as men in heterosexual married or cohabitating couples.)

Under current laws, powered transport must fall into one of three broad categories: cars and motorcycles, which require licences, MOT checks and registration; electric bikes, which are effectively treated as normal bicycles provided they are pedal-assist; and electric wheelchairs and mobility scooters, which have a special allowance to be used on pavements.</p> <p>The trial will assess what new restrictions should be put in place, such as a minimum age for riders, speed limits, licensing, insurance and helmets.</p> <p>Other topics include minimum design standards, whether they should be allowed in cycle lanes, and what powers local authorities should have to manage e-scooter hire firms.</p> <p>The absence of legislation enabling legal use of e-scooters on public roads has not prevented them being sold in Britain, however.

It involves the <strong>central bank buying up government bonds </strong>and other financial assets from banks and pensions funds, thereby <strong>flooding the system with liquidity</strong>. The hope is that the financial institutions will use the extra funds to increase lending to households and businesses.<br></p> \n  <p>It\u2019s often referred to as a \u201cmoney printing scheme\u201d because although the money used to buy the bonds is electronic and not printed notes, those funds are nevertheless simply created by the central bank at the push of a button.</p> \n  <p>We don\u2019t know yet how much the RBA scheme will be worth but it will run into billions of dollars. When the Bank of England started the scheme in the GFC, it racked up \u00a3375bn (A$750bn) over three years before it stopped in late 2012. The US Fed reached US$4.5tn in its first five years. Japan\u2019s total is also in the trillions.</p> \n  <p><strong>So what does it mean and how has this come about?</strong></p> \n  <p>This is an extraordinary, radical measure used by central banks in the US, UK, Europe and Japan in the past decade to prop up the financial system in the wake of the global financial crisis.</p> \n  <p>Back then, the mechanics of the system seized up as billions of dollars worth of financial instruments were exposed as worthless and bank after bank collapsed. Central banks cut interest rates to flood the system with cheap money but when that failed to stem the crisis, notably when the mighty investment bank Lehman Brothers crashed, they got together and launched QE.<br></p> \n  <p>It was considered an emergency measure but despite attempts to wind back the scheme, especially by the US Fed, the schemes have underpinned western economies ever since. The massive amount of cheap money unleashed by the schemes has inflated asset bubbles all over the world, with stock markets reaching all-time highs as recently as February. Attempts to deflate the bubbles met with panic in the financial markets \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/01/the-liquidity-timebomb-fiscal-policies-have-created-a-dangerous-paradox\">notably the Fed taper tantrum fiasco.</a></p> \n  <p>This time around it\u2019s a different problem because the economy itself is seizing up as normal daily activity grinds to a halt across the world. But the response of central banks is the same because all of them \u2013 including the RBA \u2013 have already cut rates as far as they can in recent years and have no alternative except to unleash QE and hope that it reassures investors that they will prop up the system \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/22/what-is-quantitative-easing\">What is quantitative easing?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T02:12:58.302Z\">at 2.12am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6eda468f085e564ad84b48\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T01:50:39.168Z\">1.50am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>National Gallery of Australia, in Canberra, will suspend tours</strong>, school visits, events and talks \u2013 but will remain open. </p> \n  <p>In an email to members, the gallery said that the suspension would last at least four weeks. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T01:53:25.583Z\">at 1.53am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6ed97f8f085e564ad84b3f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T01:43:21.376Z\">1.43am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Bluesfest</strong>, a NSW music festival due to host Patti Smith, Crowded House and Dave Matthews Band,<strong> has been cancelled today</strong>.

Its title reminded me irresistibly of one of Finch\u2019s earlier poems, <a href=\"http://www.peterfinch.co.uk/foodrevs.htm\">Going on TV</a>, in which the speaker is asked by a taxi driver about his topic. \u201cPoetry, I say / I pronounce it poultry so as not to sound too arty.\u201d Perhaps there are other fishy allusions in the current title which, flailing in my English fog, I\u2019ve missed, but still, the notion of the poet\u2019s name being got wrong by an earnestly admiring biographer, and producing new species of piscine modernism, is appealing, even if ultimately off the point.</p> <p>The nonchalant, almost dismissive tone of the introduction might signal a voice close to the poet\u2019s own. Self-denigration, mock-self-denigration, pride in the denigrators getting things maddeningly or hilariously wrong, interplay slyly throughout. From the pleasantly bizarre, defiantly \u201carty\u201d self-mockery of the fish-list, we shift to responses by \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ormond\">Ormond</a>\u201d to the artist as a young radical. The comments are both jolly and barbed. They wouldn\u2019t be funny if the reader (and the late John Ormond) didn\u2019t know that Finch had gone on to prove his worth, and enjoy, if not the last laugh, a cheerfully long-lasting one \u2013 in publications and readings spanning from the late 1960s to the present. We know this, and the subject of the comments knows it, of course. Poets with time-diluted memories of their own rejection slips may be best placed to appreciate it all.</p> <p>The old joke about the greengrocer\u2019s apostrophe in line 10 is refreshed by the daft comparison to John Cage. Monkeys and typewriters are less original, and suggest critical impatience. I found the first and last of the haul of insults the funniest: \u201cYou\u2019ve energy, Finch, but / they\u2019ll not put that on your grave\u201d and \u201cBeer mats, they read better, boy\u201d. The first is witty: the last has a joshing, genial tone some of the others lack. If we read the poem autobiographically, the so-called \u201camateur magazine\u201d was the seminal <a href=\"http://www.peterfinch.co.uk/2ndaeon.htm\">Second Aeon</a>.</p> <p>The Welsh language provides the critical hook in next stanza, centred on a list of the kinds of words \u201cFinch has never used\u201d \u2013 an interesting mixture. While in the print collection, as here, the French has a footnoted English translation, there\u2019s no help offered with the Welsh: a bilingual readership is assumed. The words and their rough, or possibly downright wrong, translations are <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bwthyn\">Bwthyn</a> \u2013 a small cottage or shelter; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llanbradach\">Llanbradach</a> \u2013 the village that\u2019s known in English as The Brad; <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cariad\">Cariad</a> \u2013 love, beloved; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiraeth\">Hiraeth</a> \u2013 longing; Pysgodyn \u2013 fish (noun, singular). A fish had to be there, of course. Other words (such as \u201ccariad\u201d) suggest an in-joke: they might have been picked out to expose some ignorant dabbler in Cymraeg asserting dubious authenticity.</p> <p>Finch the sonic dismantler emerges in the next section, fielding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/feb/05/poetry.culture\">the Frenchman</a>\u2019s romantic compliment, \u201cpiling on the micro-particles\u201d and morphing through homonyms to an explosion of percussive sound effects. The vocal recovery brings sharpened clarity: \u201cChopin, this is / an incorrect claim. Wales is a nation of / standard-stoppages / engaging with pasteurised modernism / forty years outside the frame.\u201d Is the speaker including himself in the criticism?</p> <p>\u201cI sound now like Kingsley Amis,\u201d he remarks of the above passage, \u201cit\u2019s come to this at last.\u201d These lines are clearly not informed by any <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Movement\">Movement technique or ideology</a> (the claim/frame rhyme notwithstanding): the tone of disapproval, calling out a \u201cpasteurised modernism / forty years outside the frame\u201d, implies an avant garde position. That bone-stuck-in-throat term, \u201cstandard-stoppages\u201d, alluding to Marcel Duchamp\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/duchamp-3-stoppages-etalon-3-standard-stoppages-t07507\">experiments to imprison and preserve forms</a>\u201d, may be the vital clue. And, of course, moaning about lost \u201cstandards\u201d is a popular sport for almost any establishment. Even anarchists do it.</p> <p>The final anecdote is a nice one. Finch\u2019s touch is light: the speaker isn\u2019t on the attack, and the terse, <a href=\"https://genius.com/Cole-porter-miss-otis-regrets-lyrics\">Miss Otis-like</a> dignity of the Amis response is wholly unobjectionable. All the outlived poets in Fish seem at least respected by the speaker: some, such as Chopin and Ormond, are honoured.</p> <p>Peter Finch continues to make iconoclastic works that sparkle and spit, notwithstanding some now long-established experimental forms. His new collection is a painfully joyful achievement \u2013 not only in its command of various genres, including concrete poetry and the sombre-comic anecdote, but also in the ability to unite his variety of singing fish in the net of a single poem.</p> <p>Some links to enjoy: Peter Finch <a href=\"http://www.peterfinch.co.uk/cardiff.htm\">on Real Cardiff</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lED7QLDLz9E\">performing The Way It Grows</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Not long ago, a heavily pregnant woman walked into Kizzy Gardiner\u2019s office in desperation. She was homeless, with nowhere to sleep that night, and had approached her local MP\u2019s staff because she didn\u2019t know where else to go.</p> <p>\u201cThat was one of those things where you\u2019re like: \u2018I\u2019m going to have to put her in my spare room,\u2019\u201d says Gardiner, the former head of fundraising for an international development charity. But after an afternoon hitting the phones, eventually the team found her somewhere to stay. \u201cThe most rewarding bit is when you get those wins for people \u2013 when we get to use the power of the MP\u2019s office to do something positive.\u201d</p> <p>It is stories like this that not only keep MPs awake in the small hours, but also make it exceptionally hard for them to take time off when they\u2019re pregnant themselves. Who would want cases like this slipping through the cracks? Yet what Gardiner is doing has the potential to change all that. She is parliament\u2019s first ever maternity locum, hired only after a considerable bureaucratic struggle to cover the Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy\u2019s constituency work while Creasy takes time off with her newborn daughter, Hettie. Unsurprisingly, Gardiner is very aware of how much it matters to make this work.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s great that my role exists, but it\u2019s been a huge battle and there\u2019s no commitment to doing it again,\u201d she says, sipping tea in Creasy\u2019s Walthamstow office. \u201cI could be the first and the last.\u201d</p> <p>When she first found out Creasy was looking for a locum, she almost didn\u2019t apply. \u201cI vaguely thought about putting an application in but then I was like: \u2018Oh no, what are the chances? She\u2019ll know somebody,\u2019\u201d says Gardiner, 35. She lives in Walthamstow and is a local party member but hadn\u2019t met Creasy before. She let herself be talked into it by friends, she says, partly because \u201cit had never been done before. So I thought, \u2018I\u2019m probably not going to be definitely not the right person, because who knows what that person is?\u2019\u201d Besides, she liked the description of the job as \u201crooted in Walthamstow, not in Westminster\u201d.</p> <p>Gardiner can\u2019t vote or speak on Creasy\u2019s behalf in parliament, since she is not elected, although she does meet other MPs to discuss constituency cases in which they have a common interest and she lobbies ministers on behalf of constituents. (Creasy\u2019s voting duties in the Commons are covered by the Labour MP Peter Kyle, who exercises a proxy vote on her behalf.) Her main role is as the public face of the MP in her east London patch, doing everything from running weekly surgeries to keeping Creasy\u2019s national political campaigns ticking over on issues such as domestic violence. </p> <p>She regularly finds herself making up the rules as she goes along: \u201cSomething that I\u2019ve learned is about just stepping into spaces and waiting for the challenge, especially in a role like this where it\u2019s brand new. People don\u2019t know what it means, so you have to just go for it. If people don\u2019t want you to be there, you will find out soon enough.\u201d</p> <p>Nobody has yet refused to deal with her because she isn\u2019t the \u201creal\u201d MP, she says. \u201cI think some people are shocked, but people handle it very differently.\u201d Most constituents take it in their stride once they realise she can still help them: \u201cA lot of it is in the proof of doing the work.\u201d She works full-time hours, a rough indication of how hard Creasy must have pushed heself when she was doing parliamentary and political work on top of casework.</p> <p>The big surprise has been the range of problems on which Gardiner is expected to be an instant expert. \u201cThe breadth of stuff people come in with is mind-boggling. We get a lot of \u2018Can you fix my bins?\u2019 or \u2018Can you make sure there\u2019s speed bumps in my road because it\u2019s dangerous?\u2019, and we get a lot of complaints about antisocial behaviour.\u201d Strictly speaking, many of these are questions for local councillors, not MPs, but Gardiner says it is often about advocating for people who don\u2019t feel they have got anywhere with the council. And then there are the deeper problems: \u201cWe get a lot of housing issues, we get a lot of immigration issues. Mostly people will come to us when they feel they hit a brick wall.\u201d</p> <p>Gardiner, who has a four-year-old daughter, job-shared in her previous role and thinks that experience of working alongside someone else helps with a delicate balancing act, poised somewhere between trying to second-guess what Creasy would be doing if she was here and simply being herself. \u201cI\u2019m definitely trying to follow the lead that Stella has set because ultimately it\u2019s her seat, her job, her community that I\u2019m filling in for. But I also bring my own experience.\u201d</p> <p>She and Creasy confer regularly by text and WhatsApp, keeping each other up to date: Gardiner may need to know how Creasy is using her proxy vote on upcoming legislation so that she can explain to constituents, and in return feeds back things she picks up that might influence Creasy\u2019s decisions. Might more permanent job-sharing one day be a viable option for MPs, with the role split between one person in the constituency and one in Westminster? \u201cI think it could be.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdb43a925b26499a890ae19ceac622358f715046\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdb43a925b26499a890ae19ceac622358f715046/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stella Creasy with Hettie on election night\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stella Creasy with Hettie on election night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicola Tree/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I speak to a clearly thrilled Creasy by phone, with baby Hettie squawking happily in the background, she says she knew the arrangement was working when Gardiner told her about the homeless pregnant woman. \u201cI have to be able to trust that Kizzy\u2019s going to make the right choices, and when she told me about that, I thought: \u2018That\u2019s exactly why I picked you \u2013 that\u2019s what I would have done,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cKizzy doesn\u2019t pretend to be me \u2013 she\u2019s Kizzy, but she\u2019s doing that role.\u201d</p> <p>Having suffered a string of miscarriages before having her daughter, Creasy is clearly personally grateful to Gardiner for the time she now has with her baby. But she is also grateful on behalf of her constituents. \u201cThe thought of having fought for so long to get pregnant, and all the pain and misery that goes with that, and either not being able to spend some time with her or being worried because we all care about our constituents \u2026 We\u2019ve got a knife crime epidemic in my constituency right now; I didn\u2019t want to say: \u2018Right, for six months you\u2019re on your own.\u2019 I spoke to colleagues from other political parties [about maternity leave] and one was describing hiding and hoping her constituents didn\u2019t notice. That\u2019s not feasible in Walthamstow.\u201d</p> <p>None of it has been plain sailing, however. New parents in parliament have had the right to a proxy vote, meaning they needn\u2019t physically walk through the lobbies to express a view on legislation, since last year (although it came only after widespread public indignation at the sight of the Labour MP Tulip Siddiq voting in a wheelchair on the day she was supposed to be giving birth). But until now, there has been no such cover for constituency work, meaning Siddiq was straight back to doing casework three days after a C-section.</p> <p>Creasy spent months locked in a pitched battle with the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), the parliamentary agency responsible for MPs\u2019 expenses including staff costs. It agreed to pay for maternity cover in her constituency only after she went public about the miscarriages she had suffered and her fear of losing this baby too. It was, to put it mildly, a lonely battle. While Theresa May wrote to Ipsa from Downing Street in support of her claim, all Creasy will say of the response from the senior reaches of her own party is: \u201cThe Labour party was the most sceptical and resistant. That was a surprise to me, to say the least.\u201d</p> <p>The final twist in tale is that three weeks before she was due to hand over to Gardiner, Boris Johnson called a snap general election. Since it was Stella Creasy the people of Walthamstow were choosing whether or not to elect, she had no choice but to postpone her maternity leave and hit the campaign trail at eight months pregnant. She was back out chasing votes three days after giving birth and delivered her acceptance speech on election night with the baby in a sling. There are still things Creasy can\u2019t delegate even now \u2013 only an MP can table an amendment to legislation in the Commons, which helps explain why last week Creasy was chairing a parliamentary seminar on moves to make misogyny a hate crime \u2013 and she has chosen to make occasional TV appearances and attend some events locally. She sees these as her equivalent of the \u201ckeeping in touch\u201d days available to women on conventional maternity leave.</p> <p>Having been initially put off politics by dabbling in the student version of it, which she remembers as \u201ca lot of sitting around and arguing about stuff, not a lot of doing\u201d, Gardiner agrees that covering maternity leave could be the ideal test run for women considering a political career in their own right. But she still isn\u2019t sure whether she wants to try for her own seat after Creasy returns in June. \u201cIt\u2019s a big role and there\u2019s a lot for me to learn \u2026 Would I want to do it again? I don\u2019t know, is the honest answer. At the moment, I\u2019m just focusing on trying to do this job well.\u201d</p> <p>She admits to having thought hard about the implications for her family of covering for an MP in the current climate of threats against politicians (Creasy herself has faced attempts to deselect her by hard-left activists, death threats from the far right and an intimidating campaign locally by anti-abortion activists protesting against her successful bid to establish abortion rights for women in Northern Ireland). Eventually, Gardiner decided it was worth it, knowing that when the six months are over \u201cI could always shut down Twitter and run away\u201d, but it is clear she finds what she calls \u201cthe public ownership thing\u201d the most testing part of the job.</p> <p>So would she be a locum again? When Boris Johnson announced that his fiancee Carrie Symonds was expecting a baby this summer, Gardiner tweeted tongue-in-cheek that she was happy to cover if needed. But beneath the joke was a serious point: it is not only female MPs who could benefit from cover for parental leave or even serious illness, and both she and Creasy are keen this shouldn\u2019t be a one-off.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why people aren\u2019t pushing harder for it,\u201d says Gardiner, who is worried that female politicians still daren\u2019t risk being seen to need help. \u201cThere are other countries that do this successfully; we\u2019re trialling it at the moment and it\u2019s working well.\u201d She is keeping notes on what she has learned in case they are useful to anyone else in future, but says so far the parliamentary authorities haven\u2019t shown much interest. Any MP seeking a similar arrangement will need to apply all over again to Ipsa, with no guarantee of acceptance.</p> <p>While she still finds it \u201cunreal\u201d that in 2020 politicians have no automatic right to maternity leave, it surprises Gardiner less now that she has seen the system up close. \u201cWhen you walk around Westminster it\u2019s just steeped in history; everything is designed for hundreds of years ago. You look at the pictures and it\u2019s all old white men. It just makes you realise why it\u2019s not at the forefront of everybody\u2019s minds.\u201d Perhaps the arrival of a new baby in Downing Street could be more of a tipping point than we think.</p>",
  "<p>Tonia Martinez doesn\u2019t remember the last time she voted \u2013 she guesses it was about two decades ago. The Florida native\u2019s first brush with the prison system was in 1992 but she said her real struggle started in 2010 when she was convicted of a felony and sentenced to 19 months in a Broward county facility.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/florida-primary-tuesday-coronavirus-fears\">Florida: coronavirus fears could hurt voter turnout in crucial primary</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>When she was released she did everything she was supposed to do: she paid her court fees and got a job at an Ihop closer to her hometown in Palmetto, Florida. Getting her voting rights back was hard. Returning citizens, as people in her situation are known, had to fill out paperwork and be individually granted clemency from the governor.</p> \n<p>Martinez, who is now 51, spent months trying to get her voting rights back.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is something my ancestors fought for,\u201d she said. But every time she sent in a form, or wrote an email, she was told there was another step or another problem.</p> \n<p>\u201cI read somewhere about even if you\u2019ve did your time, paid your fines, and you want to become an active part of the community, the chances of the governor granting you clemency was little to none,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I gave up.\u201d</p> \n<p>That changed at the end of 2018, when Florida <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/09/florida-amendment-4-felons-voting-rights-response-activists\">passed</a> a constitutional amendment granting people with prior felony convictions the right to vote after they complete their sentence, including parole and probation. Amendment 4, as it often called, gives an estimated 1.4 million people the right to vote.</p> \n<p>This Tuesday, as millions of Floridians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/florida-primary-tuesday-coronavirus-fears\">head to the polls for the presidential primary</a>, the impact of amendment 4 will be visible for the first time on such a scale. In a state where elections are often won by razor-thin margins, that could mean changing the political makeup of Florida, as well as offering another pathway for people leaving the prison system to re-entering their community.</p> \n<p>\u201cI expect there to be an increase in the 2020 primary turnout,\u201d said US representative Darren Soto, who represents a swath of central Florida that includes Orlando. \u201cThe returning citizens should be voting in high numbers.\u201d</p> \n<p>But there are still barriers for people with prior felony convictions. For one, the Republican legislature\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/16/florida-amendment-4-ruling-voting-rights\">attempts</a> to place restrictions on the law \u2013 such as requiring former felons to pay off all court fines and fees associated with their sentence \u2013 have created confusion.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll never know the size of that group that was made eligible but was deterred,\u201d said Marc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project, a criminal justice advocacy group in Washington DC.</p> \n<p>The confusion affects election officials too. Earlier this year the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/09/florida-voting-rights-felons-amendement-4\">reported</a> that Florida\u2019s supervisors of elections were still unclear as to which crimes were exempt from the law. States with similar laws often decide that some crimes \u2013 such as murder or rape \u2013 mean losing voting rights permanently.</p> \n<p>Some returning citizens are also grappling with the registration process, which can prove confusing for any Florida residents who change address or party affiliation.</p> \n<p>Tracey Washington was an avid voter until 2017, when she was convicted of a fraud-related felony at her workplace in Manatee county and sentenced to six months in prison. She said it was a particularly difficult time: her father was incarcerated when she was young and she had experienced the trauma her family suffered.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat six months was very \u2013 I don\u2019t know what word to use for it \u2013 it was an experience,\u201d she said. \u201cI was away from my kids, from my grandchildren. It just really drained me mentally.\u201d</p> \n<p>When Washington was released earlier this year, she was embarrassed but relieved and started rebuilding her life. She paid her court fees of $646 and started working part-time at a dry cleaners. She lives with her extended family, is saving money to rent her own apartment again and has started a not-for-profit for children with incarcerated parents.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a84a02ba-1ab5-4612-bbc3-30ad94a4935a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8QfsnG00j7s?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>She has also tried to register to vote, but she hasn\u2019t received her voter registration card or any confirmation. Since she doesn\u2019t see any barriers after amendment 4 that would stop her, she plans to go to the polling center in Manatee county in order to cast her ballot. She\u2019s hoping things go smoothly.</p> \n<p>Mauer said it was difficult to tell how many people like Washington and Martinez, who are eligible to vote, will actually be able to vote in this election. While amendment 4 has garnered lots of attention, he said, turnout may not immediately reflect the change.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven at best, it\u2019s going to be a small fraction of the more than 1 million who potentially could be eligible,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>For Martinez, her new right to vote is something she is protecting. She chose her Democratic affiliation by weighing the issues and political platforms and watching the news at home. And she\u2019s going to the polling station on Tuesday to vote for who she thinks will make the country a more humane place to live.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor me it\u2019s about the treatment of people \u2013 millions of people,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>When news of the coronavirus broke at the end of last year, and as the stories from the outbreak became more alarming over time, I found myself wondering how health anxiety sufferers were coping.</p> <p>You see, I used to be one. In late 2015, I suffered a post-traumatic stress disorder relapse which led to debilitating anxiety, much of which was health-related. During that period, I was paralyzed by the thought of becoming ill and dying. I was constantly checking for symptoms and signs of disease online and I was fixated on the health of my loved ones.</p> <p>After treatment, including trauma-focused CBT, I almost completely recovered. But I remember vividly how it felt to be in an all-consuming state of panic. For many months, it ruled my entire existence. Approximately 40 million American adults \u2013 roughly 18% of the population \u2013 have an anxiety disorder, while in the UK there were 8.2 million cases of anxiety in 2013. There are few statistics about health anxiety, but it can affect those who have an existing anxiety disorder or those who have experienced a life event such as bereavement, birth trauma or an accident. In times like these, where a global pandemic is taking up most of the media conversation, it can be even more difficult to stay calm.</p> <p>Here is some advice that may give some comfort to those of you who are struggling.</p> <h2><strong>1) Avoid the (health-related) news</strong></h2> <p>We all want to keep up to date, but when you have health anxiety the need to check and read the latest updates can become compulsive, feeding the anxiety. Try having a news detox, or allocating yourself a time limit for reading or watching news. If you\u2019re really worried about missing something crucial, you can always tell friends and family to contact you in the event of an emergency situation in order to keep you informed.</p> <h2><strong>2) Try not to seek constant reassurance</strong></h2> <p>Seeking reassurance can make you feel calmer for a little while, but in my experience, it is always temporary. Your brain creates a feedback cycle where you become increasingly reliant on reassurance, which only serves to reinforce the anxiety. It\u2019s natural to want your loved ones to tell you things will be OK, but when you start needing that reassurance several times a day it\u2019s time to take a step back.</p> <h2><strong>3) Introduce an absolute ban on Googling symptoms</strong></h2> <p>Dr Google is not, and never will be, your friend, especially not when you are a sufferer of health anxiety. Nor will message-boards and forums. Try to remember that people visit these places when they have reason to be concerned. Once you start understanding it\u2019s a skewed lens, you\u2019ll be better able to put things in perspective</p> <h2><strong>4) Try a countering technique</strong></h2> <p>This is a CBT exercise which involves giving a persistent thought the courtroom treatment, by confronting it with a rational counter-statement. For example, if your persistent thought is something like \u201cEveryone I love will die from this virus\u201d you can counter it with factual statements such as \u201cActually, most people who get Covid-19 are likely to make a full recovery, and that\u2019s assuming mum, dad and my little sister will even catch it at all.\u201d As my mother always says: \u201cJust because you think something, doesn\u2019t make it true.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>5) Do some exercise</strong></h2> <p>Even if it\u2019s just star jumps in your bedroom, or shaking your body parts like you\u2019re in the warm-up section of a hippie acting class, exercise will help get the adrenaline out of your system and channel the panic elsewhere.</p> <h2><strong>6) Breathing and grounding exercises</strong></h2> <p>From guided yogic breathing to using a strong smell (I favored lavender oil), grounding exercises can help bring you back to reality. I also found bending over to touch my toes and then very slowly standing up starting at the base of my spine to be beneficial, as it centers me.<strong> </strong>You can look for examples online, but sometimes, something as simple as sitting on the floor can help.</p> <h2><strong>7) Allocate yourself a daily </strong><strong>\u2018worry period\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Give yourself half an hour to worry about this to your heart\u2019s content, and then you have to go and do something else.</p> <h2><strong>8) Treat yourself</strong></h2> <p>Anything that will give you a little boost can help. It doesn\u2019t need to involve spending money: you can also cook yourself something nice, have a hot bath, or listen to a song you love.</p> <h2><strong>9) Remember that your anxious state isn\u2019t permanent</strong></h2> <p>When you are in it, anxiety always feels as though it will never end, but it will. It\u2019s hard to remember this, but do try. I genuinely thought that I would never recover, and now even though we are in a public health crisis, I feel calm and have things in perspective. It\u2019s a worrying time, and many of us, myself included, will have loved ones who might be showing symptoms, but the tendency to jump to the worst-case scenario very rarely reflects reality. Be kind to yourself. It may be a bit cheesy, but this too shall pass.</p>",

When you take children out of schools and put them back in the broader community, the ability for them to potentially engage with others increases that risk. And that\u2019s the understanding we have \u2026</p> \n <p>The other issue is the disruption impact that can have and put at great risk the availability of critical workers such as nurses and doctors and others who are essential in the community because they would have to remain home and look after their children.</p> \n <p>And so while it may seem counterintuitive, there is very good reason why you would not be moving to broadscale closures of schools that could actually make the situation worse, not better. And so the states and territories are not moving in that direction.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The states and territories have displayed a united front with the prime minister so far. On Wednesday, the South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, said<strong> </strong>there was no point extending schools holidays for a couple of weeks.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is not a political decision, it is not an ideological decision, it is an evidence-based decision, which has been informed by the brightest minds in Australia, and they\u2019re making it very clear,\u201d he said. \u201cChildren should go to school and to preschool and to kindy, here in South Australia, and around the country, and not to do so doesn\u2019t diminish the risk \u2013 in fact, it increases the risk and it reduces our response as a nation so the coronavirus. It will harm our ability to tackle the coronavirus. So this couldn\u2019t be any clearer. The advice was unequivocal.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, echoed the comments, saying that to make a difference to disease spread, schools would need to close for at least six months.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs much as I know parents are concerned, if you were to do that, you would do more harm than good. It is never good not to follow unanimous and clear advice from the health experts. There will be a time when schools will be significantly disrupted, some already have been where there has been individual cases. In many respects, the best place for the kids at the moment is at school. I am not criticising people for being scared or anxious, it is a natural thing.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Does this position conform with medical advice?</h2> \n<p>Yes. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee \u2013 composed of federal, state and territory chief health officers \u2013 has advised at this stage that essential functions, including schools, universities, workplaces and public transport do not need to stop functioning.</p> \n<p>In a statement, the Victorian chief health officer, Brett Sutton, has said that he \u201cfully endorses\u201d the committee\u2019s advice \u201cthat pre-emptive school closures are not likely to be proportionate or effective as a public health intervention to prevent community transmission of Covid-19 at this time\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>There is currently limited information on the contribution of children to transmission of Covid-19. The WHO-China joint mission noted the primary role of household transmission and observed that children tended to be infected from adults.</p> \n <p>Previous work suggests that the potential reduction in community transmission from pre-emptive school closures may be offset by the care arrangements that are in place for children who are not at school.</p> \n <p>There is a particular risk associated with the fact that children may require care from vulnerable grandparents or may continue to associate (and transmit infection) outside of school settings.</p> \n <p>Broadly the health advice on school closures from previous respiratory epidemics shows the health costs are often underestimated and the benefits overestimated.</p> \n <p>This may be even more so in relation to Covid-19 as unlike influenza the impact on otherwise healthy children has been minimal to date.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/publications/publishing.nsf/Content/mathematical-models/$File/pandemic-modelling.pdf\">report from epidemiologists and public health experts</a> to the health department said closing schools would only reduce the overall attack rate effectively if school children were found to have a much higher risk of infection than adults.</p> \n<p>Based on current available evidence, children are not at higher risk than adults. However, the report found a combination of hygiene and quarantining infected households were very effective. The report also states even if schools were closed that \u201cin reality, some children may continue to mix with individuals outside the household during school time\u201d.</p> \n<p>Associate Prof Kamalini Lokuge, from the Australian National University\u2019s Research School of Public Health, told the National Press Club on Wednesday: \u201cOur essential workers, our doctors, our nurses, those who supply our food, our electricity \u2013 they need to be able to send their kids to school.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/cruise-ships-scramble-to-find-safe-harbour-amid-covid-19-crisis-as-countries-turn-them-away\">Coronavirus: cruise ship passengers stranded at sea as countries turn them away from harbours</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Have others gone further in calling for school closures?</h2> \n<p>Some have suggested that preventing transmission in all settings, including schools, should be the priority.</p> \n<p>The general practitioner and former AMA president, Kerryn Phelps, has said \u201cwithin a very short timeframe we\u2019re going to have to look at the closure of schools and closure of universities for a couple of weeks in order to help with limitation of transmission\u201d.</p> \n<p>Anthony Albanese has noted that some private and independent schools have opted to close but has stopped short of calling for mass school closures.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat I don\u2019t want is the government to be too far behind here,\u201d he told Sky News.</p> \n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t see how [school closures] won\u2019t happen at some stage. What we need, though, is for those decisions to be essentially recommended by the medical officers \u2013 if they say that is where it\u2019s going to go, we need transparency.\u201d</p> \n<h2>What do independent experts say?</h2> \n<p>Prof Jonathan Carapetis, a paediatrician and a leading expert on infectious diseases, told Guardian Australia the medical community\u2019s view is \u201cnot that straightforward\u201d but everyone agrees a \u201cbalanced discussion\u201d rather than knee-jerk reaction is required.</p> \n<p>The executive director of Telethon Kids Institute said the argument for school closures is to prevent transmission from child to child and back to their family.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut the evidence that closing schools will have a significant impact on transmission of the pandemic is not that strong,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cChildren don\u2019t seem to get severely unwell, they either get a mild version or show no signs of illness, so the early data is that they are not significantly involved in transmission.\u201d</p> \n<p>School closure \u201cis not the panacea some may think\u201d, Carapetis said, citing the fact it could take 10-20% of people out of the workforce and put parents and grandparents at risk of a more severe health outcome.</p> \n<p>Carapetis suggested that children in school are \u201ceasier to control\u201d because they can be taught hand hygiene and measures like banning assemblies and school carnivals can reduce risks.</p> \n<h2>What about herd immunity?</h2> \n<p>Morrison has noted that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/epidemiologist-britain-herd-immunity-coronavirus-covid-19\">prospect of developing herd immunity</a> has been raised in the UK.</p> \n<p>Carapetis explained that one way to prevent transmission is to \u201cincrease the proportion of the population with some immunity to the disease\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cGiven we know kids don\u2019t get so sick [from Covid-19] it\u2019s possible that a higher proportion could become immune and can\u2019t transmit it, which is known as herd immunity.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Carapetis warned although there is a \u201cgood theoretical basis\u201d for that view, there is so far no data to back it and it is only an assumption that children will gain immunity once infected. As such, it should \u201cnot be a significant factor\u201d in potential school closures.</p> \n<p>On Sunday, Paul Kelly, the deputy chief medical officer, said: \u201cAnd that important issue of herd immunity that we talk about a lot in vaccination is exactly the challenge that we have at the moment. There is no herd immunity.

The latter has shaken up the market with its incredibly powerful multi-core products offering simultaneous multithreading, but these really only come into their own if you\u2019re doing other stuff on your PC such as video editing and encoding or live streaming while you play. \u201cIf your remit is purely gaming, then Intel is the way to go,\u201d says Dexter.</p> <p>Both Dexter and Wilson recommend the <strong>Intel Core i5-9600K</strong> (\u00a3230). \u201cYou get a lot of chip for your money,\u201d says Dexter. \u201cThe base frequency of 3.7 GHz means it\u2019s nippy enough for most tasks, and with a turbo of 4.6 GHz across all cores, and up to 4.9 GHz on single core tasks, it can adapt to heavy workloads well. The K suffix denotes that the chip is unlocked, meaning those that want to squeeze even more performance out of the chip can do so by overclocking (provided that you have sufficient cooling).\u201d For an AMD alternative, Dexter suggests the <strong>Ryzen 7 3700X </strong>(\u00a3270), and Wilson adds, \u201cdon\u2019t discount something like the AMD Ryzen 5 3600 if you have no strong allegiance to either brand.\u201d</p> <p>At the more expensive end, an Intel i7 or even i9 will give you a boost. Id Software is <a href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/doom-eternal-pc-specs-for-minimum-and-recommended-settings-revealed/\">recommending</a> an Intel Core i7-6700K or better (or AMD Ryzen 7 1800X or better) for Doom Eternal.</p> <p>\u201cSome games will perform to a perfectly acceptable level on an Intel Core i3-9100, when paired with a decent graphics card,\u201d says Claassen, who supplied a review PC for this article. \u201cBut for optimal performance on ultra-high settings, the <strong>Intel Core i7-9700K</strong> with eight cores, eight threads and turbo clock speed of 4.9GHz will set you right for a long time to come. If you have the budget and really want to be assured of no compromised gaming, then an <strong>Intel Core i9-9900X</strong> powered gaming machine, featuring 10 cores and 20 threads, will leave you speechless \u2013 assuming you have the gaming content and monitor to utilise all of the performance and bring the game to life in 4K with HDR.\u201d</p> <p>If all this is way out of your price range, the <strong>Intel Core i5-9400F </strong>(\u00a3140) does a decent job, but it\u2019s as low as you\u2019ll want to go, according to Dexter. \u201cGame developers are beginning to make the shift to using more cores, so a six-core chip is a sensible minimum for any machine that is expected to last three years or more.\u201d</p> <h2>Memory and storage</h2> <p>Most current mainstream PC games are asking for a minimum of 8GB system RAM, but are recommending 16GB. As Wilson confirms, \u201c16GB is plenty. I see a lot of people spending way too much money on 32GB or more. While there is certainly a time and a place, we don\u2019t even have that much on our dev machines!\u201d</p> <p>As for storage, solid state drives are more expensive than hard drives, but allow much faster access to data, which means quicker video game load times. They\u2019re more expensive, though, so most people are still using combinations of both. \u201cA common option is fast SSD for Windows and frequently used games, and then a larger capacity mechanical drive for everything else,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cSSD prices continue to go down, so consider going entirely for SSDs unless you have a lot of data that makes it too expensive.\u201d</p> <p>Wilson points out that the interface between the drive and the computer is also important. SSDs can use the older SATA interface or the newer, much slicker NVMe, so check the specs before buying. \u201cA solid pick would be something like the SATA-based <strong>Samsung 860 EVO</strong>, with the high end being an NVMe-based <strong>Samsung 970 pro</strong>.\u201d</p> <h2>Graphics card</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b1718b2d08a68f7b28da68030f2880881617e3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b1718b2d08a68f7b28da68030f2880881617e3c/225_188_1146_687/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 graphics card\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 graphics card.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nvidia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once again, there are two manufacturers here: Nvidia, with its GeForce series, and AMD with Radeon. At the budget end, Dexter recommends the <strong>AMD Radeon RX 570 4GB</strong> (\u00a3120) or the <strong>N</strong><strong>vidia GeForce 1650 Super</strong> (\u00a3150), both of which have limitations but will drive most games quite happily at 1080p resolution. \u201cThe recently released Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 is a solid graphics card for entry level gaming, possibly paired with the Intel Core i3-9100 processor,\u201d says Claassen. \u201cBut for 1440p gaming, the GTX 1660 Super GPU, paired with an Intel Core i5-9400F processor, should deliver a very enjoyable experience.\u201d</p> <p>The fashionable thing to be thinking about is support for ray tracing. \u201cIt\u2019s a new gaming graphics technique which traces the pathway of light and influences how it interacts with environments and objects to produce more dynamic and realistic lighting,\u201d says Bickham, before adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a costly effect to turn on, and will impact your framerate.\u201d Only a few titles are using it right now, but they\u2019re impressive.</p> <p>The acclaimed first-person shooter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/feb/13/metro-exodus-review-playstation-4-xbox-one-pc-4a-games-deep-silver\">Metro Exodus</a> makes amazing use of the tech, with its apocalyptic cityscapes \u2013 you see the flames of nearby fires dancing on the walls of metal shacks, the interiors of broken train carriages dotted with sickly orange sunlight, and nearby mutants sending long dark shadows crawling across concrete floors. Major forthcoming releases such as Cyberpunk 2077 and Watch Dogs: Legion are onboard, too, while both the PS5 and Xbox Series X are set to support the effect, which will boost interest in the development community.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6ecdfe691426022fa8237e8f4fdb7d8210c293c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ecdfe691426022fa8237e8f4fdb7d8210c293c2/56_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Metro Exodus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apocalyptic cityscapes ... Metro Exodus</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The intermediate-level <strong>Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super</strong> (\u00a3330) is a great value card for those who want to experiment with ray tracing and don\u2019t mind dialling down other performance features in return. At the high end, Dexter, Wilson and Bickham all recommend the <strong>Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti</strong> (\u00a3990). \u201cThis is essentially the only card that can consistently hit 4K at the highest settings,\u201d says Dexter. \u201cAlthough even here you can\u2019t set all of those ray tracing settings to max and expect silky smooth frame rates.\u201d</p> <p>Remember to match your GPU with your monitor \u2013 there\u2019s no point spending hundreds more on a card that can deal with 4K visuals if your monitor tops out at 1080p.</p> <h2>Other kit</h2> <p>If you\u2019re building a PC from scratch, you\u2019ll also need to think about getting a case that\u2019s the right size for all your components. Wilson warns not to scrimp on this component: \u201c[Cheaper cases] are likely to have poorer design when it comes to airflow and have cheaper fans, a combination that\u2019ll make your machine nosier and may bring in more dust.\u201d He uses cases by Fractal Design in his studio.</p> <p>You\u2019ll also need a power supply unit that can cope with the demands of your specifications. \u201c750W from a decent brand is more than enough,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cQuality (80+ Gold certified) is better than a cheap 1000W power supply that explodes and takes all your hardware with it.\u201d</p> <p>An adequate cooling system is another must. \u201cAs with high performance car engines, cooling is critical to get the maximum power out of a high performance machine,\u201d says Claassen. \u201cWith all of this high-end computing power in a relatively confined space, it is going to generate a lot of heat. Your computer will automatically start throttling back performance if the CPU, GPU or overall system temperatures start getting too high, resulting in game lag and frame rate dropping. Advanced cooling systems are therefore critical, whether it is dedicated high performance fans, isolated cooling chambers or even liquid cooling solutions.\u201d</p> <h2>Buying a PC</h2> <p>There are three main options here. The cheapest is to buy all the components, then physically build the machine yourself. It\u2019s a reasonably technical undertaking, but there are lots of places to go for help, including <a href=\"https://youtu.be/fOwYdAU-Zso\">this PC Gamer video</a>. A specialist supplier such as Overclockers, Scan, PCSpecialists or Chillblast will supply the parts and, for a little extra, build a PC for you from the components you select. Otherwise, you can opt for a completely pre-built PC from a brand such as Acer, Alienware or Corsair, which can be more expensive, but has the advantage of providing you with a balanced, well-configured machine, where all the components have been selected to work together.</p> <p>For the purposes of this article, I tested the <a href=\"https://www.acer.com/ac/en/GB/content/predator-series/predatororion5000\">Acer Predator Orion 5000</a>, complete with Intel Core i7-9700K processor, Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 graphics card and 16GB system memory. For me \u2013 the owner of a machine with an i3 processor and mid-level GeForce \u2013 it is an unfeasibly powerful setup. I\u2019ve been running Metro Exodus with ultra high graphics settings and ray tracing turned on and it\u2019s coping with everything, delivering smooth, seamless animation and gorgeous lighting effects. It\u2019s a cool build, too \u2013 if you like your PC to resemble some kind of alien space helmet \u2013 and the interior is visible (and hauntingly lit) through a transparent side panel. There\u2019s also loads of room for modification later down the line.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa9f7dbffe72599556e7315a0ca3e36b3562f8b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa9f7dbffe72599556e7315a0ca3e36b3562f8b0/74_0_1333_800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Acer Predator Orion 5000\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Acer Predator Orion 5000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Acer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What the Predator has made very clear is that, with the right PC specifications, the top games of 2020 look utterly astonishing. The arrival of real-time ray tracing promises a new era of visual realism. But then, the Predator Orion model I tested retails at more than \u00a32000. However, you don\u2019t have to max out every element to get impressive results. As Bickham explains, \u201cPairing a card such as an RTX 2060 (around \u00a3300) with a 24\u201d or 27\u201d 1440P monitor will get you an extremely respectable 70-80 FPS in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/nov/28/battlefield-v-review-war-playstation-4-xbox-one-pc-ea-dice\">Battlefield V</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/oct/03/forza-horizon-4-review-best-racing-experience-britain-tour\">Forza Horizon 4</a>, and a whopping 120 FPS in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/27/overwatch-review-blizzard\">Overwatch</a>, with these games running on high graphics settings.\u201d</p> <p>The bottom line is: expect to pay around \u00a31200 for a system that will play the best current games with high frame rates in 1080p or possibly 1440p resolution, and up to \u00a32000 for seamless 4K support. It\u2019s a lot, but it will last you several years and once you see the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vjF9GgrY9c0\">Cyberpunk 2077 gameplay demo</a> running on an Intel Core i7 8700K and Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti, it starts to seem much more reasonable.</p>",
  "<h2>Ravneet &amp; Jaswinder Gill &amp; Jit Atkar</h2> <p><em>Ravneet Gill is a pastry chef who has worked at St John</em><em> and has her own pop-up bakery, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/puffthebakery/\" title=\"\">Puff</a>. She is the founder of <a href=\"https://countertalk.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Countertalk</a>, a platform that connects chefs and advocates supportive and healthy work environments in the industry, and her first book, The Pastry Chef\u2019s Guide, is out next month. She grew up with her mother, Jaswinder, and grandmother, Jit, and learned to cook in restaurants before she ever cooked with her mother.</em></p> <p>When Ravneet Gill was about 14, an astrologer told her mother that Ravneet would work in the food industry. Jaswinder thought of the girl at home, so picky she\u2019d only eat jam sandwiches for lunch. It was such a ridiculous prophecy, she forgot to tell her until last year, when Ravneet was 27 and had been a chef for seven years.</p> <p>\u201cShe was so fussy, she never helped out,\u201d Jaswinder says, explaining why they never cooked together when Ravneet was growing up.</p> <p>\u201cYou would never let me help you,\u201d Rav shoots back. Rav is having afternoon tea with her mother and grandmother Jit, who they call Biji. She and Jit think that Jaswinder is too particular in the kitchen \u2013 \u201ccontrol freak\u201d is the exact phrase, repeated with much teasing.</p> <p>\u201cMum considers me messy but a normal person would consider me <em>very</em> clean,\u201d adds the chef, so adept in the precision of the pastry section that she works as a consultant for new businesses.</p> <p>\u201cShe is still messy,\u201d mutters Jaswinder.</p> <p>Jit doesn\u2019t speak much English but knows what they\u2019re talking about. How are her kitchen habits? The question brings a shrieks of laughter from the others.</p> <p>\u201cVery messy!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo messy!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe gets told off every day for her mess,\u201d says Ravneet.</p> <p>Discussing who, really, is the best cook brings more laughter. Jit loves her granddaughter\u2019s cakes (\u201cplain sponge,\u201d says Ravneet, \u201cshe hates chocolate\u201d) and Jaswinder\u2019s pakoras. Nominating Jit\u2019s best dish is immediate and unanimous: \u201cHer saag!\u201d \u2013 a Punjabi recipe of lots of greens, lots of butter, lots of onion, ginger and garlic.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hands down, Mum is the best cook in the family</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cShe loves making it,\u201d says Ravneet, as Jit demonstrates how to hand-press the chapatis that go with it. \u201cBut we get upset because it stinks the whole house out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoiled greens and lots of fenugreek,\u201d Jaswinder shakes her head and rolls her eyes in only partial mock exasperation.</p> <p>But, Ravneet says, it is acknowledged through the extended family that \u2013 \u201chands down\u201d \u2013 Jaswinder is the best cook: \u201cAll my dad\u2019s brothers\u2019 wives are from India, but Mum is from Kenya, so she\u2019s got more of an edge when it comes to spicing.\u201d Jaswinder explains that Indians will often only cook the food of the region they\u2019re from, but growing up in Nairobi exposed her to different ingredients and cuisines, so she might draw on Swahili or Gujarati elements.</p> <p>After her husband died, Jit moved her family to the UK in 1974, when Jaswinder was 14. Jit worked in a sewing factory in Aldgate, so it fell to her daughter to do the cooking and shopping. \u201cWe had to get on with it,\u201d Jaswinder shrugs. She found that not only did she enjoy cooking, but people loved her food.</p> <p>\u201cAll the ingredients in Kenya were fresh and organic,\u201d Jit says, adding that she\u2019d never cooked anything from the freezer before moving to the UK, and has still never used an oven. \u201cWe cooked with coal there, but when we came to England the hobs were gas.\u201d</p> <p>Ravneet became more interested in cooking in her late teens, especially baking cakes. After completing a psychology degree, she trained as a pastry chef. She still didn\u2019t cook at home, and didn\u2019t learn how to cook Indian food until she worked at London restaurant Jamavar.</p> <p>\u201cMy Indian food is way different to theirs,\u201d says Ravneet. \u201cI\u2019ve learnt so much about all types of cuisines, yet I have this Indian background, so I love taking seasonal ingredients and making curry with them in a way my mum and Biji wouldn\u2019t, like a delica pumpkin one I made.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou roast your pumpkin first, don\u2019t you?\u201d Jaswinder asks, explaining that she\u2019d use raw pumpkin, peeled then added to mustard and cumin seeds toasted in oil with (always) onions, ginger, garlic and chilli. Ravneet describes her more cheffy approach of making different elements: roast the pumpkin, make a base, then a sauce \u2013 before putting it all together. She might use coconut, which Jaswinder and Jit would eat happily but not think to cook with. These days, at 90, Jit is more likely to squirrel away the pumpkin seeds, scattering them in the garden without telling the rest of the family. \u201cLast year she went mad,\u201d laughs Ravneet, as her mother shakes her head, again. \u201cThere were pumpkin plants everywhere. Next door had them growing up into their trees.\u201d</p> <p>The leftover dal parathas, below, , is a recipe they all make, though Jit uses gram flour, which Jaswinder doesn\u2019t, and she doesn\u2019t put chilli in her dal, which Jaswinder does. Ravneet has shown her mum how to make Indian dishes that she\u2019s learnt in restaurants, like chat, and they now work together well enough to host dinners, splitting cooking duties. \u201cShe finally let me make samosas,\u201d jokes Ravneet.</p> <p>\u201cI made mogo [cassava chips],\u201d says Jaswinder. \u201cYou boil it and deep fry it, and add a spicy garlic paste, sprinkle it with lemon juice and coriander, so it\u2019s these African-Indian flavours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, we love that one,\u201d murmurs Ravneet. \u201cIt was only a few years ago that I realised what amazing cooks they are, and how lucky I am.\u201d <strong>HO</strong></p> <h2>Dal and fenugreek parathas with lemon pickle and yogurt</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a63d241a0753bcd4402dc21f33b0c61cf3eb042a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a63d241a0753bcd4402dc21f33b0c61cf3eb042a/0_1021_6019_5707/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dal and fenugreek parathas with lemon pickle and yogurt.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"948\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dal and fenugreek parathas with lemon pickle and yogurt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Ravneet</strong> It would be a complete lie to say that we work in harmony in the kitchen. Instead, our kitchen consists of three women who think they know more than the others. My grandma is extremely messy, loves pickling and hates throwing anything away. My mum is obsessed with cleaning and always puts too many chillies in our food. I became a chef but it hasn\u2019t earned me any credit with them yet. I grew up watching the two of them bicker and cook fantastically.</p> <p>One of my favourite things to this day is these leftover dal parathas, and we all make them slightly differently. They are so comforting and all you really need is a big bowl of natural set yogurt and some pickle to enjoy them.</p> <p>We eat these with my grandma\u2019s lemon pickle, which takes at least one week to get going; she has jars of the stuff on the go constantly.</p> <p>You can make the parathas vegan by adding oil instead of butter, and they\u2019re a great way of using up any leftover dal. There\u2019s lots of room to play here, so adjust according to your palate.</p> <p><em><strong>Makes 4-5<br>For the parathas<br></strong></em><strong>chapa</strong><strong>ti flour</strong> 200g, white or multigrain<br><strong>fine salt</strong> 1 tsp<br><strong>potato</strong> 1 small, boiled, then mashed<br><strong>white onion</strong> 1 small, peeled and minced<br><strong>green chillies </strong>2, finely chopped<br><strong>coriander seeds</strong> 1/4 tsp, crushed<br><strong>ajwain (carom) seeds</strong> 1/4 tsp<br><strong>fresh coriander</strong> 25-30g, chopped<br><strong>fresh fenugreek</strong> 15g, chopped (optional)<br><strong>melted butter</strong> 1 tbsp, or neutral oil, plus extra to brush the parathas<br><strong>leftover cooked d</strong><strong>al</strong> 200g, we like to use yellow dal that has been seasoned properly so it\u2019s super flavourful</p> <p><em><strong>For the lemon pickle (makes a large jar which should last a month or so)<br></strong></em><strong>lemons</strong> 5 large<br><strong>bird\u2019s eye chillies</strong> 20<br><strong>vegetable oil</strong> 200ml<br><strong>yellow mustard seeds</strong> 2 tbsp<br><strong>nigella seeds</strong> 2 tbsp<br><strong>turmeric</strong> 2 tbsp<br><strong>red chilli powder</strong> 1 tbsp<br><strong>fine salt</strong> 100g<br><strong>white wine vinegar</strong> 250ml<br><strong>caster sugar</strong> 2 tbsp<br><strong>asafoetida</strong> 1 tsp </p> <p><em><strong>To serve<br></strong></em><strong>natural set yog</strong><strong>urt<br></strong><strong>lemon pickle</strong> (see above)</p> <p>To make the pickle, cut the lemons into pieces the size of a 50p coin. Keep the chillies whole. Put them in a heatproof bowl. Heat the oil, then add the mustard and nigella seeds and heat for a few minutes. Pour the hot oil over the lemons and chillies, and add the remaining ingredients. Stir, stir, stir. Decant into an airtight, sterilised jar, and leave for 2 weeks before eating. Make sure you keep stirring the pickle every few days.</p> <p>To make the chapatis, mix together the flour, salt, potato, onion, chilli, and spices and herbs.</p> <p>Add the melted butter and the dal, and mix with enough cold water to form a dough, not too sticky and not too dry. We add the water by eye because the mix varies each time depending on the other ingredients. Leave to rest for 1 hour.</p> <p>To cook the parathas, roll out pieces of the dough into a circle (about 15cm in diameter), brush with a little melted butter or neutral oil. Fold it up, sides in first then the top and bottom down. Roll it out again into a circle (15cm) and brush again with melted butter or oil. Cook the parathas in a large frying pan over a medium heat, brushing with extra butter or oil if they look dry at any point, until cooked. It will be nicely browned and slightly puffy with no raw spots. Transfer to a plate and cover with a tea towel to keep warm while you repeat with the remaining dough.</p> <p>Serve the parathas with yogurt and the lemon pickle.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-pastry-chef-s-guide-9781911641513.html\" title=\"\">The Pastry Chef\u2019s Guide</a> by Ravneet Gill (Pavilion, \u00a318.99); <a href=\"https://countertalk.co.uk/\" title=\"\">countertalk.co.uk</a></em></p> <h2>Jessie &amp; Lennie Ware</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ea504392722bdae7ed7e64cb9346a9ff4c00e90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ea504392722bdae7ed7e64cb9346a9ff4c00e90/0_502_5564_4619/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jessie and Lennie Ware.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"830\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018She makes things look so effortless\u2019: Jessie and Lennie Ware.

Otherwise it just ends in \u2026</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> Out-bossing.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> Well, I don\u2019t boss.</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> You do boss, Jessie.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> I just go quiet and very subservient.</p> <p>Lennie You go quiet and you get cross.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> Inside. I wouldn\u2019t show it to you.</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> How do I know you\u2019re cross then?</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> Because of the silence. Because I\u2019m never quiet unless you\u2019re telling me off.</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> The big problem is, Jessie\u2019s very messy. If Jessie cooks, I\u2019ve got to be sous chef and just tidy up after her constantly.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> And that kind of suits me.</p> <p>Mum makes things look so effortless. She\u2019ll execute five or six different dishes \u2013 an array. And I\u2019ve inherited that generosity, but it\u2019s slightly optimistic.</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> Jessie is much better at flavours; she\u2019s much more adventurous. I can rescue things; I know how food works.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> She can rescue anything. The challenging thing with the cookbook was that we\u2019ve never really written down recipes. It was memories, \u201ca bit of this and a bit of that\u201d. With the matzo balls, you\u2019d never taught me how to make them. I\u2019d just watched you do it.</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> When I had to write the recipe down, I got it completely wrong. Because I just used to shake things in. Now, having to repeat it and write it for the book, I\u2019ve got it absolutely perfect. I learnt it from my mother. With the soup, she would have never used chicken thighs, she would have had a kosher chicken \u2013 a boiling hen \u2013 and the giblets. I learnt from friends, if you leave the skin on the onions, it gives it a darker colour. And I have my soup completely clear, my mum would have left the onions in. She wouldn\u2019t have wasted bits of chicken and onions, whereas I throw it all away. By the time you\u2019ve boiled the shit out of it for five hours, you can\u2019t eat the chicken.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> See, I would have kept the chicken in, all shredded.</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> I\u2019d put a shredded chicken breast in extra, if you want it.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> You never do though.</p> <p> I probably wouldn\u2019t make the matzo balls at home. I Iove having my mum\u2019s soup, hers is the supreme, but mine might be more hearty, verging on a stew. I\u2019m no good at puddings. It\u2019s the thing that least interests me.</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> But everyone loves puddings, Jessie. We went to friends\u2019 last weekend and there were six different puds.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> And I ate all of them, but I\u2019m not a big pudding person. So if I\u2019m doing the main, Mum will do the pud, and she will just get on with it, and that\u2019s helpful. Quite annoyingly everything that she does is pretty excellent. But I\u2019m better at curries than you.</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> Yes, you are. You could make some this weekend.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> OK, I will. <strong>HO</strong></p> <h2>Lennie\u2019s chicken soup</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9c786ae77b500fd843987e76c129a6b1bf91e5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9c786ae77b500fd843987e76c129a6b1bf91e5d/0_1357_6025_5320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chicken soup and matzo balls.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"883\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chicken soup and matzo balls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The soup may not be completely clear (and it doesn\u2019t really matter), but if you want to make it as clear as a consomm\u00e9 then you can either put it all through a tea strainer (as I did when Jay Rayner was our guest) or you can use one or two egg shells from the matzo balls and put them in the soup as you bring it back to the boil \u2013 fish out the egg shells before you put the matzo balls in.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 6 (makes about 2 litres)<br></strong></em><strong>kosher boiling hen </strong>1 (if you can\u2019t buy one, use about 3-4kg chicken thighs, legs and wings)<br><strong>large onions </strong>4, skins left on, halved, cutting off the rooty bit<br><strong>carrots</strong> 8, sliced about 2-3cm thick<br><strong>celery sticks </strong>4, with leaves, halved<br><strong>leeks </strong>2, halved<br><strong>swede</strong> \u00bd<br><strong>Telma chicken soup mix</strong> 2 tbsp (available from a kosher shop or online) or 2 good chicken stock cubes<br><strong>whole black peppercorns</strong> 1 tsp<br><strong>salt</strong> 1 tsp<br><strong>matzo balls </strong>(see below), to serve</p> <p>Put the chicken and all the vegetables in a stockpot or very large pan (about 5 litres capacity) with enough cold water to cover everything by about 5cm (about 3 litres) and bring to the boil. When boiling, skim off all the frothy scum until there is none left. Add the soup mix or stock cubes, the peppercorns and salt, bring back to the boil and then reduce the heat and gently simmer for 2-3 hours.</p> <p>Season the soup to taste, then leave to cool. Pour the soup through a colander into a large bowl. Carefully retrieve the carrots from the colander and add back to the soup. Give everything else a good squeeze to release the juices. Some people put a little of the chicken into the soup, but I\u2019m not sure it has much taste after being boiled for so long \u2013 and you will make your cat/dog very happy if you give them the bone-free chicken meat.</p> <p>Put the clear soup and carrots into the fridge for at least 2 hours or overnight. When it\u2019s well chilled the fat will rise to the top and you can easily skim it off.</p> <p>To serve, bring the soup to the boil over a medium heat and add your cooked matzo balls just before serving.</p> <h2>Matzo balls</h2> <p>Of course, you can cheat and use the ready-made packets, which are sometimes sold under the name \u201ckneidl\u201d.</p> <p>Matzo balls are very divisive: some prefer them fluffy like clouds, some prefer them dense like bullets. Some have them in the soup, others save them till after. But if you start by saying \u201cI\u2019ll only have one\u201d you will always submit to the second.

He grew up on a farm in Winchester, where he was taught to cook by his mother, Jenny.</em></p> <p><strong>Tom</strong> I think anything that we do at <a href=\"\" title=\"\">Coombeshead Farm</a> has a fundamental grounding in what Mum\u2019s done for many, many years. Whenever she comes down there, I suspect she thinks it\u2019s a rip-off of her.</p> <p><strong>Jenny</strong> No, I don\u2019t, actually, Tom.</p> <p><strong>Tom</strong> You, for example, find it very odd that cordials can be purchased in a shop. You have fundamentals in how to manage a larder.</p> <p><strong>Jenny</strong> But you\u2019re a much better cook, making things people wouldn\u2019t have tried. That\u2019s what\u2019s exciting about you, Tom. If I make elderflower cordial it\u2019s maybe very good but it\u2019s normal, but you put a twist on it.</p> <p><strong>Tom</strong> I\u2019d say less so nowadays. The more I\u2019ve cooked, the less I\u2019m interested in messing around during it. The processing is more interesting than cooking now. I get much more excited making cheese or bacon than cooking with cheese or bacon.</p> <p><strong>Jenny</strong> I just made stuff to eat.</p> <p><strong>Tom</strong> It\u2019s the same thing. Subsistence is the fundamental. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about \u2013 feeding people well.</p> <p><strong>Jenny</strong> And treating the land well. All the fruit in my garden is absolutely used, isn\u2019t it? I hate waste.</p> <p><strong>Tom</strong> You had quite a go at me yesterday, for not putting the small top of a leek into the compost.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As far back as I remember, there was something bubbling away</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Jenny</strong> You\u2019ve been chopping vegetables from an early age. But you really got into cooking things when you went to university to do some classical civilisation thing.</p> <p><strong>Tom</strong> Well, the course had some elements of Greek and Latin poetry. But I\u2019d say cookery became my passion at 15 or 16, like daily pancakes did at age nine and tomato sauce at 10. You were pretty tight about switching on the heating at home, so the kitchen was the warmest place to be \u2013 and watch. As far back as I remember, there was always something bubbling away and the Aga is good for putting your bum against. I loved raiding the pantry.</p> <p><strong>Jenny</strong> I had to put a lock on the door. But cooking together was pretty happy and natural times, wouldn\u2019t you say, Tom?</p> <p><strong>Tom</strong> It was more like being an understudy. And going out and picking stuff like rhubarb and being taught how to.</p> <p><strong>Jenny</strong> He became obsessed by pigs.</p> <p><strong>Tom</strong> I got a subscription to <em>P</em><em>ractical Pigs</em> and in the back there was a lot about the breeds available.</p> <p><strong>Jenny</strong> We gave him four piglets for his 18th, rather than a car.</p> <p><strong>Tom</strong> I\u2019d grown up with sows the size of a sofa. I\u2019d ride Empress and imagine she was a dinosaur when I was nine or 10. But with the four piglets it was about the whole processing. Pigs are not the original farmhouse staple for nothing. There aren\u2019t many animals which can sustain a household for a year \u2013 with hams, sausages, bacons, offal, p\u00e2t\u00e9, you name it. I bought 18 pigs from a breeder in Lincoln. We had a wood at home and I kept them there but left mum to look after them when I was working in London.</p> <p><strong>Jenny</strong> Thanks Tom.</p> <p><strong>Tom</strong> Yes, taking care of 18 fairly wild pigs is not the easiest task. Mum was a bit \u201cEr, you need to deal with them, Tom\u201d. I\u2019d moved to London and taken a job first on Clapham High Street in a burger kitchen as a dishwasher and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/01/how-randolph-hodgson-and-neals-yard-dairy-gave-cheese-a-chance\" title=\"\">Neal\u2019s Yard Dairy </a>in Borough Market, in wholesale. After a while a friend and I got a four-month pitch under Hungerford Bridge \u2013 with an alcohol license \u2013 and hired a barbecue trailer and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/12/jay-rayner-restaurant-pitt-cue\" title=\"\">Pitt Cue began and grew</a>.</p> <p><strong>Jenny</strong> And I made all the pickles at home.</p> <p><strong>Tom</strong> Since the farm, restaurant and guest rooms have been set up in Launceston, she\u2019s arrived and said things like \u201cThe garden\u2019s a shambles\u201d, \u201cThe bathroom tiles need bleaching\u201d and also: \u201cDon\u2019t get any more pigs, please.\u201d I get my work ethic from you.</p> <p><strong>Jenny</strong> I\u2019m worried that he takes on too much. He does animal husbandry to a very high level and it takes time. And now him and Lottie have a five-month baby. And he\u2019s wanting to do four more rooms in one of the barns and another orchard and vegetable patch.</p> <p><strong>Tom</strong> Each part makes the whole better. I\u2019m not a huge fan of expansion for its own sake.

While dishes akin to this are found all over Europe \u2013 countless countries have a dish founded upon a humble legume, fresh tomatoes and some piece of salted and preserved pork \u2013 for me at least, this is synonymous with my mother, and the kitchen of my childhood home in rural Hampshire.</p> <p>My mother has wonderfully green fingers and that rare but vital ability to build a larder of beautiful things from what is farmed, grown, foraged and gathered through the seasons. During my childhood, there was rarely a moment when something was not bubbling away on the stove, salting in the larder or being frantically bottled. A simple dish of braised beans and tomatoes from the garden \u2013 sometimes with bacon if available, sometimes not \u2013 was a constant presence through late summer, and even well into winter thanks to a freezer stocked with enough batches of summer tomato sauce to last through an apocalypse. A cast-iron pot would slowly tick away over the course of a few hours, often left on top of the Aga to keep hot for for any of us kids to help ourselves as we passed through the kitchen. It regularly made for an ideal lunch with some aioli, fresh leaves and a warm baguette, and often became a fine dinner with additional steamed greens and some slow-roasted poultry. It\u2019s also one of those dishes that benefits from a day or two in the fridge before being reheated.</p> <p>This dish is a lesson in the importance of great ingredients and, in hindsight, was perhaps the most important thing to understand from watching and helping in the kitchen and garden at home. When made with tomatoes at the peak of their power, fresh herbs and fine bacon, this is a thing of unbelievable satisfaction. On the other hand, substitute the vitals for tinned tomatoes, poorly dried herbs and soggy wet cured bacon, and this will be a most ordinary affair. And therein lies the beauty of the simplest of foods.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 4 comfortably<br></strong></em><strong>extra virgin olive oil<br>smoked bacon </strong>100g, diced<br><strong>onions</strong> 3 medium, peeled and diced<br><strong>garlic</strong> 6 cloves, minced<br><strong>celery</strong> 6 sticks, diced<br><strong>bay leaves</strong> 2<br><strong>rosemary</strong> 2 sprigs <br><strong>thyme</strong> 2 sprigs<br><strong>smoked paprika</strong> \u00be tsp<br><strong>tomatoes</strong> 250g, fresh and nicely ripe, roughly diced<br><strong>dried haricot beans</strong> 250g, soaked overnight, or fresh beans if available<br><strong>chicken stock</strong> 500ml<br><strong>salt</strong> to taste<br><strong>crusty bread</strong> to serve<br><strong>aioli</strong> to serve</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 160C fan/gas mark 4. Place a heavy bottomed pan on a medium heat, add a good glug of olive oil, the smoked bacon, onions and garlic, and let them sweat until they begin to gently caramelise.</p> <p>Add the celery and keep cooking until softened. Add the bay leaves, rosemary, thyme and paprika. Keep cooking for another 10 minutes. Add the fresh tomatoes, and allow them to cook for 30 minutes until they are fully broken down. Season to taste at this stage.</p> <p>Add the soaked and drained haricot beans and the chicken stock, and bring to a gentle simmer on the stove.</p> <p>Move the pan to the oven with the lid off and bake for 2 hours until thick and unctuous with a nice crust.</p> <p>Taste again and season accordingly with salt.</p> <p>Remove from the oven and allow to mellow for an hour.

  "<p>Nine migrant labourers working on the stadiums for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar died in 2019, the \u201csupreme committee\u201d organising the event has announced, bringing the number of deaths on World Cup projects to 34, since construction began six years ago.</p> <p>31 of the deaths, including the nine who died last year, are classified as \u201cnon-work related\u201d, a term the supreme committee uses to describe deaths that largely occur off the worksite, most of which are attributed to sudden and unexplained cardiac or respiratory failure.</p> <p>The latest figures, released in its <a href=\"https://www.qatar2022.qa/sites/default/files/Workers-Welfare-Progress-Report-dec-2019-EN.pdf\">annual report on workers\u2019 welfare</a>, include four workers who died of so-called natural causes and three who were killed in a company bus accident. There were no deaths caused by workplace accidents in 2019.</p> <p>The supreme committee said it investigates each death to identify contributory factors and preventative measures. \u201cAny loss of life on our programme is deeply saddening,\u201d said Hassan Al Thawadi, the head of the supreme committee, in the report.</p> <p>Qatari law and the supreme committee\u2019s worker welfare standards do not require companies to pay compensation for non-work related deaths. However, in October the Guardian revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/oct/07/sudden-deaths-of-hundreds-of-migrant-workers-in-qatar-not-investigated\">Qatar rarely carries out post-mortems</a> when a migrant worker dies, making it difficult to accurately determine the cause of death and establish if it was non-work related. The Guardian further found that Qatar\u2019s extreme summer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/oct/02/revealed-hundreds-of-migrant-workers-dying-of-heat-stress-in-qatar-each-year\">heat is likely to be a significant factor</a> in many worker deaths.</p> <p>The widow of one of the stadium workers who died last year is still waiting for a response to a letter she wrote to Al Thawadi, asking for compensation.

Students can enter his hospital room by pulling on a VR headset, and scan his heart monitor or reach for stethoscopes and syringes by turning their heads.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/feb/27/too-few-counsellors-on-campus-why-students-are-turning-to-mental-health-apps\">Too few counsellors on campus: why students are turning to mental health apps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The students can mimic anything a practicing doctor would do: they can take George\u2019s medical history or check his temperature, listen to his chest by sliding the stethoscope\u2019s metal diaphragm along his back as he leans forward in bed, or shine a flashlight down his anatomically accurate throat.</p> <p>Since it launched in 2017, OMS has built up a vast library of scenarios that let student doctors test their abilities on everything from sepsis to bladder infections, strokes, heart failure, or diabetic emergencies. </p> <p>It might sound like a tech gimmick but this software has the potential to improve medical training. \u201cWhat we learn in medical school doesn\u2019t necessarily prepare you for the real world,\u201d says OMS co-founder Jack Pottle, who is a former NHS doctor himself. \u201cPeople are making mistakes the world over that impact patient\u2019s lives when potentially they could have been taught in a better, more practical way. Virtual reality gives you clinical experience on demand.\u201d</p> <p>According to Sally Shiels, a medical education fellow at at the University of Oxford, trainee doctors currently must wait for the right patient to seek treatment at a teaching hospital and then consent to students learning from their case. \u201cVirtual reality gives students access to a whole number of virtual patients in a way that doesn\u2019t exist at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>The concept of learning via simulations isn\u2019t new in medicine. But until VR, student doctors had to work with highly sophisticated mannequins or donated cadavers. They\u2019re expensive to set up, complex and limited in how many students they can reach. With VR, huge groups of students can repeat scenarios again and again. </p> <p>VR can compensate for stretched resources in the NHS, says Omar Sabri, a consultant surgeon in trauma and orthopaedics at St George\u2019s Healthcare NHS Trust, who has also been trialling VR with trainees. Trainees are able to prepare for procedures without the assistance of busy consultants giving them substantially longer to practise before they move on to a real patient. As a result, \u201cit reduces surgical error and shortens the learning curve for trainees\u201d.</p> <p>VR is also helping medical students practise skills without risking exposure to the coronavirus pandemic. As medical schools pause clinical training, OMS has reported an increase in demand for its technology. </p> <p>According to Justin Barad, an orthopaedic surgeon and the founder of Osso VR, the technology can also benefit qualified surgeons, who are increasingly expected to master an ever-lengthening list of procedures. In the past Barad says he\u2019s scrubbed out of the operating room and quickly Googled a procedure or watched instructions on YouTube to keep up.</p> <p>With the Osso VR software surgeons can pull on an Oculus Quest headsetand enter a virtual operating room that has been painstakingly rendered by a team of seven medical illustrators (including an art director who previously worked on Star Wars films).</p> <p>\u201cYou have the sound of anaesthesia machines behind you, you have the pulse of the patient beeping in the background \u2013 it\u2019s familiar down to every last detail,\u201d says Michael Seem, a resident surgeon at Wake Forest Baptist Health, a teaching hospital in North Carolina.</p> <p>As well as being cheaper and more accessible, there\u2019s evidence that VR scenarios are effective teaching tools. A 2019 study by Oxford University\u2019s Simulation, Teaching and Research Centre, where the OMS software is used, found that they were equal to or outperformed classic teaching methods. Asked to treat Emma, a virtual patient with an oozing abscess on her leg, fourth-year medical students described VR as \u201cmuch more engrossing\u201d than typical teaching methods. Its simulation of \u201creal world urgency\u201d meant they felt \u201ca genuine sense of duty to this patient\u201d, says Sally Shiels, an anaesthetist and teacher at the university.</p> <p>Mark Taubert, a physician and senior lecturer in palliative medicine at Cardiff University, was so intrigued by the idea that he created his own VR content. In 2017 he bought six VR headsets and a 360-degree VR camera. He recalls initial teething troubles, including poor image quality and a misplaced resuscitation doll making it into the shot. \u201cWe soon had students asking about the dead body in the corner,\u201d he says. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/dec/04/the-netflixisation-of-academia-is-this-the-end-for-university-lectures\">'The Netflixisation of academia': is this the end for university lectures?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nevertheless, student feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. \u201cYou always hear about the betterment of healthcare due to improvements in technology, but you never really think about it being implemented in medical education,\u201d says Ahsan Abdulla, a fourth year medical student at the university. Pulling on the headset, Abdulla was transported to a small, dimly lit room where Taubert was delivering a PowerPoint presentation on nausea in palliative care. \u201cIt was actually quite a surreal experience,\u201d he says. \u201cI could look all around the room, including at the other medical students who had attended.\u201d</p> <p>Taubert has ambitious plans for the technology. \u201cMedical students are often underexposed to the realities of a frightened or even angry family, who feel the system has let them down,\u201d he says. \u201cHow do you safely test your limits, without causing harm through exposure via bedside teaching?\u201d</p> <p>Pottle thinks it\u2019s only a matter of time before VR is rolled out widely across medical education. \u201cThere is always a fear of doing new things in medicine, and in particular medical education because we\u2019re inherently risk averse. But when people try it in practice that begins to go away; they very quickly see how this does fit in with what they do. This is teaching people about how to improve care and how to save lives.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>After the unexpected success of The Invisible Man, a low-budget adaptation of the HG Wells novel that tapped into contemporary fears around stalking and toxic masculinity, the film industry\u2019s appetite for the hoary old staples of classic horror appears to have reawakened, like a shambling zombie emerging from a freshly-dug grave. Blumhouse, the independent studio behind The Invisible Man as well as hits such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/22/get-out-review-jordan-peele-writer-director-liberal-white-racism\">Get Out</a>, The Hunt and Happy Death Day, has just announced its latest project: a new version of that genre favourite, Dracula. With a string of successes behind it, and a newfound predilection for the classic stories that have transfixed generations of horror fans, Blumhouse now resembles nothing less than a modern-day version of Hammer, the British production company whose name became a byword for terror in the 1950s and 60s.</p> <p>Hammer is arguably most renowned for immortalising Dracula featuring Christopher Lee as the suave, aristocratic bloodsucker in a string of baroque, highly coloured films; their stable of stars also included Peter Cushing who played (among others) Van Helsing to Lee\u2019s Dracula, Victor Frankenstein and Sherlock Holmes. Much revered for its gory, gaudy approach, Hammer profited by an agreement with Universal studios, whose \u201chorror cycle\u201d of the 1930s introduced these stories to mass cinema audiences, featuring the likes of Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8eb36b09ed5d8892551e8a71ab0c8f8fcbac76c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8eb36b09ed5d8892551e8a71ab0c8f8fcbac76c4/0_0_2928_2338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Lee in Dracula, 1972.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"798\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gory, gaudy \u2026 Christopher Lee in Dracula, 1972.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hammer/Warner Bros/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It looks as though Blumhouse has pulled off a similar trick, as its recent Invisible Man, backed by Universal, is largely credited with reinvigorating the studio\u2019s beleaguered \u201cDark Universe\u201d, conceived as the horror-movie answer to multi-part film series such as Marvel or Star Wars, but which stumbled with the failure of its first high-profile offering, The Mummy, starring Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe, in 2017. <a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3563423233/\">The Mummy cost around $125m to make</a>, and only managed to muster $80m in its home market (though was somewhat rescued by overseas box office, resulting in $409m in total worldwide takings). In contrast, <a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt1051906/?ref_=bo_se_r_1\">this year\u2019s Invisible Man cost $7m</a>, and has so far made its cost back many times over, at $105m globally.</p> <p>For Alan Jones, horror film expert and co-director of horror festival <a href=\"https://www.frightfest.co.uk/\">FrightFest</a>, the comparison between Blumhouse and Hammer is a valid one, but there are certain key differences. \u201c[Blumhouse CEO] Jason Blum is very clever: he surrounds himself with superfans and genre fans. Hammer never did that: I\u2019ve met quite a few of the original people, and to be honest they had no real love for the genre; it was just a business. Obviously it\u2019s a business for Blum too, but there is a bit more fandom in the background at Blumhouse and they are trying to do right by the properties. That\u2019s the main difference.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfdad6cf4260142750b998c8d0c43323d5ce5f59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfdad6cf4260142750b998c8d0c43323d5ce5f59/0_0_3000_1977/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flop \u2026 Tom Cruise in The Mummy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flop \u2026 Tom Cruise in The Mummy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of The Invisible Man\u2019s strengths was to thoroughly contemporise the fable, focusing on Elisabeth Moss as a woman who fears the invisible entity is her controlling ex, harassing and stalking her. Alan Jones, horror film expert and co-director of horror festival FrightFest, says he thought Invisible Man was \u201cabsolutely fantastic\u201d and that the film \u201cupdated the story in exactly the right way: touching every hot button issue of the moment but still keeping true to what the actual core concept is. I hope they do that with Dracula too.\u201d Details of the new film are thin on the ground, but <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/karyn-kusama-to-direct-new-dracula-film-blumhouse/\">Blumhouse has announced</a> that director Karyn Kusama will be in charge. With credits such as Destroyer, Girlfight and horror comedy Jennifer\u2019s Body, Kusama would appear well-placed to inject topical ideas into the traditional neck-biting action.</p> <p>Jones points out that Blumhouse, like Hammer, has had its fair share of misses as well as hits \u2013 \u201cfor every Hunt there\u2019s a Black Christmas, and for every Purge there\u2019s that awful Fantasy Island\u201d \u2013 but says in retrospect Universal\u2019s decision to hand over its stable to Blumhouse was an excellent move: \u201cI don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t give The Mummy to them instead of overinflating it with that Tom Cruise rubbish.\u201d Blumhouse\u2019s particular skill is at making a little go a very long way and thereby achieving enormous profit margins: most of its films are budgeted under the $10m mark with only a very few \u2013 generally co-productions with major studios \u2013 breaking $20m. In recent years, the Hammer brand has itself been revived, with productions such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/29/daniel-radcliffe-woman-black-horror-record\">The Woman in Black</a> and its sequel making a splash.</p> <p>However, Jones says it\u2019s best to proceed cautiously. \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens with Blumhouse, there comes a tipping point sometimes, they might go too far and overextend themselves, so they have to be a bit careful. But let\u2019s hope.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8606756330f7490d6060f231cdc3b596bcfe91c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8606756330f7490d6060f231cdc3b596bcfe91c0/0_531_3600_1852/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Purge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"514\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fright knights \u2026 The Purge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image from film company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Blumhouse hits</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/25/paranormal-activity-review\">Paranormal Activity</a></strong> (2009)<br>Cost: $15,000 <br>Worldwide box office: $193.4m</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/04/how-the-purge-trolls-trumps-america-jason-blum-first-purge\">The Purge</a></strong> (2013) <br>Cost: $3m <br>Worldwide box office: $89.3m</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/17/sundance-film-festival-review-whiplash\">Whiplash</a></strong> (2014)<br>Cost: $3.3m <br>Worldwide box office: $49m<br>Won 3 Oscars</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/27/split-review-james-mcavoy-m-night-shyamalan-fantastic-fest-austin\">Split</a></strong> (2017)<br>Cost: $9m<br>Worldwide box office: $278.5m</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/19/get-out-review-jordan-peele-racism-america\">Get Out</a></strong> (2017)<br>Cost $4.5m <br>Worldwide box office: $255.4m<br>Won 1 Oscar</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/11/happy-death-day-review-jessica-rothe\">Happy Death Day</a></strong> (2017)<br>Cost $4.8m<br>Worldwide box office: $125.5m</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/09/halloween-review-jamie-lee-curtis-is-back-but-this-time-no-tricks-or-treats\">Halloween</a></strong> (2018)<br>Cost $10m<br>Worldwide box office: $255.5m</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/29/ma-review-octavia-spencer-creepy-exploitation-thriller\">Ma</a></strong> (2019)<br>Cost: $5m<br>Worldwide box office: $60.6m</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"910d2bf1438b3a23bf725f5bf317e65b608d2e6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/910d2bf1438b3a23bf725f5bf317e65b608d2e6d/0_0_2477_1651/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ma, starring Octavia Spencer, right.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ma, starring Octavia Spencer, right.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Kooris/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

The shocking possible extent of the crisis comes as Boris Johnson sought to shore up confidence in his handling of the situation by announcing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/15/boris-johnson-to-hold-daily-coronavirus-press-briefings\">that he will hold a daily media conference</a> for \u201cas long as necessary\u201d.

The shift has been triggered by changes to the state pension age, the data reveals, with the number of older women in the workforce increasing by 51% since the reforms were introduced in 2010. The number of working men aged between 60 and 64 increased by 13% over the same period.

But a team of researchers have concluded after exhaustive testing that they are probably fakes made of old shoe leather.</p> \n<h2>Coronavirus Extra</h2> \n<p>The story continued to move quickly overnight. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control urged people to avoid gatherings of more than 50 people as the death toll rose to 64 and California\u2019s governor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/california-governor-directs-all-bars-nightclubs-wineries-close-coronavirus\">asked bars to shut down.</a> New York City ordered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/coronavirus-new-york-city-closes-public-schools-system\">all its public schools to close</a>. Argentina has gone into full lockdown and South Africa has declared a national emergency. In Washington, however, Donald Trump gave a brief press conference in which he insisted the US was \u201cdoing great\u201d in fighting the outbreak, and heaped praise on the US Federal Reserve after it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/15/federal-reserve-cuts-interest-rates-near-zero-prop-up-us-economy-coronavirus\">announced it was slashing interest rates</a> to near zero.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"04fecb04-934a-4af1-baee-358948ad8ba5\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0hG3V9378fg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But even that emergency cut has failed to calm nerves on financial markets with another turbulent day in prospect on global stock markets.

  "<p>The department of health says it is acting to preserve domestic supplies of a critical component in coronavirus testing, which have come under \u201cconsiderable strain\u201d during the current pandemic.</p> \n<p>The Australian Medical Association told the Guardian on Monday that some jurisdictions had failed to properly stockpile a common reagent critical in the testing of coronavirus, creating supply issues because of the huge demand on Australian laboratories due to Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Chemical reagents are used to extract nucleic acids from swabs taken from potential coronavirus patients. The extraction of ribonucleic acid (RNA) is only one part of the coronavirus testing, but it is crucial in confirming the presence of the virus.</p> \n<p>The reagent used to extract the RNA is not specific to coronavirus and is used in testing for a range of illnesses, including other types of influenza, the AMA said.</p> \n<p>The department of health said there was currently significant pressure on stocks of all consumables used by laboratories.</p> \n<p>But it voiced particular concern about RNA extraction.</p> \n<p>\u201cDue to global demand exceeding supply, stocks of all laboratory related testing consumables are under considerable strain,\u201d a spokeswoman said.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt the moment there are particular concerns around supplies of swabs and DNA extraction kits.\u201d</p> \n<p>The department said there was also pressure on the stocks of swabs.</p> \n<p>Urgent steps were being taken to prevent any danger of shortages, the department said, including to \u201cconserve the supply of consumables\u201d already in Australia.</p> \n<p>Doctors were also being urged to only perform tests for those who met the definition of a \u201csuspect case\u201d. The department was analysing the supply chains of multinational manufacturers, and assessing emerging technology and innovative testing methods.</p> \n<p>\u201cSome laboratories are also beginning to screen test request forms for relevant clinical and travel history and where a test is not justified, the testing request is being rejected,\u201d the spokeswoman said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d9bee753-7d1a-4e80-ba20-84475dc07eea\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What are the common symptoms of Covid-19?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Fever</li>\n     <li>Dry cough</li>\n     <li>Fatigue</li>\n     <li>Muscle aches and pains&nbsp;</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>When should I get tested?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The current national advice is to get tested if you:<br></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>are experiencing the symptoms above,&nbsp;<b>and</b></li>\n     <li>have travelled overseas recently (within the past 14 days); or</li>\n     <li>have been in close contact with a confirmed case of Covid-19</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Help lines</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;national<b>&nbsp;</b>coronavirus health information hotline is <b>1800 020 080.</b><br><a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert\">The federal health department has a coronavirus health alert website.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The state health department websites and contact numbers are:<br></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li><a href=\"https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Pages/default.aspx\">NSW</a> \u2013 1300 066 055</li>\n     <li><a href=\"https://www.dhhs.vic.gov.au/coronavirus\">Victoria</a> \u2013 1800 675 398</li>\n     <li><a href=\"https://www.health.qld.gov.au/clinical-practice/guidelines-procedures/diseases-infection/diseases/coronavirus\">Queensland</a> \u2013 13 HEALTH or 13 432 584</li>\n     <li><a href=\"https://www.sahealth.sa.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/public+content/sa+health+internet/health+topics/health+topics+a+-+z/novel+coronavirus\">South Australia</a> \u2013 1300 232 272</li>\n     <li><a href=\"https://ww2.health.wa.gov.au/Articles/A_E/Coronavirus\">Western Australia</a> \u2013 1300 62 32 92</li>\n     <li><a href=\"https://www.dhhs.tas.gov.au/publichealth/communicable_diseases_prevention_unit/infectious_diseases/coronavirus\">Tasmania </a>\u2013 1800 671 738</li>\n     <li><a href=\"https://health.act.gov.au/\">ACT</a> \u2013 Business hours: 02 5124 9213, after hours: 02 9962 4155</li>\n     <li><a href=\"https://health.nt.gov.au/\">Northern Territory</a> \u2013 08 8922 8044</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Chris Moy, the AMA\u2019s president in South Australia, said Australia currently has \u201cvery variable stocking\u201d of the RNA extraction reagent across different states and territories.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-australian-stocks-of-covid-19-testing-kits-rapidly-deteriorating-says-chief-medical-officer\">Australian stocks of coronavirus testing kits 'rapidly deteriorating', says chief medical officer</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>That\u2019s left some jurisdictions facing supply issues but others well-prepared, he said.</p> \n<p>South Australia was singled out for praise.

Firstly, there has been very variable stocking by the state pathology services of this.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThe other reason why there is a bit of a burn-through ... there is still a proportion of the \u2018worried well\u2019 getting tested. The problem with that is the criteria for testing keeps changing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Moy said the problem again showed the need for the establishment of a nationally-coordinated disease control authority, similar to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/australian-state-governments-declare-public-health-emergencies-to-contain-coronavirus\">Australian state governments declare public health emergencies to contain coronavirus</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cIt just shows again that dealing with a pandemic which is a state thing can\u2019t rely on jurisdictional inconsistencies, and also that dealing with a pandemic is a practical not a theoretical issue. That\u2019s why the AMA has been calling for a centre for disease control to coordinate responses.\u201d</p> \n<p>Australia is hardly alone in facing strain on its supply of reagent.</p> \n<p>Last week, the <a href=\"https://www.medtechdive.com/news/fda-chief-warns-of-supply-pressure-on-reagents-for-coronavirus-tests/573999/\">head of the US Food and Drug Administration, Stephen Hahn</a>, said he was \u201caware of pressure in the supply system on the reagents\u201d needed in coronavirus testing. The agency was working 24/7 to address the problem, he said, and was seeking to supply laboratories with reagent alternatives.</p> \n<p>Grattan Institute health program director Stephen Duckett, a former secretary of the health department, said Australian officials had know for weeks that testing supply issues would arise. He said more should have been done to forecast the demand for testing.</p> \n<p>\u201cWere there estimates of demand?\u201d he asked.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a6078f6-5a66-4d3e-9339-5610fe320767\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.</p>\n    <p>The UN agency&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public\">advises</a>&nbsp;people to:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap</li>\n     <li>Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing</li>\n     <li>Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough</li>\n     <li>Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers</li>\n     <li>Advice about face masks varies.

All of those 160,000 people that we have definite diagnoses on have had at least one test.\u201d</p> \n<p>Moy said the government\u2019s decision to bring private laboratories into the testing regime would help alleviate the pressure, as would stricter and more consistent criteria for who can be tested.</p> \n<p>The New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, said on Monday his state had a significant capacity for testing, compared with other jurisdictions. He urged only those who met certain criteria went for testing.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe reason why I\u2019m telling people that is that obviously pathology laboratories have a limited amount of capacity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a very big capacity here in New South Wales compared to other states and territories, but it\u2019s still limited.

They go: \u2018The thing is, right \u2026\u2019\u201d He grins mischievously: \u201cJust don\u2019t make me look like Eric Clapton, OK?\u201d</p> <p>The musician best known as the Streets has come prepared for what he has \u2013 cheekily \u2013 assumed will be a takedown interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I need to be cancelled or not. Was Fit But You Know It sexist?\u201d he says, referring to his 2004 single that contained the lyric: \u201cSee, I reckon you\u2019re about an eight or a nine / Maybe even nine-and-a-half in four beers\u2019 time.\u201d Well, it doesn\u2019t look too great under a 2020 microscope, I admit. But then, as Skinner points out: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely better than [the Prodigy\u2019s] Smack My Bitch Up!\u201d</p> <p>Skinner doesn\u2019t need to worry about being out of touch, though. He may be settling into middle age at 41, but he\u2019s about to release None of Us Are Getting Out of This Life Alive, a mixtape full of guest spots from young stars. And while in his 00s heyday the Streets could be lairy and laddy \u2013 Skinner made his name rapping about beers, birds and bad takeaways \u2013 there was always far more going on with his lyrics. Turn the Page, the opening track of the Streets\u2019 2002 debut Original Pirate Material, referenced the Roman empire, Jimi Hendrix, the Bible, knife crime and Birmingham\u2019s Bullring \u2013 and it was only three minutes long.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"23efab2b71ea91b17ea76395a1e5c64bbe64bab4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23efab2b71ea91b17ea76395a1e5c64bbe64bab4/0_1127_3508_3834/915.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Skinner performing in 2019.\" width=\"915\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike Skinner performing in 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born in London, but raised in Birmingham, Skinner\u2019s talent was to take UK garage and make it more relatable to people like him: rather than champagne and velvet VIP ropes, he was conjuring verses about Vauxhall Novas and scrambled eggs. Crucially, he found a way to rap about male fragility in a way that appealed directly to men: revealing their cluelessness around the opposite sex (Don\u2019t Mug Yourself), fascination with, and fear of, violence (Geezers Need Excitement) and ultimate self-centredness (It\u2019s Too Late). His biggest hit, Dry Your Eyes, was a heartfelt exploration of how it feels to be dumped. Yet rather than seeing it as a defining song that ripped up the rulebook and made it OK for young men to openly talk about their feelings, Skinner maintains it was just a clumsy attempt to impress women. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a young artist and a boy, you think: \u2018Now I\u2019m gonna write one for the girls.\u2019 And, of course, the girls will never like it. Because you think: \u2018Well, girls like something they can sing along to\u2019 and \u2018Girls like romance\u2019 ... but actually, they kind of like basslines.\u201d</p> <p>Skinner\u2019s intelligence has sometimes seemed as much of a burden to him as a gift. In the past he has cut a complex, self-critical and frequently frustrated figure. Skinner wound up the Streets in 2011, admitting he was exhausted with the whole thing. He struggled for subject matter \u2013 \u201cYou gradually make your life easier and easier until you\u2019ve got nothing left to say\u201d \u2013 and success didn\u2019t agree with him. At times he could be petulant \u2013 he remembers one show where he got drunk and started mocking the lyrics to It\u2019s Too Late. \u201cMy A&amp;R man had to say: \u2018Stop taking the piss, people have paid to hear something, an emotion.\u2019 The thing is, artists want to move on quickly to the next thing. But it takes fans a long time to get to know and like a song, for it to become a part of their life. If you\u2019re not allowing them to do that you\u2019re really just wasting your time putting all that effort into the art.\u201d</p> <p>Looking back on that first album is a strange experience for Skinner because it came so naturally. \u201cPeople say: \u2018Oh, they\u2019re only 19 or 20 and they\u2019ve made this amazing music,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s like ... actually, that\u2019s when it\u2019s easiest. You\u2019ve come straight out of the school playground and you\u2019re like: \u2018That\u2019s shit, that\u2019s good, this is what I believe in, go.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Original Pirate Material made Skinner famous, but it was the Street\u2019s follow up, 2004\u2019s A Grand Don\u2019t Come for Free, that sent his fame stratospheric, and his mind into a spin. \u201cI don\u2019t generally have a lot of sympathy for celebrities,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause you can always not walk into the fire. But if you <em>do,</em> then you are absolutely taking a gamble with your mental health. And it\u2019s a traumatic thing, to be very young and very famous. Not like some traumas, but it\u2019s \u2026 I guess it\u2019s a bit like winning the lottery. It doesn\u2019t usually end well.\u201d</p> <p>Skinner once <a href=\"https://mixmag.net/read/mike-skinner-i-have-to-get-creative-or-i-get-suicidal-or-something-news\" title=\"\">told an interviewer</a>: \u201cI have to be creative or I get suicidal or something.\u201d Records that grappled with his fame, such as Prangin\u2019 Out, from the Streets\u2019 third album, The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living, contained lyrics about doing \u201csomething stupid\u201d. Was that really how bad things got?</p> <p>\u201cI only ever got as far as thinking about it,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd thinking about it is a reason to go to a psychiatrist.\u201d</p> <p>Did he?</p> <p>\u201cYeah. I actually saw my psychiatrist just last week. We spent the whole time talking about skiing.\u201d He laughs: \u201cI think basically the rule is, if you end up talking about the psychiatrist, you\u2019re probably good.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f9bf7441c3704ec5be33343df533023a6fa3adcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9bf7441c3704ec5be33343df533023a6fa3adcb/0_0_4040_5023/804.jpg\" alt=\"Skinner in 2002.\" width=\"804\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Skinner in 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Herbie Knott/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Around the time Skinner\u2019s career was really taking off, he lost his father (grief inspired the beautiful Never Went to Church) after a long illness, which didn\u2019t help his emotional struggles. Skinner was the youngest of four siblings, and credits his dad for the wisdom he passed on: \u201cMy dad was a lot older \u2013 he grew up in the second world war, he literally was in the blitz. He used to listen to Glen Miller ... war joints, know what I mean? But he was incredibly open-minded.\u201d</p> <p>He remembers being dumped as a 14-year-old and his dad explaining how things would get easier, but that he would soon have to work out how to look out for women, too. \u201cHe made me see how strange it must be for a girl to go from being a child to suddenly forced on to the market. Only someone who has had a previous marriage, children, literally at the end of their life, could teach little things like that.\u201d</p> <p>Since he first ended the Streets, Skinner\u2019s career has been hard to untangle. There have been various under-the-radar projects such as rock outfit the Dot with the Music\u2019s Rob Harvey, or his slightly rambling Peak Times podcast series with Murkage Dave, the soulful singer with whom he also put on successful, balloon-filled hip-hop and grime Tonga club nights (sample discussion topics: M\u00fcller Rice vs M\u00fcller Corner; what if Hitler had Twitter?). In 2017, Skinner brought the Streets back from retirement for a greatest hits tour and a series of collaborative efforts such as the drum\u2019n\u2019bass club track Take Me As I Am with Chris Lorenzo. Again, it all seemed pretty scattershot, which is how Skinner enjoys working \u2013 he likens making his new mixtape to \u201cdirecting chaos\u201d.</p> <p>Chatting to Skinner can be a bit like directing chaos, too. He is fascinating company, but ask a question about one of his songs, for instance, and you\u2019re only ever one step removed from a tangential discussion about the Cambrian explosion (\u201cWas there really enough time for all these dinosaurs to evolve?\u201d) or the way our eyeballs age (\u201cHaving watched the Irishman, even the middle-aged Robert de Niro\u2019s still got old man eyes. They\u2019re more reflective or something.\u201d)</p> <p>\u201cYou wonder if we\u2019re all part of a magic mushroom experience,\u201d he says at one point. \u201cOr maybe we\u2019re living in a simulation. They do say 50% of all science will be disproved ... so really it\u2019s a flip of the coin whether anything is true or not.\u201d You sometimes wish you were down the pub with him, free to follow him down his endless rabbit holes, rather than marshalling an interview.</p> <p>Right now, he appears to have found a project he can finally focus on: a Streets film that he has been working on for \u201cdonkey\u2019s years\u201d, but which he hopes will finally start shooting this year. \u201cIt\u2019s a Streets musical, really,\u201d he says, shortly before telling me that it\u2019s not really a Streets musical at all, although it does feature a soundtrack of Streets music that he wrote about three years ago. \u201cI love Raymond Chandler and so with the film, it\u2019s this idea of a DJ as a sort of cynical or disillusioned private detective,\u201d he says. \u201cBasically, imagine if Philip Marlowe was a bass DJ, featuring music from the Streets.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fab75187dce766393cb8d77b0f1ac91e56b6067c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fab75187dce766393cb8d77b0f1ac91e56b6067c/2_0_8144_4888/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018When you\u2019re a young artist and a boy, you think: \u201cNow I\u2019m gonna write one for the girls ...

A Grand Don\u2019t Come for Free was an ambitious rap opera that wrapped a tale of romance and remorse around the disappearance of \u00a31,000 belonging to the protagonist. To write it, he attended a workshop with the Hollywood screenwriting guru Robert McKee, who taught the likes of Kirk Douglas, Paul Haggis, Joan Rivers and even David Bowie.</p> <p>That album clearly influenced his film project, but perhaps not as much as his DJing experience. \u201cI\u2019d spent years and years working on scripts, wondering what I could write about,\u201d he says. \u201cThen one night I was in Manchester, a security guy had just beaten someone up, and I suddenly realised: it\u2019s very easy to find stories in nightclubs. It\u2019s the middle of the night, people are literally trying to be their worst selves ... even the promoters are! No one\u2019s there to behave.\u201d</p> <p>Does he still engage in night-time hedonism himself? \u201cIt\u2019s difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cWith touring, you control everything, so it\u2019s very easy to do whatever you want. If you want to take smack, play with animals and paint the dressing room every night then that\u2019s fine \u2013 you just need to cut a cheque. It\u2019s also very easy to <em>not</em> do that, and find a routine where it\u2019s carrot juice and turmeric lattes every night rather than straight-up madness. But with DJing, it\u2019s not your world you\u2019re walking into, it\u2019s whatever that promoter and that town have created. So you\u2019re hoping it doesn\u2019t go left because it\u2019s not cool to be 40, in a nightclub, getting off your face. But it happens.\u201d</p> <p>Still, Skinner says he\u2019s a lot more grownup than he used to be. He has to be, with two kids to look after (Amelia, 10, and George, 8), which must be difficult to balance with the wild nights.</p> <p>\u201cWell I\u2019m definitely going to get Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for your sleep. But having kids does kind of focus your creativity.\u201d</p> <p>Skinner hasn\u2019t stopped championing underground artists. In 2017, his excellent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn-70oSrLgA\" title=\"\">Don\u2019t Call It Road Rap</a> documentary for Vice was released, which explored the explosion of the UK rap scene. Filming it, he says he was struck \u2013 and slightly embarrassed \u2013 by the fact he could be in one of the rougher ends of Kilburn, north London, talking to young musicians about \u201cprison, illegitimate business, all kinds of goonish stuff\u201d, and then take an Uber a few minutes down the road to mix in music and fashion circles with his wife, Claire Le Marquand, whom he met when she worked at Warner Brothers, his record label, and married in 2010.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e13d379c618d37030cfd2d3ed8ab8e7547e8f80e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e13d379c618d37030cfd2d3ed8ab8e7547e8f80e/0_0_4912_7360/667.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Skinner: \u2018Just don\u2019t make me look like Eric Clapton, OK?\u2019\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike Skinner: \u2018Just don\u2019t make me look like Eric Clapton, OK?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think I struggled with that for a bit,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you realise that, actually, you can have an incredible sense of purpose that goes with that. Because I\u2019ve got so many incredible stories of people changing their lives with rap. And it\u2019s a nice thing to see. Because <em>nobody</em> wants a life of crime. It\u2019s very hard work. It\u2019s much easier to be a musician than a drug dealer.\u201d</p> <p>He says he\u2019s currently trying to see things from other people\u2019s perspectives \u2013 be that rightwing financiers, petty criminals or the older generation. \u201cAs the so-called metropolitan elite, and I include myself here, I think we owe it to them. Because everybody believes they\u2019re the hero in their own story.\u201d Reflecting on the current generational divide, he says: \u201cWhen you\u2019re young you think old people are a bit stupid. But they\u2019ve done everything we\u2019ve done, plus everything the previous generations did, and the one before that. I think old people almost become Buddhists. They\u2019re like: \u2018It ain\u2019t worth me saying shit so I\u2019m going to just sit here and chill.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>You can imagine Skinner as an old man imparting his wisdom \u2013 it\u2019s basically what he has been doing through the course of five albums and however many other projects, an old head on young shoulders. Back in 2011, when Skinner was exhausted with the Streets, he tried to sum up his career thus far: \u201cFor the Streets \u2026 overall \u2026 I\u2019d say it was a seven out of 10.\u201d</p> <p>It seemed rather harsh considering his impact on British culture. Today, Skinner appears far less jaded and so, before he leaves, I wonder if he has a rosier assessment of his past work.</p> <p>\u201cI mean ... I still think that\u2019s fair,\u201d he says, ever the self-critic. \u201cBut I suppose my best songs have got to be a 9/10.\u201d</p> <p>He reconsiders this for a second: \u201cThen again, I wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to say that their best work wasn\u2019t a 9/10. If you don\u2019t think your best work is a nine then ... you probably need to go and see my psychiatrist.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The first single from the Streets\u2019 forthcoming mixtape will be released next month on Island Records</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 March 2020 because an earlier version gave Mike Skinner\u2019s age as 42.

Now it is being eaten away at its eastern and northern fringes.</p> <p>Armed groups, including some aligned with al-Qaida and Islamic State, are waging a campaign of indiscriminate killing that has driven soldiers, teachers, health workers and other symbols of the state from vast swathes of the country\u2019s borders.</p> <p>\u201cWe are at a point now where the very existence of the country is at stake,\u201d says Z\u00e9phirin Diabr\u00e9, the leader of the opposition party Union for Progress and Reform.</p> <p>\u201cOfficially, there is no location that has fallen to the terrorists,\u201d says Jacob Yarabatioula, a sociologist at the University of Ouagadougou researching the violence. \u201cBut in reality, there are places at the extreme borders with Mali where you have no signs of the administration.

Aid agencies say at least $300m (\u00a3244m) in funding will be required to feed and shelter the fleeing population.

The 2014 novel moves back and forth between the first days of a pandemic that ends civilization, and the long aftermath, as small groups of survivors try to rebuild. One band of characters forms a post-apocalyptic Shakespeare troupe and they travel the wilds of Canada, staging old plays in exchange for food. The real drama of the novel doesn\u2019t come from gore or gun battles, but from the protagonists\u2019 constant reckoning with just how much they have lost. \u201cSurvival is insufficient,\u201d they keep reminding each other, even as survival itself is far from guaranteed. It all feels terrifyingly plausible.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve read Station Eleven already, the author has a much anticipated new novel out this month: <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/567284/the-glass-hotel-by-emily-st-john-mandel/\">The Glass Hotel</a>, about a global Ponzi scheme and a woman who vanishes.</p> <h2><strong>Severance, by Ling Ma</strong></h2> <p>Looking for a pandemic novel that\u2019s also a satire of global capitalism? In Severance, the pandemic that ends civilization is the Shen fever, believed to have originated in Shenzen, China, the center of electronics manufacturing, and then spread through tiny fungal spores across the globe. The narrator is Candace Chen, who works in publishing in New York City, overseeing the Bibles division. Candace is sharp, sardonic, and before the world ends, slightly diffident. Somehow, she becomes one of the last people in Manhattan left alive, before fleeing into the wilderness in a yellow New York City taxi. As Alison Willmore, a film critic at Vulture, wrote: \u201cWe should all be reading Ling Ma\u2019s Severance, not just because of the pandemic parallels, but because its heroine\u2019s survival seems to depend on her resistance to nostalgia.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>The Great Believers, by Rebecca Makkai</strong></h2> <p>This is a novel about the long consequences of trauma and loss, set among a group of gay friends in Chicago at the very beginning of the Aids epidemic. It tells two stories in parallel, one unfolding in 1985, as Yale Tishman, a young art expert, begins to lose his friends to Aids, and the second in 2015, as Fiona, whose brother died from Aids in 1985, searches for her missing daughter, and must confront her unresolved grief. This is a gripping, fast-moving novel, a good choice for long days of isolation. I read it all <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/29/social-media-detox-read-books-one-week\">alone in a cabin in the woods</a>, and I forgot myself, and I could not put it down.</p> <h2><strong>The Old Drift, by Namwali Serpell</strong></h2> <p>This multigenerational epic follows the intertwining fortunes of three Zambian families (black, white and brown) over more than a century, from the late nineteenth century into the near future. It\u2019s a big, dazzling book, and Serpell\u2019s ambition and humor will win you over from the very first page. This is not a pandemic novel, but the Aids epidemic shapes the stories of the later generations, and the novel as a whole is grappling with other forces that shape our current pandemic: colonialism, technology, stigma and secrets, the idea of Europe, the idea of Africa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b8b95a3ed40ea568182d1fe6d51d2f37325a775\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b8b95a3ed40ea568182d1fe6d51d2f37325a775/906_422_2258_1355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Namwali Serpell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Namwali Serpell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The Power, by Naomi Alderman</strong></h2> <p>In this bestselling 2016 novel, women and girls develop the power to inflict pain or death on other people \u2013 men, mostly \u2013 with power that comes from their hands. It\u2019s the opposite of a pandemic, but it has a similar ability to destabilize and remake society. This is not a relaxing novel: the women who develop the power sometimes develop it in response to horrific violence, including sexual violence, and so the novel is a chronicle of the pain and terror inflicted on women around the world, as well as their growing rebellion.</p> <h2><strong>The Doomsday Book, by Connie Willis</strong></h2> <p>In this 1992 novel by one of America\u2019s most acclaimed science fiction writers, a graduate student who is part of a time-traveling history research group at Oxford is sent on an expedition to the Middle Ages and ends up in the middle of the Black Plague.

The protagonist is a struggling freelancer whose older brother, a famous investigative journalist, was murdered on Facebook Live, during a second American civil war (which was popularly called \u201cthe National Shitstorm\u201d.)

And it\u2019s this experience \u2013 witnessing the deadly greed, incompetence, and cruelty of the men who run the boarding school, and who put her and her fellow students at risk \u2013 that shapes Jane\u2019s character and outlook. Jane Eyre is so much bigger and stranger and more compelling than the gothic love story that made it famous. If you\u2019re lucky enough to be quarantined with someone else, read Jane Eyre aloud.</p> <h2><strong>Room, by Emma Donoghue</strong></h2> <p>This novel is narrated by a five-year-old boy, who has grown up with his mother in the single room where she is being held captive. For him, that room is the whole world, and everything in it is vividly real to him: the bed, his favorite spoon, the drawings that his mother makes for him. The love and inventiveness his mother shows in trying to give him a good life in that room will be especially resonant in this moment.</p> <h2><strong>Real Life, by Brandon Taylor</strong></h2> <p>Loneliness. Alienation. Mistrust. Science as it is actually practiced, so different from Science as an idea. The themes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/05/brandon-taylor-author-real-life-interview\">Taylor\u2019s elegant campus novel</a>, which follows the life of a queer black graduate student at a primarily white university, are resonant in a pandemic, though there are no zombie battles, just an ambiguously contaminated experiment.</p> <h2><strong>My Side of the Mountain, by Jean Craighead George</strong></h2> <p>This classic children\u2019s book from 1959 tells the story of a boy who runs away from home and learns how to live alone in the wilderness of the Catskill Mountains. He digs himself a burrow underneath a tree. He learns to fish. He tames a falcon. His loneliness is, for the most part, bracing and wholesome and creative. An excellent escape fantasy, and a reminder of the brilliant pleasures of solitary life (though few of those pleasures may be readily available in your apartment).</p> <h2><strong>The Plague, by Albert Camus</strong></h2> <p>You might think this slim novel is on so many pandemic book lists only because its title is literally The Plague. But it\u2019s so much more than that: I like to think of The Plague as an unexpected guide to self-care. You can take breaks, Camus reminds us, even in the most intense and devastating situations. So go swimming! I mean, you can\u2019t go swimming. You\u2019re in quarantine. Listen to the Existentialists: take a bath.</p> <h2><strong>Meditations in an Emergency, by Frank O\u2019Hara</strong></h2> <p>Just the poetry collection you need.

This is a critically acclaimed book, beloved of many discerning New Yorkers. I would rather eat every back issue of n+1 than finish this novel, but you, dear reader, may like it.</p> <h2><strong>Something that May Shock and Discredit You, by Daniel Mallory Ortberg (now Daniel M</strong><strong> Lavery)</strong></h2> <p>This essay collection, from one of the co-founders of the cult feminist website the Toast, is characteristically wry and winsome. Lord Byron! Evelyn Waugh! The Golden Girls! But there are real stakes to these essays, a real wrestling with faith, family, and transition. It\u2019s a good book to read while quarantined, because if you cry while reading it in public, you cannot touch your face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bd4b790c18d12004934fd8f118d40e9b8387a4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bd4b790c18d12004934fd8f118d40e9b8387a4d/0_928_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel M.

It\u2019s what people think because it\u2019s the easy way to explain it. So it\u2019s an easy way to make up a myth,\u201d said<a href=\"https://www.ulmer.com/attorneys/david-w-leopold/\"> David Leopold</a>, an immigration attorney and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.</p> <p>It\u2019s true that children born on US soil <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/cafe/immigration-lawyer-birthright-citizenship\">have been granted citizenship</a> through the 14th amendment to the US constitution, and that a landmark supreme court decision<a href=\"https://www.scpr.org/blogs/multiamerican/2011/01/19/7987/who-was-wong-kim-ark/\"> set the precedent</a> for that right to be extended to almost all children of foreigners. But Americans can\u2019t just immediately safeguard their family members from deportation. In fact, a US citizen<a href=\"https://my.uscis.gov/exploremyoptions/us_petition_for_immediate_relative\"> must be 21 years old</a> before they can sponsor their parents for a green card. <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/i-864\">They also</a> must be able to financially support their parents.</p> <p>Now the Trump administration\u2019s new public charge rule targeting low-income immigrants is adding yet another burden.</p> <p>Parents who were not inspected and admitted into the US face even more obstacles to changing their immigration status: <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/pressrelease/Section245ProvisionLIFEAct_032301.pdf\">with limited exceptions</a>, they have to go abroad as part of the legalization process and then often <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/legal-resources/unlawful-presence-and-bars-admissibility\">aren\u2019t allowed back into the US for </a><a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/legal-resources/unlawful-presence-and-bars-admissibility\">10 years</a>.</p> <p>Even if parents do get a green card, they have a five-year holding period before they can finally apply for naturalization.</p> <p>In the end, the so-called \u201canchor baby\u201d pathway to citizenship is at least a 26-year endeavor, even for those who entered the US legally.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous to think that that\u2019s some sort of a tactic that people use to come here, get citizenship, \u2019cause it just isn\u2019t true,\u201d said Leopold. \u201cIt\u2019s a myth, and it\u2019s a specious talking point.\u201d</p> <p>A talking point that\u2019s popular among anti-immigrant groups, pundits and the Republican party.</p> <p>The Republican senator Lindsey Graham has called birthright citizenship \u201c<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2010/07/graham-eyes-birthright-citizenship-040395#ixzz0v5pFRNr4\">a mistake</a>\u201d and argued that immigrants come to the US to \u201cdrop a child\u201d. Graham\u2019s former colleague the California<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-may-26-la-oe-rutten-20100526-story.html\"> congressman Duncan Hunter</a> even advocated for deporting the US-citizen children of undocumented immigrants. Congressman <a href=\"https://steveking.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/king-s-effort-to-end-birthright-citizenship-for-illegals-advanced-by\">Steve King</a> has continually introduced legislation challenging these kids\u2019 right to citizenship.</p> <p>When Donald Trump launched his campaign for the 2016 presidential election, his signature policy agenda around immigration often leaned into the \u201canchor baby\u201d fallacy. Part of his platform included<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/08/17/432605103/whats-in-donald-trumps-immigration-plan\"> ending birthright citizenship</a> for the children of undocumented immigrants, and Trump called for deporting such families.</p> <p>Since becoming commander-in-chief, Trump<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/us/birthright-citizenship-14th-amendment-trump.html\"> has continued to hint</a> at an impending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/30/trump-birthright-citizenship-executive-order-14th-amendment\">crackdown on birthright citizenship</a>, and in January,<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/22/21077547/state-department-pregnant-women-birth-tourism-policy\"> the administration made it more difficult</a> for pregnant people to get short-term visas. Meanwhile, officials at the border aren\u2019t allowing pregnant asylum seekers to attend their court hearings, and an attorney said it was so they wouldn\u2019t give birth to a US citizen, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/23/808536155/pregnant-asylum-seekers-barred-from-u-s-entry-for-court-hearings\">KPBS</a> reported.</p> <p>As the 2020 presidential election heats up, Trump will probably use birthright citizenship to rile his supporters, Leopold suggested.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s red meat for the Trump base,\u201d he said.</p> <p>During the last election, Trump repeated the words \u201canchor baby\u201d gratuitously on the campaign trail, giving the phrase even more air. When a reporter pointed out that the term was hurtful and offensive, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/trump-ill-word-anchor-baby-33201519\">Trump rebuffed</a> him: \u201cYou mean it\u2019s not politically correct? And yet everybody uses it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/25/trump-family-separations-children-torture-psychology\">Trump's separation of families constitutes torture, doctors find</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But just two decades ago, no one used it \u2013 at least not publicly. In the book <a href=\"https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=28631\">Anchor Babies and the Challenge of Birthright Citizenship</a>, the anthropologist Leo Chavez tracked the term\u2019s appearance in both coasts\u2019 papers of record, the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times. \u201cAnchor babies\u201d never cropped up until the early 2000s.</p> <p>\u201cThat practice of targeting people who really are members of your society historically and legally and marking them as different allows you to do incredibly awful things to them,\u201d Chavez said. They suffered psychological terror caused by the same fears that their families experienced, he said.</p> <p>For 17 years, Daira hasn\u2019t been able to keep Silvia and Jorge safe just by being a US citizen. Nor did they ever expect that she would.</p> <p>\u201cIt was never the idea to come to the US to have a child,\u201d Silvia said. After she, Jorge, and their one-year-old son arrived in Long Island, she tried to get birth control, but the complicated US medical system delayed that process. In the meantime, life happened.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I became pregnant with her,\u201d Silvia said, \u201cat first the world fell apart for me, because we were in another country where the situation wasn\u2019t the best.\u201d</p> <p>The family can laugh about it now, maybe because they\u2019ve hustled and come out on the other side. It wasn\u2019t easy. In a corner of the country known for abnormally high rents, they\u2019ve spent practically all their lives in other people\u2019s basements. Silvia worked night shifts at odd jobs. When Jorge finally found work that wasn\u2019t just temporary, he tended to hold on to the role for years.</p> <p>These days, Daira takes art classes and wants to study illustration. Silvia is \u201cretired to march\u201d, she jokes; <a href=\"https://time.com/5670018/daca-rescinded-dreamers/\">after Trump rescinded</a> Daca and the courts took up the issue, she became an activist fighting to protect young people like her son. Jorge just got his driver\u2019s license after successfully advocating on the frontlines for all New Yorkers\u2019 rights to drive legally regardless of their immigration status. Daira\u2019s happy about that; it\u2019s \u201cmore secure\u201d, she says.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re doing all the positive things that we think are strong American values that we would really like to have here, but we don\u2019t give them the opportunity to put that into practice,\u201d said Chavez. \u201cWhat we do is take their kids and call them names.\u201d</p>",

Here are some of the night\u2019s key takeaways:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Coronavirus dominated the debate, with Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders offering different visions for how to combat the crisis. </strong>After the pair bumped elbows to greet each other, Biden described the coronavirus crisis as an \u201call hands on deck\u201d situation that required immediate steps to protect vulnerable communities, while Sanders said the pandemic underscored the need for an overhaul of the US healthcare system to protect all Americans. The contrast reflected one of the key questions in the primary race: should the country focus on immediate, short-term results or broad, structural change?</li> \n   <li><strong>Biden pledged to choose a woman as his running mate. </strong>Sanders would not explicitly commit to selecting a woman running mate but said, \u201cIn all likelihood, I will.\u201d Biden\u2019s pledge could help to reassure Democrats who are disappointed that the party\u2019s historically diverse field has narrowed down to two white men in their late 70\u2019s.</li> \n   <li><strong>Biden avoided a complete debacle, which Sanders needed to change the direction of the race. </strong>Biden did stumble at times, but considering his significant delegate lead, Sanders needed his opponent to have a terrible night if he wanted any chance at turning the tide of the race. Biden managed to avoid that catastrophe.</li> \n   <li><strong>The debate was surprisingly combative considering the current crisis. </strong>Many commentators had predicted the night would be relatively tame as the candidates focused on the health crisis gripping the country. However, Sanders went after Biden for his refusal to disavow super PACs and his past comments on Social Security, and Biden returned the favor by criticizing Sanders for his record on gun control and his recent praise of <strong>Fidel Castro.</strong></li> \n   <li><strong>Tonight made the case for holding debates without live audiences. </strong>The debate was conducted without a live audience or a media spinroom because of coronavirus, and a number of commentators said it was a welcome change from past debates. It\u2019s possible the practice could be replicated with general election debates.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Thanks for following our live debate coverage tonight, and our US politics live blog will return tomorrow morning.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-coronavirus-policies-latest\">Biden and Sanders confront coronavirus crisis in first one-on-one debate</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6eeee88f088d7575593f95\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T03:16:07.689Z\">3.16am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Anita Dunn, </strong>a senior adviser to <strong>Joe Biden, </strong>compared <strong>Bernie Sanders </strong>to the average protester who shows up at Biden\u2019s events in a post-debate call with reporters.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KThomasDC/status/1239386937741508610\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Biden sr. adv.

  "<h2>Jessa Crispin: \u2018Sanders was too gentle on Biden\u2019</h2> <p>Throughout this primary, I\u2019ve heard supporters of other candidates complain about Bernie Sanders\u2019 tendency to raise his voice. Where the hell was that yelling Bernie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-coronavirus-policies-latest\">on Sunday night</a>? His tendency to try to keep an undignified process dignified and his discomfort with going for Joe Biden\u2019s throat were on clear display. If Biden wins the nomination, he\u2019s going to have to debate the least classy man ever to appear in World Wrestling Entertainment. Bernie would have been doing us \u2013 and frankly, Joe as well \u2013 a favor by channeling <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/stone-cold-steve-austin-gives-a-nsfw-defense-of-gay-m-1566573678\">gay rights king</a> Stone Cold Steve Austin and pinning Biden on issues like how the 2008 bank bailout was disastrous for homeowners, or how his warmongering has stuck us in an endless war, or how the Violence Against Women Act that he loves to brag about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-violence-against-women-act-is-unlikely-to-reduce-intimate-partner-violence-heres-why-103734\">did basically nothing</a> to prevent violence in relationships.</p> <p>For a while, I felt like I was watching a Beckett play, with two old men on stage talking about totally different realities, talking past one another as if they did not even exist within the same space and time. Here was Bernie Sanders, acknowledging how our flawed and deteriorated health system could enable coronavirus to kill hundreds of thousands of Americans. And here was Biden, convinced he was in Independence Day, saying the coronavirus \u201cis like we\u2019re being attacked from abroad\u201d \u2013 although a bunch of people getting sick because the government is too timid to ask people not to go to <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/3/14/21179885/st-patricks-day-chicago-coronavirus\">a goddamn St Patrick\u2019s Day bar crawl</a> is not exactly an alien invasion. He talked about sending the military in to deal with it, as if it were a foreign country of brown people, with oil reserves.</p> <p>Once again the moderators may as well not have existed. Jake Tapper, looking weirdly waxy and like his makeup person had dumped a bottle of 1985 Cover Girl foundation on his face and smeared it around a little, couldn\u2019t even be bothered to step in when a squabble arose about whether or not Biden had made statements about cutting social security on the floor of the Senate. He was just sitting there! Couldn\u2019t he have pulled out his phone and gone \u201cto the YouTube\u201d, as Sanders implored, to factcheck that one?</p> <p>The division between Sanders and Biden is clearer than ever. Sanders wants lasting change, Biden wants to respond to everything as if it were a \u201ccrisis\u201d and keep things pretty much the same. But Sanders wasted the opportunity tonight to take his opponent out, and Biden managed to get through an entire conversation without glitching and <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/03/13/media_attempts_to_spin_bidens_tirade_into_a_triumph.html\">threatening to punch someone</a> in the face.

On healthcare, the Middle East and the power of corporate influence, Sanders tried to help Biden open himself up to the progressive wing \u2013 while at the same time showing Biden the areas where he may be vulnerable to the Trump assault.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It reminded the general electorate that competence is at hand</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Biden opened with a strong command of the coronavirus crisis and how to marshal the world to corral it. He was reassuring and confident in his fealty to science and facts. Voters crave it. Sanders reminded viewers that comprehensive healthcare would go a long ways to helping control epidemics. Sanders challenged Biden to go farther on climate change \u2013 a major threat in terms of infectious disease \u2013 and Biden did not resist.

This amid a pandemic for which we have no immunity and the only way we can halt its progress is by staying home.</p> <p>There is no coronavirus question discussed by the candidates tonight that doesn\u2019t involve a radical transformation of the American capitalist system. Unless the government immediately begins providing a universal basic income and places a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures, vehicle repossessions and utility disconnects, we will not be able to flatten the pandemic curve and save potentially millions of lives. There was only one candidate on the stage who understood this, and that was Bernie Sanders.</p> <ul> <li><p>Benjamin Dixon is the host of The Benjamin Dixon show</p></li> </ul> <h2>Jill Filipovic: \u2018Americans deserve leadership. Instead they got an embarrassing squabble\u2019</h2> <p>Well, that was possibly the worst debate of the entire Democratic primary.</p> <p>The United States is experiencing an unprecedented crisis. We are facing down a pandemic that could kill more than a million Americans. A great many of us are self-isolating at home, made even more anxious by the fact that our current government has totally botched the coronavirus response, putting us all at tremendous and unnecessary risk. We don\u2019t have the most basic faith that, despite living in one of the most prosperous societies in the history of the world, our leaders will keep us safe. We have a president who has failed us at every turn, and then throws up his hands and says he does not take responsibility.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We need Democrats to present a unified, dignified and trustworthy front</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the face of all of this, we need Democrats to present a unified, dignified and trustworthy front. We need them to show leadership, which means demonstrating that they can read the room (even when there\u2019s no audience). And right now, the room is freaking out.</p> <p>Instead, we got two old guys squabbling like they were trying to break a tie in a particularly cutthroat game of bingo.</p> <p>Much of the debate was spent bickering over who voted for what bill back when, instead of outlining what both men propose going forward. Joe Biden is the frontrunner and he squandered an opportunity to act like it. Bernie Sanders has a newly resonant moral authority as someone long pushing for all of the policies that would patch up the holes in the American safety net \u2013 holes that have become glaringly, terrifyingly apparent as we face down this new pandemic. Biden could have acted like the gracious and venerable leader he tells us he would be. Sanders could have held Biden\u2019s feet to the fire on what he <em>will</em> do if elected, instead of rehashing the minute details of what he\u2019s done in the past.</p> <p>As this crisis has made astoundingly clear, we have a dangerously unqualified man in the White House, and he is already costing American lives. Either of these candidates would be miles better than Donald Trump. That message \u2013 if not one of unity, then at least of alignment against a mutual foe \u2013 should have been front and center.</p> <p>We didn\u2019t get that. We got two angry men getting defensive and sniping at each other. America didn\u2019t just deserve better \u2013 at this moment, we needed better, and both men failed us.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jill Filipovic is the author of the The H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness</p></li> </ul> <h2>Lloyd Green: \u2018Sanders\u2019 luster is gone.

The debate changed nothing, but at the end of the evening Joe Biden was sitting on the cusp of the Democratic nomination. Come Tuesday, the former vice-president is poised for lopsided wins in <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/az/arizona_democratic_primary-6898.html\">Arizona</a>, <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/fl/florida_democratic_presidential_primary-6847.html\">Florida</a>, <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/il/illinois_democratic_primary-7036.html\">Illinois</a> and <a href=\"https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/ohio-2020-biden-with-large-lead-over-sanders-in-the-buckeye-state\">Ohio</a>.</p> <p>Without Hillary Clinton as a foil and target, Sanders\u2019 luster appears gone. It is no longer his time, if it ever was. As Biden put it: \u201cWe have problems we have to solve now. What\u2019s a revolution going to do? Disrupt everything in the meantime?\u201d</p> <p>Faced with a pestilential presidency, the Democrats are ready to rally to around the Delaware Democrat. Even better for Biden, so too may be the rest of the country. Nationally, the <a href=\"https://pos.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/200149-NBCWSJ-March-Poll-Final-3-14-20-Release.pdf\">latest polls</a> give Biden a nine-point lead over Donald Trump. Whether Biden can sustain that edge remains to be seen.</p> <p>Amid a pandemic, a battered stock market and zero-interest rates, a president disclaiming his own responsibility is more than America can afford or bear. Unalloyed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/opinion/sunday/trump-coronavirus-national-emergency.html\">self-absolution</a> and the Oval Office are a toxic brew. A Biden presidency would not be flashy but it would definitely be engaged.</p> <ul> <li><p>Lloyd Green was opposition research counsel to George HW Bush\u2019s 1988 campaign and served in the Department of Justice from 1990 to 1992</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders auditioned in real time for the job of president on Sunday night during the first one-on-one debate of the Democratic primary, as the world confronts the growing threat of the coronavirus pandemic and American public health officials warned the worst is yet to come.</p> \n<p>The fast-escalating national emergency dominated the prime-time encounter between two candidates with starkly different visions for the country. Yet Biden and Sanders vigorously agreed on the need for a much more aggressive government response to the virus, which had already <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">resulted in</a> 3,244 confirmed cases in the US, with 62 reported deaths, as of Sunday night.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is bigger than any one of us,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThis calls for a national rallying for one another.\u201d</p> \n<p>Biden, who has presented himself as a pragmatic standard-bearer, compared the battle against the disease to a war, calling for a whole-of-government strategy that includes deploying the the military and enacting a \u201cmulti-multi-billion-dollar program<em>\u201d </em>to address the public health and economic crises.</p> \n<p>Sanders, a democratic socialist, urged sweeping economic reforms and the creation of a single-payer healthcare system. He said the pandemic had revealed \u201cthe dysfunctionality\u201d of the country\u2019s patchwork healthcare system, arguing that the adoption of a Medicare for All-style system like the one he has championed would help mitigate the toll of future pandemics.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne of the reasons that we are unprepared, and have been unprepared, is we don\u2019t have a system,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got thousands of private insurance plans. That is not a system that is prepared to provide healthcare to all people in a good year, without the epidemic.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Biden said a single-payer healthcare system was not the solution, pointing to Italy, where the outbreak has overwhelmed the country\u2019s national health services.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are looking for results, not a revolution,\u201d Biden said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a381fa53-24c1-46a8-a648-7710acb74a3a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/K30TgRppDzg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Where there was consensus was in their denunciation of Donald Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak and his ability to lead the nation through a time of crisis.</p> \n<p>\u201cWell, the first thing we have got to do, whether or not I\u2019m president, is to shut this president up right now,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cHe\u2019s undermining the doctors and the scientists who are trying to help the American people.\u201d</p> \n<p>After the debate, which Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1239383648018804739\">deemed</a> \u201cVERY boring\u201d, his campaign operation accused the candidates of \u201cplagiarizing\u201d the president\u2019s response to coronavirus, which it described as \u201ca model for all future pandemics\u201d.</p> \n<p>At a press conference from the White House on Sunday afternoon, Trump urged Americans to \u201crelax\u201d and refrain from hoarding food. But moments later, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned: \u201cThe worst is, yes, ahead for us.\u201d</p> \n<p>The two-hour debate, hosted by CNN and Univision, took place as viewers across the nation retreated into their homes amid disruptive, even draconian, efforts to slow the spread of coronavirus. Hours earlier, New York City had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/coronavirus-new-york-city-closes-public-schools-system\">ordered public schools closed</a>; California had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/california-governor-directs-all-bars-nightclubs-wineries-close-coronavirus\">asked bars to shutter</a>, and the Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/15/federal-reserve-cuts-interest-rates-near-zero-prop-up-us-economy-coronavirus\">announced it was slashing interest rates</a> to near zero.</p> \n<p>As the debate opened, the US Centers for Disease Control published an <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/mass-gatherings-ready-for-covid-19.html\">advisory on its website</a> recommending that events of 50 people or more be cancelled or postponed for the next eight weeks throughout the United States.</p> \n<p>In a sign of the times, the candidates, both septuagenarians at greater risk, bumped elbows instead of shaking hands when they stepped on stage, where their podiums were arranged noticeably far apart in accordance with guidelines for social distancing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41a5145243ef37925c5240bfe3ea1121185cc26f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41a5145243ef37925c5240bfe3ea1121185cc26f/0_86_3376_2025/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The candidates stood far apart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The candidates stood far apart at the debate.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The debate itself was relocated from a convention center in Phoenix to a television studio in Washington to limit unnecessary travel and exposure. There was no live audience, press filing center or spin room. And ahead of the event, the Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, a moderator who may have been exposed to the virus, bowed out as a precautionary measure.</p> \n<p>The race has changed dramatically since the Democrats\u2019 last debate, before the South Carolina primary three weeks ago, when Sanders was winning early contests as Biden\u2019s campaign verged on collapse. In a sharp reversal of fortunes, Biden stepped on to the debate stage on Sunday night as the frontrunner while Sanders fought for the future of his candidacy, just days ahead of four more primary votes.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/bernie-sanders-vermont-senator-socialist-democratic-party\">How Bernie Sanders went from frontrunner to the last-chance saloon</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>After rebounding in remarkable fashion, Biden now leads Sanders by roughly 150 delegates following a second consecutive week of commanding primary victories. A strong showing on Tuesday \u2013 when Illinois, Ohio, Arizona and Florida will go to the polls to vote for their preferred candidates \u2013 could all but guarantee Biden\u2019s ascent to the nomination to face Trump in the November election.</p> \n<p>Throughout the evening, Biden kept his sights set on the general election, even as he clashed with Sanders on a number of policy issues, including social security, gun control, climate change, abortion rights and immigration.</p> \n<p>At one point, Biden committed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/joe-biden-vp-woman-female-running-mate\">selecting a woman to be his running mate</a> if he becomes the Democratic nominee and re-committed to nominating a black woman to the supreme court if elected president. Sanders said he would also choose a woman \u201cin all likelihood\u201d as his pick for vice-president, but said his priority is finding a lieutenant who supports his progressive values.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor me it\u2019s not just about nominating a woman. It\u2019s about making sure that we have a progressive woman,\u201d Sanders said, adding wryly: \u201cThere are progressive women out there.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"be6a792d-6ae8-4a41-a528-61f0c78a12d3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nLM9bm11sVI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Ahead of the debate, Biden extended an olive branch to the party\u2019s left wing, adopting a bankruptcy reform plan introduced by his former rival Elizabeth Warren and expanding his higher education platform to move closer to Sanders\u2019 proposal to eliminate college tuition at all two- and four-year public colleges for students regardless of income. In a statement, Sanders said the plan did not go far enough.</p> \n<p>The candidates sought to strike a delicate balance between debating the issues and addressing the urgent health crisis. Sanders confronted Biden over his positions on healthcare and climate change, among other issues. In one tense exchange, Sanders said Biden\u2019s climate plan fell short.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll well and good, but not nearly enough,\u201d the Vermont senator said, later accusing Biden of \u201cmissing the point\u201d. Sanders is a proponent of the Green New Deal, a sweeping proposal that calls for aggressive action to combat climate change.</p> \n<p>The pandemic has reshaped the way the candidates campaign for the nomination, forcing Biden and Sanders to cancel rallies, suspend field operations and hold virtual campaign events. The candidates said they were taking extra precautions to protect themselves from becoming infected, emphasizing that they were in good health and had not displayed any of the known symptoms.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not shaking hands,\u201d Sanders said, noting that he held a \u201cfireside chat\u201d from his home in Burlington on Sunday instead of a rally.</p> \n<p>Biden added: \u201cI wash my hands God knows how many times a day.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump urged Americans to refrain from panic buying basic supplies during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">the Covid-19 pandemic</a> as the administration announced plans to expand testing for the virus and health officials were preparing to release \u201cadvanced guidelines\u201d on how to mitigate its spread.</p> \n<p>During a press briefing at the White House on Sunday evening, Trump again appeared to downplay the threat of the novel coronavirus. \u201cRelax, we\u2019re doing great,\u201d he said, during short, meandering comments that focused mostly on celebrating a decision by the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. \u201cIt all will pass.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The president\u2019s remarks stood in marked contrast to his lead infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, who used the same conference to warn: \u201cThe worst is ahead for us,\u201d describing the crisis as reaching a \u201cvery, very critical point now\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/trump-mnuchin-coronavirus-recession-anthony-fauci-schools-bars-restaurants\">Earlier in the day</a> Dr Fauci had declined to rule out a \u201cnational lockdown\u201d of bars and restaurants as he urged more aggressive measures, similar to those in Europe and elsewhere, to contain the virus.</p> \n<p>Trump said he had hosted a call with grocery industry leaders earlier in the day who had pushed him to spread a message against hoarding.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey have actually asked me to say: \u2018could you buy a little bit less, please?\u2019 I thought I\u2019d never hear that from a retailer,\u201d Trump said, adding: \u201cThey have no shortages. We have no shortages other than people buying anywhere from three to five times [more].</p> \n<p>\u201cHave a nice dinner, relax,\u201d the president added.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s remarks came at the same time that California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, announced that the nation\u2019s most populous state would enforce a closure of all bars and nightclubs, and make restaurants cut capacity by half. The governor also urged all those over 65 to self-isolate.</p> \n<p>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the leading US government agency for public health, announced a national recommendation shortly after, urging all gatherings of 50 people or over, including festivals, parades, weddings and sporting events, to be cancelled for the next eight weeks. The recommendation did not include schools or businesses.</p> \n<p>Twenty-four states have already announced some form of school closure, with Massachusetts becoming the latest to announce on Sunday. Governor Charlie Baker also banned gatherings of 25 people or more in the state. </p> \n<p>Mike Pence, the vice-president and head of the president\u2019s coronavirus taskforce, said on Sunday evening there were now 2,900 confirmed cases across 49 states in America, up from 2,200 on Saturday.</p> \n<p>As the administration reels from criticism of its slow rollout of tests for coronavirus, Pence announced an ambitious new testing regimen, which he said would allow 1.9m Covid-19 tests to be processed over the coming weeks at over 2,000 laboratories across the country.</p> \n<p>He said the new resources would \u201cenable all Americans who need to be tested to go to a community-based testing site outside of usual healthcare facilities\u201d.</p> \n<p>Pence commended leaders in 10 states for already rolling out \u201cdrive-through\u201d testing.</p> \n<p>Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coordinator for responding to the pandemic, said those most vulnerable to the virus and the healthcare providers treating them should be tested first.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe ask you to prioritize them and prioritize them in the lines,\u201d she said, adding that the roll-out of more testing would lead to a \u201cspike\u201d in positive results.</p> \n<p>The health and human services secretary, Alex Azar, described the crisis as \u201can unprecedented challenge\u201d and acknowledged the pandemic carried the risk of overwhelming the healthcare system in the US. Azar said the administration was working to increase the number of medical supplies, including ventilators, available to fight the pandemic. But he declined to cite specific figures citing \u201cnational security\u201d.</p> \n<p>Dr Fauci said that new \u201cadvanced guidelines\u201d on how to mitigate the spread of the disease would be announced on Monday but there was little more detail on recommended measures of \u201csocial distancing\u201d, actions that limit interaction between people in order to prevent further contraction.</p> \n<p>Earlier on Sunday, Melania Trump, the first lady who has remained largely absent from public since the onset of the crisis, tweeted a link to the CDC <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/\">website</a> and urged readers to \u201cPlease take action to prevent further spread.\u201d</p>",

There could also be a shift to household isolation rather than individual self-isolation.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, a new-born baby in England who has tested positive for coronavirus is likely to be one of the world\u2019s youngest patients with the disease. The infant and its mother both tested positive at a north London hospital and staff who had contact with them have been advised to self-isolate.</p> \n  <p>The developments come as the UK\u2019s approach to developing \u201cherd immunity\u201d against Covid-19 has been called into question.</p> \n  <p>But Hancock denied that achieving herd immunity was part of the government\u2019s policy.

  "<p>Spain\u2019s King Felipe VI has renounced his personal inheritance from his father and stripped the former king Juan Carlos of his annual stipend after it was alleged that Felipe VI was poised to receive millions of euros from a secret offshore fund with ties to Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>The statement issued by Spain\u2019s royal household on Sunday evening came after a report named King Felipe as a beneficiary of an offshore fund set up by his father in 2008. At the time, Juan Carlos was still in power.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/02/spains-king-juan-carlos-to-abdicate\">The former head of state abdicated in 2014,</a> after a series of scandals sent his popularity plummeting. Juan Carlos, 82, had continued to receive an annual stipend from the state, however, amounting to around \u20ac194,000 (\u00a3175,000) in 2018.</p> <p>The alleged offshore account, named as the Lucum Foundation, held around \u20ac65m in funds that were described as a \u201cdonation\u201d from \u201cthe king of Saudi Arabia\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/14/spanish-king-named-offshore-fund-linked-65m-saudi-gift/\">according to the Sunday Telegraph.</a> The account was set up at an office in Panama city and tied to an account with Geneva\u2019s Mirabaud private bank, the report added.</p> <p>An investigation by Swiss prosecutors into another offshore fund allegedly tied to Juan Carlos, named Fondation Zagatka, sparked calls this month for Spain\u2019s parliament to investigate the business dealings of the former king. The push was rejected by Spain\u2019s Socialists and the two main parties on the right, who argued that any such probe would be unconstitutional.</p> <p>According to newspaper La Tribune de Gen\u00e8ve, prosecutors believe the fund could be linked to kickback payments after the former monarch helped to broker business deals with Saudi Arabia while in power.</p> <p>On Sunday, the statement by the Royal household noted that King Felipe became aware last year of claims that he was the beneficiary of the Lucum Foundation and subsequently swore before a notary public that he had told his father that he was renouncing any benefit from the fund. King Felipe denied any knowledge of being a beneficiary of the Zagatka fund.</p> <p>Neither King Felipe nor his household had any knowledge, participation or responsibility in the alleged events, the statement noted.

  "<p>Shop workers across the UK will be better protected from soaring levels of violence, verbal and physical abuse under proposed legislation to be put before the House of Commons.</p> <p>The private members\u2019 bill says that because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/retail\">retail</a> workers have been made responsible for effectively policing the law on the sale of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/oct/29/amazon-delivery-restricted-items-alcohol-proof-identity\"> age-restricted products</a> such as alcohol, crossbows, knives and solvents \u2013 most likely to trigger incidents \u2013 parliament should be providing them with \u201cappropriate\u201d protection while ensuring the police and courts enforce the law.</p> <p>With data showing violence and abuse against shop workers at record levels, a separate freedom of information request reveals police responses to such violence is low.</p> <p>The issue comes under the spotlight as the UK battles <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> and amid reports of verbal abuse against supermarket staff by shoppers complaining about rationing and empty shelves. Consumers are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/13/morrisons-speeds-up-payments-to-small-suppliers-because-of-coronavirus\">stocking up</a> in preparation for potential imposed self-isolation and amid fears of shortages or store closures.</p> <p>Figures from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/co-operative-group\">the Co-op convenience chain</a> reveal a four-fold increase in the number of violent incidents and abuse in its stores since 2017. In the first two months of 2020, 100 colleagues faced abuse each day and 12 were violently attacked. </p> <p>The latest British Retail Consortium (BRC) annual <a href=\"https://brc.org.uk/media/674208/crime-survey-2020.pdf\">Retail Crime Survey</a> \u2013 published earlier this month \u2013 highlights the impact of violence and abuse on the lives of shop workers, with a 9% year-on-year increase and 424 incidents reported each day.</p> <p>A freedom of information request by the Co-op - to which 75% of UK police forces responded \u2013 shows two out of every three incidents reported in its stores do not lead to police attendance. These figures reflect the national picture, with BRC\u2019s annual survey revealing 70% of retailers surveyed believe police responses to these incidents were \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cvery poor\u201d.</p> <p>Alex Norris, the MP for Nottingham North, who is presenting the bill, said: \u201cI am shocked at the level of abuse and violence shop workers face every day, and I see it in my own constituency, where at my local Co-op a staff member was hit by a glass bottle.</p> <p>\u201cIf we give shop workers responsibilities to uphold the law on sales of a range of products which parliament has determined can only be sold to people above a certain age, then shop workers should be afforded protection in carrying out those public duties. Parliament should establish a new expectation by legislating for what is acceptable and the police given the resources to implement this new legislation.\u201d</p> <p>Paddy Lillis, the general secretary of the Usdaw union, added: It is high time for the government to act by providing proper penalties for those who assault workers; a simple standalone law that is widely recognised and understood by the public, police, CPS, the judiciary and criminals.\u201d</p>"
