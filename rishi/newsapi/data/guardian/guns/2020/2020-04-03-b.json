  "<p>Around lunchtime on Saturday, somebody somewhere will hit \u201center\u201d on their keyboard and, a fraction of a second and many millions of calculations later, it will generate the result of the 2020 Virtual Grand National. A few hours after, many millions of viewers \u2013 more, perhaps, than might have watched the real thing \u2013 will tune in to ITV to watch as the computer\u2019s thought processes get the full CGI treatment and its calculation becomes (virtual) reality.</p> <p>If algorithms are not your thing, think of it as the rolling of a 100-sided dice, with Tiger Roll\u2019s name on about 16 of the faces and the other 39 virtual horses distributed around the remaining 84 faces in proportion to the computer\u2019s idea of their chance. Poor old Double Shuffle, at 100-1, is only there once, but in the unlikely event that his name does come up, it should guarantee a healthy return for NHS Charities Together, which will receive all bookmakers\u2019 profits on the virtual race.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/03/talking-horses-roll-up-for-our-answer-to-the-grand-national-mystery\">Talking Horses: roll up for our answer to the Grand National mystery</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If the ever-popular Tiger Roll is the virtual \u201cwinner\u201d, there are unlikely to be any profits to distribute (though his backers could, of course, choose to do the decent thing and pass on their winnings <a href=\"https://www.nhscharitiestogether.co.uk/\" title=\"\">here</a>). And the bookies accepting bets on the race, of course, include firms who received <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/16/mental-health-chief-appeals-to-bookmakers-over-gambling-addiction\" title=\"\">a letter from Claire Murdoch</a>, the NHS\u2019s head of mental health services, just three months ago, which accused them of \u201cleaving the NHS to pick up the pieces\u201d of lives damaged by problem gambling.</p> <p>So it is only fair to report that at a moment of national crisis when we are all in need of diversion, not just on Saturday but probably for many weeks to come, the bookmakers seem to have thought quite carefully about how to approach the Virtual Grand National and the interest it will generate.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s of risk of that happening [a losing race for the bookies] if Tiger Roll wins, and we\u2019ve made NHS Charities Together aware of that,\u201d Gary Follis, of the Betting and Gaming Council, which represents all the major firms offering odds on the race, said this week. \u201cBut of course there\u2019s no guarantee of that happening.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve developed a set of rules around this and there\u2019s going to be no marketing to new customers, it\u2019s only going to be promoted among the current customer base, and there\u2019s also going to be guidelines around the treatment of any new customer who signs up as a result of this. Like any Grand National, there will always be new customers, though probably considerably fewer this time around, but we\u2019re looking at ways to put them into a separate database, so that they don\u2019t receive any follow-up marketing or cross-promotion of other products.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about a bit of light relief during coronavirus and to raise money for the NHS. I think we\u2019ve been beaten up often enough that the penny is dropping that we\u2019ve got to be whiter than white on this, so it hasn\u2019t been difficult to get members to agree to that.\u201d</p> <p>Nearly 10m viewers tuned in to watch Tiger Roll win his second Grand National 12 months ago and an even bigger audience would have been anticipated this time around to see Gordon Elliott\u2019s chaser attempt to become the modern Red Rum with a third successive victory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Virtual Grand National.\">  <iframe title=\"vimeo-player\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/403717707\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>ITV declined to speculate on possible viewing figures on Friday, but the strict lockdown means that it is at least possible that this year\u2019s virtual race will pull in more viewers than an actual National ever could, and if the <a href=\"https://we.tl/t-KLWynngZC8\" title=\"\">trailers</a> are any guide, it promises to be quite a show.</p> <p>Little touches which add to the experience include CGI fence-repair teams who jog on to patch up the obstacles for lap two, virtual mud, CGI crowds in the stands and around the track and even a virtual ambulance following the field to check on the condition of fallen riders. The developers have even created what they describe as a \u201cflocking algorithm\u201d to account for how horses run around bends.</p> <p>It is very clever stuff, and promises to offer a welcome respite from grimmer realities outside the front door. And when all is said and done, the virtual prizes have been handed out and the actual bets settled, it may also leave us cherishing the real Grand National a little bit more.</p>",
  "<p>Nearly two years ago, <a href=\"https://www.climateworksaustralia.org/\">ClimateWorks Australia</a> set out to test whether the implied goal agreed by world leaders at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris\">Paris climate conference</a> \u2013 cutting greenhouse gas emissions to \u201cnet zero\u201d by 2050 \u2013 was still possible in Australia. They weren\u2019t certain it would be. They were pleasantly surprised by the result.</p> <p>\u201cWe found not only is it not yet out of reach in Australia, but it can be achieved using technologies that are mostly already mature and available,\u201d says Anna Skarbek, the chief executive of the not-for-profit that was established in 2009 to fill a gap between climate research and action.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/01/nearly-one-in-five-of-australias-big-polluters-breach-government-set-emissions-limits\">Nearly one in five of Australia's big polluters breach government-set emissions limits</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Net-zero emissions targets have been adopted by 121 countries responsible for a quarter of CO2, asset owners worth $4tn and an expanding list of major companies. The Morrison government is yet to join them, having promised a long-term strategy later this year, but all Australia\u2019s states and territories have net-zero goals for mid-century.</p> <p>ClimateWorks spent 18 months examining each part of the Australian economy in detail to consider what would be involved in getting there. The resulting report, <a href=\"https://www.climateworksaustralia.org/resource/decarbonisation-futures-solutions-actions-and-benchmarks-for-a-net-zero-emissions-australia/\">Decarbonisation Futures</a>, is an update of similar work in 2014. It found net-zero emissions were possible not just by mid-century but by 2035 \u2013 soon enough for Australia to play its part in an effort to limit global heating to 1.5C.</p> <p>The report lands as the coronavirus crisis has, in a best-case scenario, postponed 2020\u2019s expected focus on climate change. The year-end <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-26-glasgow-climate-change-conference-2020\">UN meeting in Glasgow</a> has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/uk-likely-to-postpone-cop26-un-climate-talks-glasgow-coronavirus\">delayed until next year</a>. It is considered the most important since Paris in 2015, with countries being exhorted to ramp up commitments as promised in the French capital. </p> <p>ClimateWorks\u2019 analysis was completed before the pandemic hit, but Skarbek says the need to recover from the economic shock once the survival stage passes will also provide an opportunity to make the sort of investment required to respond to the climate crisis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a lot of relatively small transactions that get this job done. That\u2019s why it is stimulus-friendly</p> <footer> <cite>Anna Skarbek</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The former will demand a substantial stimulus program. The latter requires an \u201call-in\u201d approach from governments, business and individuals in what the report calls \u201cthe transformational decade\u201d before 2030. After that, the window for Australia to do its bit towards the Paris targets and prepare for a coming global zero emissions economy may have closed.</p> <p>Skarbek says it means a \u201cmake or break moment\u201d is coming. The good news, she says, is many transformational climate-friendly steps are stimulus-ready.</p> <p>\u201cIf we get this right, we can meet Australia\u2019s international climate change commitments, create jobs in sustainable industries, and set ourselves up for a smoother and speedier shift to a zero-emissions economy,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cIf we miss the moment of the stimulus injection to also accelerate on climate, the downturn will make it even harder to do what is needed over the next decade. I do worry we might miss this chance forever if we don\u2019t seize it now.\u201d</p> <p>The report finds the progress and fall in cost of clean technology since the last analysis six years ago has been faster than expected, with renewable energy becoming cheaper than fossil fuels and the cost of batteries plunging 80% in a decade. It says much of the shift needed now could be rolled out quickly by rapid and large-scale deployment of familiar technology.</p> <p>It would include upgrading homes and commercial buildings to boost energy efficiency and run on solar power; building more large-scale clean energy plants and storage; installing electric vehicle charging stations; boosting the use of recycled goods in supply chains; and supporting more carbon forestry by planting and protecting trees to store CO2.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of relatively small transactions that get this job done,\u201d Skarbek says. \u201cThat\u2019s why it is stimulus-friendly.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa99678b731bec54237705a84e1614007a849573\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa99678b731bec54237705a84e1614007a849573/0_9_4102_2461/1000..jpg\" alt=\"a row of electric volkswagon cars\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">To achieve a goal of 1.5C by 2030, three out of four cars in 2030 would have to be electric, the report says.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uwe Meinhold/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The analysis found the difference between making cuts consistent with 1.5C and 2C of heating were noteworthy, but not always that great. The lower goal was likely to mean renewable energy providing 79% of power by 2030, compared with 73% for 2C and 48% if we continue on the current path without governments introducing further policies.</p> <p>On electric vehicles, a 1.5C path could require three out of every four new cars sold in 2030 being electric, compared with one out of two on a 2C path. The government has projected EVs will make up one in five new sales by then.</p> <p>Deployment of available tech to make rapid cuts in electricity, buildings and transport is easier than in heavy industry, agriculture and the land, but Amandine Denis-Ryan, ClimateWorks\u2019 head of national programs, says there are emerging solutions in those areas.</p> <p>One may be hydrogen, which governments are backing as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/19/time-to-consider-hydrogen-the-new-clean-energy-carrier-on-the-block\">potentially plentiful clean energy source</a> for use in transport and industry, and to export. While the report acknowledges green hydrogen is likely to have a part to play, it does not assume how big that role will be, given it is a relatively new industry and there is little data to back it up.</p> <p>But Skarbek says it is a potential answer to two big questions: what can be done in those parts of the economy, particularly in heavy industry, that cannot easily shift to running on clean electricity? And what industries can fill the gap created by Australia\u2019s reliance on fossil fuel exports?</p> <p>Denis-Ryan stresses the report reveals both what is possible and the urgency of the task. Achieving the Paris goals will require national emissions being cut in half by 2030 at the latest.</p> <p>\u201cWe now know we have enough technological capacity in the Australian economy to get there,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we need to get these technologies out the door at every opportunity.\u201d</p> <h2>Electricity</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/24/australia-carbon-emissions-fall-industrial-pollution-surges-electricity-agriculture-lng\">Australia's carbon emissions fall just 0.3% as industrial pollution surges</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The analysis found electricity is key \u2013 getting to 100% clean energy will help clean up other parts of the economy. It suggests no significant increase in storage is needed to get from where we are today, <a href=\"https://opennem.org.au/energy/nem\">at about 25% clean energy</a>, to 50%. Pumped hydro and batteries are mature and available technologies for when that boost is required.</p> <p>Hydrogen may play a role, and demand-response programs, microgrids and inertia control technology are all considered at demonstration stage and could be rapidly scaled up to improve grid security. But the key factor determining the pace of the electricity transition is the speed at which coal and gas plants are closed.</p> <p>The analysis suggests over-building renewable energy to 200% capacity \u2013 double what the country needs \u2013 could be more cost-effective than building to 100%, and would spark new clean export opportunities.</p> <h2>Buildings</h2> <p>As with electricity, the technology for zero-emissions building already exists.</p> <p>It would involve improving energy efficiency through insulation and draught sealing and by installing LED lighting, solar hot water and efficient heating, cooling and appliances. It could mean the introduction of passive house design standards to conserve energy, the use of electrochromic windows that allow owners to control the amount of light and heat that passes through them, and smart systems that optimise when and how power is used. But much of it would be driven by a shift to clean energy, replacing gas-fired heating and cooking with heat pumps and induction stovetops.</p> <h2>Transport</h2> <p>Transport is not as easy to tackle as electricity and buildings, but the analysis found it could reach near zero emissions by 2050 through improving travel practices (using more electrified mass public transport and video-conferencing for business), shifting to electric vehicles and replacing fossil fuels with biofuels, and possibly renewable hydrogen and ammonia.</p> <h2>Industry</h2> <p>Industrial emissions have been rising rapidly<em> </em>in Australia, effectively cancelling out reductions in electricity generation and drought-affected agriculture before the coronavirus pandemic. They are harder to cut and would leave considerable \u201cresidual\u201d emissions by 2050 based on existing technology.</p> <p>Improved efficiency, fast-tracking a circular economy in which metals, plastics and timber are recycled and reused and 3D printing plays a bigger role, electrifying mines and steel operations where possible, and shifting to renewable fuels are (to varying degrees) available solutions that could lead to deep cuts.</p> <h2>Agriculture</h2> <p>Immediate cuts are possible through better use of energy, including onsite renewables at farms, substituting some meat products for plants and better management of waste and fertiliser. Other changes such as using vaccines to limit methane from livestock, and shifting to lab-grown meat, are emerging technologies and need greater support for rapid rollout.</p> <h2>Forestry</h2> <p>Reaching net-zero emissions in the medium-term would involve expanding use of forests to store carbon to offset the sector where, based on today\u2019s technology, the complete eradication of CO2<sub> </sub>is not yet possible. But the report warns this is a temporary solution. The country cannot reforest land forever, and trees are vulnerable to bushfires, drought and heatwaves, which are exacerbated by climate change.</p>",

The Australian Open compels for all its flamboyance, athleticism and star-studded giddiness ... and signals the start of the real countdown to AFLW and AFL.</p> <p>Once the season starts so too does the endless fun banter, the tipping comps and associated light-hearted commentary, the constant WhatsApp sledging, the personal betting and the contentions about wagers (in my case, bottles of Clonakilla shiraz \u2013 the betting currency of choice with one St Kilda-supporting mate; I\u2019m yet to receive them) carried over from years past. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86a4cccac68dd1ee4c94ec6409ab75c901eb6cf6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86a4cccac68dd1ee4c94ec6409ab75c901eb6cf6/0_0_5020_3347/1000..jpg\" alt=\"An empty Marvel Stadium\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An empty Marvel Stadium hosted Collingwood\u2019s first and only game of the season to date.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Burns/AFL Photos/AFL via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A Carlton supporting mate explains better: \u201cI\u2019m lost.

Though none quite so bleak as this. And it reminded me how badly I want to do it again and how much we have foregone already. But for now I\u2019ll take what football I can so I don\u2019t lose touch with the cadence altogether.</p> <p>This week the Pies play St Kilda.

  "<p>At this time of year, sheep farmers in the UK start keeping an eye on a website linked to local weather stations making forecasts: not of rain or sun, but parasites.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.moredun.org.uk/research/diseases/nematodirus\">Nematodirus</a></em> or thread-necked worms, are parasitic roundworms that infect lambs when they start eating grass. The infection is usually mild, but lambs ingesting large numbers of worm larvae can suffer severely, with a mortality rate of up to 30%. <em>Nematodirus</em> hatching is triggered by specific weather conditions. A cold snap followed by several days of temperatures of 10C or more will produce mass hatching and extremely dangerous conditions. This tends to be in April or May in southern England, but might be in June in Scotland, with a local variation due to differences in microclimate.</p> <p>The industry group SCOPS (Sustainable Control of Parasites) provides its <a href=\"https://www.scops.org.uk/forecasts/nematodirus-forecast/\">online parasite forecast</a> site to warn farmers exactly when there is a high risk in their area, based on the weather. There are still variations to watch out for though: south-facing fields have an earlier <em>nematodirus</em> hatch because they catch the sun, and each hundred metres of altitude brings cooling and slows the hatch by about seven days.</p> <p>Once alerted, farmers can take protective measures, such as moving lambs to lower-risk fields not grazed by lambs the previous year.</p> <p><br></p>",

It had identified more than 160 different coronaviruses that had the potential to develop into pandemics, including a virus that is considered the closest known relative to Covid-19.</p> <p>A decision to wind down the program was made, however, in September, just three months before the first reports of people becoming infected with Covid-19 in Wuhan, China. The end of the program saw the departure of dozens of scientists and analysts working to identify potential pandemics in countries around the world, including China.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a genius, visionary program that USAid took a big risk to fund and it\u2019s a crying shame it was canceled,\u201d said Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit specialist in tackling wildlife-borne disease that was one of the major partners in the program.</p> <p>Daszak said he did not know why the initiative was scrapped or if the White House played any direct role in its ending. EcoHealth Alliance has been given a temporary extension to work on the program but the role will finally come to a close in September.</p> <p>The news about Predict\u2019s demise was <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-04-02/coronavirus-trump-pandemic-program-viruses-detection\">first reported </a>in the Los Angeles Times.</p> <p>Predict\u2019s work focused on the dangers of viruses spreading from wildlife to humans and causing possible pandemics like the Covid-19 outbreak that has resulted in much of the world grinding to a halt. It is suspected that Covid-19 made the leap to humans from a bat sold at a Wuhan market.</p> <p>Daszak said there are an estimated 1.7m mystery viruses in wildlife that may have the potential to transfer to humans and cause another pandemic, making the early detection of these diseases imperative for public health and economic reasons.</p> <p>\u201cWe should\u2019ve been more unsettled about this before all this happened,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got a lot of flak for spending money in other countries but just think how much even a few billion would be worth to stop this sort of pandemic. It\u2019s sad to see the project finish because it\u2019s the way of the future, in 50 years they will be bog-standard.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not confident we will learn the lessons from this, though. We saw the same thing happen after Ebola and then Zika. We are always behind with pandemics, we are flying blind. We have hit the snooze button several times and now here\u2019s the big one.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not clear whether a continuation of the project would have dampened the current pandemic, although the Trump administration has faced criticism for its preparation before the outbreak. The administration reduced a team working in China on pandemics and has repeatedly attempted to cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p> <p>A spokesman for USAid told the Los Angeles Times that the Predict program was \u201cjust one component of USAid\u2019s global health security efforts and accounted for less than 20% of our global health security funding\u201d.

The 7 April election will be the most significant test of whether a state can safely conduct a fair election amid a global pandemic.</p> <p>So far, using aggressive public messaging, Wisconsin has successfully convinced more than 1.2 of its 3.3 million voters to request a mail-in ballot. That is unprecedented \u2013 in its 2016 spring election, the state issued just under 250,000 mail-in ballots.</p> <p>But there is still deep concern that confusion and rules around mail-in voting will leave many unable to participate.

Normally Wisconsin requires people to submit a picture of their ID to get an absentee ballot, and all voters needed a witness to sign their ballot. These restrictions have been especially hard for senior citizens, as well as students and other people who move a lot, Burden said.</p> <p>Patricia Ginter, a 72-year-old real estate agent who lives alone in Wauwatosa, said in <a href=\"https://642cf75b-6e65-4c0d-82e2-11357e0523f7.filesusr.com/ugd/85cfb4_fd5031b5c752493fa160525360716d99.pdf?index=true\">a court filing</a> she has only left her house once in the last few weeks to go to the grocery store. She filled out her absentee ballot, but has no way of getting a witness because she\u2019s in isolation. Ginter is a plaintiff in one of several federal lawsuits challenging restrictions around Wisconsin absentee ballots.</p> <p>A Wisconsin elections commission <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KLQBN-KEwY1v9PGNvL8uNpzaPph7U7dP/view?usp=sharing\">memo</a> said people like Ginter could rely on delivery people to observe voters filling out their ballot through a window, or mail the witness certificate to someone who could observe over video chat. Lawyers representing Ginter and the other plaintiffs called those guidelines unworkable.</p> <p>On Thursday, however, the US district judge William Conley eased some of those rules and said Wisconsin voters could submit an absentee ballot without a witness signature if they provided a declaration they could not get one, and left local clerks with the authority to determine validity. He said cities like Milwaukee, which has already received hundreds of ballots without witness signatures, could count them with the declaration as well.</p> <p>The judge called the election \u201cill-advised\u201d but <a href=\"https://www.wispolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/200402Order-1.pdf\">said he had no authority to stop it</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile Wisconsin\u2019s controversial identification rules have not been eased. Officials in Madison said Wednesday they received over a thousand requests for a mail-in ballot from people without acceptable ID \u2013 about half of which were from senior citizens.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MadisonWIClerk/status/1245456746384064512\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We are unable to process over 1,100 absentee requests because we do not have the voter&#39;s ID on file.

He requested his absentee ballot on 26 March, but as of Thursday had yet to receive it. The local clerk\u2019s office told him his ballot was sent to an address in a different town. \u201cIt\u2019s been such a confusing process so far,\u201d he said.</p> <p>To account for the severe delays, Conley extended the deadline by which local election officials have to receive ballots from 8pm on election night to nearly a week later, at 4pm on 13 April. Conley <a href=\"https://twitter.com/srl/status/1246113340004450305\">also blocked</a> election officials from releasing election results until the later date.</p> <p>The change will probably allow thousands of Wisconsin voters to have their votes counted. And provide relief to election officials like Albrecht, who said he needs 300 workers to count ballots and had less than 50.</p> <p>Local officials still plan to run a small number of in-person voting sites \u2013 significant because voters can register to vote on election day. In previous spring elections, about 20% of voters in Milwaukee made use of that process, Albrecht said, and disproportionately voters of color.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we talk about communities in poverty, which is where we\u2019re seeing the hotspots of the pandemic, getting to the voting center may not be as accessible to you,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But the Wisconsin elections commission reported a shortage of at least 7,000 poll workers. And there is valid reason for many of them to drop out: poll workers tend to skew older, the demographic most likely to develop severe complications from Covid-19. <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article241539451.html\">Two poll workers in Florida</a> tested positive for coronavirus after the election there last month.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9a727943f6127c2ad01ecc4295ffd264cd78e6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9a727943f6127c2ad01ecc4295ffd264cd78e6d/0_0_3900_2600/1000..jpg\" alt=\"FILE - In this Feb. 18, 2020 file photo poll worker Bill Martens mans the ballot machine and \u201cI Voted: stickers at the Hart Park Muellner Building in Wauwatosa, Wis.

Eventually, officials uncovered a web of offending by Matamata spanning 25 years.</p> <p>On 16 March, more than three years after Loto escaped from Matamata\u2019s control, following a five-week trial, Matamata stood silently in the dock at the high court in Napier as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/samoan-chief-found-guilty-of-enslaving-villagers-in-new-zealand-over-25-years\">he was convicted on 13 counts of dealing in slaves</a> and 10 counts of human trafficking between 1994 and April 2019. It is the first time that anyone has been simultaneously convicted of both charges in New Zealand. His oldest victim was Loto, at 53, his youngest victim was just 12.</p> <h2>Chores, abuse and beatings</h2> <p>Despite their cases spanning decades, the stories the victims told over the five-week trial were similar: they met Matamata in Samoa and he paid for their flights and visas to New Zealand, promising them work or schooling. But upon arrival they found themselves working 14-hour days in the fields as \u201cbags of cash\u201d were handed to Matamata, a horticultural contractor, but never passed on.</p> <p>After working in the fields all day they did chores around his home late into the night and were subjected to brutal beatings if work was not completed to his liking. They were not allowed to leave his property without permission, speak to anyone at work or church, or talk to their families in Samoa.</p> <p>The crown prosecutor Clayton Walker told the jury that all of Matamata\u2019s victims \u201ctrusted him completely\u201d because he was a <em>matai, </em>a Samoan chief.</p> <p>\u201cThat trust was misplaced. He abused his matai position.\u201d</p> <p>Loto, who arrived in New Zealand in winter 2015, says that he was often punished for working too slowly, having to \u201coffer\u201d up his head for Matamata to hit with a piece of wood, a power cord, secateurs or a broom.</p> <p>At the beginning of the trial Matamata often wore an <em>\u2019ulafala</em>, a bright red pandanus key necklace symbolising his chiefly status over his suit and tie. As the weeks wore on it gave way to a black hoodie. He sat quietly, sometimes smiling, often looking bored, as his victims gave evidence against him.

He claimed he had brought people to New Zealand for a \u201choliday\u201d, not work, and it was out of his control if they ran away and became overstayers.</p> <p>\u201cI am a <em>matai</em>.

However, he also said he was \u201ccautiously\u201d hopeful.</p> <p>Trump has claimed the use of hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin, an antibiotic, could be \u201cone of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine\u201d \u2013 only to be immediately contradicted by public health experts including his own top infectious diseases adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, who warned that there was only \u201canecdotal evidence\u201d that the drugs could be helpful.</p> <p>Dr Gaetan Burgio, from the John Curtin School of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/medical-research\">Medical research</a> at the Australian National University, had said \u201crecent results from clinical trials indicated a possible improvement in shortening the duration of the infection\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHowever the results are disputed and the clinical trials are inconclusive,\u201d he said. \u201cTo date there are no clear indications that chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are a treatment option.\u201d</p> <p>The Therapeutic Goods Administration [TGA], which regulates drugs in Australia, has placed tight new restrictions on doctors who are authorised to write new prescriptions for the drug, limiting it to <a href=\"https://www.tga.gov.au/scheduling-decision-final/notice-amendment-current-poisons-standard-under-paragraph-52d2a-therapeutic-goods-act-1989\">a small group of clinical specialties</a>.</p> <p>The TGA <a href=\"https://www.tga.gov.au/alert/new-restrictions-prescribing-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19\">warned</a> of increased off-label prescription of medicines containing hydroxychloroquine, citing a \u201ca potential shortage of this product in Australia\u201d and the medicine\u2019s \u201cwell-known serious risks to patients including cardiac toxicity (potentially leading to sudden heart attacks), irreversible eye damage and severe depletion of blood sugar (potentially leading to coma)\u201c.</p> <p>The Pharmaceutical Society of Australia wrote to members urging them to \u201crefuse the dispensing of hydroxychloroquine if there is not a genuine need\u201d.</p> <p>A health department spokesperson said the legislative changes \u201callow the importation and supply of a medicine including hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine to deal with the threat to public health by the Covid-19 emergency without a requirement to be included in the Australian register of therapeutic goods\u201d.</p> <p>The spokesperson noted safeguards including that a patient information leaflet must be supplied with the medicine.</p> <p>Peter Collignon, a professor of infectious diseases, described the move as sensible as long as the drug was only given to approved providers and, in the first instance, used in clinical trials being undertaken by those providers. He gave the example of the antibiotic penicillin, which Australia almost ran out of several years ago due to issues with the supplier. Even though there were equivalent drugs in other countries, Australia was unable to import these to fill the gap because those specific brands had not been approved by the TGA, a process that can take a year or more.</p> <p>Collignon said the changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act meant bureaucratic red-tape had been removed, which he said was reasonable given shortages of hydroxychloroquine in Australia which meant patients who needed it for severe and painful conditions like rheumatoid arthritis are struggling to get scripts filled.</p> <p>\u201cThis does not mean, however, that any hydroxychloroquine in the stockpile should be given to Australians more widely before clinical trials are done,\u201d he said. \u201cI would hope it is used for the trials being done in Australia first and foremost.</p>",

By 21 January, 198 cases of coronavirus were confirmed in the Wuhan region, with three fatalities.

The next day, 21 January, Murphy told journalists this was now a \u201crapidly evolving situation\u201d. Concern had been heightened by events of the \u201clast three or four days\u201d.

There was a confirmed case in the state, a Wuhan resident, in isolation at the Gold Coast University Hospital: Queensland\u2019s patient zero. By the end of January, Australia hit seven cases.</p> <p>Queensland was the first state to move. It declared a public health emergency on 29 January. In Canberra, the response was also gathering pace. Morrison told reporters the government would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/29/australian-coronavirus-evacuees-to-be-quarantined-on-christmas-island\">activate Christmas Island as a quarantine area</a>. He also upgraded the travel advice, telling Australians to reconsider all travel to China.</p> <p>But coronavirus was not the prime minister\u2019s only problem.

There were now substantial outbreaks in South Korea, Japan, Italy, and Iran. There were cases in Africa, West Asia, Europe and South America. But Morrison was both moving, and soothing. Normal life would go on. \u201cYou can still go to the football, you can still go to the cricket, you can still go and play with your friends down the street, you can go off to the concert and you can go out for a Chinese meal.\u201d</p> <p>A day later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/28/states-to-push-back-against-federal-plan-to-outsource-aged-care-assessment\">health ministers met in Melbourne</a>. The dominant issue was aged care. A senior official familiar with the discussion on that day insists that only Queensland, which had already declared a health emergency, and New South Wales, had a sharp grasp of what was coming. Victoria was slow, but would come in forcefully later. \u201cThere really was no national leadership at that point,\u201d the official says.</p> <p>Morrison and the government would doubtless contest this assessment by pointing to the steady accumulation of action since 20 January. The government was also beginning to talk itself around on the likely need for fiscal stimulus. The first package of measures was in its infancy.</p> <p>But the clear impression from the states in late February, at least at the health intersection point, was Canberra hadn\u2019t yet locked on just how bad the Covid-19 health crisis would ultimately get.</p> <p>In March, the operating tempo would change.</p> <p>Two key events would drag the federation of Australia into the new normal.</p> <h2>The week that changed everything</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/03/australia-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-explained-can-i-visit-my-partner-family-friends-walk-dog\">Australia's coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Covid-19 pandemic is an extraordinary event.

But in Australia, two incidents in March moved the dial, pushing the management of the crisis into new territory.</p> <p>The first escalation happened on 13 March, when Morrison met the premiers and chief ministers in Sydney for the council of Australian governments. The second major pivot point played out over the following week, culminating in the weekend of 21 and 22 March.</p> <p>The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, gave an inkling of what was to come on 10 March. Standing inside the Royal Melbourne hospital, he warned journalists \u201cextreme measures\u201d were coming.

If more was needed, there was always the budget in May.</p> <p>By the evening of 12 March, the premiers and chief ministers were at Kirribilli House with Morrison for a social gathering ahead of Coag the next day. Some of the leaders noticed when Andrews hung back when others left. The Victorian premier congratulated the prime minister on the stimulus, but predicted government assistance would shortly need to tick over into survival payments. Swathes of the economy were going to have to shut down.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Morrison was visibly annoyed the health guidance had changed in what felt like the blink of an eye</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By the time the leaders woke the next day and made their way out to Parramatta stadium, which was the venue for the Coag talks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/13/australia-coronavirus-live-news-formula-one-f1-gp-grand-prix-melbourne-australian-government-stimulus-economic-package-asx200-latest-updates\">the world had reached 130,000 Covid-19 cases</a>, and more than 4,700 deaths had been recorded.

Live coverage could barely keep pace with events. But inside the cavernous football stadium, the Coag meeting started with the preordained agenda. There were briefings from the Reserve Bank of Australia and from Treasury. Murphy, the chief medical officer, also supplied a detailed briefing. The leaders then broke for a cup of tea.</p> <p>Running parallel with the leaders, health advisers from the states were also conferring by teleconference. Murphy was shuttling between the leaders meeting and the teleconference. Victoria, which had recorded the first case of community transmission that Friday, and Queensland, pushed during the discussion for stronger and more urgent action to force social distancing. People familiar with the dynamic in the meeting of medical officers insist it wasn\u2019t a boil over, but the forward-leaning states insisted more was needed. They sought a consensus to craft new, stronger, recommendations to be put to the leaders.</p> <p>Murphy conveyed that shift to the leaders meeting. That news hit the group like a thunderclap. Morrison was visibly annoyed the health guidance had changed in what felt like the blink of an eye. Officials were promptly turfed out of the room and the leaders were left in a huddle, in a cavernous, empty football stadium in western Sydney, to determine what to do next.</p> <p>The table had been set for lunch. Lunch didn\u2019t happen. Tumult happened. But within the hour, entirely on the hop, nine political leaders had invented a new governance structure. No papers, no proposals, no guidance from officials. Morrison suggested they manage the crisis by convening regularly as a national cabinet. The proposal materialised in the room. The states agreed and insisted the group just be them, first ministers \u2013 no opposition leaders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare: what do the Australian government's coronavirus changes mean for my family?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The group created an emergency national government of nine. Morrison later bolted in the national cabinet as a subcommittee of the regular cabinet.</p> <p>The leaders then moved to the discussion about imposing new limits on crowds, and how that would be announced to the public. There was a debate about when the proposed restriction should commence. Now, or Monday? Did people need to be given notice given it was now mid-afternoon on a Friday and events were scheduled for the weekend? There was a view some notice was required.</p> <p>Morrison war gamed in the leaders huddle about whether going to the opening game of the NRL season on Saturday night \u2013 something the prime minister had been foregrounding for days \u2013 would be a good or a bad signal. Would people be unsettled if he suddenly wasn\u2019t going? The leaders resolved the position they would telegraph, and emerged, and Morrison announced there would be a ban on non-essential gatherings of 500, effective Monday. The prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2020/mar/13/scott-morrison-defends-decision-to-attend-rugby-league-game-during-coronavirus-outbreak-video\">said he\u2019d be going to the football on Saturday night</a> because there was no cause for alarm, and \u201cit might be the last game I get to go to for a very long time\u201d.</p> <p>The day wasn\u2019t yet over. Shortly after the leaders scattered, there was another bombshell. The home affairs minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-peter-dutton-tests-positive-to-covid-19-after-returning-to-australia-from-us\">Peter Dutton had been infected with the virus, likely during a trip to America</a>.

Morrison has told colleagues the impact of this pandemic will be more far-reaching than the Depression. As the world wobbles, Australia is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/australian-prime-minister-to-ask-global-leaders-to-fund-urgent-research-for-coronavirus-vaccine\">worried about failed states</a>, and the risk of a global sovereign debt crisis.</p> <p>The national government is responsible for economic wellbeing. This crisis has triggered a legitimate dialogue between the tiers of government about protecting lives and livelihoods; how to craft public health measures that save lives without deepening an economic crisis that would threaten wellbeing in other ways. Morrison wanted to craft measures that would enable Australia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/overseas-arrivals-to-australia-to-be-quarantined-in-hotels-for-two-weeks-over-coronavirus\">economy to move into a period of hibernation</a>, and he wanted to sequence the inevitable health restrictions to flatten the curve of infections with bursts of significant fiscal firepower.</p> <p>The economic response to this crisis is massive, as it was a decade ago during the global financial crisis. The Morrison government is drawing on the central bank, on the Council of Financial Regulators, on the retail banks, on big corporates, on coordination commissions. Public servants are being redeployed to frontline agencies. Sacked call centre workers are being picked up by Centrelink, and working in contact-tracing call centres in the states. Morrison and Frydenberg are talking regularly to their counterparts overseas.</p> <p>While the economy is largely Canberra\u2019s problem, the states manage health systems, and there was concern in the two most populous states that tough restrictions necessary to stop infections were not moving fast enough. Which brings us to the events of the weekend of 21 and 22 March.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Ruby Princess, the boat two Coalition governments failed to stop, would cause a spike in infections</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was this weekend where the inevitable tension in the federation between saving jobs and preventing unmanageable numbers of ICU patients reached its peak, and manifested publicly as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/as-australia-goes-off-the-coronavirus-cliff-the-question-is-how-hard-will-it-land\">sonic boom Sunday</a>.</p> <p>The NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian, had endured a terrible few days.

A tipping point had been reached.</p> <p>In Canberra, Morrison was hunkered down with colleagues finalising the government\u2019s second stimulus package. The plan was to unveil the $66bn worth of new measures on Sunday. Journalists were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/22/scott-morrison-to-announce-66bn-stimulus-including-income-support-for-workers\">briefed late on Saturday</a> so stories could appear in the Sunday papers and on the political shows.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/apr/03/how-has-the-morrison-government-responded-to-the-coronavirus-crisis-australian-politics-live-podcast\">How has the Morrison government responded to the coronavirus crisis? \u2013 Australian politics live podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in Sydney and Melbourne, Berejiklian and Andrews were alarmed. They felt public health restrictions needed to be imposed more quickly, because people were ignoring polite entreaties from politicians and chief medical officers. Canberra was not blocking action, but a dialogue about how hard to go with social distancing restrictions that would force businesses to close remained unresolved.</p> <p>Berejiklian and Andrews were in touch throughout Saturday, into Saturday night and then again Sunday morning. Berejiklian told Morrison on Saturday night that NSW and Victoria wanted to implement the first stage of restrictions pronto \u2013 the closure of places like pubs and clubs. She said the two states were prepared to move ahead of other jurisdictions if there wasn\u2019t prompt consensus through the national cabinet.</p> <p>Not all states were persuaded that it was time to force widespread lockdowns, and worried they would be dragged along in the slipstream when there wasn\u2019t a solid evidence base. Politically it would be hard for premiers to explain to their constituents why some states were moving and they were not. One official from another state says: \u201cWe [were] moving ahead of the health advice, and all the political pressure is to go further; to be out in front of this\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The story had been briefed to Canberra reporters at a time to capture national attention, while Morrison was on his feet</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the ACT was fully on board with the NSW/Victoria view that stage one lockdowns had to happen, and now. The chief minister, Andrew Barr, noted there could not be one rule for Canberra and another for Queanbeyan. A leaders meeting scheduled originally for Tuesday had been brought forward to Sunday evening.</p> <p>The two premiers were not mucking around. Morrison was in his courtyard in Canberra about two-thirds of the way through unveiling stimulus round two when a reporter from the Nine Network asked the prime minister to comment on a new push by NSW and Victoria \u201cfor a total shutdown on non-essential businesses\u201d. The story had been briefed to Canberra reporters at a time to capture national attention, while Morrison was on his feet, and the news channels were broadcasting live.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/it-will-change-my-life-entirely-young-people-on-getting-the-550-coronavirus-supplement\">'It will change my life entirely': young people on getting the $550 coronavirus supplement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Morrison was not pleased by the political firebomb, but he ploughed on. He responded by saying he would be guided by the health advice that was currently being prepared by the chief medical officers. If he had a view, he would be expressing it in the national cabinet, not on the hop to journalists. \u201cThat\u2019s the orderly and calm way to deal with these things, and to make decisions in a responsible manner.\u201d</p> <p>Public statements from the two states followed confirming that was in fact the position: restrictions needed to happen, and they were prepared to go in advance of others. Victoria upped the ante by signalling it would close schools from Tuesday. The national cabinet had been jolted into more urgency on the health side. The view in the states intent on pushing the envelope was this was a necessary jolt, delivered just in the nick of time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84a39b5d533f2a1fb5af3d19ebada1cd6b940863\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84a39b5d533f2a1fb5af3d19ebada1cd6b940863/0_0_6720_4480/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A sign out the front of a restaurant in Surry Hills after pubs, clubs and cafes were closed for dining in.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sign out the front of a restaurant in Surry Hills after pubs, clubs and cafes were closed for dining in.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later that night, after the national cabinet discussion, Morrison fronted the cameras and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/victoria-nsw-lockdowns-scott-morrison-coronavirus-national-cabinet\">confirmed pubs and clubs would close</a>. Restaurants and cafes would be restricted to takeaway only. Schools, confusingly, seemed to be both open and closed.</p> <p>Given the obvious tumult of the day, Morrison also felt compelled to affirm the national cabinet had not splintered. The self-created government of nine had mauled, inelegantly, to a point of consensus. It has weathered its first big test. \u201cAll of its members are very committed to its processes and decisions,\u201d the prime minister said.</p> <h2>The new normal</h2> <p>This pandemic is close. It casts a shadow. \u201cWe are all next to it,\u201d Josh Frydenberg tells Guardian Australia while downing a late dinner in his Canberra digs one night this week. As the treasurer was working up the third economic support package in as many weeks \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/30/from-tight-purse-strings-to-massive-fiscal-firepower-the-coalitions-staggering-transformation\">$130bn for wages subsidies the government unfurled early this week</a> \u2013 his cousin was seriously ill in intensive care in a Melbourne hospital. Frydenberg\u2019s cousin had picked up the virus during a trip to London with his wife, and soon succumbed to a high temperature and breathing difficulties. Fortunately, he is now recovering well.</p> <p>After the watershed weekend in March, the public health restrictions have only gathered pace. Stage one was followed quickly by stages two and three. One of the recent national cabinets decreed that gatherings would go from 10 to two. Some insiders say the health advice going into the meeting was to maintain the restriction at 10, but leaders defaulted to two. Queensland pushed for one of the more recent measures \u2013 quarantining returning travellers in hotels. The state argued that particular measure would have the biggest positive impact on infection rates without inflicting more pain on the general community.</p> <p>Messaging at the beginning was confusing, and at times contradictory. But the public health messaging has become simpler, and more forceful. Stay home, unless there is a very good reason to go out. The commonwealth meanwhile keeps rolling out economic support. Wages subsidies. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare</a>, at least for some. Support for tenants and landlords.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"e603c8445074b6071f2cfeb60d41166a518a4e96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e603c8445074b6071f2cfeb60d41166a518a4e96/0_0_4821_3212/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A closed Bronte beach in Sydney with the words #StayHome written into the sand by local lifeguards.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A closed Bronte beach in Sydney with the words #StayHome written into the sand by local lifeguards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brook Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The new normal is uncomfortable. It is disconcerting. Gathering places that once teemed with life are empty. States are walled off. The businesses still open wonder when they will have to close their doors. The federal parliament is only sitting in short sessions to pass specific measures. Liberty has been curtailed by emergency powers now in place across all the states and territories, enforced by state police. It is reasonable to wonder how long the public will consent to these arrangements. Australia is a vibrant, noisy, democracy, not a police state.</p> <p>Things feel grim, because they are grim. The suspension of ordinary existence is absolutely necessary in the service of saving lives, but we have entered a new normal that could persist not for six months, which is the timeframe invoked most regularly by political leaders, but for a year. Or two.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Governments had to go further and deeper because of the lack of community buy-in initially</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Tony Bartone</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The medical profession remains on the fence about whether the governments of Australia are currently getting the balance right. The president of the Australian Medical Association, Tony Bartone, tells Guardian Australia that can only be judged with the benefit of hindsight. \u201cThe truth of the matter is governments had to go further and deeper because of the lack of community buy-in initially,\u201d Bartone says.</p> <p>\u201cWe can raise all number of reasons about why that\u2019s the case including mixed messaging, poor information and communication, and indifference by younger sections of the community who thought it was an old person\u2019s disease and they didn\u2019t have to worry. For all those reasons, governments have had to take the community on a conversation.\u201d</p> <p>Bartone also cautions against some of the optimistic commentary that has emerged over the course of the past week that Australia has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/2020/apr/01/is-australia-flattening-the-coronavirus-curve-look-at-the-charts-\">begun to flatten the curve of new infections</a>. \u201cWe are flattening it but remember that also, we had a big spike in numbers last week and previously because half the Australian population abroad returned home before the lockdowns.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/2020/apr/01/is-australia-flattening-the-coronavirus-curve-look-at-the-charts-\">Is Australia flattening the coronavirus curve? Look at the charts ...</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou\u2019d expect a bump,\u201d Bartone says. \u201cYou worry whether that flattening is actually a true flattening or whether we came off a high base, but there is still an underlying trend that needs to be flattened.\u201d</p> <p>Andrews brushes off commentary that Morrison was too slow to act on the health impacts. \u201cI think the PM is doing a fantastic job in very very difficult circumstances. I sent him a text the other night to say no prime minister in our lifetime has had to face down something as significant as this, and that national cabinet is working extremely well, and this was a fantastic suggestion from him and we are all very grateful to be acting as one government almost, if you like, across the country rather than nine of us doing our own thing.\u201d</p> <p>He says the federation creates a tension reflecting divided responsibilities. \u201cThere is that tension, that\u2019s perfectly healthy and appropriate. It\u2019s a big thing to close businesses and see people stood down. These are massive decisions to make and there is a very big toll that comes with that including anxiety and all sorts of other issues, often tragic issues, like increased family violence rates for instance and all sorts of other mental health considerations. It\u2019s not a bad thing that we are all grappling with that very difficult choice, trying to smash the virus and trying to preserve the economy as much as we can.\u201d</p> <p>Barr says the ad hoc government of nine is learning on its feet. \u201cWe are getting there now but we weren\u2019t quite there initially around fully appreciating how much the health curve would impact on the economic outcome. I think that gap is now being closed.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a few things that in hindsight you would like to have got there a week to 10 days earlier, but we have got there, sometimes just in time. What I would like to see in the next phase of this is we are not playing catch-up so much; that we are shaping the future a bit more rather than reacting to the past.\u201d</p> <p>Barr insists the national cabinet has brought out the best in the federation, and could, in fact, be a segue to a newer, more effective style of politics and governance. \u201cThis mechanism has forced cooperation that we haven\u2019t seen before. The level of information sharing is much improved from the case before.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/30/australia-coronavirus-shutdown-rules-stage-3-not-lockdown-what-is-closed-open-restrictions\">Australia coronavirus shutdown: what is open, closed and banned under the current rules?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf you were observing that national cabinet from outside and you knew nothing about Australian politics you wouldn\u2019t know which side of the fence people were on. If you\u2019d said to me three weeks ago <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/australian-jobseekers-to-get-550-increase-as-part-of-huge-coronavirus-welfare-package\">Newstart would be doubled</a>, we\u2019d have a significant wage subsidy scheme that is effectively a guaranteed minimum income, that private health would be enlisted in the public system in this way, that there would be talk of nationalising certain industries, people would have thought you were crazy, but this is a once-in-a-century health and economic crisis that required consensus decision-making and more centrist policy outcomes.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are asking so much of so many \u2026 it is so frustrating not to be able to give people an end point</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel Andrews</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Morrison warned Australians this week we are in this for the long haul. \u201cIt will be months. We need to make changes that we can live with and that we can implement day after day, week after week, month after month.\u201d</p> <p>Andrews is even blunter about the prognosis.</p> <p>There is no obvious end point to this crisis, at least not until there is a vaccine. \u201cThe most frustrating thing about this is not being able to give people an end date. We are asking so much of so many, taking extraordinary steps, it is so frustrating not to be able to give people an end point.\u201d</p> <p>Nobody, he says, is going to the football or for an overseas break for the foreseeable future. \u201cThings like international travel and restrictions on larger gatherings are going to be with us for a long time and that vaccine is some way off. </p> <p>\u201cAre we going to have many international students at universities across Melbourne and Victoria next year? Don\u2019t think so. This challenge is going to present in lots of different ways.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The scale of the coronavirus outbreak and the response it has required from government means a large-scale public inquiry is now inevitable, a former head of the civil service has said. <br><br>Sir Bob Kerslake said the scope of the decision-making undertaken by politicians and officials had been vast, and, as some of it had already been challenged, there would need to be a chance to reflect upon the UK\u2019s response in case of another pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cThere will need to be some sort of inquiry after we get through this to learn lessons,\u201d said Lord Kerslake, who is a crossbench peer. \u201cThis is one where we might face the same situation again.</p> <p>\u201cI hope that even during this clear crisis moment there is a proper record being kept of who made decisions and why, because that will be very, very important. Not to lay blame \u2013 though clearly there will be a bit of that \u2013 but to plan for the future. We could face this again and it could be even worse.\u201d</p> <p>Kerslake also warned Downing Street against appointing people with election skills and backgrounds in political messaging over those with the exact skills for the task in hand.</p> <p>His intervention echoes repeated acknowledgments by ministers that their decisions are likely to be scrutinised at a future inquiry and No 10 accepts that this is likely to be on the horizon.</p> <p>A senior Tory source said questions over testing, the government\u2019s initial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-science-chief-defends-uk-measures-criticism-herd-immunity\">consideration of herd immunity</a>, ventilator stocks, the way ideas have been briefed to the press, and the delivery of personal protective equipment would all be issues any inquiry might want to look at.</p> <p>They said: \u201cThere has to be a public inquiry about how decisions were taken and what was happening beforehand while the virus was still in Wuhan in China. What was the planning, what was flagged to who and when?\u201d</p> <p>An ex-No 10 staffer said no one working on coronavirus from within Downing Street would be overly concerned about a forthcoming inquiry, but they would always have \u201cone eye\u201d on what would be subject to a freedom of information request and any leaks of information, particularly when they involved worst-case scenario planning.</p> <p>Downing Street is said to be urgently bringing trusted people back on board to help deal with the crisis, including Isaac Levido, the head of the Tories\u2019 successful 2019 general election campaign. He has been tasked with improving the party\u2019s public health communications campaign.</p> <p>Tom Shinner, a civil servant who was formerly head of no-deal Brexit planning, has been drafted back into Downing Street to coordinate Whitehall\u2019s response to Covid-19.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Kerslake said Shinner had clearly impressed the government over Brexit and that Levido was known for his skills with election communications, but that the job now required a firm grasp of data and science.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThis is more about how do you keep the public on side because this requires massive voluntary effort. People have to choose to follow the rules and how do you keep confidence with the public.</p> <p>\u201cThe communication task goes beyond producing messaging. If that\u2019s all Levido does, I\u2019m not sure he will add a lot, but if he can recognise the \u2026 task that\u2019s needed now and how different it is to an election campaign, then he might bring something to it. If he does a rerun of the election, he\u2019s got it wrong.\u201d</p> <p>A No 10 insider said Shinner was a brilliant civil servant and exactly the right person to work on Covid-19. The senior Tory source said they were worried about the new appointees \u2013 particularly Levido \u2013 because of their political background.</p> <p>They said: \u201cYou need people who understand the logistical challenges. Experts in disaster relief. A lot of these people already exist within government who look after crisis briefs. Winning elections is good but undoubtedly this is different.\u201d</p>",

The toll, up from from 2,373 a day earlier, represents the highest single-day rise since the coronavirus crisis struck.</p> <p>There are 102,863 confirmed cases in New York. Cuomo said that hospitals have in effect turned into ICU hospitals for Covid-19 patients.</p> <h2>Italy records 766 more deaths \u2013 but infection rate slows</h2> <p>The number of deaths on Friday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-update-live-news-usa-uk-spain-italy-china-who-middle-east-spike-world-global-cases-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e8764fb8f0866297e9f6ac8#block-5e8764fb8f0866297e9f6ac8\">was relatively steady</a>, when compared to those seen the previous day. But the rate of new infections continues to slow, raising hopes of turnaround. Some 85,388 people are currently infected, with an increase of 2,339 new cases; 138 fewer than Thursday.</p> <p>Italy remains the world\u2019s worst-hit country, having suffered a total of 14,681 deaths.</p> <h2>More than 250,000 EU citizens stranded abroad</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-update-live-news-usa-uk-spain-italy-china-who-middle-east-spike-world-global-cases-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e874c2f8f0866297e9f68c5#block-5e874c2f8f0866297e9f68c5\">Some 350,000 have been repatriated</a> but that still leaves a quarter of a million EU citizens trying to get home.</p> <p>Josep Borrell, the bloc\u2019s foreign policy chief, says operations are under way to retrieve them. But he adds: \u201cOne could not imagine that there are so many Europeans stranded in the world: tourists; visitors; short-term workers.\u201d</p> <h2>Swiss death toll rises to 484</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-update-live-news-usa-uk-spain-italy-china-who-middle-east-spike-world-global-cases-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e87127a8f08532a0e66742c#block-5e87127a8f08532a0e66742c\">The Swiss government announced an increase in the number of deaths</a>, adding that the number of positive cases now stands at 19,903. Switzerland has closed schools and many businesses, as well as banning gatherings of more than five people.</p> <h2>English Premier League asks players to take 30% wage cut</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/03/uk-coronavirus-live-emergency-nightingale-hospital-opens-today-matt-hancock-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e874b418f08532a0e6677c7#block-5e874b418f08532a0e6677c7\">Premier League clubs announce</a> they are \u201ccommitting \u00a320m to support the NHS, communities, families and vulnerable groups during the pandemic\u201d.</p> <p>And the governing body says it will consult players regarding a combination of conditional reductions and deferrals amounting to 30% of total annual remuneration. It also says it will advance funds of \u00a3125m to the four leagues beneath the Premier League.</p> <h2>Queen records special coronavirus broadcast</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/03/uk-coronavirus-live-emergency-nightingale-hospital-opens-today-matt-hancock-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e87366f8f0866297e9f6756#block-5e87366f8f0866297e9f6756\">A broadcast from the monarch will be aired on Sunday</a>, Buckingham Palace says. The televised address to the nation will be only the fourth of her 68-year reign during times of national crisis and grief.</p> <p>The three previous speeches were: after the Queen Mother\u2019s death in 2002; ahead of Diana, Princess of Wales\u2019s funeral in 1997; and about the Gulf war in 1991. The Queen also made a televised address to mark her Diamond Jubilee in 2012.</p> <h2>Cases among English and Welsh prisoners rise 20% in 24 hours</h2> <p>The number of confirmed cases among prisoners in England and Wales <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/03/uk-coronavirus-live-emergency-nightingale-hospital-opens-today-matt-hancock-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e8753178f087564da1e55c8#block-5e8753178f087564da1e55c8\">has risen to 88 across 29 prisons</a>, according to a daily update from the UK\u2019s Ministry of Justice.</p> <p>The number of prison staff who have tested positive remains at 15 in the same period, while the number of infected prisoner escort and custody services staff remains at four.</p> <h2>Hungarian journalists\u2019 concerns at new law</h2> <p>The law supposedly aimed at fighting the outbreak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/hungarian-journalists-fear-coronavirus-law-may-be-used-to-jail-them\">will make objective reporting of the pandemic harder</a> and could mean court cases or even jail time for reporting the crisis, Hungarian journalists say.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">The measures, in place since Monday</a>, have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/hungary-emergency-law-incompatible-with-being-in-eu-say-meps-group-viktor-orban\">roundly criticised</a> for the sweeping powers they hand to the nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, to rule by decree.</p>",
  "<p>Even in these extraordinary times, the sight of the president of the United States presenting a slide which announced as a \u201cgoal\u201d the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefing-painful-us-deaths\" title=\"\">up to 240,000</a> of its citizens was almost beyond belief. To hit the lowest end of the target, a staggering 100,000 American deaths, would show that his administration had done \u201ca very good job\u201d, Donald Trump claimed this week. The highest end would be more than double the US casualties in the first world war. This could only be considered a positive outcome because the alternative is so shocking: without mitigation measures, if people fail to stay at home as advised, the US could be heading for between 1.5 million and 2.2 million deaths.</p> <p>The US is now the new centre of the pandemic, with more than a fifth of the million cases reported worldwide, and more than 5,000 deaths. The vast majority of Americans \u2013 more than 300 million \u2013 are now under some form of lockdown, though the stringency of restrictions varies greatly and a few states are still holding out. Those measures have come too late to stop hospitals from being overwhelmed.</p> <p>The richest country in the world is structurally ill-equipped to cope with such a crisis. The lack of universal healthcare or basic employment rights such as statutory sick pay, and the low incomes on which so many Americans survive, are conducive to the spread of disease and to it having the most serious consequences.</p> <p>But an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\" title=\"\">utter failure of leadership</a> \u2013 the lack of will, intelligence, basic competence or even consistency on the part of the Trump administration \u2013 has turbocharged the problem. And without the work of state governors and institutions, who have pre-empted the administration and gone far beyond it in taking action, matters would be even worse. Mr Trump has at best left them to fend for themselves and at worst actively hindered the fight against coronavirus.</p> <p>His culpability actually predates the virus\u2019s emergence in China. The administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/trump-cuts-undermine-coronavirus-containment-cdc-watchdog-report\" title=\"\">got rid of most of the staff</a> who worked on identifying global health problems in China, while repeatedly attempting to slash funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A comprehensive document on battling pandemics, drawn up under the Obama administration, was \u201cthrown on to a shelf\u201d by its successor. Only last October, an internal federal government report warned that the US was woefully underprepared and underfunded to tackle a virus without a cure.</p> <p>Even after the virus was confirmed to have reached the US, Mr Trump downplayed the crisis at every opportunity, fearing the impact on the economy. As late as 25 February he called it \u201cvery well under control\u201d. He has touted unproven remedies. Last week, he said he wanted to reopen large sections of the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/trump-coronavirus-us-easter-new-york-fauci-birx\" title=\"\">by Easter</a> and to see \u201cpacked churches all over our country\u201d \u2013 though he has, thankfully, since extended the federal \u201cstay at home\u201d guidance until the end of this month. The federal government should have mobilised long ago to acquire an appropriate supply of testing kits, protective equipment and ventilators. It did not. This week, he was forced to acknowledge that the government\u2019s emergency stockpile of protective equipment is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/trump-coronavirus-stockpile-ppe-briefing\" title=\"\">almost exhausted</a>.</p> <p>The economy is reeling. An astonishing 6.6 million Americans signed on for unemployment welfare last week. The emergency <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\" title=\"\">$2tn relief package</a>, while necessary and welcome, offers more to corporate America than those on the breadline.</p> <p>Some wonder if this could finally break his spell. So far, people are rallying around the flag: a national crisis tends to prompt people to support the leadership. Despite his dereliction of duty, Mr Trump\u2019s approval ratings have actually increased, as they have for leaders <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c7f5a8bc-eb0e-45e5-a080-bbfd6d317def\" title=\"\">in almost every democratic nation</a>. He may also benefit from the rock-bottom expectations people have of him. And he is already trying to rewrite the facts and pin the blame on others, attacking governors both for failing to prepare and for hoarding equipment.</p> <p>These efforts may yet succeed. But the truth is that, as he has finally acknowledged, the coming weeks will be \u201cvery, very painful\u201d \u2013 and that his inaction has made them much more so.</p>",

Jamie Potter, Partner at Bindmans, said:<br><br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The social distancing measures being put in place by government are clearly important, but they cannot be used to disproportionately interfere in the rights of those with protected characteristics, particularly those with mental illness, autism or similar conditions that necessitate leaving the house more than once per day. </p> \n   <p>Such rights can clearly co-exist with the health measures being put in place and Parliament clearly did not think it necessary to impose the once per day restriction arbitrarily introduced by the government. It is essential the government needs to rethink this restrictive policy and allow appropriate flexibility where it is necessary and justified.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>One of the affected families instructing Bindmans said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The government must consider the vital needs of disabled people and their families, many of whom now have considerably reduced support, while managing the coronavirus crisis, including essential social distancing. Without these considerations, the current situation risks becoming unmanageable for them.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8755a38f0866297e9f6992\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-03T15:26:50.790Z\">4.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a38885a67fbb87077071c2448a9722900731196f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a38885a67fbb87077071c2448a9722900731196f/0_0_2804_2944/952..jpg\" alt=\"A brightly painted \u2018thank you NHS\u2019 picture in a shop window in Penarth, Wales.\" width=\"952\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A brightly painted \u2018thank you NHS\u2019 picture in a shop window in Penarth, Wales.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8753fd8f08532a0e667886\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-03T15:21:31.529Z\">4.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A will company is waiving fees for those working in the NHS after experiencing a 12-fold increase in the number of requests from such workers in March compared to December.<br><br><strong>Farewill</strong> is waiving its \u00a390 fee to make a will, the company\u2019s chief executive, Dan Garrett, said. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve seen demand for our services increase recently and we\u2019ve done everything we can to meet it, taking on around 20 extra staff.

  "<p>Boris Johnson and his government are on probation, watched by a public whose mood could turn rapidly and brutally. For now, and on paper, Johnson has the people with him: his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-28/coronavirus-gives-boris-johnson-s-political-immunity\">poll ratings</a> have surged north of 50%, a feat last managed by a Tory government at the height of the Falklands war nearly 40 years ago. But the wisest heads in Downing Street will not be turned by those numbers. They know that there\u2019s always a \u201crally around the flag\u201d effect at moments of extreme crisis: when citizens are frightened, they want to believe their leaders have got things under control. That\u2019s why incumbents around the world, even useless and immoral ones <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/27/trump-narcissism-american-blood-coronavirus\">such as Donald Trump</a>, have enjoyed an initial corona bounce in their ratings, almost regardless of their actions. At the start of the Iran hostage crisis in 1979 Jimmy Carter saw his approval numbers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/10/archives/survey-finds-carters-popularity-has-risen-sharply-in-iran-crisis.html\">leap from 32% to </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/10/archives/survey-finds-carters-popularity-has-risen-sharply-in-iran-crisis.html\">61%</a> \u2013 only for him to crash to defeat a year later. Johnson will know that one day, and perhaps quite soon, he, too, will be judged.</p> <p>He can point to some concrete achievements. The opening today of what is a giant field hospital in east London\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/03/prince-charles-opens-nhs-nightingale-hospital-for-coronavirus-patients-video\">Ex</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/03/prince-charles-opens-nhs-nightingale-hospital-for-coronavirus-patients-video\">CeL </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/03/prince-charles-opens-nhs-nightingale-hospital-for-coronavirus-patients-video\">centre</a>, constructed within nine days, is the prime example. Those who drooled with totalitarian envy at China\u2019s ability to throw up a hospital in Wuhan within a week were adamant that a western democracy like Britain could never match that accomplishment, and they have been proved wrong. Rishi Sunak\u2019s promise that the state will pay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\">80% of workers\u2019 wages</a> has won plaudits around the world, even if the chancellor has had to return repeatedly to his economic rescue package, tweaking it to catch those groups he left behind first time around. And the government has imposed a national lockdown that has been largely observed, one that might even see a flattening of the infection curve in the next week or so.</p> <p>All that, though, has to be set against a record that does not inspire confidence, but saps it. It consists of a series of decisions that, for now, the British public has been prepared to forgive, granting its leaders the benefit of the doubt, but which it may eventually find indefensible. Their combined effect can be seen in a single image, a graph with the power to terrify. It shows that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1245466456789303297?s=20\">the UK death toll is </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1245466456789303297?s=20\"> currently higher than Italy\u2019s at the same stage</a>, reinforced by another showing that by this stage of the outbreak <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky/status/1245703131947827200?s=20\">Italy had begun to flatten its curve while in Britain the line keeps rising</a>, the number of deaths doubling every three days.</p> <p>Start with Johnson\u2019s initial reaction to this menace. Recall the smirking insouciance with which he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/27/i-shook-hands-with-everybody-says-boris-johnson-weeks-before-coronavirus-diagnosis-video\"> boasted that he continued to shake hands</a>, even when he met people he knew to be infected with the virus. If Britain emerges from this crisis with a higher death rate than comparable countries, that is a Johnson moment that will come to haunt him.</p> <p>That complacency was formalised in the government\u2019s flirtation with the notion of herd immunity, an approach that some ministers still try to deny was ever policy but which was spelled out explicitly by the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/1238390547783528448?s=20\">chief scientific adviser as recently as 13 March</a>. To be sure, Johnson U-turned on that, ditching mitigation for all-out suppression when he announced the national lockdown 10 days later, prompted in part by seeing Italy engulfed by the virus. But Britons might not wait for the inevitable public inquiry to wonder at the time lost chasing what proved to be a fantasy and to ask how those precious days might have been used instead to prepare for what was coming.</p> <p>For that time could have been devoted to testing, the failing on which this government is likely to be judged most harshly. On Thursday, health secretary Matt Hancock sought to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/matt-hancock-sets-target-of-100000-coronavirus-tests-a-day\">offer an explanation</a> for why Britain so conspicuously lags behind the likes of Germany in this area: Britain does not have the diagnostic industry the Germans have built up over 70 years, he said. But that cannot excuse what has been a litany of mixed messages, crossed wires and broken promises.</p> <p>Even now, there remains confusion about whether the government accepts the centrality of <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-we-still-need-to-test-widely-for-coronavirus/\">testing to combating this threat</a>. It was not three weeks ago that the head of the World Health Organization made the case in words of one syllable. The way to fight Covid-19 was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/16/test-test-test-who-calls-for-more-coronavirus-testing-video\">test, test, test</a>\u201d. Yet a matter of hours before Hancock spoke, and even as the prime minister was calling testing the key that would \u201cunlock the coronavirus puzzle,\u201d the deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, was on TV arguing that testing was \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/itvpeston/status/1245456133659262979?s=20\">a bit of a side issue,</a>\u201d compared with slowing the rate of new infections via physical distancing.</p> <p>Small wonder, then, that while ministers have been on a loop promising to \u201cramp up\u201d testing, those tasked with making that happen have been tripping over their feet. Note the government\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/richholmes/uk-thousands-extra-coronavirus-tests\">animal health agency, which says it could have been running </a><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/richholmes/uk-thousands-extra-coronavirus-tests\"> 40,000 human tests a week </a>and has been eager to help, but couldn\u2019t get a straight answer out of Public Health England (PHE). First in touch with PHE back in January, its capacity still remains untapped.</p> <p>That seems to fit with reports that PHE has been too controlling and centralising, standing in the way of the Dunkirk effort urged by Nobel prize-winning scientist Sir Paul Nurse, in which hundreds of the UK\u2019s smaller labs would play the role of 1940\u2019s little boats, doing their bit to test, test, test. There has been confusion \u2013 ministers say there\u2019s a shortage of key chemicals called \u201creagents\u201d, the chemical industry says there\u2019s no shortage \u2013 and there has been failure, best captured by the sight of those much-vaunted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulBrandITV/status/1245737538461077504?s=20\">drive-through testing </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulBrandITV/status/1245737538461077504?s=20\"> facilities, in Chessington, North Greenwich or Wembley, standing unused </a>and echoingly empty. Note too the baffling decision that only 15% of tests should be given to NHS staff, a limit that was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BethRigby/status/1245354010720206851?s=20\">lifted this week</a>.</p> <p>When the time comes, the government might try to blame the civil servants and the bureaucrats and, no doubt, there will be plenty of blame to go around. But the government has power \u2013 more of it now than at any time since the war \u2013 and its duty was to bend the bureaucracy to its will. Hancock wants to convey that he\u2019s doing that, promising 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month. But even if meeting that target proves possible, and details are scant, it could come too late, given that those same ministers are warning that the tidal wave will be crashing on our shores very soon. </p> <p>Sadly, the failings on testing do not stand alone. There has been the scandalous failure to equip doctors and nurses with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/nhs-staff-protection-doctor-ppe-coronavirus\">protective kit</a> they need. When hospitals are turning to <a href=\"https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/03/28/medical-fetish-store-hospital-scrubs-nhs-coronavirus-pandemic-ppe-covid19-medfet-twitter/\">suppliers of medical fetish gear </a>for essential masks and scrubs, you know something has gone badly wrong. The same can be said of watching a Trump administration official <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PickardJE/status/1245381721283059712?s=20\">mock the UK for having so few ventilators</a>, or of the evidence that our government chose to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/uk-discussed-joint-eu-plan-to-buy-covid-19-medical-supplies-say-officials\">stand aside from a Europe-wide effort to source those life-saving machines</a>, apparently because to take part would smack of betraying Brexit.</p> <p>For now, the British public are being patient, but their patience will not be infinite. Hancock will have to make good on that promise of 100,000 tests by the end of this month; the curve will have to flatten. At stake over the next four weeks will be the lives of many citizens of this nation \u2013 and the life of this government.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 April 2020. The original version referred to a decision that \u201conly 15% of NHS staff could be tested\u201d for Covid-19; in fact the decision had been that only 15% of daily testing capacity for the disease could be allocated to NHS staff.</p>",
  "<p>You are paying monthly for your car insurance \u2013 but no longer using your car. You have an expensive season ticket for travel into work on the train \u2013 but now you are at home.

Readers have asked whether they can pause their insurance, particularly as they are set to receive only 80% of their wages. The answer? Unfortunately, it\u2019s not easy. </p> <p>Insurers say they set the premium at the start of the policy and the cost reflects the risk at that time. You could try lowering your predicted annual mileage, or take drivers off the policy, but this will rarely achieve big savings \u2013 especially when admin fees of about \u00a330 are applied.</p> <p>If you really need to cut your outgoings, you can tell the DVLA you are taking the car off the road with a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/make-a-sorn\" title=\"\">statutory off road </a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/make-a-sorn\" title=\"\">notification (Sorn)</a>, and cancelling the insurance.

  "<p>The USNS comfort, the navy hospital ship deployed to New York City this week, was supposed to house 1,000 patients. Instead, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/nyregion/ny-coronavirus-usns-comfort.html\">it\u2019s taken in only 20, refusing to accept New Yorkers suffering with coronavirus.</a></p> <p>Sitting on idle on the Hudson River, the ship is quickly becoming a symbol of all that has gone horrifically wrong with both the federal and local response to the Covid-19 outbreak. There are about 50,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in New York City alone, with more than a thousand dead. Many, with the right course of action, could have been prevented.</p> <p>Donald Trump, who has bumbled through every conceivable facet of preparation for this once-in-a-century pandemic, saw off the ship in Virginia to much fanfare. Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City, and Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, greeted it upon arrival. But military and bureaucratic hurdles have prevented the Comfort from accepting most patients.</p> <p>Strict rules are preventing people infected with the virus from coming on board. The navy is also refusing to treat a host of other conditions. Guidelines sent to hospitals included a list of 49 medical conditions that would exclude a patient from admittance to the ship.</p> <p>Ambulances cannot take patients directly to the Comfort. First, they must deliver patients to a city hospital to be tested for the virus and then pick them up again for transport to the ship. Hospital leaders rightfully find the delays untenable.</p> <p>In New York City, hospitals are besieged. Patients are dying in hallways. Refrigerated trucks are now makeshift morgues. Doctors and nurses are forced to reuse protective gear, some even <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2020/03/26/new-york-city-nurses-wear-garbage-bags-camerota-intv-newday-vpx.cnn\">donning trash bags</a>. The city is running dangerously low on ventilators and even body bags.</p> <p>The ship, sitting nearly empty, is almost a mockery of all the suffering taking place on land. If it won\u2019t treat coronavirus patients, it will hardly treat anyone: since so few people are going outside, non-coronavirus injuries and illnesses have plummeted.</p> <p>The solution is obvious enough. Open the navy hospital ship to coronavirus patients and let the Comfort join the ranks of other temporary hospitals in New York, like the 1,000-bed facility at the Javits Center, which in better times hosts book expos and auto shows.</p> <p>There are understandable challenges to making the Comfort ready for Covid-19 patients. Infections could spread easily in a confined area. The cramped conditions are suitable for wounded sailors but not necessarily civilians. When Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico, the Comfort failed to relieve much of the strain of hospitals, treating <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/us/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-hospital-ship.html\">only six patients a day</a>.</p> <p>Ultimately, politicians like Trump and Cuomo invested far too much hope in one hospital ship. It\u2019s the tragic consequence of failing in the most brutal way to prepare for such a pandemic. America knew what was happening in China, Spain, Italy and elsewhere: there were many weeks of lead time that other countries couldn\u2019t benefit from.</p> <p>Trump, a deeply incompetent executive who denies science, could not ramp up testing to create any kind of accurate picture of which Americans were infected and needed to be quarantined. Federal guidelines for social distancing came too late. Medical supplies weren\u2019t produced. Companies were not compelled, by law, to produce them.</p> <p>Cuomo, perceived as a hero because Trump is so ill-fit for a crisis, has not performed much better. Though New York had more coronavirus cases, the state government closed public schools and implemented a shelter-in-place order after states like California, Ohio and Michigan, even though New York was the center of the outbreak. The curve was not flattened enough. New York, like northern Italy before it, is in a state of catastrophe.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a vacant hospital ship floats uselessly on the river. For now, it\u2019s sadly representative of the federal and local response to coronavirus: too little and far too late.</p> <ul> <li><p>Ross Barkan is a journalist based in New York City.<br></p></li> </ul>",

New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, compared the experience to eBay; Connecticut\u2019s governor, Ned Lamont, said it was like Uber surge pricing, except \u201cat the last moment, the car drives away because somebody has outbid you\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmVqrJHrO-8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TmVqrJHrO-8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, governors are comparing buying life-saving ventilators for a pandemic to surge pricing,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cThis is capitalism at its absolute worst. While Trump waits for the market to decide, people are literally going to die, and states are getting ripped off like they\u2019re trying to call an Uber in the rain in midtown after a Broadway show.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll never guess who\u2019s in charge of this shitshow,\u201d Meyers continued. \u201cThe guy Slenderman has nightmares about: Jared Kushner.\u201d Kushner reportedly pushed back on Cuomo\u2019s request for 30,000 ventilators; he called Cuomo an alarmist and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/04/inside-trumps-decision-to-back-off-of-his-easter-coronavirus-miracle\">said in a White House meeting</a>: \u201cI have all this data about ICU capacity.

You\u2019re a nepotism case, and you only got the White House job because you married into the family, and because the security guards believed your fake ID.</p> <p>\u201cI hope when the time for accountability comes, we can all remember that it didn\u2019t have to be like this,\u201d Meyers concluded, noting that countries such as South Korea and Iceland have contained their coronavirus outbreaks better than the US. \u201cOther countries responded to this pandemic with competence, and they avoided the worst. Now, we\u2019re bracing for an unimaginable tragedy and as we speak, the president is leaving besieged states and hospitals to fend for themselves, putting lives at risk.\u201d</p> <h2>Stephen Colbert</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RBo9rVhZqI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7RBo9rVhZqI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>On A Late Show, Stephen Colbert noted that \u201cevery member of my family has been terrific\u201d on his first week of home-produced TV (including his affable spaniel, Benny) \u201cwhich statistically means I\u2019m the bad roommate.

  "<p>When the lockdown is lifted, will the virus return? Of course it will. Matt Hancock has said we will do <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-matt-hancock-sets-goal-of-100000-tests-per-day-by-end-of-april-video\">100,000 tests each day</a> by the end of April, but Britain still doesn\u2019t have a way to control the virus that goes beyond lockdown. Without a proper programme of community surveillance and contact tracing, we won\u2019t stop the spread of coronavirus. As patients pour into hospitals again, a series of national lockdowns will follow. It\u2019s a pattern that could go on for years \u2013 until we have a vaccine.</p> <p>The problem with Hancock\u2019s plan is that testing alone won\u2019t break the chain of community transmission. To stop the spread of a virus, tests must be linked to community surveillance and contact tracing. This ensures that people who have the virus, and people they have come into contact with, can be identified quickly and quarantined at home to prevent the virus spreading. The government\u2019s tests will measure how many people have had the virus, and will show whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/hancock-orders-all-spare-coronavirus-tests-used-nhs-staff\">health workers are immune</a> \u2013 but without community surveillance, tests alone won\u2019t prevent its spread.</p> <p>On 12 March, the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, and chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, announced that the UK had moved from containing the virus to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-science-chief-defends-uk-measures-criticism-herd-immunity\">delaying its spread</a>. Their plan was to flatten the curve of the epidemic that would sweep through our population. They reassured us that herd immunity would kick in once 60% of the population had been infected. Social distancing and washing our hands would ease the pressure on health services, they said. Crucially, community testing and contract tracing would stop immediately. At that point, we were still four weeks behind Italy. The media felt safe, reassured by two eminent physicians.</p> <p>The trouble is, those scientists were wrong. The maths wasn\u2019t difficult: working off their figures, about 40 million people in the UK would be infected by coronavirus, and between 200,000 and 400,000 would eventually die. When the government\u2019s mathematicians modelled figures from Italy and showed that 30% of people admitted to hospital ended up in intensive care, they warned the government that the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-hospitalisation-rates-revealed-80-per-cent-infected/\">NHS would be overwhelmed</a>. The government backtracked within three days, and shifted to suppressing rather than mitigating the virus.</p> <p>In reality, little changed. The government\u2019s beliefs were founded on the assumption that coronavirus behaves like flu. It doesn\u2019t. Its mortality rate is higher, there is little evidence that it is seasonal, and it poses a far greater threat to the NHS. Without a programme of community surveillance and contact tracing, the virus will continue to spread. Britain will be subject to routine flare-ups and repeated lockdowns.</p> <p>I spoke to a senior international epidemic expert, who wished to remain anonymous. They described the UK\u2019s response as too weak. \u201cFinding these viruses is like guerrilla warfare. If you don\u2019t know where the virus is hiding you cannot control it. We must use a bundle of measures to chase it. We must organise teams of friendly community workers to find people with symptoms, test for the virus, isolate and treat them, and trace their contacts. Workers must check on them in their homes every one or two days,\u201d they said.</p> <p>I asked them whether social distancing alone could beat the virus. \u201cIt won\u2019t work,\u201d they told me. \u201cYou can stop contact tracing in the hotspots, but when you lift the lockdown, everywhere at the same time, you\u2019ll face a problem: the virus will come back. New hotspots will form.</p> <p>\u201cWithout a community programme for case detection and contact tracing, you won\u2019t find the virus until it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p> <p>In China, Xi Jinping initially prevaricated, suppressing the findings of a fact-finding mission on 4 January that investigated the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/22/coronavirus-asymptomatic-wuhan-woman-shows-why-outbreak-will-be-hard-to-stop\">outbreak in Wuhan</a>. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/26/china-bans-long-distance-buses-from-entering-three-cities-to-contain-coronavirus-spread\">by 26 January</a>, China had placed more than 50 million people under quarantine; 40 provinces reported a total of 2,744 cases and 80 deaths. The Chinese communist party mobilised thousands of community workers to scale up a national testing effort, while mapping infections using case definitions based on symptoms.</p> <p>Almost 40,000 health workers were flown in from across China<strong> </strong>to help with this huge community surveillance effort. The government enforced regional lockdowns, closed down shops, bars, universities and schools, and policed the supermarkets and pharmacies. They <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/the-new-normal-chinas-excessive-coronavirus-public-monitoring-could-be-here-to-stay\">developed apps</a> to monitor peoples\u2019 symptoms and their compliance with quarantine, and set up 24-hour TV channels in every province to update people on data, progress and prevention. With this comprehensive response, China managed to suppress the transmission of the virus in less than two months.</p> <p>By contrast, the UK was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/the-uk-governments-woeful-response-to-the-coronavirus-outbreak\">slow to act</a>, and timid when it did. The government mistakenly based its coronavirus response on social distancing alone. The UK\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group of Experts (Sage) didn\u2019t even ask their mathematical advisers to model a community testing programme. Neil Ferguson reportedly said community testing and contact tracing wasn\u2019t included as a possible strategy in the original modelling because <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2238578-uk-has-enough-intensive-care-units-for-coronavirus-expert-predicts/#ixzz6IS5s4KYQ\">not enough tests were available</a>. But we had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/britain-covid-19-head-start-squandered\">eight weeks\u2019 notice</a>.</p> <p>We still don\u2019t have a coordinated mobilisation of general practices and public health outbreak management teams. None are linked with digital apps or laboratory testing. In one of the best research cultures in the world, we failed to create the community surveillance and testing effort needed to stop the spread of the virus.</p> <p>The government and its advisers are now committed to their strategy of delaying the spread of coronavirus, which they hope will eventually lead to herd immunity. Our present predicament is a symptom of past decisions: the decision not to roll out testing sooner put the government on the back foot, scrambling to catch up with the virus.</p> <p>But it isn\u2019t too late. To prevent the spread of coronavirus, we need a change of direction. Local authorities must take control of their public-health outbreak management teams. We need a centralised app and database to allow citizens to report their symptoms, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/31/nhs-developing-app-to-trace-close-contacts-of-coronavirus-carriers\">NHSX app</a> that researchers have been working on since January.</p> <p>GP networks, working with teams of trained volunteers and retired health workers equipped with personal protective equipment, could visit everyone reporting suspicious symptoms at home every one to two days. If there is testing, all the better. But symptom-based reporting will do. With a proper community protection scheme in place, local authorities could shield their population from the threat of the virus, which has taken hold in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/london-hospitals-facing-tsunami-of-coronavirus-patients-overwhelmed\">hotspots like London</a> and the cities of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/west-midlands-emerges-as-a-hotspot-for-coronavirus-deaths\">Midlands</a> and north west.</p> <p>The lockdown will flatten the curve, but we have a month or more before it lifts.

They want to do meaningful things,\u201d said Art Goldsmith, a professor of economics at Washington and Lee University who has researched the psychological effects of unemployment.</p> <p>Although Goldsmith noted there is evidence that people experience a brief period of optimism when they are first let go from their jobs \u2013 they find they have more time to do other tasks, like cleaning out a garage \u2013 dangerous feelings of pessimism can set in after four to five weeks of unemployment.</p> <p>\u201cAs the weeks go on, and we see the economy struggling, I think there will be more pessimism.

An Association for Psychological Science <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/09/190903120522.htm\">study</a> published in September 2019 found that those who experienced financial, housing or job-related hardship during the Great Recession were more likely to have depression, anxiety or substance abuse as many as three years after the recession. A <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/171044/depression-rates-higher-among-long-term-unemployed.aspx\">poll</a> from Gallup conducted in 2014 found that unemployed Americans were more than twice as likely to self-report being treated for depression.</p> <p>Economists are particularly concerned about people who were disenfranchised before the crisis started.</p> <p>Black Americans historically have an unemployment rate that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/17/us-booming-economy-black-americans\">twice as high</a> as the overall rate, even in a healthy economy.</p> <p>\ufeffThe overall <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap/\">median wealth</a> for a black family is 10 times less than the median wealth of a white family. Discriminatory job processes have kept black Americans in low-paying jobs, many of which have seen layoffs with Covid-19. \u201cFrom the standpoint of providing for oneself and one\u2019s family, the situation is already significantly less secure for black Americans.\u201d</p> <p>While the mental health toll from unemployment is shared across the globe, America\u2019s weak safety net and lack of affordable healthcare exacerbates the consequences for unemployed Americans.</p> <p>Economists have shown that unemployment and low wages have literally fatal consequences for Americans. In 2015 Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton, winner of the 2015 Nobel prize for economics, found middle-aged white Americans were more likely to die in mid-life than their parents \u2013 reversing decades of steadily increasing life expectancy.</p> <p>They coined the term \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/28/deaths-of-despair-us-jobs-drugs-alcohol-suicide\">deaths of despair</a>\u201d and blamed the rise on suicide, drug overdose or alcohol-related liver disease.</p> <p>Their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/19/us-healthcare-industry-working-class-deaths\">research</a> found geographic and class-related underpinnings to the rise: places that have a smaller fraction of working-age people in jobs are more likely to have higher rates of deaths of despair.</p> <p>The people dying were overwhelmingly white working-age Americans without college degrees. That group of people were finding that their jobs were being valued less than previous generations by the American economy \u2013 they were working for lower wages, inflexible hours and fewer benefits. Many lost jobs to changing technology.</p> <p>Exacerbating the problem has been easy access to addictive opioids and firearms (more than <a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/magazine/magazine_article/guns-suicide/\">half</a> of suicides in America are committed with a firearm). \u201cWe all but load the weapons of self-destruction for people in misery,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/why-americans-are-dying-from-despair\">noted</a> surgeon Atul Gawande in the New Yorker.</p> <p>This economic and mental health crisis will only be deepened by the sudden rise in unemployment. And, in the meantime, many Americans face barriers to getting mental healthcare. While health insurance can offset the cost of therapy and access to a psychiatrist, Americans typically rely on an employer for health insurance and lose access if they are laid off. About 28 million Americans do <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/\">not have health insurance</a> at all.</p> <p>\ufeffCities typically do not rely on a single firm to keep people employed. If a major company shuts down, people can typically find employment elsewhere. But with huge sectors of the service industry \u2013 restaurants, hair salons, hotels \u2013 shutting down amid the pandemic, the mental health toll of this recession is likely to cast a wide net.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to low-skilled, support sectors in the cities if this lasts really long? We\u2019d have whole different population cohorts we haven\u2019t seen before that may also suffer some severe mental health crises,\u201d Graham said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying we shouldn\u2019t social-distance \u2013 we have no choice.

  "<p>You may not know the name John Langdon, who died on 23 March, but you\u2019ll very probably have laughed at his jokes or even read his pun-packed posters on the London Underground in the 1980s. When the story of BBC Radio Light Entertainment is written, the legend of Langdon will feature large, not least because he wrote the famous Week Ending sketch about Derek Jameson (\u201ca man who thinks erudite is a type of glue\u201d) for which the tabloid editor sued the BBC and lost. But to me, he was my best friend, my greatest encourager and, for over 35 years, my constant writing partner.</p> <p>He\u2019d appreciate the irony of now being the late John Langdon, as that was a salient part of his reputation \u2013 his inability to deliver scripts on time, or rather, his infallible ability to produce far too many jokes at the very last minute. \u201cDo you want it funny or do you want it Friday?\u201d he\u2019d say, knowing that producers invariably wanted it Friday. But he, equally invariably, managed, through a combination of chaotic genius and perfectionism, to push it into the small hours of Saturday. One producer blamed the break-up of his marriage on the fact that his wife wouldn\u2019t believe him when he insisted he was working late editing John\u2019s scripts and decided he must be having an affair. Barry Cryer would say John was like Brigadoon, the Scottish village that appeared out of the mist one day every 100 years.</p> <p>In the 80s John was a writer on the radio corridor at the BBC, working on weekly satirical shows such as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/entries/8fb0a92d-349d-365f-a02e-b5d2edffe291\">Week Ending</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006r9yq\">The News Quiz </a>with writers including Dave Cohen, Pete Sinclair, Andy Hamilton and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/feb/01/jeremy-hardy-obituary\">Jeremy Hardy</a>. I think it was Pete or Dave who credited John with \u201cthe Langdon\u201d, a joke formula where you introduce two subjects, and switch them at the punchline. For example, Boris Johnson and his girlfriend introduced their new dog to Downing Street yesterday. \u201cHe\u2019s a bit scruffy and wants to shag everything that moves, but we\u2019ll get used to him,\u201d said the dog.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"00b0d5c629526ea6216b988e5b403a285c90e7a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00b0d5c629526ea6216b988e5b403a285c90e7a3/0_0_480_594/404..jpg\" alt=\"John Langdon, centre, with Rory Bremner and Lewis Macleod.\" width=\"404\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Langdon, centre, with Rory Bremner, right, and Lewis Macleod.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Rory Bremner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He wrote whole series of The News Quiz \u2013 in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/apr/01/broadcasting.guardianobituaries\">Barry Took</a>/<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/06/simon-hoggart-obituary\">Simon Hoggart</a> era - on his own (now there are often three or four credited writers) \u2013 usually, as was his style, outside on the pavement, leaning against railings so he could smoke unusual cigarettes and type on a handheld computer or scribble on sheets of paper. Someone contacted me this week to say he remembered John going AWOL while working on Frankie Howerd\u2019s TV show. They found him in a cubicle in the gents\u2019 writing material on a \u201cbakelite microwriter contraption\u201d strapped to his thigh.</p> <p>We were paired up in Edinburgh in 1984. I was doing my first standup show, with Mark Steel and Jenny Eclair, and BBC radio producers Alan Nixon and Jennie Campbell wanted to use my impressions to link highlights from the rest of the Fringe. Jennie introduced us and from that day forward, we were inseparable.</p> <p>Yes, the scripts could be overwritten, a torrential flow of jokes that I told him were like those Indian trains with people hanging off every conceivable door and window. But he taught me everything I know about writing, and as I grew more confident and self-reliant (because sometimes it <em>had</em> to be Friday) he became the best editor and embellisher of my efforts I could wish for. We ended up like a married couple, finishing each other\u2019s sandwiches. (A typical John twist, that. A couple \u201cfinishing each other\u2019s sentences\u201d wouldn\u2019t be funny. Unless, like Jack Dee, you make the couple Fred and Rosemary West.)</p> <p>Just weeks before John died, we were writing lines for the tour of I\u2019m Sorry I Haven\u2019t a Clue and one of our last email exchanges crossed in the ether. Inventing new slogans for companies, we\u2019d each written, unbeknown to the other, \u201cSussexRoyal.com: Heir today, gone tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>However good the line, he\u2019d want to make it even better. Asked by Stephen Fry to do a piece at Prince Charles\u2019s 50th, I suggested Dr Dolittle singing, \u201cIf I could talk to the vegetables\u201d. (\u201cImagine talking to a turnip; moaning to a mushroom \u2013 I could even talk in Swedish \u2013 to a Swede!\u201d ) Back came the lines from John: \u201cI\u2019d frater-nize with whole fields of wheat / bend their ears a bit / it\u2019s a-MAIZE-ing just how corny I can be; I love to share a hearty joke / with an audience of artichoke / I\u2019m a sort of life and soul of the party bloke / and they all talk to me.\u201d There\u2019s the joy of writing together, right there.</p> <p>Late as he was with scripts, he could be lightning fast with one-liners. Backstage at a Prince\u2019s Trust gala, the great Robin Williams asked him: \u201cWhat do you say to a prince?\u201d John immediately suggested: \u201cI\u2019m a great fan of yours \u2013 I\u2019ve got all your portraits.\u201d Someone once remarked that they hadn\u2019t realised Barry Took was so tall. \u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s standing on <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001204/bio\">Marty Feldman</a>\u2019s reputation,\u201d John replied. Very unfair, as John immediately acknowledged, but boy, it was quick.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nohGiQmOxlc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nohGiQmOxlc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Friday nights on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jan/01/john-fortune-five-great-comedy-sketches\">Bremner, Bird and Fortune </a>were the best. John and I would madly rewrite my opening monologue as I sat in the make-up chair, with the warm-up comedian already priming the studio audience. With five minutes to go, John would run to give the changes to our long-suffering autocue operator Sarah. As I was introduced with a cheer from the audience, John would jump up and down mouthing \u201cKill! Kill! Kill!\u201d as I bounded to the microphone and did a few minutes warm-up of my own while the script was typed into the autocue in front of me. When it was finished, I\u2019d sight-read it, humming the voices instead of actually speaking, and then we\u2019d run the opening titles and start recording.</p> <p>That was how we did it. It was all adrenaline, seat-of-the-pants, last-minute writing stuff.</p> <p> Beyond writing, John was the kindest, most generous, least judgmental man you could ever meet. Such was his love of other people that he was the least important person in his life \u2013 this often extending to his appearance. Once he arrived on set with severe toothache. I sent him off to the dentist. John came back later that day having had all his top teeth removed, unable to control his top lip or speak as the anaesthetic hadn\u2019t worn off. For months he didn\u2019t have any false teeth fitted, chewing everything \u2013 even sandwiches \u2013 with his gums, his lack of teeth hidden under his trademark moustache.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm2e9iIlra0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Rm2e9iIlra0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>A while ago, we lost contact for a year or two. I found out it was because he\u2019d been unwell and didn\u2019t want to tell me, as he knew I\u2019d want to put it right, and it couldn\u2019t be put right. In those years he slipped into reclusiveness, editing a magazine about sewing machines of which he became, by default, a huge collector. Luckily we got back in touch and in his final years he wrote wonderful material for me and for Jan Ravens, driven to one show by his devoted wife Ros and carrying his own oxygen supply, the result of the COPD that was ultimately to claim his life.</p> <p>He was writing up to a few weeks before his final relapse, living on oxygen, having lost sight in one eye and having a cataract in the other. There wasn\u2019t a shred of self-pity. He knew his time was up and he\u2019d had an extraordinary, unconventional, complicated, fulfilling life. It was our greatest luck \u2013 all of us who worked with him on our shows \u2013 that we shared so much of that life with him, doing what we all loved. Making comedy. Oh, how we\u2019ll miss him.</p>",

We were quite weak on that in the five years after the financial crash.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fisher said it was important that if Starmer won he ensured the shadow cabinet reflected views across the party and not within a single faction. \u201cHe is obviously going to change the shadow cabinet ... but he does need to find a balance, a broad church in a Wilsonian way, so he does have a range of opinion in there,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He added that a new leader would have to react to the Conservatives\u2019 recent conversion to approving the partial nationalisation of transport. \u201cThe new leader will have to look at the measures put in place temporarily and work out which they want to continue and campaigning for those where appropriate.\u201d</p> \n<p>Society will have changed after the coronavirus, Fisher said, which may increase a Labour government\u2019s appeal as long as the party sets a radical economic agenda.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople\u2019s values, people\u2019s experiences have shifted. We don\u2019t know what the level of unemployment will be or the level of people on reduced hours will be at the end of this crisis but it\u2019s clearly going to be substantially up,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cLabour can tap into that at the right time. Trying to be too sharply political at this time when people are very anxious about their security, housing and income and their health would be wrong and I think Labour has got the tone right.\u201d<br></p>",

The government has tried to respond but it has no idea of the scale of the problem it is going to have to deal with. We make some back-of-the-envelope calculations and they are scary,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Making the assessment alongside David Bell, an economist at the University of Stirling, the former Threadneedle Street policymaker said the collapse in activity amid Covid-19 and the accompanying rise in unemployment looked to be at least 10 times faster than in the recession triggered by the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>The economists said that while government support in Britain for companies to furlough workers could help to cushion the blow, unemployment would still soar. While joblessness would rapidly rise, they cautioned it was uncertain how long the impact would last and how quickly unemployment would come down. During the Great Depression, records show unemployment hit 24.9% in the US and 15.4% in the UK over several years.</p> <p>The warning shot for the two economies comes as business activity in Britain and the eurozone plunges to the lowest levels since the start of closely watched surveys more than two decades ago and as unemployment in the US begins to rise.</p> <p>According to the latest snapshots from the purchasing managers indices (PMI), which are based on surveys of business activity, the private sector economy in the UK and the eurozone collapsed in March at the fastest pace since records began in the late 1990s.</p> <p>The US economy also shed 701,000 jobs, according to March data, far more than the 100,000 fall expected on average by economists. The unemployment rate rose to 4.4%, up from 3.5% in February. Initial unemployment insurance figures, which come in advance of official figures, have suggested joblessness is already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/03/us-jobs-report-march-unemployment-coronavirus\">on track to reach more than 10 million</a>.</p> <p>Stock markets sold off on Friday as the prospect of lasting economic damage becomes increasingly clear.

  "<p>The clearing of ancient woods for HS2 is to proceed this month after the high court refused an emergency injunction and judicial review of the government\u2019s decision to proceed with the high-speed railway.</p> <p>HS2\u2019s felling of woodlands in spring when birds are nesting has been widely condemned by wildlife charities but the conservationist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/03/hs2-legal-challenge-launched-by-chris-packham\">Chris Packham\u2019s attempt</a> to halt \u201cenabling\u201d works was rejected after the court decided there was \u201cno real prospect of success\u201d for a judicial review.</p> <p>Two high court judges made the ruling after a one-day hearing held over video link, as bailiffs sought to evict <a href=\"https://hs2rebellion.org/\">protesters occupying treehouses</a> in Crackley Wood, Warwickshire.</p> <p>The hearing heard that it would cost \u00a320m\u2013\u00a325m to \u201cpress the pause button\u201d on HS2 while a full judicial review of the government\u2019s backing for the \u00a3106bn high-speed project could be considered.</p> <p>Timothy Mould QC, for the secretary of state for transport, said that cost would \u201ccome from the public purse. The court will not be seduced into treating that as an insignificant consideration.\u201d</p> <p>He argued that Packham and others had already had plenty of opportunity to make arguments about HS2\u2019s environmental impact while the railway was scrutinised by both chambers of parliament, which passed the act enabling HS2 in 2017.</p> <p>Packham, who crowdfunded \u00a3100,000 for the challenge, said: \u201cI\u2019m immensely disappointed on behalf of all the wildlife that will now be destroyed in the next few weeks and the irreversible damage to the woodlands. These trees are going to come crashing to the ground and all the birds nesting in them and bats roosting in them are going to die and nobody is going to know anything about it.</p> <p>\u201cOur nation will be robbed of some of our greatest national natural treasures over the next few days for an entirely fallacious vanity project.\u201d</p> <p>During the hearing, David Wolf QC, for Packham, argued that Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, was not given all the information required to make an informed decision on HS2 by the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oakervee-review-of-hs2\">Oakervee </a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oakervee-review-of-hs2\">review</a>, which was led by the former HS2 chair Doug Oakervee.</p> <p>He told the courts the works would cause \u201cirretrievable and irreversible\u201d harm to ancient woodlands. HS2 Ltd contractors are clearing trees and soil from five ancient woodlands in Warwickshire during April, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/01/betrayal-of-trust-hs2-criticised-over-removal-woodland-soils\">the Woodland Trust condemning the timing</a> and the RSPB warning that bird nests would almost certainly be destroyed.</p> <p>HS2 has said temporary exclusion zones are being put around all nests discovered by its ecologists until the chicks are fledged, and contractors were \u201ckeenly aware of the law around nesting birds\u201d.</p> <p>Wolf told the court that Oakervee\u2019s review failed to properly consider HS2\u2019s environmental impact or the railway being a net contributor to carbon emissions during construction. Wolf said the emissions produced by all the concrete required during construction would cause emissions of 8-14m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, which would contravene Britain\u2019s legal obligations to reduce its emissions under the Paris climate agreement.</p> <p>He argued that hearing the review would not unduly delay HS2 because if it was to abide by the law its contractors would not be able to continue with the clearance of ancient woodland. \u201cThis woodland will now already be full of nesting birds and it is a criminal offence to interfere with those nesting birds. Their ability to proceed in this [nesting season] period is already heavily compromised,\u201d he told the court.</p> <p>Dr Darren Moorcroft, the chief executive of the Woodland Trust, which provided an expert witness statement criticising HS2\u2019s \u201ctranslocation\u201d of ancient woodland soils during April, said: \u201cTo say we are disappointed by this outcome is an understatement. This decision is catastrophic for these irreplaceable ancient woodlands and the hundreds of species that call them home. Instead if bursting into life they will now be destroyed. </p> <p>\u201cThe flawed and invariably unsuccessful process of translocation will be carried out at completely the wrong time of year, flying in the face of professional standards and HS2\u2019s original assurance that they\u2019d do it when they should \u2013 when everything is dormant. Nature and the environment are the big losers today.\u201d</p> <p>A Department for Transport spokesperson said: \u201cWe are pleased with today\u2019s verdict. While our current priority is combating the spread of coronavirus, we must continue our work to level up the country. HS2 will be crucial to that ambition, boosting capacity and connectivity across our rail network.</p> <p>\u201cWe have tasked HS2 Ltd with delivering one of the UK\u2019s most environmentally responsible infrastructure projects.\u201d</p> <p>Packham and his lawyers, Leigh Day, will be able to consider the grounds for an appeal when the judges publish their written reasons for the verdict on Monday.</p>",
  "<p>I became obsessed with the 1984 film The NeverEnding Story through the power of scrapbooking. Despite missing this meta-textual fairytale when it was released, someone in my family home had clipped out the black-and-white production stills presumably intended to jazz up the entertainment listings of our local paper. I then Pritt Sticked these contextless images into my jumbo movie scrapbook, which ended up being a NeverEnding Story fanzine because I never added anything else to it.</p> <p>I revered that tatty book. As the 1980s crawled onward in the sedate and rather culturally remote Scottish Borders where I grew up, I would periodically pore over these snapshots from an unknown fantasy world. They depicted a rock monster with a jutting Desperate Dan chin, a dapper adventurer in a top hat petting a giant snail and a wizened man with elven ears. This was the height of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/jul/13/no-more-nerds-how-dungeons-dragons-became-cool-stranger-things-game-of-thrones\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> mania, so it seemed reasonable to assume that this mismatched band would embark on a quest to retrieve the magical cauldron or whatever.</p> <p>Does this not ring any bells? Perhaps the overworked journalist who assembled those listings back in the day hadn\u2019t seen The NeverEnding Story, either. Certainly none of the images featured Bastian or Atreyo, the boyish heroes of the piece, nor Falkor, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QdLc9Fz4dI\">the giant dog-faced draught</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QdLc9Fz4dI\"> excluder</a> who swoops in to save them at vital moments. When I finally saw the film a few years later, it was a discombobulating experience. The plot, where the modern-day Bastian discovers his destiny is entwined with the fantasy book he is reading, was far removed from the story I had imagined.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeFni9dOv7c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UeFni9dOv7c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The NeverEnding Story has remained a personally memorable outlier in a crammed 1980s fantasy film canon that includes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/12/how-labyrinth-led-me-to-david-bowie\">Labyrinth</a>, Willow and the heroically naff Krull. Viewed from 2020, that magnificent cluster looks like the last starburst of pre-CGI practical magic, where allegorical realms were ingeniously magicked up from matte paintings, physical puppetry and the judicious deployment of dry ice. The NeverEnding Story even boasted a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2WN0T-Ee3q4\">title track synth-pop banger co-written by </a><a href=\"https://youtu.be/2WN0T-Ee3q4\">Giorgio Moroder</a>, a tinkly but potent earworm with a M\u00f6bius strip chorus that still feels as if it could loop back on itself for ever.</p> <p>So it felt a little weird to cue up the film on Netflix and revisit this dusty wing of my mind palace, albeit with a deeper appreciation of Moroder and armed with the knowledge that director Wolfgang Petersen was coming to this family-friendly project fresh off Das Boot. Turns out, The NeverEnding Story is still a florid but uneven quest, dense with lore about the world of Fantasia harvested from the source material \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2012/apr/01/review-neverending-story-michael-ende\">a bestselling children\u2019s book</a> by the German author Michael Ende \u2013 but confusingly framed by modern-day scenes of the bullied Bastian, who spends most of the time hiding out in his school\u2019s dusty attic hunched over his precious book.</p> <p>Now, as then, I wish I had that actual tome: it looks like the sort of fantasy doorstop that would have a detailed map of the lands of Fantasia in its endpapers, so it would be easier to figure out how the royal Ivory Tower geographically relates to the Desert of Shattered Hopes and the Swamps of Sadness. The fantastical characters I had fixated on all those years ago are still merely bit players: emissaries from the various compass points of Fantasia, comparable to the motley background patrons of the Mos Eisley cantina in Star Wars. (Although this time round it clicked that the dapper dude dressed like Willy Wonka is played by Deep Roy, who would go on to appear as multiple munchkins in Tim Burton films.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f1c00f38c20838705be2f4884aa1f2733d41322e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1c00f38c20838705be2f4884aa1f2733d41322e/0_93_1692_1195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barret Oliver in The NeverEnding Story.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barret Oliver as Bastian in The NeverEnding Story.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Constantin FILM</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The intervening years have not been kind to The NeverEnding Story. It feels like a grab-bag of well-worn ideas and obstacles as Atreyo tackles a fantasy-trope assault course in search of the higher learning that will defeat amorphous baddie the Nothing, a broiling black cloud apparently fuelled by apathy in the real world. Spoiler: in the end, Atreyo needs the fourth-wall-breaking help of Bastian himself.</p> <p>If it catches you in the right frame of mind, it might resonate as a metaphor about the hallowed power of stories. Watch it in snark mode and it feels like an overstretched Crystal Maze episode. Yet for all the dubbed dialogue, variable acting and wonky effects, it still contains one genuinely shattering sequence. The plucky warrior-teen Atreyo is leading his magnificent white stallion Artax through the Swamps of Sadness in search of an oracle. Under Fantasia\u2019s fairytale rules, this fetid slurry can claim any traveller who surrenders to its miasma of depression.</p> <p>For whatever reason, Artax gives up and begins to slowly sink into the peaty murk while an increasingly frantic Atreyo looks on. In an otherwise goofy fable, it is an emotionally scourging scene that seems to take forever. The previously dauntless Atreyo is inconsolable; his huddled reader-companion Bastian is in bits. And if the viewer isn\u2019t a little teary too, then the Nothing has already won. You may as well watch Krull instead.</p>",

We are called \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/1243594515677622274\">heroes</a>\u201d and finally being acknowledged as \u201c<a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/de-blasio-pauses-crackdown-e-bikes-covid-19\">essential</a>\u201d, but the truth is this job was never the first choice for many of us.</p> <p>For me, this job is a supplement to freelance writing; I decided to stop doing deliveries when the first few coronavirus cases were confirmed in New York. But others don\u2019t have that option. While writing this piece I spoke to workers aged 18 to 58, many of whom are pressing on in spite of unsafe conditions. There are many first-time delivery workers, laid off from other jobs, learning how to use the apps. No one is making a ton of money, and everyone is nervous.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019ve been doing this work for a day or a half decade: platforms like Grubhub, Uber Eats, Postmates and DoorDash (which recently purchased Caviar from Square) consider us \u201cindependent contractors\u201d and we are therefore not entitled to health insurance, worker\u2019s compensation, much less basic support from a human being. When the outbreak began, the apps simply sent out emails that sounded copy-and-pasted from the CDC (\u201cStay home and wash your hands!\u201d).</p> <p>Now, apparently worried about losing market share, the apps have temporarily waived <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-lockdowns-prompt-smaller-restaurants-to-rethink-delivery-11585743246\">commission fees</a> for restaurants and cut customers\u2019 <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/uber-eats-waives-delivery-fees-for-independent-restaurants-during-covid-19-pandemic/\">delivery fees</a> to zero. Yet they have offered no bonuses or hazard pay for workers \u2013 the assumption is that we are disposable. The farthest they have gone is to promise up to<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2020/03/17/coronavirus-doordash-postmates-couriers-keep-regular-rates/5060297002/\">two weeks\u2019 pay</a> if a worker presents proof of a Covid-19 diagnosis, something that is difficult to obtain even with obvious symptoms. Workers who have tried requesting payments say the process is <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/features/gig-workers-with-covid-19-symptoms-say-its-hard-to-get-sick-leave-from-uber-lyft-instacart/\">a nightmare</a>.</p> <p>In practice, our best hope is to be careful and pray. Volkan considers himself well prepared, thanks to an ample supply of face masks and gloves from his handyman work. But he is getting scared as he notices more and more couriers coughing and looking sick. Many don\u2019t have masks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/instacart-workers-risk-their-health-to-do-their-job\">Why is Instacart making its contract workers risk their health to do their job? | Sarah Polito</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even with protective gear, delivering food to a locked-down city has become total chaos. Demand is surging from the millions of New Yorkers suddenly forced to stay home, yet restaurants are severely short-staffed. Recently, Volkan was assigned to pick up food from a trendy West Village eatery that had begun offering delivery during the lockdown. Upon arrival he saw <a href=\"https://ny.eater.com/2020/3/23/21190803/carbone-crowds-nyc-delivery-takeout-coronavirus\">dozens of couriers crowded together</a> on the sidewalk, and inside, what appeared to be a single cook, struggling to handle hundreds of orders. Volkan waited an hour for the order before police came and ordered everyone to disperse. The restaurant canceled all the orders and Volkan was not paid. He just moved on.</p> <p>The apps have hyped up a new \u201c<a href=\"https://www.delish.com/food-news/a31469056/coronavirus-food-delivery-non-contact-policies/\">no-contact</a>\u201d delivery option, which allows couriers to leave food in a building\u2019s lobby to encourage physical distancing. But not all customers abide by it, or appreciate it. After completing one no-contact delivery recently, Volkan said he received a call from the customer, cursing at him. \u201cHe screamed, \u2018You son of a bitch, do your job properly!\u2019 It was my first time getting that in five years.\u201d</p> <p>Usually, high demand means more orders, which for couriers means more earnings. But since the outbreak, Volkan has accepted multiple orders only to discover upon arriving that the requested restaurant was shuttered. With no way to cancel in-progress deliveries using his Caviar app, he has had to message a support agent to request the cancellation \u2013 a process which usually takes minutes, but during the pandemic has taken as long as four hours, preventing new orders from being sent in the meantime. Once, out of desperation, he rode his bike empty-handed to the customer\u2019s address and marked the order \u201cdelivered\u201d just so he could continue working. \u201cI called the customer; I\u2019m like, look, I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re not going to get your order. Please contact Caviar.\u201d</p> <p>Most worryingly, hygiene has proven surprisingly difficult. Despite the pandemic, restaurants have been refusing to allow couriers to wash their hands in the sink. To make do, Volkan traded some of his face masks with another delivery worker for some hand sanitizer the other worker had ordered through DoorDash. DoorDash charged the worker $5 for shipping (<a href=\"https://payup.wtf/blog/doordash-hand-sanitizer\">other workers have been charged $10-$40</a>). \u201cThe bottles were so small,\u201d Volkan said. \u201cIt\u2019s so cheap\u2026 but they want the five dollars. They got to make a profit off of everyone.\u201d I contacted Grubhub, Postmates, Square, and Doordash for comment but did not receive a response before publication. A spokesperson for Uber Eats acknowledged the virus was \u201cespecially concerning for people who drive and deliver with Uber. In these difficult times, their well-being is at the top of our minds, and we have a dedicated team working around the clock to support them the very best we can.\u201d</p> <p>According to some estimates, on-demand food is set to be a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/the-hidden-cost-of-food-delivery/\">$385b</a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/the-hidden-cost-of-food-delivery/\">n industry</a> by the end of this decade. <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-food-delivery-stocks-roll-145502384.html\">Grubhub\u2019s stock</a> has jumped nearly 33% since the announcement of New York City\u2019s lockdown; DoorDash has recently <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/doordash-13b-demand-food-delivery-145852606.html\">filed for an IPO</a>, with a pre-pandemic valuation of $13bn. In a call with shareholders on 19 March \u2013 when two hundred people in the United States had died from the virus \u2013 Uber\u2019s chief executive, Dana Khosrowshahi, said the company\u2019s Eats business was growing and revealed Uber had a $10bn pile of unrestricted cash. \u201cIn any crisis, liquidity is key,\u201d he said. The day after the call, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/19/uber-stock-pops-after-saying-worst-of-coronavirus-fallout-is-behind-it.html\">Uber\u2019s stock </a><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/19/uber-stock-pops-after-saying-worst-of-coronavirus-fallout-is-behind-it.html\">jumped 40%</a>.</p> <p>That financial firepower has not been deployed for us. Instead, we are fed hazy rhetoric. According to Doordash, \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/DoorDash/status/1241120122120450049\">We\u2019re all in this together</a>\u201d (until you want benefits; then you\u2019re an independent contractor).

This isn\u2019t helpful. As the pandemic continues to worsen, it is a matter of certainty that delivery workers will get sick \u2013 and it\u2019s more than likely that some of us will die.

The anxiety they feel around this issue is hardly surprising when the world we work in has changed so dramatically in just a month.

We have been hearing concerns from people \u2013 not only doctors \u2013 about their access to PPE, and launched a <a href=\"https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/ppe-now\">campaign</a> earlier this week demanding goggles, masks, gowns and gloves in line with World Health Organization recommendations for all healthcare staff. More than 35,000 staff have signed our petition.</p> <p>We welcome <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-personal-protective-equipment-ppe-guidance-for-nhs-teams\">government guidance issued </a>yesterday to help clarify previous advice that had left many confused. Now all staff working within close proximity of patients with coronavirus are recommended to wear goggles. Previously, hardly anyone had been recommended to wear eye protection. Government advice regarding masks continues to reflect and, in areas deemed high-risk due to frequent use of aerosol-generating procedures, even exceeds the advice from the WHO. However, we are concerned that Public Health England has not gone far enough.</p> <p>For example, WHO advises the use of long-sleeved gowns for anyone directly caring for patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus. PHE continues to advise the use of a flimsy plastic apron. The most common form of transmission of the virus is through contact. GPs on home visits along with other workers undertaking care in the community, such as paramedics and district nurses, must enter people\u2019s homes with these aprons, and it is suggested that they scrub their arms up to the elbows, which can be impractical. We know the virus is carried on clothing, and anyone who has worn these aprons knows that their underlying clothes are not protected when reaching over to listen to the chest or feeling the tummy of an unwell person.</p> <p>Moving beyond arguments in favour of gowns, we are hearing from members and other allied health professionals that people working on the front line do not even have access to the level of PPE prescribed<strong> </strong>by the government. GPs are going out to DIY stores to buy their own masks and goggles. Cleaners are being told they do not need masks despite working in high-risk areas, and nurses are being bullied by managers for raising concerns.</p> <p>While PPE is a vital element of our protection, it is also part of broader infection-control measures within and outside of the NHS. Evidence suggests healthcare workers are as likely to contract coronavirus in the community as we are to at work, and so it is vital that we all continue to follow the strict social distancing and hand-hygiene advice recommended by PHE.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/doctors-nurses-lack-of-equipment-johnson-government\">Doctors and nurses are dying for lack of equipment.

But before you can start using an oven liner you have to start off with a clean oven.\u201d</p> <p>You can go for a heavy-duty oven cleaner, but many people are put off by the harsh chemicals these contain. \u201cOther people swear by using bicarbonate of soda in a paste, which I have never really had much success with, especially if you are battling a really grimy oven.\u201d</p> <p>Bray takes out racks and leaves them to soak in a bath of very hot, soapy water. \u201cWashing-up liquid is one of the best things for tackling grease. Slowly, little and often, work on the bottom of the oven \u2013 even in 15-minute slots.\u201d Wait until after you have used the oven, and it has cooled but is still warm. \u201cUse hot, soapy water and a cloth, and every time you use the oven go in there, go at it and eventually you\u2019ll start to see a difference.\u201d</p> <p>To clean a microwave, slice up a lemon and put it in a bowl of water. \u201cPut it in for five minutes at full power,\u201d says Lynsey Crombie, AKA <a href=\"https://queenofclean.blog/\">the Queen of Clean</a> and author of The Easy Life: Quick Ways to Clean and Manage Your Home All Year Round.

Wipe the inside of the fridge with water and a microfibre cloth \u2013 you don\u2019t really want to be introducing much in the way of products. The drip tray at the back can get clogged up, maybe with bits of labels from jars. Get a cotton bud, put some kitchen roll round it and dab in and out of the hole to keep it free-flowing.\u201d</p> <p>If you can manage, pull the fridge out and clean behind it. \u201cThat\u2019s when you discover you\u2019ve got mice, or you\u2019ve had mice \u2013 you\u2019ll see droppings,\u201d says MacKenzie.

Scoop it out with rubber-gloved hands, or \u201cplunge\u201d it down the U-bend with a toilet brush. \u201cPut some limescale-removing product down there and leave overnight.\u201d Denture tablets or soda crystals will also work. But Crombie cautions: \u201cIf you put it down and someone uses the toilet within half an hour, you\u2019re not giving it an opportunity to work. The reason I don\u2019t advise bleach is it doesn\u2019t break limescale down. It will look better, but in a few days it will come back.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Get a sparkling shower</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI use a 50/50 ratio of white vinegar and water solution in an old spray bottle,\u201d says Bray. \u201cIt helps to tackle the limescale and dirt. If you\u2019ve got a clogged-up showerhead \u2013 check first it won\u2019t damage the surface \u2013 you can sit it in a white-vinegar solution. I try to use as few chemicals as possible in the house.\u201d</p> <p>For the black mould spots around the silicone, \u201cget some tissue paper and soak it in a bleach solution\u201d. Your shower curtain can probably go in the washing machine \u2013 check the label \u2013 as can a non-slip bathmat. \u201cThey can go a bit gunky underneath, but they come out like new.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Wonderful windows</strong></h2> <p>Shop-bought window cleaning products or vinegar will work on the glass. \u201cIf you have UPVC frames, use a cream cleaner or a damp sponge with bicarbonate of soda on,\u201d says Crombie. \u201cFor wooden, painted windows, dry dust them then clean with an orange-oil-based product, to protect the wood. Don\u2019t forget to clean the handle \u2013 just use what you\u2019ve been using on the frame.\u201d Vacuum your curtains, and wipe blinds.</p> <h2><strong>Tackle the junk drawer</strong></h2> <p>This is the time to be ruthless. Empty it out, says MacKenzie. Give the inside of the drawer a vacuum and a wipe with a damp cloth. Then \u201conly put back the things you use. If you think: \u2018I might need that one day,\u2019 no, you won\u2019t because you haven\u2019t used it in the last year. I used to have a dish full of keys and I never knew what they were for. One day I just threw them away. Did I come to any grief? No.\u201d Rehome items to the places they belong.</p> <h2><strong>Under the bed</strong></h2> <p>Remove whatever it is you are storing under your bed and clean off the dust (there will be a thick layer), then vacuum underneath. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to flip your mattress if it needs it,\u201d says Crombie. \u201cGive it a vacuum.\u201d If you have a steam cleaner, use this too. \u201cHold the steamer 30cm away from the mattress \u2013 people go too close and get the mattress wet and then they can\u2019t go to bed. Leave the window open so the mattress can dry. If you have stains on your mattress, a carpet-cleaning product should get them off.\u201d</p> <p>She recommends a homemade fabric freshener: 20 teaspoons of bicarbonate of soda and 20 drops of lavender essential oil in a 500ml bottle of water. \u201cJust spritz it on.\u201d Pillows can usually be washed \u2013 check the instructions.</p> <h2><strong>Walls, ceilings and doors</strong></h2> <p>Wallpaper, particularly if it hasraised patterns, can benefit from a vacuum. \u201cGently go over it with a brush attachment, or with a dry microfibre cloth or paintbrush,\u201d says Crombie. \u201cIf you have a flat-headed mop, use that to dry-dust your ceiling.\u201d While you are at it, use a brush (a clean paintbrush, or old makeup brush) to dust light fittings.</p> <p>Although some paint is washable, Crombie says she wouldn\u2019t recommend it, \u201cbut you can dry-dust\u201d. For marks, use a <a href=\"https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/best-magic-eraser/\">Magic Eraser or similar,</a> or get a sponge and gently wipe. Don\u2019t forget doors, particularly those with dirt-attracting panels, and frames. \u201cI use warm soapy water, and dry it instantly with a clean dry microfibre cloth.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Spruce up your sofa and soft furnishings</strong></h2> <p>If you are spending a lot more time on the sofa, you may as well improve your environment. Give it a thorough vacuum, including in the crevices and under the seat pads. \u201cGet a damp microfibre cloth and gently rub at any stains,\u201d says MacKenzie. \u201cIf you have ingrained dirt, borrow a steam cleaner. Check the labels of your cushion covers \u2013 some can be washed. I wouldn\u2019t wash feathered cushion pads, but most are synthetic fibres so follow the washing instructions.\u201d Pull out the sofa and vacuum underneath. \u201cBehind it, you\u2019ll see a massive layer of dust on the skirting board. That\u2019s where a lot of dust mites are.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Clean your clean</strong><strong>ing tools</strong></h2> <p>Finally, give your cleaning tools some attention. \u201cString mops give me the heebie-jeebies,\u201d says MacKenzie. \u201cA much better mop is a flat-headed one, with a cloth pad you take off after each time you wash your floor and stick in the washing machine. I wash my dustpan brush in the kitchen sink and dry it outside.\u201d</p> <p>Show your vacuum cleaner some love. Many have washable filters; the brush head will probably be clogged with hair. \u201cGet a small pair of scissors and snip right down the middle [of the tightly rolled hair]. It takes a while but it\u2019s terribly satisfying.\u201d</p> <p>Bray uses a new dishcloth each day and saves them up until they can go in the washing machine on a hot wash. But she cautions against overdoing it. On her 100,000-strong Facebook group, \u201ca lot of them are prone to overcleaning. I always tell people just do what you need to do and don\u2019t feel you have to be cleaning all day, because otherwise it can turn into a bit of an unhealthy obsession.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Swearing on air is no longer offensive to the British public, the television and radio regulator has concluded, after finding that complaints regarding on-air cursing have halved in five years.</p> <p>Ofcom research found widespread agreement among the British public that societal norms around offence have shifted in recent years, with audiences particularly forgiving of accidental mild on-air swearing, such as when the ITV political editor, Robert Peston, <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/robert-peston-coronavirus-press-conference_uk_5e7ce760c5b6cb9dc19c6873\">recently blurted out</a> \u201coh shit\u201d during a recent Downing Street press conference on the coronavirus.</p> <p>British audiences are more concerned about content that could incite hatred or target specific groups.

Other concerns were around foreign-language satellite stations that incite religious hatred and are aimed at minority audiences in the UK \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/15/uk-based-tv-station-channel-44-fined-anti-ahmadi-muslim-hate-speech\">a regular issue for the media regulator</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"021cc76f9645483a4174eaca6a5a8c008890f66e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/021cc76f9645483a4174eaca6a5a8c008890f66e/0_100_3000_1800/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Naked Attraction, presented by Anna Richardson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Naked Attraction, presented by Anna Richardson, would have been unthinkable a few years ago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachel Joseph/CHANNEL 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The report also found that the British public were \u201cworried about coming across offensive or harmful content unexpectedly\u201d on unregulated streaming sites such as YouTube, which is not covered by Ofcom\u2019s broadcasting code.</p> <p>Adults were found to be more comfortable about unregulated paid-for streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video having fewer rules than broadcast TV and radio: \u201cThis was because they felt they had an active choice in selecting content and were therefore more in control on these platforms.\u201d</p> <p>Tony Close, Ofcom\u2019s director of content standards, said the research was about understanding how the British public\u2019s attitudes had changed when it came to enforcing standards.</p> <p>He said: \u201cA dating show entirely premised on full-frontal nudity [Naked Attraction], even post-watershed, was once unthinkable. Nasty Nick\u2019s dastardly deeds in the first series of Big Brother, which offended many in 2000, would seem less remarkable now after two more decades of reality TV. And racial stereotypes that were a feature of some comedy shows in the 70s and 80s are unacceptable to modern audiences and society.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Easter: hard to get your head around it in these strange times. Normally, it\u2019s second only to Christmas in terms of family get-togethers, but this year, small groups of us will be sitting it out at home, some even on our own, though hopefully not without good food on the table. And wine \u2013 yes, for heaven\u2019s sake, WINE.</p> <p>Even though food and wine matching is my thing, I\u2019m not going to suggest any clever-clever food pairings at this time. Drink whatever wine you enjoy and that makes you feel good. That said, Easter is relatively late this year, so we are firmly into spring, which, to my mind at least, means lighter wines, possibly even ros\u00e9 if you\u2019ve got an outdoor space in which to enjoy it. Personally, I like the exotically lush <strong><a href=\"https://www.aldi.co.uk/pedro-luis-monastrell-ros%C3%A9/p/702622365522900\" title=\"\">Pedro Luis Monastrell</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.aldi.co.uk/pedro-luis-monastrell-ros%C3%A9/p/702622365522900\" title=\"\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.aldi.co.uk/pedro-luis-monastrell-ros%C3%A9/p/702622365522900\" title=\"\">Ros\u00e9 2019</a> </strong>(\u00a35.99 Aldi, 12.5%), Spain\u2019s version of mourv\u00e8dre, which tastes oddly but deliciously like ripe nectarines.</p> <p>There\u2019s a lot to be said for the comfortingly familiar at such times: grape varieties such as chardonnay and merlot that were popular for a reason but simply fell out of fashion, say; and classic wines such as rioja and red bordeaux, which are both good with lamb. There\u2019s a role for well-known names at these moments, just as the word Heinz on a can of soup or beans offers comforting reassurance. You pay a bit more, but it\u2019s a faithful old friend.</p> <p>Supermarkets, of course, have special offers to tempt you (Waitrose is selling the very decent <strong><a href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/terre-di-vita-organic-pinot-grigio-terre-siciliane-igp/821249-700894-700895\" title=\"\">Terre di Vita Organic Pinot Grigio</a></strong> for \u00a35.99 at the moment), and has taken on new stocks after that dead period between January and March, the wine world\u2019s equivalent of the hungry gap.</p> <p>In addition to the ros\u00e9 above, I was particularly impressed by Aldi\u2019s range at the last tasting I went to before full lockdown. There\u2019s another in my recommendations below.</p> <p>Please also try to support your local shops, producers and small online independent businesses who are finding life desperately hard. If you can buy wine from a local winery (or beer from a local brewery), do it.</p> <p>At the time of writing, some restaurants and wine bars that are unable to trade and have an off-licence are selling direct, while most local wine shops will deliver even if they\u2019ve had to close their doors \u2013 though the situation is constantly changing. If they\u2019re not already offering a delivery service, just ask.</p> <h2>Four bottles with a feelgood factor</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"dhshd\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 12px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a38efb4bed2f6a4e226b967164a0e3344931c311\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a38efb4bed2f6a4e226b967164a0e3344931c311/0_0_1000_1000/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Aldi Exquisite Collection Padthaway Chardonnay 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.aldi.co.uk/exquisite-padthaway-chardonnay/p/053821305865900\" title=\"\">Aldi Exquisite Collection Padthaway Chardonnay </a>2018</strong></p> <p>\u00a35.99 , 13.5%.<br>Lush, creamy, comforting: will rub along seductively with anything from roast chicken to fish pie.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"spacer with line\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 32px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"64c17a83f6e9eb47b4e8638cd148a9e3c26ba8c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64c17a83f6e9eb47b4e8638cd148a9e3c26ba8c3/0_0_1000_1000/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Fitz sparkling wine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.fitz.wine/collections/\">Fitz sparkling wine</a></strong></p> <p>\u00a322 or \u00a3120 for a case of six, 12%. <br>Really appealing.

  "<p>Law graduates training to become barristers have called on regulators to cancel face-to-face exams, which have been delayed until August, and to swiftly move assessments online instead.</p> <p>The Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC) is one of the last remaining courses where students must still sit exams in person, as regulators insist they are needed to <a href=\"https://www.barstandardsboard.org.uk/training-qualification/becoming-a-barrister/vocational-component/covid-19-and-the-vocational-component-faqs.html\">uphold the</a> \u201chigh standards and integrity\u201d of the degree.</p> <p>But students say that the Bar Standards Board (BSB), which regulates the exams, must prioritise student wellbeing during the unprecedented global pandemic.</p> <p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pVf8Gj0ahQ4L6YrYL9flBH7XUxlQuDlGlrHb-fqNv-Q/edit\">In an open letter</a>, signed by 200 BPTC trainees, they urge the BSB to rethink its stance. \u201cIn an extraordinary time of a global pandemic [...] It is essential that the BSB considers [the] human impact, and [...] make adjustments to the format of the exams,\u201d they said.</p> <p>Universities across the country, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/21/oxbridge-to-replace-summer-exams-with-online-assessments-due-to-coronavirus\">including Oxford and Cambridge</a>, have already said they will replace traditional undergraduate exams with online assessments. At Imperial College London medical students have also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-forces-medical-students-sit-final-exams-online\">taken unsupervised exams</a> at home for the first time.</p> <p>If the pandemic has not eased by August, sitting exams in person could put students \u2013 particularly those with underlying health conditions \u2013 at risk. International students who have left the UK may also be unable to sit exams in August, students say, and it could make it difficult for others to begin their pupillage and effectively start their careers.</p> <p>Alex Mullen, a law student at BPP University Law School, says it would be a financial struggle for him to sit face-to-face exams in August. \u201cI have a scholarship designed to pay for my course and the costs of living until the end of the course, which is now longer than when they thought it would be. My tenancy also ends in August, so I could have to find somewhere to live for two weeks in the middle of what is going to be a really stressful exam season,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Robert Harris, a student at City Law school, says the situation is tense. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to overplay our concerns and we recognise this is a difficult time for everyone and others have it worse, but still these are real concerns. For me, the key impact is on when I\u2019ll be able to start my pupillage. It seems strange that the Bar course is the only one to say [moving assessments online is] not possible.\u201d</p> <p>The BSB says it is exploring a range of contingency plans if restrictions remain in place in August. \u201cWe are very conscious that this is a difficult and uncertain time for students,\u201d it said in a comment. \u201cHowever, there is no secure solution that could be put in place by April to enable us to deliver these exams as normal. The next scheduled opportunity is August and that is what we are working toward.\u201d</p> <p>However, the Bar Council says it sees \u201cno reason\u201d why exams must be face-to-face in August and that it is \u201cconcerned\u201d that this is \u201cnot the best solution\u201d. \u201cIt creates delay and uncertainty for students. It means students will be sitting exams long after their teaching has finished, and very close to the time when their pupillages would start. And it is unclear how resits can be accommodated,\u201d Nicholas Vineall QC, Chair of the Bar Council\u2019s education and training committee, says. \u201cIt ought to be possible to arrange for these exams to be taken online.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere in the legal profession, the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) rowed back on plans to delay exams until the Autumn, after students urged the regulator to rethink. They have since asked universities to send proposals on how they would like to do exams instead. \u201cThey haven\u2019t said what online things must be used, they\u2019re just saying \u2018tell us what you want to do and we\u2019ll consider it\u2019,\u201d Charlotte Parkinson, Chair of the Junior Lawyers Division of the Law Society, says.</p> <p>Legal education is often traditional and slow to adopt online practices. However, individual lecturers are working hard to set up online learning and assessments, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/25/its-a-nightmare-how-coronavirus-is-wreaking-havoc-on-students-exams\">similarly to academics teaching other subjects</a>.</p> <p>Alan East, an assistant professor at Coventry Law School, says the pandemic has meant exams have gone online at Coventry. He has also connected with students over Zoom and Microsoft Teams. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to push this over the past couple of years and it has been quite slow but I think this period of being confined to our houses and having to do things online will move things along a bit,\u201d he says. \u201cLaw has begun to modernise.\u201d</p> <p>Students say regulators must be creative and find modern solutions, too.</p> <p><br></p>",

One, a Chinese machine, sold for \u00a312,800 on 26 March.</p> \n<p>The seller, who appears to specialise in second-hand TV parts and mobile phones, had previously received negative eBay reviews including one that warned \u201cdo not buy from this guy\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Guardian found a retailer in China selling the same kind of ventilator for $2,100 (\u00a31,609), a fraction of the eBay price.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1941a05967183f5a1d3adbebf31ed3e13acd486c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1941a05967183f5a1d3adbebf31ed3e13acd486c/0_0_707_249/500..jpg\" alt=\"Screengrab of the eBay listing\" width=\"500\" height=\"176\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Screengrab of the eBay listing</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Various</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A spokesperson for eBay confirmed the item had been purchased and said if it does not arrive the buyer will be entitled to a refund. A second listing offering an identical machine from the same seller was removed permanently from the site as it was in breach of its medical devices policy and restrictions have now been placed on the seller\u2019s account.</p> \n<p>Another Chinese\u2013made ventilator was sold on eBay for \u00a38,790 on 20 March. Records suggest that vendor previously sold mobile phone cases before turning to antibacterial wipes. eBay said the seller had provided documentation to justify the sale, and had subsequently cancelled the transaction due to \u201clow stock\u201d. It said the buyer had received a full refund.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are monitoring listings in this category extremely closely,\u201d said an eBay spokesperson. \u201cIf any listings are found to be in breach of our policies we will take the necessary action, which can include account suspension.\u201d</p> \n<p>The pandemic has led to a flurry of activity on Facebook. The platform pledged on 19 March to introduce a global ban on adverts for and sales of coronavirus-related products including test kits, masks, hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes. </p> \n<p>While Facebook has been rapidly removing paid advertising on the platform, it appears to have allowed some pages that produce banned ads to remain live, allowing sellers to continue promoting their products. On one morning this week, searches revealed 17 Facebook pages hawking Covid-19 test kits and 18 pages selling other forbidden products.</p> \n<p>The Facebook pages either promote products, link to external websites where they can be bought, or give phone numbers and other means of contact for vendors. One popular Facebook page, called Covid-19 Tests, which had 5,000 likes, offered visitors a dialogue box to contact the seller. </p> \n<p>The vendor responded to one message saying they had sold out but added: \u201cWill have more stock end week, I will send you a link. How many kits did you want?\u201d</p> \n<p>After being alerted by the Guardian, Facebook began deleting such pages as well as paid adverts. \u201cFacebook is focused on preventing the exploitation of this crisis for financial gain,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson said. \u201cWe have removed millions of ads, posts, pages and Marketplace listings for the sale of masks, hand sanitiser, surface disinfecting wipes and Covid-19 test kits, including all of those shared with us by the Guardian.\u201d </p> \n<p>The MHRA is particularly worried about sales of rapid testing kits, which take 10 minutes and do not require laboratory analysis. They look similar to pregnancy test sticks and use a drop of blood taken from a finger prick to measure the presence of antibodies. Certain antibodies are a strong indication of whether a person has previously contracted Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Some test kits claim to have a CE (Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne) mark that denotes the product was approved by regulators. However, guidance issued by Public Health England states: \u201cThere are no CE-marked tests for home use and it is illegal to supply such products.\u201d</p> \n<p>These appear to be the tests that were being sold by Beaini, the Bradford GP, via a website that had no contact name, no phone number and no email or postal address. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"731e648f509e48a12aa904c627551d547b128ab8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/731e648f509e48a12aa904c627551d547b128ab8/0_124_4340_2604/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Youssef Beaini\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Youssef Beaini said: \u2018We will get all the pages deleted and taken down so that no illegal activity can occur.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bonds Clinic</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Facebook page promoting Beaini\u2019s kits was also anonymous.

  "<p>The trump card of Donald Trump was always going to be the economy. If it wasn\u2019t the job market, it was the stock market. You could read it every day in his endless, mindless tweeting or the oh-so-subtle briefings of his campaign aides. November was going to be all about the economy, stupid.</p> <p>Having ripped off so much of Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1980s paraphernalia \u2013 including <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/make-america-great-again-who-said-it-first-n645716\">the slogan</a> he now claims to have invented himself \u2013 Trump was all set to ask the voters the same question that Reagan posed just before his own re-election: are you better off than you were four years ago?</p> <p>For an astonishingly large number of Americans, their answer is a deafeningly loud no. For almost everyone else, the answer is soon to be no.</p> <p>This week\u2019s unemployment numbers have taken the same rocket-ship trajectory as the number of coronavirus cases. Last week it was a record 3.3 million new claims; this week it doubled to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economy\">another 6.65 million new claims</a>. That\u2019s almost 10 million newly unemployed Americans: more than the previous 10 months combined.</p> <p>Experts already believe that the unemployment rate has jumped from historic lows of 3.5% to numbers we haven\u2019t seen since the Great Depression of around 17%. You don\u2019t need to be an expert to know we have yet to reach peak pain.</p> <p>We can argue about what number represents the greatest suffering in this pandemic: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">number of the victims</a> or the unemployed. Each one of the people affected \u2013 by the virus and by the virus-led recession \u2013 is more important to consider than the fate of one man watching cable television in the White House.</p> <p>But we also need to talk about the carnival barker who played a businessman on reality TV for a few years. Because we have never seen someone more ill-suited for leadership at a time of crisis. The history books tell us about Herbert Hoover\u2019s failures to intervene to stop the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/21/100-years-on-another-great-depression-coronavirus-fiscal-response\">Great Depression</a>. They tell us about James Buchanan\u2019s support for slavery and his failure to head off the secession of the slave states.</p> <p>Still, Trump stands alone: an incredibly shrinking man who looks and sounds smaller as the numbers of dead and unemployed grow ever larger. Even George W Bush\u2019s epically disastrous war in Iraq pales into insignificance. More Americans have died from this pandemic than in Bush\u2019s war of choice: more than 6,000 dead at the most recent <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">count</a>.</p> <p>Before the revisionists <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/us/politics/hannity-limbaugh-trump-coronavirus.html\">try too hard</a> to make us forget, Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">leadership</a> as the virus spread was as loud as a red cap perched on an orange combover. He abolished the pandemic group inside his own national security council, set aside the pandemic playbook left by his predecessor, and proposed <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-cut-cdcs-budget-democrats-claim-analysis/story?id=69233170\">cutting the CDC\u2019s funding</a> at the very moment the pandemic was taking hold. He spent February pretending like the pandemic was a <a href=\"https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-kag-rally-north-charleston-south-carolina-february-28-2020\">hoax</a> or would <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/11/politics/fact-check-trump-administration-coronavirus-28-dishonest/index.html\">disappear</a>, and spent March telling governors to fend for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-respirators.html\">themselves</a>.</p> <p>So how did he respond to the worst weekly unemployment claims in American history? By changing the subject to the oil industry, suggesting that the Saudis and Russians might just be cutting production. As he bizarrely <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1245720677660925952\">tweeted</a> to a shell-shocked nation, \u201cIf it happens, will be GREAT for the oil &amp; gas industry.\u201d</p> <p>Only this sociopath of a president could imagine that what\u2019s good for the oil industry is good for the souls of 10 million newly unemployed Americans.</p> <p>Later in the day, at his so-called press briefing, he said he knew \u201cbetter than anybody\u201d what people were suffering in the restaurant business. His cure is to allow corporations to make their restaurant expenses deductible from their taxes. If only people were going to work and having boozy business lunches, this might just be an idea worth throwing in the trash can. Instead, it\u2019s yet another presidential brain fart.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve learned so much, <em>so much</em>, that we really have a chance to be bigger and better and stronger,\u201d he concluded, treating the epic disasters of the pandemic and recession as just one more lesson in his on-the-job training course.</p> <p>Sadly Trump\u2019s capacity to learn is far smaller than the economy\u2019s capacity to shed jobs. So we have stimulus cash designed to help people through the worst of the pandemic arriving not this month, or next, or the one after that. Some people won\u2019t receive the help until September, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/irs-to-begin-issuing-1200-coronavirus-payments-april-9-but-some-americans-wont-receive-checks-until-september-agency-plan-says/2020/04/02/8e0cfc84-751e-11ea-85cb-8670579b863d_story.html\">internal documents</a> from the Internal Revenue Service.</p> <p>How could we face such a botched preparation for a pandemic and such a botched response to a recession?

Demonstrating the full scope of his leadership skills, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/02/politics/trump-schumer-letter-politics/index.html\">Trump wrote a letter</a> that ran the gamut of his emotions from infantile to childish.</p> <p>\u201cIf you spent less time on your ridiculous impeachment hoax, which went haplessly on forever and ended up going nowhere (except increasing my poll numbers),\u201d he wrote, \u201cand instead focused on helping the people of New York, then New York would not have been so completely unprepared for the \u2018invisible enemy.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to haplessly going on forever, Trump may be something of an expert. It makes up for his lack of expertise in preparing for the invisible enemy that everyone but Trump could actually see coming.</p> <p>Now the man who could not prepare for one pandemic disaster is even less prepared for the economic disaster unfolding at the same time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-economic-crisis-financial-impact\">How do countries differ in their response to the coronavirus economic crisis? | Ricardo Reis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Back in the late stages of the 2008 election, in the middle of the financial collapse, then-candidate Barack Obama was stunned to hear the economists\u2019 projections of 10% unemployment. \u201cWe\u2019ll have riots on the streets if that happens,\u201d one of his closest aides said in disbelief at the time.

  "<p>The world of energy generation has its established totems of sustainability. Solar panels, wind turbines \u2013 to many they seem beyond reproach. Yet for Jo Bandle, a process engineer at Atkins, the picture is more nuanced.</p> <p>\u201cLook at the waste you get from wind turbines,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of them only have a life expectancy of 20 years, so when they get decommissioned that waste has to go somewhere. And think of the sheer numbers of them.\u201d</p> <p>Bandle, who specialises in nuclear power projects, knows her viewpoint is not an easy sell. \u201cPeople are quick to see the negatives of nuclear and not the positives, but none of the renewables are wholly positive,\u201d she says. The lifespan of Hinkley Point C, in Somerset, which Bandle works on, will be 60 years, during which time it will power about 6m homes \u2013 equivalent to about 8,000 turbines.</p> <p>Bandle, deputy lead of systems design, points out that the nuclear power industry has come a long way in terms of sustainability, purely by designing with decommissioning in mind. \u201cToday\u2019s fleet can be decommissioned more easily. Forty years ago, people didn\u2019t think about that. Nowadays, a huge amount of thinking goes into how we will decommission, how we will minimise waste \u2013 that is at the forefront of the design and planning.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a philosophy that\u2019s shared across the Atkins workforce. Kristina Parry, who works on building developments as an interior designer, has seen how sustainability is considered at every juncture of a scheme \u2013 even in terms of choosing a site that promotes greener behaviour from its eventual occupants. \u201cWe think about the location, ask how people will get to the site. We\u2019ll check that there are existing transport links, so people aren\u2019t forced to drive, and we\u2019ll assess the local facilities.\u201d</p> <p>The building itself then needs to be fit for purpose \u2013 and part of that is promoting a more environmentally conscious working life. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk with the architects to make sure we have the right rooms with the right adjacency for how people are going to use the spaces,\u201d says Parry. \u201cIf we\u2019re designing an office, for example, we\u2019ll design in videoconferencing facilities. That means the end users can have a more sustainable approach to meetings, rather than travelling to other sites unnecessarily.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2e189e52dfd32a9607fe4bfa9e92099a6c9c1844\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e189e52dfd32a9607fe4bfa9e92099a6c9c1844/0_333_4000_5000/800.jpg\" alt=\" Supporting-key projects-WOODCOTE3 (2)\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Atkins\u2019 new Epsom office has been awarded a Breeam excellent rating.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Atkins</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even the finishing materials that give a building its aesthetic are scrutinised from an environmental perspective: \u201cWe are always mindful of making sure they have as minimal an environmental impact as possible, be it where they\u2019ve come from, what they\u2019re made from, or the impact on environmental air quality [from transporting them],\u201d she says.</p> <p>It\u2019s this focus on sustainability that helped Atkins bag a <a href=\"https://www.atkinsglobal.com/en-gb/media-centre/news-releases/2020/feb/2020-02-06\" rel=\"nofollow\">Breeam excellent rating</a> for its new office in Epsom, Surrey. \u201cEverything from the architecture to the interiors was done by the in-house team. It\u2019s an amazing place for staff to work,\u201d says Parry. For the Breeam assessment, a building is scrutinised in eight categories \u2013 with energy, materials, and health and wellbeing making up more than two thirds of the eventual score. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the physical buildings, but the social impact the surroundings have on staff, and on their physical wellbeing too.\u201d</p> <p>Buildings such as the new Epsom office set an important marker for what can be achieved. \u201cWe\u2019re flying the flag for environmental buildings by showing clients that they are achievable and can be done on time and on budget,\u201d says Parry. The recently opened <a href=\"https://www.e-architect.co.uk/england/bournemouth-university-poole-gateway-building\" rel=\"nofollow\">Poole Gateway building at Bournemouth University</a> \u2013 also rated excellent \u2013 is testament to what can be achieved when clients take that leap of faith.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re always looking to use the most advanced materials, to build renewable energy into a building\u2019s infrastructure. Quantity surveyors generally hate the design team because we want to spend so much money,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen clients start to look at the long-term benefits of switching materials or switching the building processes, or heating systems, the message starts to get through, but the initial expense is quite high. It\u2019s a battle to get that passed sometimes.

As former public health director Gabriel Scally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/england-public-health-coronavirus-cuts-regional\"> said earlier this week</a>, public health budgets have since been systematically raided in the face of massive cuts to council funding. The heart of the local response to the virus now lies with a small number of council public health specialists \u2013 about 500 across England.</p> <p>As the first wave of infections hit, these specialists played a crucial role in the containment phase, chasing infection contacts and coordinating the local response.</p> <p>Among a torrent of other responsibilities, highlighted via the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/adayinthelifeofaDPH?src=hashtag_click&amp;f=live\">#adayinthelifeofadph</a>, local public health staff are collating and analysing data, giving advice on everything from protection equipment to homelessness, managing the implementation of social distancing, supporting vulnerable people, and working with the NHS, voluntary groups and government. </p> <p>All councils depend on these specialists to help implement the blizzard of guidance on infection control and safe working, as they work with GPs, volunteers, community groups, local businesses and government during the lockdown. </p> <p>Those who may need help are being identified from numerous sources, including responses to a government letter asking 1.5 million people judged at risk if they need help. Many people have contacted councils directly. Staff and voluntary workers \u2013 all trained in infection control \u2013 are making personal visits and keep in touch online and by phone, as well as delivering food and medicines and checking on social care and other welfare needs. Some support will come from the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-those-affected-by-covid-19/support-for-those-affected-by-covid-19\">\u00a3500m</a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-those-affected-by-covid-19/support-for-those-affected-by-covid-19\"> government hardship fund</a>. </p> <p> Two weeks ago the NHS and the government instituted a <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/03/covid-19-discharge-guidance-hmg-format-v4-18.pdf\">new patient discharge regime</a>, which amounted to an order to do whatever it takes to clear patients out of 15,000 beds. Councils are working with the NHS, care homes and voluntary groups to ensure residents being moved out of hospitals have somewhere to go and have the right support in place.</p> <p>The government has allocated councils in England <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/876273/Covid-19_additional_funding_allocations.pdf\">\u00a31.6b</a><a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/876273/Covid-19_additional_funding_allocations.pdf\">n of additional funds</a> to cope with Covid-19 pressures, such as buying support from care providers, but the guidance did not mandate the testing of patients before discharge, leading some care homes, such as in Liverpool, to refuse to take them. Continuing difficulties in getting personal protection equipment (PPE) to care staff are also hindering discharges, and infections in care homes will put a huge additional strain on adult social care.</p> <p>Social care staff continue to go to people\u2019s homes despite the lack of PPE. The British Association of Social Workers <a href=\"https://www.basw.co.uk/system/files/resources/BASW%20Letter%20to%20PM%2001.04.20..pdf\">has warned</a><a href=\"https://www.basw.co.uk/system/files/resources/BASW%20Letter%20to%20PM%2001.04.20..pdf\"> (pdf)</a> that staff are often seeing a dozen or more service users a day without even hand sanitiser as protection. Social workers are also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/02/children-safe-social-workers-fears-lockdown-coronavirus\">scrambling to keep in touch with children</a> who may be put at additional risk by the lockdown. </p> <p>Councils and their contractors are trying to keep other vital services running, particularly refuse collections, knowing that any deterioration in the environment will exacerbate people\u2019s sense of fear. It\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.localgov.co.uk/Councils-warn-of-wave-of-waste/50290\">growing problem</a>. Some council recycling centres have closed and the volume of waste is increasing just as sickness among refuse crews increases. </p> <p>Huge efforts have been made to get rough sleepers off the streets, including working with volunteers and businesses <a href=\"https://careappointments.com/care-news/england/143184/manchester-and-liverpool-rough-sleepers-to-be-housed-in-hotels-during-coronavirus-outbreak/\">to get people into hotels</a> and <a href=\"https://www.babergh.gov.uk/news/council-teams-and-local-business-restore-property-in-less-than-a-week-in-order-to-house-vulnerable-residents/\">revamp empty properties</a>. And councils are gearing up to help an expected <a href=\"https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/news/domestic-abuse-and-covid-19\">surge in domestic abuse victims</a>. </p> <p>Local authorities also have to handle the emotionally-charged practicalities around funerals. Guidance from Public Health England now says only immediate family are allowed to attend and social distancing rules must be maintained. </p> <p>Some families are waiting to remove bodies from hospital mortuaries in the hope that the rules might be relaxed in a few weeks, while many undertakers are not working as normal. As a result, mortuary capacity is rapidly running out, and emergency facilities are being built.</p> <p>Under intense pressure, local government\u2019s role has been a mix of community leadership, implementing national plans in ways that are sensitive to local needs, and providing support for everyone from rough sleepers to businesses.</p> <p>When the immediate crisis is over, councils need to ram home the message that while national guidance has often been essential in fighting Covid-19, local government is at its best when it has maximum freedom to meet local needs. When the plaudits are being handed out, councils will deserve huge credit for the energy and innovation they have brought to leading their communities.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Vize is a public policy commentator and analyst</p>",

And with about 80% of game sales now coming via digital download, according to the Entertainment Retailers Association, it had seemed that the sector was coronavirus-proof.</p> <p>However, blockbuster video game titles like The Last of Us II still tend to sell more copies in physical rather than digital form; often because mainstream audiences are less experienced with online purchasing, or because purchasers take advantage of pre-order offers and discounts from shops and supermarkets. The most successful game in the UK in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/sep/26/fifa-19-review\">Fifa 19</a>, achieved 75% of its sales from the physical product rather than through digital downloads.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Launching a really big game right now is going to cost you</p> <footer> <cite>Seth Barton, editor of MCV/Develop</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What the delay of The Last of Us Part II shows is that the closure of stores and the disruption to the manufacturing and distribution pipeline for physical software products is still problematic for the games industry.</p> <p>\u201cThe Last of Us II, by all accounts and appearances, looks to be finished, so this is a commercial decision,\u201d said Seth Barton, editor of industry news publication <a href=\"https://www.mcvuk.com/\">MCV/Develop</a>. \u201cSony is concerned that the crisis will stymie the launch of its flagship title for the year. Bricks and mortar retail still makes up a considerable part of the sales mix, especially for the biggest titles, and with every Game Digital store in the UK and every GameStop in the US closed, launching a really big game right now is going to cost you. There\u2019s also the possibility that the crisis has delayed production and shipping of high-margin collector\u2019s editions of the game.\u201d</p> <p>And if The Last of Us Part II has fallen victim to the uncertainty and disruption around Covid-19, it\u2019s likely other major releases will follow. Titles such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jan/02/games-most-anticipated-2020-preview\">Ghost </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jan/02/games-most-anticipated-2020-preview\">of Tsushima</a> and Cyberpunk 2077, which were also due for release in the next few months, may also be affected \u2013 if not by sales and manufacturing channels then by disruption to the development process itself.</p> <p>\u201cWhile big games have long been created by teams in distributed locations, having your individual staff all working from home is far from ideal,\u201d says Barton. \u201cThe process of bringing a big game to fruition is a complex one, and certain elements, such as performance capture, motion capture and [quality assurance] will be very hard to relocate out of dedicated spaces.</p> <p>\u201cQA is a particular bugbear, especially given the industry\u2019s penchant for incredible secrecy and round-the-clock shifts approaching launch. Sending test kits and code to testers\u2019 homes looks both practically difficult and potentially risky.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a21ef368f10af187cd75febd6ae5c1fd03fc8d8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a21ef368f10af187cd75febd6ae5c1fd03fc8d8b/0_0_5641_3385/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Promotion for Cyberpunk 2077 during the Tokyo Game Show 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Promotion for Cyberpunk 2077 during the Tokyo Game Show 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franck Robichon/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Game developer Will Luton, who now runs consultancy <a href=\"https://departmentofplay.net/\">Department of Play</a>, reiterates the difficulties that Covid-19 brings to games testing. \u201cFor consoles, people need access to developer test kits. Often there are fewer than needed and they are shared around in a studio, with QA departments using rolling shifts for 24-hour coverage. So getting these into the homes and set up for the right people at the right time will be a logistics challenge, especially considering that technically these kits need to be kept securely in one building.\u201d</p> <p>This winter was also set to host two major console launches: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/mar/19/playstation-5-specifications-revealed-but-design-is-still-a-mystery\">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/feb/25/xbox-series-x-console-features-12-teraflops-graphics-processor\">Xbox </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/feb/25/xbox-series-x-console-features-12-teraflops-graphics-processor\">Series X</a>. But, given the reliance on complex manufacturing and distribution channels and the need to get tens of thousands of units into both digital and physical stores, might we see Microsoft and Sony rethinking the schedule?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/mar/30/epic-video-games-self-isolating\">Now's the time \u2013 15 epic video games for the socially isolated</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat depends on China\u2019s ability to control the virus, specifically in Shenzhen, the world\u2019s electronics factory, as there\u2019s nowhere else you can realistically move production,\u201d says Barton. \u201cIn addition, component supplies may be impacted, though the initial slowdown there generally seems to have picked back up.\u201d</p> <p>Luton also points to the security issues of having staff working from home while developing and testing PS5 and Xbox Series X titles. \u201cI would imagine Sony and Microsoft would be reluctant for their next-gen hardware to be in some private residence and they certainly wouldn\u2019t want to ship one there. But they\u2019ll have to change policy as the lockdown continues.\u201d</p> <p>The one positive factor is that digital channels are there if needed.</p> <p>\u201cOptical media manufacture is going to falter as supply chain is disrupted and bricks and mortar retail has completely disappeared,\u201d says Luton. \u201cWhile people are spending more money and time on games, a big chunk of the sales channel has just disappeared. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some AAA games now attempt a digital-only release as some of the Hollywood blockbusters have tried with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/26/film-industry-blockbusters-multiplex-cinemas-closed-coronavirus\">\u2018straight-to-streaming\u2019</a> approach. But it\u2019s a massive unknown.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s also the fact that key titles such as The Last of Us Part II and Cyberpunk are both set to launch on current generation consoles as well as the PC \u2013 so there is a lot of hardware out there that can already play these games.</p> <p>\u201cThankfully, this is the most resilient console market we\u2019ve ever had. The new consoles could be delayed into 2021 and we\u2019d still \u2013 Covid-19 permitting \u2013 be able to play all this winter\u2019s big releases on our current hardware. It pains me to say it, but we\u2019ve never <em>needed</em> new hardware less.\u201d</p>",

However, other cruise ships remain in limbo while carrying passengers infected with Covid-19, including the Coral Princess, which is also hoping to dock in Florida. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08c4c50e184093b0f8975da638849a9cd06321be\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08c4c50e184093b0f8975da638849a9cd06321be/0_127_4666_2800/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The Rotterdam, left, passes the Zaandam at Port Everglades in Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rotterdam, left, passes the Zaandam at Port Everglades in Florida.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wilfredo Lee/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Cruise ships are also in purgatory off the coast of<strong> Australia</strong>, with many staying put despite being ordered to leave.

They hope the ships will then return to their ports of origin. </p> \n<p><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>Face masks may yet become the accessory du jour</strong></p> \n<p>Surgical face masks have been deemed to have little effect in protecting individuals from catching coronavirus in general situations, not least because they are not close-fitting and tiny viral particles can penetrate them, unlike well-fitting masks that have a respirator to filter air, such as FFP3 models.</p> \n<p>However, surgical masks can catch droplets from coughs and sneezes, suggesting they do offer some protection, and experts say they may help to reduce the transmission of Covid-19 from infected people even before they show symptoms by catching droplets when people talk.</p> \n<p>This week the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association stressed that staff and patients should wear surgical masks to cover their mouths and reduce the risk of transmission of Covid-19.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/can-a-face-mask-protect-me-from-coronavirus-covid-19-myths-busted\">Can a face mask protect me from coronavirus?

  "<p>Covid-19 has been living in my apartment for the past 15 days. It falls asleep inches from my head and wakes up beside me. I breathe its breath. I\u2019ve always been reluctant to call my apartment \u201chome\u201d here in Catania. Over the past 10 years I\u2019ve traversed the Middle East, photographing cities, their inhabitants and the conflicts that have ravaged that area of the world for decades. The streets of Baghdad, Mosul, Kabul, Amman, Khartoum and Tehran have been my home. I\u2019d always considered those 50 sq metres in Catania as a pied-\u00e0-terre, a place to keep my clothes and my photo archive. I never could have imagined that after documenting the desperation of refugee camps in Iraq or mass graves in Sinjar, or aboard an ambulance collecting the dead among the Kurdish resistance in northern Syria, that I\u2019d have to confront the world\u2019s biggest story in my own small apartment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"013358068349116724bfd14532b75aa4a9b5e107\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/013358068349116724bfd14532b75aa4a9b5e107/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Photographing the empty streets from the window.

My mother, my partner, the war reporter Marta Bellingreri, and other people close to me have been infected, but somehow I have been spared. I interpreted this peculiar twist as if Covid-19 had chosen me to photograph it from a different perspective. And I met the challenge, also because the reasons that brought the virus into my apartment are also extraordinarily tied to my career as a photographer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"92d0d8a6a9b6e50c372f87b5c7938da6faa71d6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92d0d8a6a9b6e50c372f87b5c7938da6faa71d6e/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The street where Alessio and Marta live at sunset with very few people walking due to the government measures to respond to the pandemic emergency.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The street where Alessio and Marta live, at sunset with very few people walking due to the government measures to respond to the pandemic emergency.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The street where Alessio and Marta live, pictured at sunset.</p></li> </ul> <p>Last 25 February I hosted some friends and family members for a celebratory dinner. <a href=\"https://www.worldpressphoto.org/\">World Press Photo</a> had just announced the 2020 winners, and, for the second time, I was selected, for my photograph of <a href=\"https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/2020/39627/1/Alessio-Mamo\">an I</a><a href=\"https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/2020/39627/1/Alessio-Mamo\">sis bride embracing her child in the prison camp of Al-Hol</a>, north-east Syria. At the same time, cases of Covid-19 throughout Italy had risen from four to 322. No one could have imagined that Sicily\u2019s patient zero was at that dinner table, a friend who had returned from Germany. He had no idea he was an asymptomatic carrier of the virus. I left the day after for Khartoum with Marta to photograph a country in the throes of revolution for over a year.</p> <p>The call that changed that trip and the following weeks came six days later, in early March, as Italy and the world were changing for the worse. My friend who had been in Germany had tested positive for Covid-19. The alarm was sounded: phone calls to notify those who may have been infected and tests for the older adults who were at the dinner. Some of my family members tested positive, and my mother was taken immediately to an hospital. She\u2019s 69 and has suffered from respiratory illness in the past. Her life was at risk and my world caved in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e121b766782d68f424c44e7ea5553b63024c58a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e121b766782d68f424c44e7ea5553b63024c58a3/0_0_6240_4160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marta at the window while drinking a herbal tea.

Local authorities have also provided financial incentives, such as subsidies for equipment rental and catering, to encourage producers to keep shooting.</p>",

They are taking the necessary time, they are very demanding on information, which is not bad. But we believe that once we have the first novel food given a green light from EFSA that will have a snowball effect.\u201d</p> <p>In the eyes of leading players in the insects-as-food industry, the potential for their high-protein delicacies has been held back by a lack of EU-wide approval.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/28/larva-fat-sustainable-alternative-butter-cakes\">There\u2019s a fly in my waffle! Scientists experiment with larva fat to replace butter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The UK, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Finland have taken a permissive approach to a 1997 EU law that requires foods not eaten before that year to get novel food authorisation.</p> <p>Those national regulators decided the EU law did not pertain to animals used for food. As a result, a host of insect-based products can be found in British, Dutch, Belgian and Finnish supermarkets. About 500 tonnes of insect-based food for human consumption is produced every year.</p> <p>But such products are banned in France, Italy and Spain, among other countries. In 2018, a new EU law sought to bring some clarity. It stipulated that insect-based dishes would also require novel food authorisation.</p> <p>A transition period was established to allow companies already producing food from insects to operate until they received a judgment on the safety of the species they work with and final approval by the EU\u2019s institutions.</p> <p>Indeed, companies such such as Protifarm in the Netherlands, Micronutris in France, Essento in Switzerland and Entogourmet in Spain are said to be preparing to ramp up their operations.</p> <p>\u201cWe have many of our members building bigger factories because the key to success is to upscale your companies and produce on a mass scale. And this is already happening,\u201d Derrien said. \u201cWe are expecting the next few years will be very interesting ones and obviously the novel food authorisations will definitely help.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe sort of foods ranges from whole insects as an aperitif or as snacks to processed insects in bars or pasta or burgers made out of insects. We believe that insects for food is one solution for some of the biggest challenges we are facing on the planet. In the context of scarce resources, and insect production is not too demanding, you have the capacity to produce high-quality protein. That is a very promising solution.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 April 2020 to correct a grammatical error concerning ground, not grinded, mealworms.</p>",

  "<p>Jared Kushner is not a guy to turn to for sound political advice. Most recently, he reportedly told the president that Andrew Cuomo, New York\u2019s governor, was being \u201calarmist\u201d after he announced that his state required 30,000 ventilators to help get through the pandemic.</p> <p>To add insult to injury, Kushner also bragged of his own wisdom and told those assembled that Cuomo was wrong. According to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/04/inside-trumps-decision-to-back-off-of-his-easter-coronavirus-miracle\">Vanity Fair</a>, Kushner declared: \u201cI have all this data about ICU capacity. I\u2019m doing my own projections, and I\u2019ve gotten a lot smarter about this. New York doesn\u2019t need all the ventilators.\u201d</p> <p>The princeling has helped place American lives and bodies on the line. New York\u2019s hospitals have become combat zones, its morgues and funeral homes look like abattoirs. Meanwhile, the US is locked down and the administration is projecting up to a quarter-million dead even if everything goes right.</p> <p>American carnage is now. We may witness more deaths in months than its troops suffered in Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam after years of fighting.</p> <p>When Mike Pence compares the US to Italy, we have a problem whose glaring scars will be felt long after Donald Trump leaves office. Coronavirus won\u2019t be disappearing in a matter of days despite the president\u2019s earlier assurances. Trump ignored the intelligence community and his national security staff, and now we must pay a collective price.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Kushner doesn\u2019t only suffer from intellectual overreach. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/us/jared-kushner-assets-conflict-of-interest.html\">Self-dealing</a> may have made a cameo too in the middle of crisis, and we have seen this movie before. Earlier, the Kushners had attempted to attract capital from China, by touting EB-5 visas in exchange for investments and looked to Anbang, a Chinese conglomerate, to bail them out of their real estate positions.</p> <p>When Kushner was boasting about data and Trump was going on about testing websites, they were probably referring to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/kushner-coronavirus-testing-oscar-company/609139/\">Oscar Health</a>, an insurance company tied to the <a href=\"https://www.dfs.ny.gov/docs/insurance/exam_rpt/x9475o13.pdf\">Kushner family</a>. In turn, Oscar appears to have been involved in the government\u2019s efforts to map the spread of the disease.</p> <p>According to reports and filings, Josh Kushner, Jared\u2019s brother, still owns a piece of Oscar, and Jared <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/03/jared-kushner-once-controlled-oscar-now-running-a-coronavirus-testing-site/\">belatedly divested</a> his interest after entering government. If the Trump Organization can bill the Secret Service when they guard the president at his personal properties, why can\u2019t the Kushner kids make a few dimes off the taxpayer?</p> <p>Sadly, none of this should come as a surprise. Kushner never deigned to come clean on his SF-86, his federal disclosure form, a prerequisite for obtaining a security clearance, until he was squeezed by external events, the drip of incessant leaks, headlines and hearings.</p> <p>Reportedly, the delays surrounding Kushner obtaining a security clearance stemmed from more than his inability to properly complete the pertinent paperwork. Questions swirled about ties to overseas investors, foreign governments and contacts. Ultimately, Kushner received his White House <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/24/kushner-inc-review-vicky-ward-jared-ivanka-trump-kakistocracy\">security clearance</a> the <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/the-story-behind-jared-kushners-curious-acceptance-into-harvard\">same way he got into Harvard</a> \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/us/politics/jared-kushner-security-clearance.html\">\u201cDaddy\u201d pulled some very expensive strings</a>.</p> <p>To be sure, this is not the first time Kushner put his father-in-law\u2019s political career at risk. In 2017, Ivanka\u2019s husband urged Trump to fire James Comey, the FBI director. As he saw it, career FBI agents, Democrats and Trump\u2019s base would applaud the dismissal.</p> <p>Wrong. The \u201crid me of this meddlesome priest\u201d thing didn\u2019t work so well the first time. Ask Henry II. In death, Thomas Becket was venerated.</p> <p>The president acceded to Kushner and political wreckage ensued. Against this backdrop, Steve Bannon, the brains behind Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, compared Kushner to \u201cair\u201d and derided him as a \u201cdope\u201d.</p> <p>In case anyone forgot, Bob Mueller dogged Trump and his campaign staff for two years. Paul Manafort sits in prison while Mike Flynn and Roger Stone await sentencing.</p> <p>To further complicate things, Trump can no longer deliver a speech to Congress without Nancy Pelosi smirking over his shoulder or ripping up his texts. Viewed in this light, Jared helped cost the GOP its control of the House of Representatives.</p> <p>If Kushner weren\u2019t married to the boss\u2019s daughter he would not be anywhere near the Oval Office. But Trump treats the presidency like a family business, and we know how that has ended before: a passel of bankruptcies and a pile of debt.</p> <p>These days, the sun is setting later but darkness will be casting its broad shadow earlier.</p> <ul> <li><p>Lloyd Green was opposition research counsel to George HW Bush\u2019s 1988 campaign and served in the Department of Justice from 1990 to 1992</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>California restaurants were some of the first in the US to close in order to stem the spread of the coronavirus. And in the food service industry\u2019s crisis, third-party delivery platforms have found great opportunity.</p> <p>As businesses have been forced to close their dining rooms amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/california-coronavirus-shelter-in-place-bay-area\">shelter-in-place orders</a>, many have attempted a quick pivot to takeout and delivery. Without a physical presence in their customers\u2019 lives, many restaurants\u2019 immediate survival has come to depend on a digital one, shifting power and control from business owners to third-party technology companies that take large commission fees on every order. It has meant a boon for platforms such as UberEats and DoorDash, rare corporate winners in an accelerating unemployment crisis and recession that has decimated food service \u2013 though the apps probably still won\u2019t be enough to keep many small businesses alive.</p> <h2>Apps to the rescue \u2013 or profiting from an industry\u2019s collapse?</h2> <p>Third-party delivery platforms frame their business as one of marketing. When restaurants still had dining rooms to fill, apps promoted their service as a way of reaching new customers. Now the platforms hold the restaurant market captive, and the apps are more crowded than ever.</p> <p>On the consumer side, the deals look great: UberEats is dropping delivery fees to drive more demand. Grubhub is offering a special \u201cSupper for Support\u201d $10 discount to qualifying customer orders every evening.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/i-could-be-on-the-street-100000-jobs-at-risk-as-coronavirus-pummels-california-restaurants\">'I could be on the street': 100,000 jobs at risk as coronavirus pummels California restaurants</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But restaurants are left to pick up the tab, as Grubhub\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/2020/3/31/21201207/restaurants-pay-grubhub-discount-support-for-supper\">usual commission</a> is still calculated on the pre-discount total.

Grubhub has temporarily deferred but not waived or reduced commissions for some independent restaurants.</p> <p>Still, many struggling restaurants have no choice but to give in and sign up. Grubhub reports more than 10 to 15 times the usual onboarding requests from new restaurants, with four to five times more new businesses added to the app on a regular basis. \u201cWe know these are tough times for independent restaurants because people are not eating out. Our mission here is to help keep their doors open,\u201d Grubhub said in a statement.</p> <p>Faced with shutting her doors for the first time in over 20 years, Rachel Herbert, the owner of four Park Cafes across San Francisco and Oakland, took her chances on tech. \u201cThe first place we turned to was the third-party delivery companies,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re looking at what we need to do to keep our doors open, we have to remember that 30% of the revenue we\u2019re taking in is going to go to third-party delivery. They\u2019re experiencing a boom. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we\u2019re grateful for the service. But it sure would be nice if they reduced those fees.\u201d</p> <p>Herbert says sales are down 80% across her cafes, which relied on neighborhood foot traffic. \u201cWe\u2019re not really breaking even, but we\u2019re keeping our doors open, so we\u2019re making enough to pay the people who are working and providing that service for the neighborhoods,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of survival.\u201d</p> <p>Los Angeles restaurant owner and consultant Adam Weisblatt often tells his clients that third-party delivery is a good tool for short-term cashflow \u2013 but not for profit.</p> <p>\u201cThe delivery fees and service charges from these websites are murder. They\u2019re incredibly high rates,\u201d said Weisblatt. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to profit at all.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12c52f4364a92b769a313db5a6b78a68332ae23a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12c52f4364a92b769a313db5a6b78a68332ae23a/0_116_3500_2101/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Trays of to-go orders ready to be bagged are seen at the Michelin-star SPQR restaurant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trays of to-go orders ready to be bagged are seen at the Michelin-star SPQR restaurant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Lam/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Weisblatt has temporarily shuttered his oyster bar, and kept his Thai restaurant Same-Same open for takeout and delivery on several third-party platforms.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing quite a bit of delivery and to-go, but that\u2019s always been a significant portion of our business. Still, Same-Same is going to lose money every month \u2013 we just don\u2019t know quite how much yet,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThese sites live off of restaurants, they need us to survive. But I don\u2019t feel like they\u2019ve been especially supportive of the industry. They\u2019re not proving to be good partners right now,\u201d Weisblatt added. \u201cIt feels like a very shortsighted decision not to be helpful, and that as soon as business returns to normal, people are going to look to really eliminate these things.\u201d</p> <h2>Pivoting to survive. But for how long?</h2> <p>Some restaurants, many of them totally new to takeout and delivery, have attempted to make that leap already, deciding to go it alone and platform-free. That means keeping more of their profits, but expending more labor along the way, from wrangling orders as they come in to launching new DIY delivery fleets.</p> <p>S+M Vegan relied on catering and regular pop-ups at bars in the Bay Area before the shelter-in-place order took effect. Plans for their brick and mortar, set to open later this summer, have fallen through. Now they have switched to twice-weekly meal pickups from their commercial kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cThe advantage is we can do it by ourselves. Third-party delivery apps are known for being kind of a scam,\u201d said co-owner Marie Chia. \u201cThe most successful restaurants run on a margin of about 6%, so the more people order from you, the more you\u2019re losing money. We don\u2019t need to be giving over 30% of our already very small margins.\u201d</p> <p>With only two owner-operators, S+M is too short-staffed to run delivery orders \u2013 but turning to an app for help is not an option.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to maximize what we can get out of this and the value that we can give to our customers,\u201d said co-owner Shane Stanbridge. \u201cIf we were taking a 15% to 30% chunk out of our margins, we might feel tempted to inflate our prices to make up for it. That\u2019s just so unnecessary.\u201d</p> <p>California\u2019s Alcohol Control Board loosened restrictions on restaurants selling liquor to-go, which has helped fill the gap for some businesses, with the margins on drinks typically wider than on food.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60edb749637b2ecd4b0f7e6f4ce694b14cc563ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60edb749637b2ecd4b0f7e6f4ce694b14cc563ff/0_122_3905_2343/1000..jpg\" alt=\"An employee for Atelier Crenn restaurant hands a takeout order to a customer in San Francisco, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An employee for Atelier Crenn restaurant hands a takeout order to a customer in San Francisco, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Oakland\u2019s Kon-Tiki bar and restaurant began delivery service the day the new rules were announced, doing about half their usual business, said co-owner Matt Reagan. Ultimately he decided against using third-party platforms. The operation has gone old-school, with a menu available online, but orders made over the phone. \u201cWe give people the expectation up front that takeout is your best option \u2013 we can get you delivery but it\u2019s going to be a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like time traveling to 15 years ago and you\u2019re just waiting for your pizza to show up.\u201d</p> <p>For now, it\u2019s enough to pay some bills, and allow Kon-Tiki to hire back some staff. Plans to open another Oakland restaurant, Palmetto, are continuing apace, though with a to-go only grand opening planned for April. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a market there. It doesn\u2019t have to be a big market, it just has to be something,\u201d said Reagan. \u201cFor now, there\u2019s a path forward. People are making a conscious effort to support the places that they want to survive.\u201d</p> <p>But as the nation slips deeper into a coronavirus recession, no one knows if consumers will be able to afford to keep up that kind of support \u2013 or if it will be enough to save the industry. In a <a href=\"https://restaurant.org/Articles/News/Study-details-impact-of-coronavirus-on-restaurants\">National Restaurant Association poll</a> of more than 5,000 restaurant owners, 11% said they would probably permanently close in the next 30 days, and 3% reported that they had already closed for good.</p> <p>\u201cWe all want to have the lights on and people employed and be open for the day of the victory parade,\u201d said Reagan. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s going to be a lot fewer restaurants when that day comes \u2013 a lot of neighborhood staples that aren\u2019t going to be able to make it through to the end.\u201d</p>",

A self-quarantine puts them in perpetual proximity to their abuser. Leaving exposes them not just to a deadly virus but a world that has largely closed its doors.</p> <p>Activists worldwide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/28/lockdowns-world-rise-domestic-violence\">have reported</a> an alarming rise in domestic violence cases since the start of coronavirus-related quarantines. In Wuhan in February, while the province was under strict lockdown, one police station, <a href=\"https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005253/domestic-violence-cases-surge-during-covid-19-epidemic\">reported</a> a threefold increase in complaints compared with the same period last year. Advocates are concerned that this bleak reality has reached the United States, where experts say one in four women and one in seven men face <a href=\"https://www.thehotline.org/resources/statistics/\">physical violence by a partner</a> at some point in their lifetimes.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.thehotline.org/\">National Domestic Violence Hotline</a>, which typically receives up to 2,000 calls per day, counted 951 callers between 10 and 24 March who mentioned Covid-19 while reporting their abuse. One caller, from New York, reported being awakened from bed because she had a fever and wasn\u2019t feeling well. Her abuser threw her out of the front door and kept their child. Another told the hotline she was being kept home against her will after being threatened by her abuser with a hammer and an unregistered gun. He was using the pandemic as an excuse to stop her from leaving him, she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are hearing from survivors how Covid-19 is already being used by their abusive partners to further control and abuse, how Covid-19 is already impacting their ability to access support and services like accessing shelter, counseling, different things that they would typically lean on in their communities,\u201d says Crystal Justice, the chief marketing and development officer at NDVH.</p> <p>\u201cWe want people to socially distance themselves as much as possible, but that really has impacts for people,\u201d says Kimberlina Kavern, senior director of the crime victim assistance program at <a href=\"https://www.safehorizon.org/\">Safe Horizon</a>, a New York-based victim assistance organization. \u201cA domestic violence victim is likely not able to pick up the phone and call somebody for help because their abusive partner is in the home or in the room with them.\u201d</p> <p>Safe Horizon has a <a href=\"https://www.safehorizon.org/safechat/\">chat service</a> on their website for quiet interactions, as well as an escape button which allows survivors to quickly leave their website without it appearing in their browser history.</p> <p>Kavern explains that financial concerns as the economy falters and unemployment numbers spike can also increase incidents of domestic violence. Studies show that as unemployment rises, so do levels of domestic violence. Financial uncertainty might stop women from leaving even outside times of economic crisis. Women hold <a href=\"https://nwlc.org/issue/low-wage-jobs/\">two-thirds of America\u2019s low-wage jobs</a>, and many have now been cut.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we are concerned about in the community is that calls to our domestic violence hotline are down, calls to our intake are down, and we don\u2019t think that that\u2019s because less people need our help,\u201d says Susan Pearlstein, co-supervisor of the family law unit of <a href=\"https://www.philalegal.org/familylaw\">Philadelphia Legal Assistance</a>, which provides legal services to low-income residents of Philadelphia. \u201cWe\u2019re really fearful that the people that are in the most danger are unable to reach out.\u201d PLA saw a 54% decline in intake volume in the period following 16 March.</p> <p>With much of the country shut down, advocates are also concerned that victims may assume there\u2019s nowhere to go for help. That\u2019s not the case, says Pearlstein, emphasizing that hotlines are still open, legal aid remains accessible, and Philadelphia courts have set up remote access to file for protection orders against abusers by phone or email. NDVH operates one of the <a href=\"https://www.thehotline.org/resources/victims-and-survivors/\">country\u2019s largest databases</a> of resources and service providers and is working to track who is still operational so that women throughout the country can find where to go for help.</p> <p>Shelters, too, remain open, though many are screening for Covid-19 symptoms. If a woman seeking help from Safe Horizon is showing symptoms, she is referred for medical treatment and can self-quarantine at one of the organization\u2019s shelters. Safe Horizon is practicing physical distancing within shelters, ensuring people are six feet apart and running therapeutic and educational programming virtually when possible. The organization continues to provide child advocacy services, as well; with children out of school, Kavern also expects an inevitable increase in child abuse, especially with fewer options to seek refuge in someone else\u2019s home.</p> <p>When leaving isn\u2019t an option, advocates are still committed to helping women navigate a changed world. \u201cObviously a safety plan looks very different if they\u2019re forced to shelter in place with their abuser, so right now, we\u2019re focusing a lot on emotional safety plans,\u201d says Justice. \u201cThen physical safety planning. What does it look like for you to create physical distance between yourself and the abuser in the space that you\u2019re in? What does it look like for you to use virtual tools? What does it look like for you to reach out in a time of emergency?\u201d</p> <p><em>Advocates at the National Domestic Violence Hotline are available 24/7 at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) in more than 200 languages.

  "<h2>\u2018Hula hooping is perfect for cardio and strength\u2019</h2> <p>I am a professional hula hooper so I\u2019m hooping my way through the lockdown. It\u2019s perfect for cardio and strength, as well as being a bit silly so you can forget about what\u2019s happening with the world. I also have a young son so I decided to film and record a hula hooping for kids online course. I\u2019ve <a href=\"https://learn.livelovehoop.com/\">released it for free</a> and have had over a hundred people download it for their kids which is amazing! <em>Jo, Worthing.</em></p> <h2>\u2018I was inspired by the man who ran a marathon on his balcony\u2019</h2> <p>I have a physical disability called limb difference, so have to wear a prosthetic leg to walk. Usually I go on small walks at my own pace at Roundhay Park in Leeds, but obviously that is harder now. I used to be a Paralympic swimmer and I like to keep fit and feel strong. I had to figure out a way to exercise and was inspired by the restaurant worker in France, Elisha Nochomovitz, and the marathon he ran on his seven-metre long balcony.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/man-runs-marathon-on-7-metre-balcony-during-french-lockdown\">Man runs marathon on 7-metre balcony during French lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the back of my house is a small courtyard, around seven metres across. I challenged myself, not to walk a marathon, but to walk a mile a day, back and forth across the courtyard. I\u2019m on my seventh day now and it feels wonderful to have the sun on my face, breathing in the fresh air. I\u2019m sleeping better because of the exercise. And the added bonus is that I can still do this, at my own pace, with my prosthetic leg. I\u2019ve been putting up videos of me doing a silly walk to celebrate my mile for the day. It seems to bring a smile to people\u2019s faces, which makes my day. <em>Elizabeth, Leeds</em></p> <h2>\u2018I can continue strength work thanks to my village pub\u2019</h2> <p>Thanks to my village pub, <a href=\"https://www.sevenstarskennford.co.uk/\">The Seven Stars</a>, I can continue strength training using an improvised barbell made from ale casks and bamboo. <em>Ivy, Kennard.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df1f69b370824e052d27353e3c69b8c928520d08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df1f69b370824e052d27353e3c69b8c928520d08/0_756_1440_890/1000..jpg\" alt=\"reader\" width=\"1000\" height=\"618\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Creative weights.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: reader</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I suspect we\u2019ll be fitter after all this than we were before\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019ve set up a small gym in my garage.

As I am running a coronavirus ward in a London hospital, the travelling is allowed and I need the run to clear my head. I am being careful to keep social distancing. Although, having already had Covid-19, I think I am not a risk to others and they are not a risk to me.</p> <h2>\u2018Don\u2019t be disappointed when you start. It takes time to become fit\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m 77 and I do 25 minutes cycling every day on my 1988 Holdsworth Elan bicycle (fitted with a Wahoo cadence sensor) using the excellent and free app Indoor Cycling Workout. My current performance for the 25-minute ride is seven miles and 200kj of work (doesn\u2019t mean anything to me either) at average of just under 17mph and heart rate averaging 114 with max 134. Because you can\u2019t coast downhill and there are no traffic lights or junctions, time on a trainer is equivalent to a longer time on the road. My advice is don\u2019t be disappointed when you start. It takes time to become fit. Take it gently and it comes bit by bit.

Normally, I\u2019m a bit of a smooth mover but to get the energy levels up I\u2019ve found \u201cauntie first up on the dancefloor at a wedding\u201d mode is the best.

  "<p>It is almost certain that 2020 will be a recession year in every advanced economy. Most affected countries have by now adopted strict lockdown measures. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-six-in-10-british-firms-have-no-more-than-three-months-of-cash-left\">economic statistics</a> already coming in are abysmal, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economy\">unemployment claims</a> to sales in the hospitality sector. It is almost impossible for most people to work or spend as much as they used to. A tree does not bloom in frost, and a frozen economy does not produce income.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/millions-uk-slip-through-coronavirus-pay-wage-safety-net-self-employed-wage-subsidy\">Millions in UK 'could slip through virus wage safety net'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Understandably, the first economic policy response was: do something, do it big and do it fast. The IMF <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19#U\">lists</a> sizeable emergency policies for more than a hundred countries, almost all adopted in the past few weeks. The first priority of these policies should be to support the health sector, quickly increasing the capacity of beds, staff and ventilators, mobilising the production of the valuable equipment through tax breaks, public purchases or direct government control, and spurring innovation in treatments and vaccines.</p> <p>Beyond this immediate priority, there are three goals of economic policy now: make the impact of the frost on people\u2019s life less hard, preserve the economy\u2019s productive capacity for when we can unfreeze the economy, and get ready to raise the heat quickly. For each of them, there are different options, each with its virtues and its flaws. Countries have taken different paths in trading these off, often with little discussion on which is best.</p> <p>To preserve wellbeing, facing a disaster that affects everyone, governments must provide social insurance to help the most vulnerable make it through. A decision facing policymakers could be to either use existing social insurance mechanisms or to give people cash transfers. Most European countries have done the former, expanding unemployment benefits and welfare payments while relaxing eligibility criteria. In the United States, where the safety net is weaker and has more trouble in reaching people, the government will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/us-government-to-give-citizens-emergency-financial-aid\">sending checks directly</a> over the coming month. Cash transfers are not targeted to reach only those who need them, so they become very expensive, while too-generous unemployment benefits encourage more layoffs and quitting than needed.</p> <p>Another trade-off is whether to make support conditional on someone\u2019s current income, knowing that checking who qualifies takes time and creates bureaucratic hurdles, so that the payments will be slower. Going further than any other country, the UK government is giving the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-uk-offers-self-employed-80-of-earnings\">self-employed 80%</a> of their past profits as a cash grant, no matter how their business is doing right now.</p> <p>The second goal is to have the economy ready to go back to work with a minimal shortfall in productivity when the lockdown period loosens. The fear is that companies that cannot make payments during the freeze will close their doors for good. Afterwards, it will take a long time for the right business to emerge, bringing together the right people to sell the right product in the right market. Some workers who are laid off now will later have trouble finding the same job that suits them and pays well. This re-matching of markets, companies and workers often makes recessions prolonged and painful. It is better to stop businesses failing in the first place, if the lockdown is going to be short-lived.</p> <p>To keep businesses afloat, almost every country has deferred some, or most, tax payments. That is an effective and simple way for the government to give credit. Other policies involve tough trade-offs. Italy and Spain have enacted a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/26af5520-6793-11ea-800d-da70cff6e4d3\">moratorium</a> on many loan repayments. Asking banks that are already fragile to roll over credits risks creating a financial crisis. Central banks have been buying government bonds to keep interest rates down, and have extended credit to banks with no limit and little cost, as well as directly to companies. In doing so, central banks are taking a lot of risk that these many credits will not be paid back. If they do not, history teaches us that the currency they issue is likely to sharply lose its value.</p> <p>A separate decision is how to reconcile national mandates with an international pandemic. For now, central banks have activated a patched-up network of lending between them (through so-called swap lines), but the network has many holes, leaving many emerging markets at the risk of running out of foreign funding in the coming weeks, as private investors run for the exit.</p> <p>A harder question is whether giving liquidity to businesses should take the form of credit or grants. Germany has done the former, putting <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/26af5520-6793-11ea-800d-da70cff6e4d3\">no limits on how much firms can borrow from the </a><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/26af5520-6793-11ea-800d-da70cff6e4d3\">state</a>, but the loans must be paid back, even if over many years. Denmark has opted for the latter, paying companies up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/denmark-coronavirus-uk-government-workers-employees\">90% of their wage bill,</a> as well as sick leave, rent and other fixed costs. The question is who should ultimately pay for all the money that businesses are getting: is it the ones who receive help now, paying it back over the next few years out of their revenues? Or, rather should all the taxpayers in the country pay for it, especially the future generations who will inherit the exploding public debt? For most countries, the answer lies somewhere in between, since at least some of the credits won\u2019t be repaid. But where exactly in between should it be is a question not just of economics but of intergenerational ethics and justice.</p> <p>Finally, policymakers must stimulate the economy as soon as we can get back to work. One trade-off for many highly indebted countries is that the surge in spending now might leave no money for public investments for this near future. For all countries, the disruption in the production and supply chains might lead to large increases in prices. Responding to the bottlenecks that arise sector by sector will provide the grounds for targeted industrial policy, while a tempting way to deal with inflation is the imposition of price and wage controls. These policies are sometimes adopted during wartime, and there is a battle today \u2013 against a virus \u2013 but more often than not these policies lead to economic disaster.</p> <p>Across all these trade-offs, the urgency of doing something has drawn in the usual ideologues. For them, there are no trade-offs (now or ever). The emergency either requires a huge permanent expansion in the role of the government, or bailouts to failed but politically connected businesses. This is the last trade-off that moderate policymakers face today: to separate the temporary exceptional measures from permanent long-lasting revolutions.</p> <p>\u2022 Ricardo Reis is AW Phillips Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics</p>",
  "<p><br></p> <p>\u201cThe only problem she had was men, who constantly bothered her\u201d: this might be the motto of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/mar/24/jami-attenberg-interview-women-all-grown-up\">Jami Attenberg</a>\u2019s latest novel. The line is uttered by Twyla, the daughter-in-law of a dying misogynist gangster named Victor Tuchman. She\u2019s not alone in feeling this way about men in general, and Victor in particular. His wife, Barbra, and his daughter, Alex, have also gathered to see whether the man who made their lives miserable will die, and to figure out how much they really care. This story is about them.</p> <p>The bulk of the novel takes place over a single day, just after Victor has been for a heart attack. The setting is present-day New Orleans, where Victor and Barbra have moved after a long, mansion-bound life in Connecticut, ostensibly to be near their son, Gary, and his wife and daughter, Twyla and Avery. But Victor is a deceptive man, even to his children. He is also a bad man.</p> <p>Though we\u2019re never given the exact nature of his crimes, we learn that he was a New Jersey gangster, more or less of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/08/the-sopranos-10-years-since-it-finished-its-still-the-most-masterful-show-ever\">the Sopranos</a> variety. He was also an abusive husband and father, a philanderer and a tyrant and likely a rapist. Whatever the details of his life, their implications have long been clear to Alex: \u201cHer gut told her he should be in jail right now.\u201d</p> <p>It is the women around Victor \u2013 Barbra, Alex and Twyla \u2013 who must endure the hurricane of his life, who must try to love him, to make him happy, to cover up for him, and who are all upbraided and assaulted by him. Much like Attenberg\u2019s 2012 book <em>The Middlesteins, </em>this novel is uncompromising in its penetrating treatment of the ties that bind a family together.</p> <p>Attenberg weaves her narrative with a scintillating and often wry prose; her love for her characters, and her keen interest in their joys and longings, never fails to shine through. Often she sets scenes with the terseness of a screenplay, but periodically she plunges into rich description, as when Twyla, crying, looks in the mirror and notices \u201clips in distress, cracked at the edges, only half the color left behind, the other half disappeared, god knows where, absorbed into skin, into air, into grief\u201d.</p> <p>These tears are not just for Victor\u2019s victims. Alex must plead with her ex-husband, Bobby, not to expose their daughter to his compulsive lechery. Twyla has lived the bulk of her life trying not to wither beneath the male gaze, and now finds herself more distanced from Gary than ever. Barbra struggles to understand why she still loves her husband, after all this time. And all of them live under the shadow of another, casually destructive man: as Alex thinks every day, \u201cour president [is] a moron and the world [is] falling apart\u201d. The varied experiences of these characters make it clear that the bad man is not an exception to the rule of manhood; he merely defines its borders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/mar/24/jami-attenberg-interview-women-all-grown-up\">Jami Attenberg: \u2018I wanted to see if there were other happy endings for single women\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The novel is not only concerned with gender politics: it also frequently returns to questions of socioeconomic class. And yet, it is weaker on this topic. We get cursory moments of virtue-signalling, when the narrative pauses briefly on working people \u2013 a cashier, a waitress, a tram driver \u2013 to tell us about the second job they\u2019re forced to hold, or about how much they hate privileged tourists. The novel tells us about mass graves for the indigent, and gives us 30 pages with Sharon, a black woman only tangentially related to the plot, who lifts up her neighbourhood while suffering the effects of white gentrification.</p> <p>But none of these people is a protagonist, none of their lives is centred. The novel points to them, wants them to be recognised; but it refuses to perform that recognition itself. \u201cWhatever we do tonight, let\u2019s not talk about politics,\u201d Alex says to a man she meets at a bar, just after an altercation with a homeless man on the street.

  "<p>It was around 1 a.m. on Thursday when officer Jason Brown from the Albuquerque police department responded to a single gunshot on 3rd St and Central Avenue. The officer arrived to find Jon Jones seated in a black Jeep with the engine running, a near-empty bottle of mezcal on the floor behind the passenger\u2019s seat and a handgun under the driver\u2019s seat.</p> <p>According to Brown\u2019s <a href=\"https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/jon-jones-arrest-statement-2020.pdf\">report</a>, Jones had a \u201cgreen leafy substance on his shirt and pants, consistent with marijuana\u201d and a \u201cstrong odor of alcohol coming from his facial area\u201d. He performed poorly on three field sobriety tests and his breathalyzer tests showed him \u201cat or above twice the legal limit.\u201d He was searched and <a href=\"https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/jon-jones-arrest-statement-2020.pdf\">arrested on four different counts</a>, including aggravated DWI, negligent use of a firearm, possession of open container, and no proof of insurance in vehicle.</p> <p>This is far from the first time that the Jones has been in trouble with the law. The UFC champion was charged with a DWI in 2012 after smashing his Bentley into a utility pole in New York. Then, in April 2015, Jones was involved in a felony hit-and-run where he fled the scene after hitting a pregnant woman\u2019s car. The woman had sustained injuries from the accident, but, according to witnesses, Jones fled the scene after shoving cash in his pockets. Despite facing 18 months in jail for the felony, Jones avoided jail time and instead received 18 months of supervised probation.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Jones, his problems did not end there. While on probation for his felony charge in 2016, Jones was stopped in Albuquerque and given five tickets, including one for drag racing. The well-documented incident was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6yFu5ZD32c\">captured on body cam footage</a>.</p> <p>Then, in October 2019, Jones took a <a href=\"https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/10/ufc-jon-jones-plea-deal-in-strip-club-case-new-mexico\">plea deal</a> after pleading no contest to disorderly conduct in an incident with a cocktail waitress at a strip club. He had originally pleaded not guilty to a charge of battery after <a href=\"https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/ufc-jon-jones-police-report-strip-club-incident-redacted.jpg\">being accused</a> of kissing and choking the waitress before slapping her in the genital region.</p> <p>Beyond his string of arrests and concerning legal incidents, Jones has also failed two separate drug tests administered by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), which facilitates testing for the UFC. He was suspended on both occasions.</p> <p>However, Jones\u2019s latest incident raises some concerning alarms regarding the UFC champion\u2019s mental health. In the body cam footage distributed by the Bernalillo County district attorney, Jones appeared to be distraught and revealed that he was \u201cscared for his family\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI have anxiety. I have anxiety,\u201d Jones repeated while the officer appeared to cuff him. \u201cWould you guys just allow me to take off my hoodie? Please?\u2026Please, please, because my anxiety gets so bad\u2026\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aIZXI5vfsM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6aIZXI5vfsM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The candid footage allows viewers a peak behind the curtain at Jones distressed state, his apparent intoxication, and some of the underlying familial and mental health issues that may be plaguing him. It is also the latest example of Jones\u2019s downward trajectory \u2013 a spiral that encapsulates every aspect of his life outside of the UFC octagon, where he remains champion.</p> <p>Earlier this week, Jones pleaded guilty to a DWI and will avoid jail time as long as he follows the terms of a plea agreement. According to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/ufc/story/_/id/28978665/jon-jones-agrees-plea-deal-dwi-charge-new-mexico\">agreement</a>, Jones will serve 96 consecutive hours in a county Community Custody Program, complete 48 hours of community service, pay a $500 fine, and will remain on supervised probation for a year. He will also wear an ankle bracelet that will track his movements. All the other charges against him, including negligent use of a firearm and possession of an open container of alcohol, were dropped.</p> <p>Afterwards, Jones released a public<a href=\"https://twitter.com/arielhelwani/status/1245122692560420869?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=https://www.sportbible.com/ufc/mma-news-jon-jones-makes-emotional-first-statement-following-last-weeks-arrest-20200401\"> statement</a>, where he admitted to an \u201cunhealthy relationship with alcohol\u201d:</p> <p>\u201cWhile we all work to understand and cope with stress and uncertainties surrounding the current state of our world, I want to express how truly disappointed I am that I have become the source of a negative headline again, especially during these trying times,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI am disappointed for letting down the people I care about the most - my family, friends and my fans. This morning I entered into a plea deal with the Albuquerque DA\u2019s office. I accept full responsibility for my actions, and I know that I have some personal work to do to which involves the unhealthy relationship I have with alcohol.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Jones\u2019s admission and the concerning footage, it remains unclear whether Jones will receive the help he needs from either the legal system or the organization that employs him. While <a href=\"https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2020/3/26/21195774/most-stupid-athlete-ever-fighters-react-to-jon-jones-dwi-and-negligent-use-of-firearm-charges\">several fighters have openly criticized and mocked Jones</a> following his latest run-in with the law, the champion\u2019s bitter rival, Daniel Cormier, did not see this as a cause for celebration, instead imploring the UFC to get involved to help Jones.</p> <p>\u201cI think the UFC needs to save him,\u201d Cormier told <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/28972781/daniel-cormier-ufc-needs-take-measures-help-jon-jones\">ESPN</a>. \u201cKeep him, but then really try to help him try to get better.\u201d</p> <p>While the UFC has stripped Jones of his light heavyweight title in the past, it was not always due to his legal troubles. Jones was first stripped of the title in 2015 following the felony hit-and-run charge. Then, in 2016, Jones was stripped of the interim title after failing a pre-fight drug test in connection with his title unification bout scheduled for UFC 200. In September 2017, Jones was stripped for a third time after he tested positive for the banned steroid turinabol.</p> <p>When Jones was stripped of the interim title in 2016, UFC president Dana White revealed that he would \u201cnever take the risk of headlining a show with Jon Jones again\u201d. Since then, Jones has headlined five separate events, including as recently as UFC 247 in February 2020. Given how quickly White reconsidered his ruling on Jones, and the UFC limited action with regards to Jones\u2019s legal trouble, it is unlikely that the promotion will take any action against the UFC champion for his latest infraction.</p> <p>It is evidently clear that the 32-year-old fighter is in need of help for his potential mental health issues and substance abuse. And while the NHL has a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CarBombBoom13/status/1051910130898329601?s=20\">player assistance program</a> and the NFL has an <a href=\"https://nflpaweb.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/PDFs/Agents/2016SOAPolicy_v2.pdf\">intervention program</a>, the UFC does not appear to have such a program in place. Yet given that the greatest fighter in a generation is in dire need of some serious help, it might be time for the UFC to implement such a program.</p>",

  "<p>In the century since March began, one series has emerged as the go-to distraction for the millions now sequestered in their living rooms: Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness. The bizarre documentary series on a feud between big cat owners, as well as about 95 other things, has been the No 1 program on Netflix\u2019s US platform since it premiered less than two weeks ago. And though the news and social media remain dominated by coronavirus coverage, the five hours of drama between outlandish characters in the disturbing American trade of private zoos has proved to be strange and fittingly unhinged counter-programming.

And few shows can counterweight a once-in-a-generation public health crisis quite like Tiger King, which is, to be clear, truly bananas. Tiger King is the Long Island iced tea of shows, if it was stirred with Tide Pods and spiked with moonshine. It jams your processing functions by throwing a semi-truck\u2019s worth of base interests at the wall, such as: actual tigers, polygamy, guns, genital piercings, a murder-for-hire plot, bad country music videos, a shock presidential campaign with branded condoms and meth. It\u2019s so crazy that a convicted drug trafficker from Florida who is allegedly the inspiration for Al Pacino\u2019s Scarface is the least remarkable person on the show. Which boils down to one intoxicating fact: for many, the horror of coronavirus is temporarily drowned out by Tiger King\u2019s MadLibs of peak American things \u2013 Joe finds his <em>presidential campaign manager </em>in the <em>ammo section </em>of <em>Wal</em><em>mart.</em></p> <p>The exposure of a Netflix show has, naturally, launched a cascade of news developments, another chapter unfolding in real time. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) <a href=\"https://www.peta.org/blog/netflix-tiger-king-big-cats-tiger-cubs/\">denounced the series</a> for not delving deep enough into the abuse of big cats in photo-ops and entertainment, and on Wednesday, a private zoo in Florida which had received tiger cubs from Joe was <a href=\"https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/regional/florida/tigers-removed-dade-city-wild-things-peta-lawsuit/67-04d37de8-f4b1-4621-99c5-ebd72ff26c32\">shut down by authorities</a>. Many of the main participants have weighed into the public commentary, feeding into another round of competing narratives. Though he is in prison in Texas, Joe somehow continues to post on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GWZoo/\">his Facebook page</a> (he wants Brad Pitt to play him in the miniseries). Both Bhagavan \u201cDoc\u201d Antle, who called the series \u201c<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/docantlesafari/photos/rpp.1948105035266641/2764264420317361/?type=3&amp;theater\">sensationalized entertainment</a>\u201d, and Joe\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/entertainment/doc-antle-jeff-lowe-tiger-king/index.html\">ex-business partner Jeff Lowe</a> have disputed their portrayals, as has Baskin, who claimed she was misled in a <a href=\"https://bigcatrescue.org/refuting-netflix-tiger-king/\">blogpost</a>.

And because truly, there is no end to content, Tiger King cast members, including Lowe, are now <a href=\"https://toofab.com/2020/04/01/tiger-king-castmembers-join-cameo-to-bring-personalized-fan-messages/\">selling personalized fan messages</a> via the app Cameo for between $50 to $108.</p> <p>Much of the online chatter has revolved around Baskin, an eccentric flower-crowned big cat sanctuary owner in Florida whom Joe despised and frequently accused of murdering her ex-husband, Don Lewis, who disappeared in 1997. (Baskin has flatly denied the accusations, and she was never charged). Though it makes no claims, the show leaves Baskin\u2019s innocence up for interpretation. (Asked by the New York Times if he had a theory on Lewis\u2019s disappearance, Goode replied: \u201cI do and I\u2019d rather not share that publicly.\u201d) The internet has run with it. The show\u2019s takeaway should arguably be the sickening state of big cat ownership in the states, but in the mental overload of a pandemic, whether or not Baskin killed her husband has become the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tiger-king-carole-baskin-kill-don-lewis-clues/\">hot internet topic</a>, as has Baskin\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/officerdaddo/status/1244326621244542976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1244326621244542976&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2020%2F03%2F30%2Fthe-best-tiger-king-memes-almost-as-good-as-the-netflix-show-itself%2F\">signature greeting</a> \u2013 \u201cHello all you cool cats and kittens\u201d \u2013 now a Tiger King fan signal.

A Florida sheriff told CNN he <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/entertainment/tiger-king-cold-case-sheriff-trnd/index.html\">has received tip calls for the case</a> (none were relevant) and called for leads (the series \u201ccertainly spun it a certain way for entertainment purposes\u201d, he said of the case).</p> <p>That entertainment, really, is the heart of Tiger King\u2019s maddening yet predictable appeal. In this five-alarm fire time, the desire for something to tap the pressure valve is high. And when so many are isolated and anxious, brains fried and scared, a show up to the WTF-levels of the moment is a welcome point of communion. It\u2019s yet unclear if there will be an official Tiger King follow-up \u2013 \u201cAt the moment I\u2019m not contemplating doing more on this at all. Let\u2019s see what happens. We\u2019re just taking a deep breath,\u201d Goode told the Times. And it\u2019s still unknown when life will go back to normal, if loved ones will be OK, how jobs and livelihoods will sustain. But there is one small certainty, at least for the moment: if you step into the Tiger King universe, you\u2019re not alone, for the content train barrels on.</p>",
  "<p>US buyers waving wads of cash managed to wrest control of a consignment of masks as it was about to be dispatched from China to one of the worst-hit coronavirus areas of France, according to two French officials.</p> \n<p>The masks were on a plane at Shanghai airport that was ready to take off when the US buyers turned up and offered three times what their French counterparts were paying.</p> \n<p>Jean Rottner, a doctor and president of the GrandEst regional council, said part of the order of several million masks heading for the region, where intensive care units are inundated with Covid-19 patients, had been lost to the buyers.</p> \n<p>\u201cOn the tarmac, they arrive, get the cash out \u2026 so we really have to fight,\u201d he told RTL radio.</p> \n<p>Rottner would not identify the buyers, who they were working for or which US state the cargo was flown to, but another French official also involved in procuring masks from China said the group were acting for the US government.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/deaths-comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe icing on the cake, there is a foreign country that paid three times the price of the cargo on the tarmac,\u201d R\u00e9naud Muselier, the head of the south-eastern Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur region, <a href=\"https://www.bfmtv.com/mediaplayer/video/renaud-muselier-confirme-que-des-masques-commandes-par-la-france-ont-ete-rachetes-en-cash-par-des-americains-sur-le-tarmac-en-chine-1235752.html\">told</a> the French channel, BFMTV. The Guardian has contacted the US state department for comment.</p> \n<p>A senior administration official told AFP \u201cthe United States government has not purchased any masks intended for delivery from China to France. Reports to the contrary are completely false.\u201d</p> \n<p>Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau described such reports as \u201cconcerning and asked officials to look into similar claims that masks were being diverted away from his country.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need to make sure that equipment that is destined for Canada gets to and stays in Canada, and I\u2019ve asked ministers to follow up on these particular reports,\u201d he said on Thursday.</p> \n<p>At a press conference in Brazil on Wednesday, the health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, said recent attempts by Bras\u00edlia to purchase protection gear such as gloves and masks from China had fallen through.</p> \n<p>\u201cToday the US sent 23 of their biggest cargo planes to China to pick up the material they had acquired. Many of our purchases, which we had hoped to confirm in order to supply [our health system], fell through,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole world wants [these things] too. There is a problem of hyper-demand.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mandetta asked ordinary Brazilians to make themselves homemade masks from pieces of cloth so that health professionals could have the remaining professional equipment.</p> \n<p>As the pandemic worsens, panicked governments have been accused of using questionable methods to acquire supplies in the battle against the coronavirus. Tactics have ranged from blocking exports of medical supplies to sending spies on clandestine missions to find tests.</p> \n<p>Fearing shortages and a strain on their health systems, a number of states, including France, Germany and Russia, have taken measures such as stockpiling masks and hazardous materials, or hazmat suits. This has meant limiting exports of protective medical equipment.</p> \n<p>Turkey allegedly went further, not only <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-04/virus-free-turkey-restricts-exports-of-medical-protective-gear\">banning exports</a> of protective gear but also appearing to renege on foreign sales of masks that had already been paid for.</p> \n<p>Reports by the Belgian newspaper <a href=\"https://plus.lesoir.be/287643/article/2020-03-16/coronavirus-apres-lepisode-des-faux-masques-turcs-la-belgique-cherche-des\">Le Soir</a> and the Italian daily <a href=\"https://www.corriere.it/dataroom-milena-gabanelli/20_marzo_19/coronavirus-200-mila-mascherine-gli-ospedali-italiani-bloccate-ad-ankara-15-giorni-2b0ea5be-695d-11ea-913c-55c2df06d574.shtml?fbclid=IwAR0Doe05YcX120uBogX8FXm4rAf4Xcqp0B1GusaedRKvqzFh5RsVht8S0Fg\">Corriere della Sera</a> said Turkish-made masks destined for those countries had never arrived. In Italy, it took more than two weeks following a phone call from the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, for the masks to be released. In Belgium, supplies had still not been delivered despite a formal police complaint from the country\u2019s health ministry. <br><br> Turkey has also threatened to commandeer domestic mask producers to make sure they are provided only to the state. The local news outlet Hurriyet quoted the interior minister, S\u00fcleyman Soylu, as saying that authorities would seize factories if companies did not agree to sell on an exclusive basis to the health ministry.</p> \n<p>China, the world\u2019s largest mask manufacturer, was the first country to be hit by the Covid-19 outbreak and was also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/business/masks-china-coronavirus.html\">accused</a> of stashing its supplies. It has, however, since been one of the few countries to go the other way, selling or donating millions of masks to Europe. One such shipment bound for Italy went through the Czech Republic, where it was seized by authorities under disputed circumstances.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/coronavirus-world-map-countries-most-cases-and-deaths\">Coronavirus world map: which countries have the most cases and deaths?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Czech authorities denied allegations of state-backed stealing by Giornale Radio Rai, the radio news arm of Italy\u2019s public broadcasting company, RAI. They said the masks had made their way to a warehouse north of Prague, where they were confiscated in an anti-trafficking operation. The foreign minister, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Pet\u0159\u00ed\u010dek, later said his government had sent 110,000 masks to Rome as compensation.</p> \n<p>A similar incident occurred in Kenya, where a shipment of up to 6m masks bound for Germany mysteriously disappeared while passing through the east African country, although there has been no suggestion that the government was responsible.</p> \n<p>Drugs and coronavirus tests are also being coveted around the globe. After the US president suggested, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/coronavirus-cure-fact-check-hydroxychloroquine-trump\">without fully backed scientific evidence</a>, that a common anti-malaria drug could treat Covid-19, India immediately moved to ban exports of hydroxychloroquine.</p> \n<p>Israel\u2019s Mossad intelligence agency has launched several clandestine international operations to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/israeli-spies-source-100000-coronavirus-tests-covert-foreign-mission\">fly in hundreds of thousands of coronavirus testing kits</a>.</p> \n<p>Local media reports, citing unidentified medical and intelligence officials, suggested the kits had been bought from an enemy state that would not want such a deal to be made public.

  "<p>We are in the third week of school closures and general <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/23/manhattan-streets-empty-as-new-york-city-goes-into-coronavirus-lockdown-video\">lock</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/23/manhattan-streets-empty-as-new-york-city-goes-into-coronavirus-lockdown-video\">down in New York</a> and I keep thinking of the movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/30/home-alone-review-yuletide-rerelease\">Home Alone</a>. Famously in that film, Kevin went wild for his first few days off the grid, eating ice-cream for dinner and jumping on the furniture. After that, he tidied up and discovered that order and structure are the only way to live. When his mum came home at the end of the movie, he had reached a state of wisdom.</p> <p>The trajectory from school\u2019s out abandonment to set routine held true for the first two weeks at home. Now we\u2019re in a new phase \u2013 one not covered by the three-act structure. If this pandemic has exposed anything, it\u2019s how arbitrary many of the things we take for granted really are, including the way we organise our time. We dossed about, we knuckled down, and then this week we hit a wall. \u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d said my kids when I set up the equipment for home-school lessons. I had no real desire to make them. We are unravelling and resetting, again.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just school. For those lucky enough to be healthy and have jobs, the mood veers wildly between anxiety and optimism. Several female friends report unwanted erotic dreams about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/new-york-coronavirus-cuomo-us-new-normal\">Andrew Cuomo</a>, the governor of New York and very much man of the hour. (It begs an unthinkable analogy with Rudi Giuliani after 9/11.) We are all working on our time management skills, while realising that the only really valuable time management tool is a wife to watch the kids.</p> <p>Outside the house, meanwhile, things get stranger. So far, neighbourliness still reigns; within our own networks, there\u2019s a sense of solidarity. But there is an increasingly odd dynamic in public. In the supermarket, we glare at each other for passing too close. Hostility lurks near the surface. In the laundry room, someone stands three inches from me while loading the drier above mine. \u201cHey,\u201d I snap. \u201cSorry,\u201d he says. It\u2019s all very awkward.</p> <p>During the middle of the week, news reports say the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is about to recommend everyone <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/apr/01/us-coronavirus-news-donald-trump-white-house-live-latest?page=with:block-5e84ab158f087564da1e3d94\">wear a mask</a> outside the house. It\u2019s impossible to get one on Amazon and so we walk to a weird toy store in my neighbourhood, still open via a loophole that classifies sellers of \u201coffice supplies\u201d as essential businesses, that is rumoured to have masks. The entrance is shuttered, but like something from a bad dystopian movie, after we\u2019ve milled about on the sidewalk for a minute, someone sees us and opens the grille half way. We duck in. It\u2019s a maximum of six masks per person, for $60 \u2013 10 times what it should cost \u2013 and I\u2019m only too happy to pay.</p> <p>At 7pm that night, we go out on our terrace and clap for the hospital workers. People bang pots and pans. There is universal cheering. I had wondered if the novelty of this would wear off, too, diminishing through gratitude fatigue. But it hasn\u2019t. The cheering, perhaps the real barometer of the city\u2019s mood, is different from one day to the next. It keeps getting louder.</p> <p>\u2022 Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>Sennheiser\u2019s second-generation high-end true wireless earbuds gain noise cancelling and longer battery life to do battle with Sony and Apple.</p> <p>The German firm\u2019s first earbuds were some of the best-sounding available.

The case fully charges the earbuds three times for a total of up to 28 hours of playback.</p> <p>The earbuds magnetically snap into place in the case to charge and store them, with a flip-top lid also held in place by a magnet. A USB-C socket on the back takes care of charging, which takes about 90 minutes via cable. A 10-minute charge provides enough for about 90 minutes of playback from empty.</p> <p>As with most true wireless earbuds, the Momentum True Wireless 2 are not repairable and the batteries are not replaceable. The batteries are rated for 500 full charge cycles, dropping to 80% capacity afterwards. Each earbud and the case are available separately for replacement, but Sennheiser does not operate a trade-in or recycling scheme, nor are the earbuds made using any recycled materials.</p> <h2>Connectivity and controls</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a9930e310538090378309b1c1e0ffc8792ee49d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a9930e310538090378309b1c1e0ffc8792ee49d/1167_896_2590_1554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The silver discs are touch-sensitive gesture panels for controlling your music, including the often missed volume adjustment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Momentum True Wireless 2 support Bluetooth 5 and had a rock-solid connection to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/07/iphone-11-pro-the-best-small-phone-available\">iPhone 11 Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/19/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-back-to-the-folding-flip-phone-future\">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip</a>, even in congested areas.</p> <p>The earbuds support the standard SBC Bluetooth audio format, as well as the improved AAC and aptX, but not Qualcomm\u2019s aptX Low Latency, which their predecessors did. Not many devices support aptX LL, so while gamers might be put out, the majority of users won\u2019t care. Lipsync wasn\u2019t an issue with any video apps.</p> <p>Only the right earbud can be used independently, which is disappointing.</p> <p>The metal cap of each earbud is a touch panel for controls, supporting single, double and triple gestures, plus a tap and hold that adjusts volume by default. Each gesture can be configured to different actions on each earbud using the Smart Control app, including pause/play, skip track, activating your phone\u2019s voice assistant, turning on ANC or the ambient listening mode.</p> <p>Generally the touch panels work great, although they are further up your ear than you might expect at first because of the size of the earbuds.</p> <p>Music is paused when an earbud is removed, resuming when reinserted.</p> <h2>Sound and ANC</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4dee09c716dfbba25520fb437c2ccc5e0c2d90cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4dee09c716dfbba25520fb437c2ccc5e0c2d90cb/1291_904_2482_1489/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sennheiser\u2019s detail-rich sound comes through well in these earbuds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Expensive, high-end earbuds like these need to deliver on sound quality. The Momentum True Wireless 2 are some of the best-sounding true wireless earbuds you can buy.</p> <p>They have a very clean and detailed sound, with excellent separation of instruments and tones. Mids and treble are rich and detailed and there\u2019s plenty of punch in the low end without it being overbearing, with well-controlled highs.</p> <p>They sound great with practically every genre. Feed them something like Dr Dre\u2019s The Next Episode and you\u2019re treated to a track full of attack and aggression, while Darude\u2019s classic Sandstorm is full of high energy and precision. They kept up with The Who\u2019s cluttered Baba O\u2019Riley, while orchestral pieces were delivered with the authority and depth required.</p> <p>If I was to nitpick, I\u2019d say they were a bit too clean for a raw and full-blooded rendition of Nirvana\u2019s Smells Like Teen Spirit, and lacked a bit of warmth in Ella Fitzgerald\u2019s version of Summertime.</p> <p>Overall they sound great, delivering sparkling audio and revealing new things in well-worn tracks, second only to Sony\u2019s WF-1000XM3.</p> <p>The earbuds also have active noise cancelling, which on top of the good noise isolation of the silicone eartips helps to reduce background drone significantly. They dealt with engine noise and the drones of fans in an office well, which means they should help on a plane, but struggled with more complex disruptions such as typing, chatting, road noise and similar.</p> <p>They were not as effective as Sony\u2019s WF-1000XM3 or Apple\u2019s AirPods Pro, being similar in level to Libratone Track Air+ but with better passive isolation.</p> <h2>Observations</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b442c5913453b10fcdd2a6abd63ba4008a6773f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b442c5913453b10fcdd2a6abd63ba4008a6773f9/673_286_3579_2148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Metal contacts on each earbud take care of charging in the case, while a presence sensor can detect when they\u2019re worn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The ambient sound mode is good, pausing the music by default and allowing you to have a quick conversation without taking them out or listen out for announcements or road noise while commuting.</p></li> <li><p>Call quality was good with optional sidetone: callers said I sounded loud and clear, even while a little background noise was let through in noisy environments.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Price</h2> <p>The Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2 cost <a href=\"https://en-uk.sennheiser.com/momentumtruewireless-2\">\u00a3279</a> and will begin shipping in April.</p> <p>For comparison, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/13/amazon-echo-buds-review-alexa-in-your-ear-with-bose-noise-reduction\">Amazon\u2019s Echo Buds</a> cost <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07FWGBDN6\">\u00a3119.99</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/20/libratone-track-air-review-the-noise-cancelling-airpods-apple-wont-give-you\">Libratone Track Air+</a> cost <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07SP524XM/\">\u00a3179</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/14/sony-wf-1000xm3-review-updated-noise-cancelling-earbuds-sound-great\">Sony WF-1000XM3</a> cost <a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/sony-wf-1000xm3-noise-cancelling-true-wireless-bluetooth-nfc-in-ear-headphones-with-mic-remote/black/p4237421\">\u00a3169</a>, Apple\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/09/airpods-pro-review-a-touch-of-apple-magic\">AirPods Pro</a> cost <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MWP22ZM/A/airpods-pro\">\u00a3249</a>, while non-ANC earbuds such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/05/galaxy-buds-review-samsungs-airpod-killers-that-are-now-for-everyone\">Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Buds+</a> cost <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/wearables/galaxy-buds-plus-r175/SM-R175NZWAEUA/buy/\">\u00a3159</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/20/jabra-elite-75t-review-small-and-long-lasting-airpod-beaters\">Jabra\u2019s Elite 75t</a> cost <a href=\"https://www.jabra.co.uk/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-75t/\">\u00a3169.99</a>.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>The Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2 are a great set of high-end true wireless earbuds that tick most boxes.</p> <p>They sound fantastic, particularly if you are a fan of clean, controlled and highly detailed sound. They last a long time between charges, have a solid set of gesture controls including volume adjustment, and have rock-solid Bluetooth connectivity with support for SBC, AAC and aptX.</p> <p>The earbuds also have excellent passive noise isolation and good but not class-leading noise cancelling.

  "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Josh Taylor bringing you the main stories on Friday 3 April.</p> <h2>Single-digit growth rate continues</h2> <p>The rate of the number of new confirmed cases of coronavirus has continued to slow in single digits, passing over 5,300 confirmed cases in Australia on Friday.</p> <p>Two more deaths were recorded in Victoria and New South Wales.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s chief health officer, Brendan Murphy, said he was \u201cquietly pleased\u201d with the numbers slowing, but community transmissions had been growing. There are now 300 community transmission cases in Sydney, 60 in Melbourne and 30 in Brisbane.</p> <h2>National cabinet moves to \u2018suppression\u2019 phase</h2> <p>The prime minister, Scott Morrison, says the national cabinet is moving from a phase of reacting to slow the spread of the virus to reviewing the measures put in place around restrictions and support. Morrison said if the rate had continued as it was a few weeks ago there would now be 10,000 cases, almost twice the current number.</p> <p>Morrison said after this phase, the national cabinet would move into a recovery phase.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian Australia's coronavirus email signup button\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a></figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Commercial tenancy agreement delayed</h2> <p>The national cabinet has yet to agree to an industry code of practice between businesses and their landlords. The mandatory code would potentially require landlords whose tenants have a turnover of less than $50m and are participating in the jobkeeper program to waive rent in proportion to the loss of turnover for that business.</p> <p>Morrison said how that works will be negotiated between the tenant and the landlord.</p> <p>For residential tenancies, Morrison said there was a moratorium (which some have argued is not legally enforceable) on evictions, but he said that didn\u2019t mean there was a moratorium on rent. He said state and territory treasurers were still working on policies on residential rents.</p> <h2>Modelling to be released</h2> <p>Morrison announced modelling for how many cases and deaths Australia is expected to see from coronavirus will be released by the government next week after more work, and review by the national cabinet.</p> <p>There will also be a national dashboard of coronavirus data pooled from all the states and territories updated every afternoon. It is expected it will be available in the next few days.</p> <h2>Regional workers</h2> <p>Anyone on a working visa wishing to go work in a regional area where there is work will need to register with the government as self-isolating, and remain in isolation for 14 days before they\u2019re allowed to travel to regional areas.</p> <p>Local government workers are also not eligible for the jobkeeper program, as they are the responsibility of the states and territories.</p> <h2>NSW cruise ship stand-off ends</h2> <p>The NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, announced that two Carnival ships that had been off the coast of the state had departed overnight, and another five Royal Caribbean ships would be leaving for their port of origin after refuelling and restocking on the weekend.</p> <p>A man was removed from the now-infamous Ruby Princess overnight for medical treatment. There are still six cruise ships off the coast of NSW, and 19 across Australia.</p> <h2>Asic warns real estate agents over super advice</h2> <p>The financial regulator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/03/australian-real-estate-agents-face-fines-and-jail-if-tenants-told-to-use-super-to-pay-rent\">has told real estate agent institutes</a> in a letter to advise agents not to suggest renters in financial hardship use the up to $20,000 people can access from superannuation in order to pay their rent. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has warned such advice would be in breach of the Corporations Act, and those in violation of the law could face fines of up to $1.6m for companies, or five years jail for individuals.</p> <h2>What you need to know: get the most important information from some of our key explainers</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/03/social-distancing-rules-australia-coronavirus-strict-new-laws-legal-illegal-state-physical-restrictions-guidelines-explained-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa-two-person-rule\">Australia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare: what do the Australian government\u2019s coronavirus changes mean for my family?</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/australias-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-explained-can-i-still-visit-my-partner-and-other-questions\">Australia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/apr/01/when-is-it-legal-to-leave-your-home\">Full Story podcast: when is it legal to leave your home?</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/2020/apr/01/is-australia-flattening-the-coronavirus-curve-look-at-the-charts-\">Is Australia flattening the coronavirus curve?

But villagers say the pandemic has strengthened the hand of criminals against the already reduced authorities.</p> <p>\u201cThe invaders know that this disease is weakening the inspection bodies even more,\u201d one of the villagers, Awapy Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau, told the environmental group.</p> <p>WWF Brazil plans to donate 14 drones to indigenous communities and local governments so they can conduct their own real-time surveillance. \u201cNever has this been more important than during the current global health crisis, when official monitoring is being scaled back, bringing the threat of an escalation of invasions on indigenous territories\u201d said Mike Barrett, executive director of science and conservation at WWF UK.</p> <p>On the first flight over Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau territory, locals discovered 1.4 hectares had been cleared without their knowledge last year and they have recently spotted planes dropping grass seeds on the area so the land can be used for cattle grazing.</p> <p>The Yanomami territory in Roraima state has seen an influx of illegal miners. Although this started before the pandemic, environmental groups fear the trend will accelerate because the crisis has pushed up the price of gold and the economic downturn that is forecast to follow will push more people to seek another source of income.</p> <p>Tensions over land and natural resources have been rising for some time, sometimes leading to murderous violence. On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://noticias.uol.com.br/colunas/rubens-valente/2020/03/31/mais-um-lider-guajajara-e-morto-em-terra-indigena-no-maranhao.htm\">Brazilian media</a> reported the killing of an indigenous forest guardian in Maranh\u00e3o.

Up to 90% of the pre-Columbian population of the Americas may have been wiped out by measles, smallpox and other diseases brought by European invaders in the 16th and 17th centuries, according to recent studies.</p> <p>Many indigenous people are now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/south-america-indigenous-groups-coronavirus-brazil-colombia\">retreating to their villages</a> in the forest and blocking outside traffic. They have put out an appeal for extra food and medical assistance, and decried the government\u2019s handling of the crisis, which they say has made a bad situation worse.</p> <p>Although the government has imposed restrictions on visitors to indigenous territory due to health concerns, this could work to the benefit of criminals, said Antonio Oviedo, monitoring coordinator of Brazil\u2019s biggest environmental NGO, Instituto Socioambiental.</p> <p>\u201cThere are rules forbidding entry into indigenous lands and conservation areas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut land grabbers, illegal loggers and illegal miners do not follow the rules.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>\u2018I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space,\u201d says Hamlet. He should be so lucky. A lot of plays in the history of drama deal with self-imposed or enforced isolation. Here are just a few to remind us that our current situation is not without precedent.</p> <h2>Sophocles\u2019s Philoctetes (409BC)</h2> <p>Spare a thought for Sophocles\u2019s hero. He\u2019s been dumped on the isle of Lemnos for nine years with a festering snake bite that stinks to high heaven \u2013 that\u2019s why the Greeks abandoned him en route for Troy. Mind you, he\u2019s not without company: Odysseus and Neoptolemus turn up to trick him into returning since they need his expertise as an archer. There\u2019s an ironically happy ending, but Sophocles is the first great dramatist to explore the corrosive effect of isolation.</p> <h2>John Galsworthy\u2019s Justice (1910)</h2> <p>Can plays do any good? This one is often cited because the wordless central scene shows a young clerk, sent to prison for forgery, locked up alone and beating furiously and helplessly on his cell door. Winston Churchill, on his sixth evening as home secretary, went to the first night and was so shocked by what he saw that he changed the law on solitary confinement and ordered that political prisoners, including militant suffragettes, be treated differently from hardened criminals.</p> <h2>Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s Huis Clos (1944)</h2> <p>\u201cHell is other people,\u201d is the line everyone remembers from Sartre\u2019s tragedy of confinement: one that shows a neurotic pacifist, a female infanticide and a lesbian postal worker locked up together for eternity. Even though dead, the trio seek to destroy each other. But you could argue that Sartre\u2019s gloomy message is contradicted by our current crisis, where isolation is encouraging charity and goodwill. The play\u2019s real pertinence comes from the Beckettian final line, \u201c<em>Eh bien, continuons</em>,\u201d as the trio confront an unending fractious co-existence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b8eb9cf4022ff1aa0d00a38063a3c7dc3b5e52c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b8eb9cf4022ff1aa0d00a38063a3c7dc3b5e52c/186_241_4713_2830/1000..jpg\" alt=\"No escape \u2026 Ian McKellen and Owen Teale in No Man\u2019s Land.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No escape \u2026 Ian McKellen and Owen Teale in No Man\u2019s Land.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Persson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Harold Pinter\u2019s No Man\u2019s Land (1975)</h2> <p>Pinter had several alternative titles for this bleakly brilliant play: A Tomb of Honour, The Last Toast, Closing Time, Night Quartet. All reek of desolation and finality. Yet there is also wit and humour in the play, which shows Spooner, a minor pub-poet, seeking to penetrate the drink-fuelled defences of a self-immured writer, Hirst. There is much comedy in their canter through an imagined past and a strange gallantry about Spooner\u2019s final attempt to rescue Hirst from a permanent entombment.</p> <h2>Samuel Beckett\u2019s Footfalls (1976)</h2> <p>Beckett was the poet of terminal stages, and all his plays deal, in one way or another, with confinement or solitude. This, however, is one of the most haunting in the way the physical action perfectly embodies the theme. We watch as May, a middle-aged woman, paces relentlessly up and down a narrow strip of stage communing with her bedridden mother whom we hear but do not see. It is both an image of filial servitude and of timeless human suffering. Take May out of her setting, as a production once did by having her roam about the theatre, and Beckett\u2019s vision is shattered.</p> <h2>Caryl Churchill\u2019s Imp (2019)</h2> <p>Churchill often deals in big social themes but this play \u2013 part of a quartet seen at the Royal Court last September \u2013 had an eerie, claustrophobic resonance. The central image was of a pair of ageing cousins cooped up together in uneasy harmony and bound together by a dark secret. They have a pair of young visitors, but there was an element of the comic-macabre about the relationship between Toby Jones\u2019s depressive Jimmy and Deborah Findlay\u2019s quietly murderous Dot. It says a lot about the play\u2019s suggestive power that you wonder how they would cope with our current enforced lockdown.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/dua-lipa\">Dua Lipa</a> knew two things before starting the follow-up to her massive self-titled 2017 debut: she would call it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/27/dua-lipa-future-nostalgia-review\">Future Nostalgia</a>, and it would be \u201can album that was really fun and made me wanna dance and removed the outside world\u201d, she says. Few albums have fulfilled their intended purpose faster. Future Nostalgia was meant to arrive today, until an online leak brought it forward to the first Friday of Britain\u2019s coronavirus lockdown. Lipa wasn\u2019t sure it felt right to release it during the pandemic, but accurately concluded that her brilliant disco-wreathed anthems-in-waiting \u2013 the kind that transform kitchen tiles into a makeshift Studio 54 \u2013 might distract fans from the news.</p> <p>At the very least, a day of radio interviews and unceasing congrats stopped the 24-year-old from stressing about when to take her government-sanctioned daily walk. We FaceTime in the early evening of Future Nostalgia\u2019s premature birthday, Lipa at ease in a Christopher Kane \u201cTechno Sexual\u201d jumper, modish straw-on-tarmac hair tied up, saucer eyes unadorned. Like everyone, she has been self-isolating, eating chips and watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/31/a-zoologists-view-of-tiger-king-a-crass-expose-that-could-do-some-good\">Tiger King</a>. Unlike everyone, she is doing it in a plush Airbnb (her London flat flooded) with her model boyfriend <a href=\"https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/fashion/article/dua-lipa-anwar-hadid-couple-dressing\">Anwar Hadid</a> (brother of models Gigi and Bella). Later, she will be conference-calling friends and family to \u201cdrink and dance through the phone\u201d.</p> <p>Although Lipa says today has felt like Christmas, it is still an anticlimactic arrival for an album that the British music industry has been banking on. Hers is the rare homegrown success not belonging to anyone named Sheeran or Adele, born from no-nonsense mega-pop in the vein of Britney and her idol Pink. In 2017, Lipa was the most-streamed female musician in the world. A year later, she became the first female solo artist to get five Brits nominations (she won two), and the youngest woman to break 1bn YouTube views with her video for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2qgadSvNyU\">New Rules</a>, the single that transformed her from pop journeywoman to superstar.

At 11 tracks, the focused Future Nostalgia bucks pop\u2019s trend for bloated, spread-betting albums that try to please all-comers. But her initial intention for the record \u2013 to have fun and ignore the world \u2013 came after online criticism threatened to dent her self-worth. \u201cPeople almost made me feel bad about my achievements, or didn\u2019t allow me to feel proud of the things that I\u2019ve done because they made me feel like I was almost unworthy of them,\u201d she says. \u201cEven though I know I\u2019ve worked really hard and I did so much of the work, the performances and behind the scenes.\u201d</p> <p>There are two key words here, the first being \u201calmost\u201d: Lipa is indomitable, not given to vulnerability, or at least not to showing it. The second is \u201cwork\u201d: Lipa\u2019s parents are Kosovar-Albanian Muslim immigrants who fled war-torn Kosovo for the UK in 1992. She was born in 1995, and lived in London until the family returned to Pristina when she was 10. At 15, she came back to pursue pop stardom, persuading her parents she would have a better chance of getting into a British university if she finished school here. Where most kids would go wild, Lipa grafted, pestered people with her demos and became an assiduous networker (the Instagram page for Girls Collective, a DIY talent agency she started with five friends, is still live). One connection led to another and she signed first with Lana Del Rey\u2019s management team, then to Warner Music.</p> <p>It took two years from releasing her debut single, New Love \u2013 showing off her trademark bungee-jump vocals and ex-vanquishing MO \u2013 to her first album. The latter was repeatedly delayed, Lipa a prime study of how pop careers build slowly and evolve publicly in the streaming era \u2013 and living proof of the \u201cadaptability\u201d she admired in her parents. \u201cWith every song, the momentum was building, but only tiny little bits,\u201d she says. \u201cI was doing new things, I was learning what was expected of me, how to be in front of a camera, how to better the last performance.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/27/dua-lipa-future-nostalgia-review\">Dua Lipa: Future Nostalgia review \u2013 a true pop visionary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But her singles were not charting well. By the time she released two successive collaborations \u2013 modern pop\u2019s stabilisers \u2013 fans worried she was destined for pop\u2019s dumper. Then she unleashed the video to New Rules, \u201cand it was like rocket fuel\u201d, she says, a feminist sleepover fever dream and instant classic. It takes place in a luxury Miami Beach hotel, which she approached to fund the video, not because her label had shut its wallet, but in a savvy cash grab that let her \u201cpush it to another level\u201d. She never doubted her career prospects. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think it was gonna happen like this.\u201d</p> <p>Reflecting pop\u2019s long game, Lipa won the Grammy for best new artist in 2019. The backlash took flight. \u201cPeople being like: \u2018She\u2019s been fucking best new artist for so long and she doesn\u2019t deserve that, blah blah blah,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cThere were times that I felt people were being so mean that when someone recognised me and said: \u2018I really like your music,\u2019 I\u2019d be like: \u2018Oh my God, not everyone hates me!\u2019\u201d She says this with self-aware melodrama, though it echoes recent sentiments from Billie Eilish and Britney Spears: how dismal it must feel to see your hard work burned up by hatred.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3d0e7cf38ffff942decc68efd955e0a8e1b728ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d0e7cf38ffff942decc68efd955e0a8e1b728ce/0_0_6439_8049/800..jpg\" alt=\"Dua Lipa.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dua Lipa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lipa hopes the #BeKind movement sparked by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/04/caroline-flack-authorities-to-review-pursuit-of-assault-case\">Caroline Flack</a>\u2019s death might improve online discourse. \u201cThe scrutiny not just on social media but in the media, especially towards women, is so intense and unkind and really trying to get a rise out of people,\u201d she says. \u201cThe tabloids know very well what they\u2019re doing, and it really affects everyone. You have to be made out of steel to not let words get to you. It\u2019s so sad that we have to learn lessons from somebody\u2019s death.\u201d</p> <p>But then, maybe we are a long way off when, as Lipa says, \u201ccertain leaders are inciting racism and almost making it acceptable for people to be racist and treating people in very vile and disgusting ways\u201d. British political parties are \u201cabsolutely\u201d sowing such division, she says. \u201cYou have people like Nigel Farage, who is very openly racist and that is just shocking, and there are people who beat around the bush. They\u2019re racist but \u2013 it\u2019s such a mindfuck \u2013 they have a lot of people fooled.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The scrutiny not just on social media but in the media, especially towards women, is so intense and unkind</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lipa is unusually specific about politics for a pop star of her stature. It\u2019s not just \u201cvote\u201d, it\u2019s \u201cvote Labour\u201d, or \u201cvote Bernie\u201d, or \u201cFUCK THE PATRIARCHY I AM DONE WITH THIS BULLSHIT HANDMAIDS TALE SHIT WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK\u201d after Alabama banned abortion. She credits her parents for her voice, saying she was raised \u201creally liberal\u201d. She is most concerned about UK immigration policy post-Brexit. Had it existed in the 90s, she thinks it would have stopped the Lipas fleeing Kosovo (where her mum was a lawyer, her dad a dentist-in-training) for the UK, where they worked as waiters and studied for new careers.</p> <p>\u201cIt upsets me that probably some of the younger generations of refugees don\u2019t really have the same opportunities that I was given because of the fortunate \u2013 or unfortunate \u2013 fact that my parents moved to London and I was born here and able to live my dream and do something on a global scale,\u201d she says. Whether post-Brexit Britain still offers those opportunities, \u201cwe\u2019re gonna have to see how everything works out\u201d, she says cautiously. Brexit has been upsetting: \u201cBeing from Kosovo, I know what it would mean for them to be a part of the EU and be accepted.\u201d</p> <p>It is an obvious thing to say about someone who frequently entertains packed arenas, but Lipa evidently wants to be heard. Although she occasionally jumps into the conversational deep end but grips the safety rail (a devout Labour supporter, she indicates that she is no Corbyn fan, but won\u2019t say so outright), she sticks to her chosen guns. She kept Future Nostalgia relatively short to hold listeners\u2019 attention spans. \u201cI really wanted to make sure there wasn\u2019t any tracks you could skip,\u201d she grins.</p> <p>Pop\u2019s detractors like to point out that it is an industry where artists conform to conventions. In the immortal words of Eilish: <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyDfgMOUjCI\">duh</a></em>. Lipa is a canny operator who understood that she had to play a certain game to reach the point where she could be herself. (Her ambition/achievement conversion rate is a big part of her aspirational appeal.) Lipa was surprised by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/11/this-years-male-dominated-brit-awards-have-an-issue-with-women\">the under-recognition of female talent at this year\u2019s Brits</a> \u2013 evidence, critics said, of the British industry\u2019s inability to develop female talent \u2013 but she is pragmatic about what might seem like a conservative feeder system where new acts spew out singles and accept every possible collaboration. \u201cArtists that are already well known get the upper hand, so you do have to get on those playlists as much as possible to be heard,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7f4fcf6c7ae0625d5aa89284c1f50d5df8bf3cda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f4fcf6c7ae0625d5aa89284c1f50d5df8bf3cda/0_0_4904_3247/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Dua Lipa at this year\u2019s Grammy awards.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dua Lipa at this year\u2019s Grammy awards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Polk/Rolling Stone/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Following Lipa\u2019s success, one such feeder system seemed to be getting young female acts to make their version of New Rules: Mabel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQKyDD9Yig\">Don\u2019t Call Me Up</a>, Ella Eyre\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnDvD7Ko3IM\">New Me</a> and Anne-Marie\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzD_yyEcp0M\">Friends</a> to name just three. (Incidentally, New Rules is the only one of Lipa\u2019s songs that she hasn\u2019t had a hand in writing.) She must have noticed. \u201cEr, have I noticed \u2026? I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve noticed \u2026\u201d she says, her game face dropping to reveal that she has absolutely noticed. \u201cBut that\u2019s OK, though!\u201d she says when called on it. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of different ways to say the same thing, make it honest and unique to you.\u201d She resists the idea that anyone is being told to recreate someone else\u2019s success. \u201cArtists do have a lot of control.\u201d</p> <p>Had Lipa tried to recreate New Rules for album two, \u201cI\u2019d just be in a vicious cycle\u201d, she says. She says she struggled to find her \u201clyrical language\u201d on her debut, feeling more at ease writing sad songs. \u201cI learned that I could write happy songs that are still really authentic and have the possibility of being cool and not seen as bubblegum.\u201d Most striking is how she sings about sex: mutually pleasurable, orgasmic transcendence mirrored in dazzling disco reveries. On Good in Bed, she nonchalantly celebrates \u201call that good pipe in the moonlight\u201d from a toxic ex-with-benefits. \u201cEverybody thinks that as a woman, you have to be so <em>careful</em> about how you portray yourself or how you talk about sex, and everything has to be really <em>sweet</em>,\u201d she says mockingly. \u201cIt\u2019s just very colloquial and how I chat with my mates.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t like to apologise if I don\u2019t believe I should be apologising for something</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Future Nostalgia ends with its lone ballad, the weighty Boys Will Be Boys, where a children\u2019s choir backs Lipa singing about how girls grow up faster in a world of male violence. She wanted to make something that felt like the moment the lights go on at the end of a party, \u201cso it would almost end a bit abruptly and maybe make you feel uncomfortable\u201d. She has grown less accommodating, a dynamic she dealt with in real life in January, when she attended Lizzo\u2019s Grammys afterparty at an LA strip club. After they were filmed throwing money at dancers with Rosal\u00eda, Lipa was accused of exploiting women, sparking the hashtag #dualipaisoverparty where users revelled in her \u201ccancellation\u201d.</p> <p>Lipa \u2013 who no longer goes on Twitter \u2013 did not respond. \u201cI don\u2019t like to apologise if I don\u2019t believe I should be apologising for something,\u201d she says now. \u201cI believe in supporting women in all fields of work. Nothing at that party was derogatory; everyone was just dancing and having fun.\u201d In our supposedly enlightened culture about sex work, she was surprised by the prudish response. \u201cThat\u2019s something we all have to work on,\u201d she says. \u201cNot every sex worker is being forced to do something they don\u2019t wanna do. I think a lot of the women found it really empowering and really like to dance.\u201d</p> <p>Women\u2019s work is always undermined, says Lipa. \u201cWe all have to work a little bit harder to be taken seriously, but it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re not used to doing,\u201d she says, rolling her eyes and grinning. She has pointedly described Future Nostalgia as \u201cfun\u201d even though she knows that is exactly the stick critics use to beat it with; that women in pop are only judged as \u201cauthentic\u201d when they are weeping by the piano. \u201cTime always tells,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cAnd in the meantime, I\u2019ll just work for people to take me seriously.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 and 7 April 2020. Dua Lipa\u2019s debut single was New Love, not Hotter Than Hell as an earlier version said.

  "<p>This is a piece about panic buying in the time of coronavirus, and maybe I should stop right there. None of us needs more panic in our lives right now. If there\u2019s one thing psychologists can agree on, it\u2019s that panicky behaviour is contagious. Every time we read an article telling us not to be selfish and ransack the supermarkets, it triggers the thought that food is running out and we must urgently get to the nearest Tesco and buy five packets of pasta and as many tinned tomatoes and lentils as we can carry.</p> \n<p>These are certainly unsettled times in which to feed ourselves. Over the past month, we have been exposed to an uncanny sight that has been almost unknown in Britain for decades: empty supermarket shelves. When you are not used to it, this sight does strange things to your insides.</p> \n<p>Two weeks ago, pre-lockdown, I popped to Sainsbury\u2019s on the way home from school with my 11-year-old son. He drags his heels at shopping, but I assured him I only wanted to buy potatoes. I had everything else I needed for a shepherd\u2019s pie. But we stopped in our tracks to see that there were no potatoes and indeed, no vegetables of any kind anywhere in the fresh produce aisle, except for a few sad packs of drooping mixed veg for stir fries. The locusts had been. I was aware that hand sanitiser and pasta and toilet roll were in short supply, but hadn\u2019t realised that the fresh and frozen produce aisles were now emptying, too. I suddenly felt shaky. The last time I had seen a food shop with so little actual stuff in it relative to the shelves was on a school trip to Soviet Russia 30 years ago. My son\u2019s eyes lit up: boring old food shopping had become a post-apocalyptic scavenger hunt. \u201cWill frozen roast potatoes work in a shepherd\u2019s pie?\u201d he exclaimed in the near-empty wastes of the frozen food section.</p> \n<p>What is generally called panic buying \u2013 a common human response to crisis \u2013 is not caused by food shortages per se, but by fear. At its root is a fear of scarcity, and this fear is self-fulfilling, because the more people anxiously stockpile, the more others get infected by the panic and the faster the food runs out. According to Steven Taylor, a clinical psychologist and author of The Psychology of Pandemics, which was published last year, there are parallels between the ways people are behaving now and the way they behaved during earlier pandemics such as the Spanish flu of 1918, when there was panic buying of Vicks VapoRub, and the 1968 flu pandemic, when food was looted from restaurants. The difference now, Taylor observes, is that the panic can escalate much faster via social media and online news.</p> \n<p>\u201cInevitably, someone posts dramatic photographs of panic buying,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cThis amplifies the sense of scarcity and perceived urgency, which leads to further panic buying.\u201d</p> \n<p>The American food writer Helen Rosner <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/we-are-all-irrational-panic-shoppers\" title=\"\">has noted</a> an element of \u201cfantasy\u201d to the shoppers who fill entire trolleys with cases of mineral water, given that \u201cstaying at home for a few weeks isn\u2019t quite nuclear holocaust\u201d. We need to keep reminding ourselves that there is still generally plenty of food going around, even if it does not always reach the right people at the right time. Prof Tim Benton, who is research director for emerging risks at Chatham House, a London thinktank, told me that the UK has \u201cfull warehouses\u201d of non-perishable food and that \u201cthe flow of fruit and vegetables from Europe is OK at the moment\u201d, although distribution has clearly been made much more challenging by the spread of coronavirus in Spain and Italy, and the fact that lorries carrying fresh foods have been subject to more delays and checks than before. But there is still food in the shops. Rationally, we don\u2019t need to panic.</p> \n<p>But who said the human relationship with food was fully rational? Many people reacted to news of the virus by rushing to the shops, as if the prospect of running low on coffee beans were more terrifying than the risk of exposing yourself or others to infection. One of these people was me. Along with a couple of extra bags of coffee, I stocked up on ground almonds for my daughter who loves to bake; and lemons because they improve everything.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\" no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Uncertainty breeds fear, and fear makes a person wonder whether there is enough butter in the fridge. The restrictions on our movement in recent days and weeks, coupled with a daily drip-feed of unease, have been unlike anything most of us can remember. We can\u2019t visit our elderly relatives or even find out whether we are infected or not, but we can at least stock our kitchens with sardines and long-life milk \u2013 or gin, as the case may be \u2013 to give us the sense that we are somehow prepared. As the Harvard epidemiologist Karestan Koenen says, \u201cfood buying helps us feel in control\u201d.</p> \n<p>The way we eat at any given time reflects our national state of mind. For 50 years or more in the UK, we have been eating with the largesse of a people who felt that food was an inexhaustible fountain. Unlike the wartime generation, we did not worry too much about wasting odds and ends or saving the bit of bread that was not mouldy, because we knew that there would always be another loaf. Nor did we have to keep track of the seasons, because in the never-ending summer of the supermarkets, blueberries could be shipped in for our pleasure no matter what the month. Yes, there were <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/society/food-banks\" title=\"\">food banks</a>, but most of the population could push the idea of scarcity far to the back of our minds. For many, these past few weeks have been a shock: a moment when almost everyone in the country felt at least a bit insecure about food, and started to realise that the fountain could dry up.</p> \n<p>In some ways, this has been a rare moment of clarity, when we finally recognise how much we owe to the low-paid \u201ckey workers\u201d who put in the hours to grow and harvest and pack and cook and deliver so that the rest of us can have food available at all times. But with that clarity comes a new unease. The panic buying and shortages \u2013 even if temporary \u2013 have revealed to us that our food system is built on a far less solid foundation than we imagined.</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>On 20 March, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, commented that people should buy only \u201cwhat they need and not more than what they need\u201d. You can tell that something radical has shifted in our attitudes to food shopping when the Conservative party \u2013 which for so long has defended the right of the food industry to sell us anything it likes, regardless of its effects on our health \u2013 starts asking people to restrict what they buy for the sake of others.</p> \n<p>Hancock\u2019s comments were prompted by a much-shared video featuring a critical care nurse called Dawn Bilbrough, who filmed herself in tears after coming off a 48-hour shift in intensive care and finding that she was unable to buy any fruit or vegetables in the supermarket. \u201cYou are just stripping the shelves bare of essential foods,\u201d Bilbrough says in the video. \u201cJust stop it. Because it\u2019s people like me that are going to be looking after you when you\u2019re at your lowest, so just stop it. Please!\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"06ee9134-0929-4dce-95c4-6b56997291b7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jmSPOSGpAYs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>To watch Bilbrough\u2019s video is to feel a visceral reaction against the selfish stockpilers who have deprived this hard-working NHS nurse of fresh produce. Her righteous rage is the same anger that people have felt throughout history towards the hoarders and speculators who put their own interests above the common good. During the Great Famine of England and Wales in 1315-17, the lords hoarded grain while the poor starved. In times of war, hoarding is loathed more than ever, and tends to be more severely policed. In 1941, an egg dealer in Folkestone was sentenced to three months of hard labour for illegally hoarding thousands of eggs and selling them on the black market. With rationing in place, to fiddle the system by taking more than your fair share of food was seen as an appalling form of cheating.</p> \n<p>But what on earth would a fair share of food be by today\u2019s standards? Nowadays, you might get through half a week\u2019s wartime ration for meat and eggs in a single breakfast. There was an outcry during the first days of lockdown when some convenience stores reported that police had been trying to stop shopkeepers from selling Easter eggs on the grounds that they were not \u201cessential\u201d food. </p> \n<p>For more than half a century, the freedom and abundance of our food system taught us that we could have whatever we want, whenever we wanted it, assuming we could pay. Over the past five years, food delivery services took this freedom still further. Whatever our hearts desired could be ordered up on an app and biked round in minutes, without fear of being judged for ordering too much or failing to share. Suddenly, coronavirus has tested the limits of our rights as consumers. For many modern families, there has been a profound shock to this new reality.</p> \n<p>Eating is once again framed as a moral act. There have always been people who felt reassured by bulk buying, and the rest of us didn\u2019t feel the need to judge them for this quirk. But our scrutiny of others has sharpened \u2013 and some individual behaviour has been remarkably irresponsible. Supermarket workers have described acts of astonishing selfishness. In an excellent <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/grocery-store-employee-covid-19_n_5e78c99ac5b6f5b7c54839ae\" title=\"\">article</a> for HuffPost, American grocery store worker Karleigh Frisbie Brogan described in horrified terms watching one shopper \u201cuse his forearm to empty a shelf of refried beans into his cart\u201d. As coronavirus spread through Singapore in February, there was an outcry when <a href=\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wuhan-virus-coronavirus-groceries-supplies-ntuc-sheng-siong-12406906\" title=\"\">a photo</a> was shared on Facebook of a middle-aged woman in a medical mask pushing a trolley piled to shoulder height with instant noodles. Most of the reactions consisted of crying with laughter emojis coupled with insults. Several people suggested that this \u201caunty\u201d would die not from coronavirus but from an overdose of MSG.</p> \n<p>Most of us would not go so far as to wish harm on the hoarders, although we can certainly unite in righteous indignation against these new villains of our post-coronavirus life. Besides the selfish shoppers who clear the shelves of fresh fruit, there are cold-hearted profiteers who buy up essential foods, as well as hand wash and face masks to sell them on at an inflated price. Sky News reported finding a carton of formula milk (normal price: \u00a311) being sold on eBay for more than \u00a3300.</p> \n<p>The media have focused heavily on these stories of hysterical greed in the shops. \u201cSelfish Tesco shoppers block NHS staff from getting into supermarket after working gruelling 60 hours on coronavirus frontline\u201d read one headline from the Sun on 23 March. But this fixation with selfish shoppers is not good for anyone\u2019s anxiety levels. Some eating-disorder sufferers \u2013 who are already often grappling with feelings of guilt about buying food \u2013 have reported that reading stories of panic buying have triggered worries that they must not buy food at all, lest they be taking food away from people who need it more. Another reason we should stop talking so much about the stockpilers is that their role in the current upheaval (or their responsibility for the current shortages) is probably not all that important.</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>Have you noticed that one of the main features of panic buying is that it is always done by other people, and never by ourselves? It is a label we attach to others in order to make ourselves feel better about our own shopping choices. He panic buys. You stock up. I tirelessly provide food for my family.</p> \n<p>A binary opposition has sprung up in our culture between shoppers \u2013 who are portrayed as grasping and selfish \u2013 and workers \u2013 who are heroic, especially anyone who works for the NHS. But NHS workers go shopping, too. Some of the people who took vegetables from the shelves before Dawn Bilbrough got there will have been other nurses just like her. They probably didn\u2019t take much more than usual.</p> \n<p>True panic buying \u2013 as in, cupboards full to the rafters with ramen noodles or packets of pasta \u2013 is actually much less common than we think. When market analysis firm Kantar Worldpanel looked at data from 100,000 UK shoppers in mid-March, it found that only 3% of the population engaged in full-blown panic buying. The rest of the increase in food sales over the past month \u2013 an extra \u00a31bn in the first three weeks of March \u2013 could be explained by consumers adding just a few extra items here and there. Chris Morley of Kantar wrote that the research suggested \u201chuge volumes of consumers were adding a few extra purchases of products they normally buy, and adding a few purchases of categories that they don\u2019t often buy into their trolley or basket [lentils being an obvious example] and were shopping more regularly than usual\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the term panic buying,\u201d says risk expert Tim Benton. He admits that there have been a few examples of \u201cstupidity\u201d from consumers in the shops, but he argues that for the most part, our patterns of shopping in recent weeks have been a \u201crisk-resilience issue\u201d rather than a \u201cpanic response\u201d. People have been told it is their duty to go home and stay there (and in some countries such as Canada, consumers have been <a href=\"https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/think-about-coronavirus-outbreak-when-planning-for-spring-break-champagne\" title=\"\">explicitly told</a> by politicians to stock up with enough supplies to last a week or two). At the same time, people can no longer have lunch or dinner outside of the home at cafes or restaurants or work canteens, which previously would have accounted for around 30% of all calories eaten in per day in the UK. \u201cThey can\u2019t eat out, so they stock their larders,\u201d says Benton.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"232941ba43e80d4248b19e553b650f4ffb2147a0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/232941ba43e80d4248b19e553b650f4ffb2147a0/0_0_4761_2857/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Shoppers queue outside a supermarket in Huddersfield.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shoppers queue outside a supermarket in Huddersfield.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Vaughan/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Some of the people buying more food than usual will have been doing so in order to help out friends and neighbours who are stranded at home. In Singapore in February, journalist Annie Tan observed that many people \u201cdecided to multiply their shopping list\u201d in order to \u201cspare their friends and family from knee-numbing queues\u201d. I have seen the same thing here, with WhatsApp groups filling up with neighbourly offers to share everything from fresh fruit to self-raising flour.</p> \n<p>Instead of panic buying, perhaps we should speak more of resilience buying. There is solace in feeling prepared, especially when we actually have no idea what\u2019s coming next. During the second world war, the writer Alice B Toklas lived in rural France with the art collector Gertrude Stein. In The Alice B Toklas Cookbook, she describes how she accumulated a store of dried fruits, including 4lb of citron and 2lb of raisins, which she was saving to make a liberation fruit cake when the war was over. From time to time, she would look at the fruit in its jars and feel \u201ccheered\u201d during the \u201cdismal days of that winter\u201d.</p> \n<p>This is not a war, thank God. Many people are invoking the spirit of the blitz \u2013 and some of us are certainly digging for victory, judging from the fact that vegetable seeds have been bought in vast quantities. But we are not having to make do with wartime rations of dried egg just yet. Knowing that we have a store of the half a dozen things we dread running out of can make us more equipped to summon up the reserves of patience and humour we are all going to need over the next few weeks.</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>When I put out a request on Twitter asking what items people felt they needed to stock up on most urgently, I was stunned to receive more than 1,300 replies. Many of them read like prose poems, speaking of private passions. \u201cParmesan. Just parmesan,\u201d read one. \u201cGarlic, olive oil, capers, anchovies, bacon. With them I can make any pulse, grain, or starch taste great,\u201d was another answer, from food broadcaster Sheila Dillon. Chef Alex Rushmer replied that his one essential was Lao Gan Ma crispy chilli oil, because, \u201cIf all you had was rice and noodles, Lao Gan Ma would make it OK.\u201d</p> \n<p>Common themes emerged. Apart from the obvious answers of staple grains, other popular essentials included onions, ginger and garlic, frozen veg, lemons and cheese, butter and oil, various kinds of pickles and spices: all ingredients for enhancing a meal rustled up from pantry goods. Many people named their favourite stimulants, from teabags to coffee to wine. \u201cDark chocolate, floor cleaner, gin\u201d, read one of the most bracingly honest replies. Someone wrote from day 15 of lockdown in Madrid to warn that although she had laid in 10 litres of olive oil, she had not anticipated how much chocolate she would want: \u201cYou\u2019ll need comfort food after a hard, sad day.\u201d</p> \n<p>The spirit that mostly emerged from these tweets was not one of panic, but of warmth and resourcefulness. People started to swap helpful tips on where to source certain hard-to-find products. There was a discussion of the fact that yeast \u2013 which is near-unobtainable in mainstream supermarkets, because so many people have started baking for comfort during lockdown \u2013 could still be found in some Polish shops, where it is labelled <em>dro\u017cd\u017ce</em>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"629c21287327ac24ddd98447731dda71d15361c4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/629c21287327ac24ddd98447731dda71d15361c4/0_297_4611_2766/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Panic buying continues as hundred queue at Costco Lakeside as the Coronavirus pandemic worsens.

A few weeks ago, when there were acres of empty shelves in the out-of-town hypermarkets, I strolled into a medium-sized Turkish shop near where I live in Cambridge and found plentiful supplies of fresh fruits and vegetables, cheeses and yoghurts, dried goods and breads and much more. Many of the items were both cheaper and more appetising than the supermarket equivalent, yet I didn\u2019t witness any customers piling their basket especially high. In a family-run shop like this, you would feel silly to clear the shelves. Others have reported that Korean and Chinese supermarkets in the UK have generally remained much better stocked than the big supermarket chains.</p> \n<p>And yet many British people still ignore these independent shops, in their eagerness to join the queue at a hollowed-out supermarket. It is as if we have been brainwashed to believe that these familiar superstores are the only ones that can supply us with the abundance and choice we have become accustomed to.</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>For years, food policy expert Tim Lang has been an almost lone voice in the wilderness, arguing that UK food security needs to be improved. In his new, very timely book \u2013 Feeding Britain: Our Food Problems and How to Fix Them \u2013 Lang notes that most consumers think that \u201cas long as there is food on the supermarket shelves, all is well in the world. It is not.\u201d According to Lang, Britain has long had \u201ca false sense of security about food\u201d, and all the more so post-Brexit. There\u2019s an assumption that, as a rich country, we will always be able to buy the produce we need from abroad, but this is a risky assumption in times of crisis.</p> \n<p>The empty shelves we have been so shocked by are not just reflective of the behaviour of individual shoppers, but of a supermarket system based on \u201cjust in time\u201d delivery systems. The idea \u2013 eagerly embraced by all the major UK food retailers \u2013 is that the business carries minimal stock, buying only what it needs at any given time, to save on the cost of storage. It\u2019s an efficient and highly profitable model \u2013 as long as imports are freely flowing. But even in the good times, as Lang explains in his book, the plenty in our supermarkets was based on \u201cstretched and risky food supply chains\u201d. The current crisis has laid bare the problems with having a food system so heavily weighted towards imports.</p> \n<p>A country with the UK\u2019s climate will never be fully self-sufficient in food \u2013 we can\u2019t grow our own coffee beans, to take one pressing example \u2013 but Lang argues that far more land should be given over to food production. \u201cThe UK cannot grow rice or mangoes or bananas, but it could grow 100% of apples, pears and soft fruit, and a more diverse range of vegetables.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"89103ae6e068353782cb849b6a27a3ccd4644973\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89103ae6e068353782cb849b6a27a3ccd4644973/0_0_5568_3342/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Shopping restrictions at a supermarket in Warrington march 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shopping restrictions at a supermarket in Warrington last month.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Copley</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Another weakness in our food supply that coronavirus has highlighted is that it is so unfairly and unequally distributed across the population. The coronavirus outbreak has pushed millions of people in the UK to the brink of food poverty. A <a href=\"https://foodfoundation.org.uk/covid-19-latest-impact-on-food-2/\" title=\"\">report from the Food Foundation</a> in March found that the combination of self-isolation, erratic food availability and a drop in income was leaving many vulnerable households at serious risk of not being able to access an adequate diet without government aid. During the week before lockdown, a food bank in Enfield reported an 80% surge in visitors. As Tim Benton comments, the question is not currently whether there is enough food in the UK, but who gets it \u2013 and that ultimately needs to be addressed by the government.</p> \n<p>The problem of individual panic buying may turn out to be a trivial worry compared with other, deeper issues in the food system, such as how to remodel it to deliver healthy food for all. Since social distancing and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/31/uk-supermarkets-ease-coronavirus-shopping-restrictions\" title=\"\">some temporary rationing</a> were put in place in UK supermarkets, panic buying has largely taken care of itself. Because of the social distancing rules, one day last week I found myself one of only 11 people allowed inside a small supermarket. Each item was limited to no more than three per customer, but I only saw people take one or two. The atmosphere felt as hushed as a church, and I noticed that everything from eggs to \u2013 yes! \u2013 potatoes were now available again. Steven Taylor, expert in the psychology of pandemics, notes that rationing is a far more effective strategy for stopping panic buying during a pandemic than either pleas from the government or \u201csocial shaming and ridicule\u201d. Once rationing is in place \u201cand people can see that they can still obtain staples, fears of scarcity tend to abate\u201d.</p> \n<p>A much more serious issue on the horizon is panic buying not by consumers, but by governments. On 24 March, Bloomberg reported that some governments had started to put in place protectionist food policies as a response to the coronavirus pandemic. Serbia has halted exports of sunflower oil and Kazakhstan is no longer allowing wheat flour or carrots to leave the country. If such protectionism spreads widely, it could result in higher prices and shortages of certain commodities, particularly for a country such as Britain that is so heavily dependent on imported food.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/how-will-the-world-emerge-from-the-coronavirus-crisis\">\u2018We can\u2019t go back to normal\u2019: how will coronavirus change the world?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThe problem,\u201d says Tim Benton, \u201cis that the more countries [engage in hoarding food], the free flow of food becomes sticky and imports start getting hammered.\u201d Technically, there is enough food in the world to feed current populations. According to the Agricultural Market Information System, which tracks food supplies across the world, \u201cglobal reserves of non-perishable goods such as wheat and rice should be sufficient to meet any imminent demand\u201d. Trade runs on trust, but at this moment of crisis, many countries seem to be feeling jittery and thinking only of national interests. Benton notes that in the current global food system \u201cwe are seeing every country working for itself\u201d. His concern is what could happen to imports of fresh fruits and vegetables from Europe into the UK, given shortages of labour in southern Europe as a result of coronavirus.</p> \n<p>These are testing times for food delivery drivers, as Dan Saladino reported on a recent episode of the BBC Food Programme. There have been cases of drivers making the epic journey back from Spain or Italy with lorryfuls of fresh food, only to be turned away at distribution sites in the UK because of fears that they might be bringing in infection. The rest of us should be grateful that, for now, there are still plentiful supplies of fresh fruit and vegetables in Europe, and drivers still prepared to make the trip and get it for us. But we need to stop taking this bountiful flow of food for granted, and start thinking about building a more resilient system. As Benton points out: \u201cYou can\u2019t stockpile lettuce.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

Yuki Sato, an employee of a start-up in Tokyo, has set up a small office at the home he shares with his wife and two children. Teleworking means he no longer has to endure a long commute and has more time for his daughters, whose schools are closed due to the outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cI can also give them their bath in the evening, something I could never do before because I was never home before 8pm,\u201d Sato, who has been working from home since February, told Agence France-Presse. \u201cThis experience has completely changed my image of teleworking.\u201d</p> <p>Teleworking has sparked a boost in sales of items such as web cameras and headphones, but some old analogue habits die hard. In an age of electronic contracts, many Japanese companies still require employees to print out documents that are then stamped with official <em>hanko</em> seals, often by several people.</p> <p>Mariko Kitano, who works for a TV production company, believes the last few weeks have proved that more flexible working practices should continue long after the coronavirus crisis has subsided.</p> <p>\u201cThere are times when you have to go into the office, but about 80% of my colleagues have been working from home since late February,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cI live alone, so I\u2019ve found teleworking really useful. I meet my deadlines, of course, but I can take a break now and then to do things like hang out the laundry.\u201d</p> <p>There are times, though, when teleworking is no substitute for face-to-face contact, Kitano added. \u201cI\u2019m mentoring junior colleagues and it\u2019s sometimes frustrating not to be able to see what they\u2019re doing and offer advice in person.</p> <p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t think we can go back to the way things were, despite the traditional view in Japan that you can only prove your worth by working hard in front of your boss. The past few weeks have proved that teleworking has too many advantages to be ditched.\u201d</p> <p><em>*Okada and Kitano\u2019s names have been changed at their request.</em></p> <p><em>Agence France-Presse contributed reporting.</em></p>",

  "<p>Hungarian journalists say a new law supposedly aimed at fighting the coronavirus will make objective reporting of the pandemic harder and leave them open to facing court cases or even jail time for their reporting.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">The measures, in place since Monday</a>, have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/hungary-emergency-law-incompatible-with-being-in-eu-say-meps-group-viktor-orban\">roundly criticised</a> for the sweeping powers they hand to the nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, to rule by decree. Another part of the bill provides penalties of up to five years in prison for those spreading misinformation during the pandemic.</p> \n<p>Journalists in the country say the new law is already being used to deny them access to information, and on occasion to threaten them.</p> \n<p>One Budapest-based journalist, who requested anonymity given the current situation in the country, said she had called a hospital over the weekend to follow up on a tip-off about a group of doctors who had reportedly contracted the coronavirus there. \u201cA few minutes later, the hospital\u2019s chief communication officer called me back and asked if I think it\u2019s a good idea to keep asking about this, a day before the government\u2019s bill will be passed,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Csaba Luk\u00e1cs, a journalist from the weekly newspaper Magyar Hang, said that since the law was passed at the beginning of the week, there had been a rise in threatening comments on social media or in emails warning staff that they would end up in jail. \u201cWe are also afraid we might face more lawsuits, which could put us in a very difficult financial situation,\u201d said the journalist.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hungary is ranked as the second-worst EU member state for press freedom in the most recent list compiled by Reporters Without Borders.

In a conference call with foreign reporters last week, Hungary\u2019s justice minister, Judit Varga, said the legal provision was \u201cboth adequate and necessary in order to fight malicious disinformation campaigns\u201d. She made it clear that the provision would apply to everyone, including journalists.</p> \n<p>The majority of independent journalists in Hungary stressed that they did not believe the law would lead to mass incarcerations, but said they were nevertheless deeply worried. One said their outlet had sought legal advice over how the law might affect its reporting.</p> \n<p>P\u00e9ter Erd\u00e9lyi, a senior editor at the online portal 444.hu, said the law would have \u201ca chilling effect\u201d on the media landscape. He added that while he did not believe his own outlet would change the way it worked, in some places it could lead to self-censorship. \u201cWhen people are openly calling for your arrest, even if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen, it can affect you.\u201d</p> \n<p>As of Thursday morning, there were 585 coronavirus cases in Hungary, with 21 confirmed deaths.

A government-linked businessman has also bought into the country\u2019s largest independent news portal, fuelling fears of interference.</p> \n<p>M\u00e1rton B\u00e9k\u00e9s, a pro-government magazine editor and historian, said in a recent discussion on the HirTV channel that Hungary was now in a \u201cwar situation\u201d and some opposition media outlets were \u201copenly rooting for the virus\u201d. Another guest on the programme suggested opposition journalists spreading panic should be arrested. There is now specific legal provision to back up these calls.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat I expect is some overzealous far-right pundit calling the police on some journalists, that is likely to happen. Then we\u2019ll see how they react,\u201d said Szabolcs Panyi, a journalist with the investigative news portal Direkt36.</p> \n<p>The new law is also likely to make sources even more wary than before about speaking to the media. Several doctors have declined to speak to the Guardian in recent weeks, citing strict orders from hospital management. One Hungarian journalist said he had been unable to follow up a tip-off about coronavirus cases in a Hungarian school because everybody was scared to speak, even anonymously. \u201cPeople were scared of talking to journalists, because they were afraid of losing their jobs. Not just doctors and nurses, but school headteachers and parents as well,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Sixteen of the other 26 EU states released <a href=\"http://deeply%20concerned/\">a statement</a> on Wednesday expressing concern over the Hungarian measures \u2013 but it did not actually include the word \u201cHungary\u201d.</p> \n<p>In a carefully calibrated piece of trolling, the Hungarian justice ministry responded with a statement saying it was also signing up to the appeal, as Hungary supports the initiative \u201cto ensure the fundamental values of the Union are upheld\u201d.</p> \n<p>In a radio interview on Friday, Orb\u00e1n accused a network led by the Hungarian-American philanthropist financier George Soros of being behind attacks on the law via supposed proxies in Brussels. Orb\u00e1n frequently attacks Soros, sometimes using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/15/hungarian-leader-says-europe-is-now-under-invasion-by-migrants\">antisemitic tropes</a> to paint him as a scheming puppet master.</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Flora Garamvolgyi</em></p>",

  "<p>The poet Bruce Dawe, who wrote his first poems in his teens under a pseudonym, has died at age 90 as one of Australia\u2019s best-known poets, respected by a wide and diverse audience. This diversity would have mattered to him. His work was widely honoured in his lifetime, including with the Patrick White award and a Christopher Brennan award for lifetime achievement in poetry.</p> <p>From a working-class background with broken schooling in Melbourne, then later ongoing commitment to part-time education, through to receiving a PhD, he eventually became a teacher and academic in Queensland. Dawe\u2019s earlier work experience<strong> </strong>(his many jobs included being a postman, working in a battery factory and serving for a long period with the RAAF) provided the \u201clived life\u201d feel of social familiarity in his poems.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/18/ali-cobby-eckermann-on-winning-the-worlds-richest-writing-prize-its-taken-time-to-adjust\">Ali Cobby Eckermann on winning the world's richest writing prize: 'It's taken time to adjust'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Born in Fitzroy, growing up in Victoria and spending time working in Sydney, Dawe eventually taught in various institutions in Queensland. Apart from writing many books of poetry, he also edited a poetry anthology, Dimensions, published fiction, and collated Speaking in Parables (drawing on Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Islamic and Hindu writings). Though he was a social commentator on the secular, his religious sensibility often underlay his moral positioning toward the material and secular. In an interview I did with Dawe in 1998, he said, \u2018\u201cwhat we do is to deify the secular in one form or another, isn\u2019t it?\u201d That statement, also a question, shows something of his poetic practice, too.</p> <p>For decades, when you went into a second-hand bookshop in Australia, even if there was no poetry section, you\u2019d find at least one book of poetry, and that book would be Bruce Dawe\u2019s Sometimes Gladness. It wasn\u2019t simply about a discarded book looking for a new owner, but the inevitable circulation of a school standard across the country. Innumerable copies of the many (updated) editions of this timeless classic were in high-school kids\u2019 bags, lockers, bookcases, desks and maybe scattered on their floors after a heavy study session.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Always behind Dawe\u2019s seemingly playful banter is his commitment to sympathy and connection with the less empowered</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At school in the mid to late 70s, I too studied Dawe\u2019s poetry, and as I look through my bookshelves now I find three copies once owned by an in-law, by my mother and by a stranger whose school form number is written after their name \u2013 on top of whiteout, because underneath you can make out another name, and another form number. New editions with new poems came along, but at the book\u2019s heart was a remarkable body of socially aware, socially critical and socially investigative poetry that had coalesced by the mid-70s.</p> <p>Here was a poet who spoke with \u201cthe voice of the people\u201d (or \u201ca people\u201d), who knew all the tones of irony and satire from the world he\u2019d grown up in, lived in, and the world he saw beyond Australia\u2019s borders. He translated the satirical ways of other literature into Australian contexts. I use the word \u201cborder\u201d because Dawe\u2019s 2016 collection, Border Security (UWAP), shows his ability to empathise with human vulnerability when faced with officialdom, with the trappings of power (what we do or don\u2019t take through customs, and how such barriers work on our conscience). What are the real and imagined barriers between people?</p> <p>Always behind Dawe\u2019s seemingly playful banter with us, his readers and public, is his commitment to sympathy and connection with the less empowered, the disenfranchised, downtrodden, neglected and exploited. He differentiates between the human foibles shown and exercised by power, and those of people who have little or no power. Dawe wrote against tyranny, brutality and totalitarianism. He wrestled, sometimes subliminally, with issues of masculinity.</p> <p>Yet it was also in his \u201ctopical\u201d teachability that sometimes schoolkids missed out on Dawe\u2019s lyrically tender side \u2013 where irony, pathos and excoriating acerbity are put on hold to show the gravity of personal loss, of the essence of living shared by all.</p> <p>I will never forget a school lesson in which we studied A Public Hangman Tells His Love, a 1967 poem about the Ronald Ryan hanging in Melbourne, that works like a disturbed love letter or a paradoxical letter of estranging yet familial tenderness between executioner and victim. It shows not only the brutal wrong of state execution, but the way in which we can be affected by tone and expectation with seemingly \u201cordinary\u201d language-use. That poem, written about what became Australia\u2019s last \u201clegal execution\u201d, begins:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dear one, forgive my appearing before you like this,<br>in a two-piece track-suit, welder\u2019s goggles<br>and a green cloth cap, like some gross bee \u2013 this is the State\u2019s idea ...</p> </blockquote> <p>And this epistle, almost apostrophe, is signed off:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Be assured, you will sink into the generous pool of public feeling<br>as gently as a leaf ... Accept your role. Feel chosen.<br>You are this evening\u2019s headline. Come, my love.</p> </blockquote> <p>What Dawe achieves here is horrifying and deft at once \u2013 implicating not only the state, but all who acquiesce in this kind of treatment of another living being; always speaking about power, but examining the often compromised nature of the generic \u201cpublic\u201d. He appeals to our consciences by revealing our ways of dissembling.</p> <p>At the end of that lesson, I was browsing his other poems to hand, and came across the remarkable 1964 lyric Elegy for Drowned Children, where Dawe\u2019s rhetorical, conversational questioning mode becomes public and private in its implications at once:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What does he do with them all, the old king:<br>Having such a shining haul of boys in his sure net,<br>How does he keep them happy, lead them to forget<br>The world above, the aching air, birds, spring?</p> </blockquote> <p>I understand why I was taught A Public Hangman, because of its \u201ctopicality\u201d and moral gravitas and necessity, and yet I wondered how closely connected the two poems were: both concerned with disempowerment and all its complexities. Both seemed to come from the same psychological place.</p> <p>And Dawe, though such a readable poet, a poet who speaks with people as if they will get him if they want to, also deals behind the screen of the page, with the personal behind the political.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/01/awe-wonder-and-the-overview-effect-how-feeling-small-gives-us-much-needed-perspective\">Awe, wonder and the overview effect: how feeling small gives us much-needed perspective | Julia Baird</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whether writing against the intractability and consequences of war in a quiet, understated but overwhelming way, getting at the root of the problem, or laughing with us about sports obsessions (Australian Rules Footy!) and group behaviours, he was always with us, and remains with us, the people, for all our (many!) faults. He can joke, laugh, cry and also be very angry. He can take us from the material to the spiritual, and be generous about it.</p> <p>Les Murray once called Dawe \u201cour great master of applied poetry\u201d, and as Dawe said to me in that interview mentioned above: \u201cLike many critics of particular things, I am half in love with the things I criticise at times; I know the appeal such media phenomena as TV have because I\u2019ve felt it, too.\u201d And in this, we have the key, just maybe, to why a Dawe poem can get us onside whether we agree with its gist, or not. Bruce Dawe\u2019s passing is a great loss, but his poetry \u201cof the suburbs\u201d and further afield will continue to be relevant for a long time to come.</p> <p>\u2022 John Kinsella is an Australian poet and academic</p>",
  "<p>Free childcare was one of the goals of second wave feminism, when we took up the cause of gender equity in the 70s. It seemed logical, because children need access to other children and expert care to develop the skills that parents can\u2019t provide, and allowed particularly mothers, as the primary carer, time for paid work and other activities. After all, child rearing was not intended to be the sole responsibility of parents but a community: \u201cit takes a village to rear a child\u201d. But community child rearing was harder after urbanisation, and the contraceptive pill offered control over fertility, so women more time for other roles.</p> <p>As an active early advocate for funding childcare, my hearing the prime minster on the radio announcing free childcare in the midst of the very scary Covid-19 pandemic was startling. It was obviously too good to be true, and my examination of the newly devised policy proved it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare: what do the Australian government's coronavirus changes mean for my family?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The billion-dollar-plus program is proving to be an odd version of public funding as its primary aims do not target specifically the needs of children or mothers \u2013 though these may benefit from it \u2013 but instead provide a relatively short-term (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/morrison-insists-nothing-lasts-forever-especially-the-coronavirus-spending-spree\">maximum six months</a>) quite generous funding of care centres and services.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">These centres will offer free care to those attending and free continuing places to enrolled non-attenders</a>. The justification is the massive need for the mainly female qualified healthcare workforce to manage virus patients after childcare centres threatened to close as anxious parents withdrew children. </p> <p>Keeping childcare centres open would allow workers in the services to be covered by the jobkeeper payments of $750 per week and reduce the numbers of official unemployed, as well as freeing essential, mainly female health and welfare workers to continue in their needed jobs (and others in unrelated jobs). Together with the wage subsidy, the new grants would cover the costs so care would be free. Note, luckily for the government, most childcare workers are grossly underpaid so the costs would be covered. The sums will work!</p> <p>There\u2019s a big benefit for the government by the reduction in the numbers of unemployed on jobkeeker payments. Low-paid female workers are likely to remain in their vital jobs, as will others who are still employed. Together with the earlier massive commitment to businesses of jobs and grants, this program is obviously targeted at the image of the government\u2019s competence in a crisis. Rather than using the crisis as the means to reform the problematic high-fee structures and maldistribution of childcare services \u2013 let alone needed reforms to very low pay rates \u2013 good PR appears to be the aim. The questions of excessive profits made at taxpayer expense by too many centres, and poor community links, are also ignored as politicians clearly state the current model will be reinstated as soon as the crisis passes.</p> <p>The brief experience of free care is also problematic. New users will be encouraged to take on unused places, others to increase their use. However, there are criteria set for prioritising essential job holders. Who decides these conflicting needs and what happens to these new users when the scheme is switched off? There are also unanswered questions about the eligibility of family day care and owners of multiple centres who may be too big for the jobkeeper scheme. There are also a range of unanswered questions about how non-attenders who are covered can reclaim their places.</p> <p>Interestingly, the Labor party and the unions are backing the program without any signs that there is also a need for reform of the current funding. This brief glimpse of free care will raise expectations that are unlikely to be met when these one-offs are withdrawn. So underpaid workers and overpriced, badly located services will continue to be problems.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/morrison-insists-nothing-lasts-forever-especially-the-coronavirus-spending-spree\">Morrison reminds us nothing lasts forever \u2013 especially the coronavirus spending spree | Malcolm Farr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But we will be left with a brief example of the benefits of free care. My dreams in 1972 were that public acceptance of care for kids would mirror the early years public school provisions. As a sole parent I committed myself to this issue as I had had serious problems finding care for my child. Funding of services was started by Phillip Lynch under Billy McMahon. By 1983, we had convinced the incoming Hawke government to plan and fund community-based care services as an entitlement. A decade later saw the effects of a major shift in policy by the incoming Howard government. It removed the direct conditional childcare funding that was based on needs, and encouraged for-profit services that abandoned and distorted the process. So now a once useful part of local community services are mostly replaced by a profit-oriented business model.</p> <p>Maybe the brief experience of thousands of users of the temporary model will create the demand for a serious revolution in this (and other) community services. Maybe my brief flash of nostalgic hope was a sign that place-based community services that meet user needs would reappear, and the social contract that offered trust between those elected to serve citizens\u2019 needs and voters, who are sick of being just powerless customers.</p> <p>Maybe!</p> <p>\u2022 Eva Cox is a sociologist who has worked as an academic, political adviser and public servant</p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump sparked fresh criticism on Thursday by deploying his son-in-law Jared Kushner at a White House coronavirus taskforce briefing and accusing Democrats of launching a fresh \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d.</p> \n<p>Kushner, a senior adviser to the US president who is married to his daughter Ivanka, made a surprise appearance on the podium and said Trump had instructed him to \u201cbreak down every barrier needed to make sure the teams can succeed\u201d.</p> \n<p>Kushner added: \u201cThe president also wanted us to make sure that we think outside the box, make sure we\u2019re finding all the best thinkers in the country, making sure we\u2019re getting all the best ideas.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/02/new-york-ventilators-coronavirus-andrew-cuomo\">New York only has enough ventilators for six more days, says Governor Cuomo</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But by way of example, Kushner said Trump became concerned about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/02/new-york-ventilators-coronavirus-andrew-cuomo\">supply shortages</a> after hearing about them \u201cjust this morning\u201d from \u201cfriends of his in New York\u201d \u2013 implying the president responds to anecdotes rather than the state governor or public health officials.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe went to the president today,\u201d Kushner continued. \u201cAnd earlier today, the president called Mayor [Bill] de Blasio to inform him that we are going to send a month of supply to New York public hospital system.\u201d</p> \n<p>The vice-president, Mike Pence, later said there would 200,000 masks sent to New York.</p> \n<p>Kushner said: \u201cWe\u2019ll be doing similar things with all the different public hospitals that are in the hotspot zones and making sure that we\u2019re constantly in communications with the local communities.\u201d</p> \n<p>Media reports have suggested that Kushner, a property developer with no medical expertise, is running a \u201cshadow taskforce\u201d \u2013 a rival power base that conflicts with the official task force led by Pence.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cI\u2019ve been serving really at the direction of the vice-president. He\u2019s asked me to get involved in different projects. The vice-president and I speak, probably, sometimes five, 10 times a day, but everything that I\u2019m doing is at the direction of the vice-president.\u201d</p> \n<p>He glanced over at Pence, who smiled benignly.</p> \n<p>Earlier on Thursday, Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, announced a new House committee would oversee \u201call aspects\u201d of the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic and did not rule out an investigation in the style of the commission on the 9/11 terrorist attacks.</p> \n<p>Such a prospect clearly stung Trump, who compared it to the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation and the congressional hearings into his dealings with Ukraine that led to his impeachment.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is not the time for politics,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cEndless partisan investigations \u2013 here we go again \u2013 have already done extraordinary damage to our country in recent years. You see what happens. It\u2019s witch-hunt after witch-hunt after witch-hunt and, in the end, the people doing the witch-hunt have been losing, and they\u2019ve been losing by a lot. It\u2019s not any time for witch-hunts.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet even as the president spoke, the White House was releasing a letter in which he assailed Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader from New York. \u201cThank you for your Democrat public relations letter and incorrect sound bites, which are wrong in every way,\u201d Trump wrote.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"037307b73ae975b2605dcdeec2ac0312fc73f673\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/037307b73ae975b2605dcdeec2ac0312fc73f673/0_0_5574_3716/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Shortages of equipment have roiled healthcare facilities in New York and across the US.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shortages of equipment have roiled healthcare facilities in New York and across the US.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vanessa Carvalho/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIf you spent less time on your ridiculous impeachment hoax, which went haplessly on forever and ended up going nowhere (except increasing my poll numbers) and instead focused on helping the people of New York, then New York would not have been so completely unprepared for the \u2018invisible enemy\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<p>Along with Kushner, Trump introduced Peter Navarro, the national Defense Production Act (DPA) policy coordinator. Navarro claimed there was a \u201cblack market springing up\u201d to drive up prices of protective gear, involving brokers and middle men.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are going to crack down on the hoarders,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Navarro, a hardliner on trade, also used the opportunity claim the pandemic showed \u201cwe\u2019re over-dependent on a global supply chain\u201d and was a \u201cvindication\u201d of Trump\u2019s stance on buying American goods and strengthening borders. More than once he praised \u201cTrump time\u201d \u2013 shorthand for getting things done fast.</p> \n<p>Trump said he was again invoking the DPA to ensure parts were available for the mass production of ventilators. Adm John Polowczyk, in charge of the supply chain, said the federal government had now produced 22.4m pairs of protective gloves, 5.2m face shields and 7,600 ventilators.</p> \n<p>But distributing the supplies to the places most in need has been a problem. Trump became defensive under questioning, seeking to shift blame to individual states.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economy\">Coronavirus batters US economy as 6.65m file for unemployment last week</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Some were well prepared, he said, but \u201cin some cases their shelves were bare\u201d.

Whoever heard of a governor calling up the federal government and saying, \u2018Sir, we need a hospital?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump also faced queries about the economy on a day that saw the number of people filing claims for unemployment benefits <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economy\">surge to a record of more than 6.6 million</a>. He made the astonishing claim: \u201cI will always protect your social security, your Medicare and your Medicaid\u201d \u2013 despite having supported cuts in the past.</p> \n<p>The president announced that he had taken a second test for coronavirus and, like the first, it came back negative. The second test was much simpler and took about 15 minutes. \u201cI\u2019ve done them both and the second one is much more pleasant,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/coronavirus-us-new/map\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>America now has more than 236,000 confirmed cases of the virus, according to Johns Hopkins, the highest in the world, and more than 5,600 fatalities.
