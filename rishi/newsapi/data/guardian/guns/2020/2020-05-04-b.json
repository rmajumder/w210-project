given a century-old <strong>tuberculosis vaccine</strong> on Monday in a trial to see whether the venerable formula can protect against coronavirus. </p> \n  <p>Devised at France\u2019s legendary Pasteur Institute 100 years ago, the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is one of the world\u2019s oldest and most trusted immunisations. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe vaccinated the first participant this morning,\u201d Duncan McDonald, head of business development and marketing at a clinical research organisation called TASK, told AFP. </p> \n  <p>Trials started at Tygerberg hospital in Cape Town, where BCG booster shots were administered to 250 health care workers, while another 250 received a dummy formula, or placebo. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThere are observations that this BCG vaccine does something to the immune system that we don\u2019t really understand,\u201d TASK founder professor, Andreas Diacon, said. </p> \n  <p>Children immunised with BCG tend to suffer less from respiratory illnesses, including asthma, he said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt makes the immune system cope better with respiratory retract infections,\u201d said Diacon. \u201cNo one actually really understands why it works.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Diacon and his team want to determine whether BCG could have an effect on coronavirus by reducing the risk of infection or easing symptoms. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIf you can reduce the (Covid-19) symptoms just a little, you will probably get people to survive this better or not even have to go to hospital or not even becoming ill,\u201d said Diacon. </p> \n  <p>The plan is to ramp up the trials to up to 3,000 health care workers in Cape Town.

Beijing faces a rising wave of hostility in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak that could tip relations with the <strong>United States</strong> into confrontation, Reuters reports. </p> \n  <p>The report, presented early last month by the ministry of state security to top Beijing leaders including president Xi Jinping, concluded that global anti-China sentiment is at its highest since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, sources said.</p> \n  <p>As a result, Beijing faces a wave of anti-China sentiment led by the US in the aftermath of the pandemic and needs to be prepared in a worst-case scenario for armed confrontation between the two global powers, according to people familiar with the report\u2019s content, who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter. </p> \n  <p>The report was drawn up by the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR), a think tank affiliated with the ministry of state security, China\u2019s top intelligence body. </p> \n  <p>Reuters has not seen the briefing paper, but it was described by people who had direct knowledge of its findings. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have relevant information,\u201d the

request for comment. </p> \n  <p>Reuters couldn\u2019t determine to what extent the stark assessment described in the paper reflects positions held by China\u2019s state leaders, and to what extent, if at all, it would influence policy. </p> \n  <p>But the presentation of the report shows how seriously Beijing takes the threat of a building backlash that could threaten what China sees as its strategic investments overseas and its view of its security standing. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45ed20c14567af2d7a4bab3fbcf5b9519edba2fa\"> \n   <img

The orange departments will be declared red or green when a definitive map is published on Thursday. In any case, the French have been told not to make journeys of more than 100km without good professional or major family reasons after 11 May for the foreseeable future.</p> \n  <p>One of Macron\u2019s main objectives in ending the lockdown is to reopen the country\u2019s schools, but this is proving problematic. Nursery and primary schools will reopen classes on Tuesday, but with a maximum of between 10 and 15 pupils. The two lower years of secondary schools, will return the following Monday.</p> \n  <p>In Paris, City Hall estimates only 10% of nursery and primary school pupils will be able to return on Tuesday.

The states worst hit are on the east and west coasts, with New York by far the hotspot, although Michigan and Louisiana have also been hard hit. Cases are rising in cities and rural areas.</p> \n<p>But more than half of the 50 states are now attempting some form of easing of lockdown measures. Some states led by Republican governors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/02/florida-grim-reaper-beach-video-coronavirus\">have sought to move more swiftly</a>.</p> \n<p>Also on Monday, the influential Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington (IHME), a team that has been cited by the White House, revised a key piece of coronavirus modeling and almost <a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kimt.com%2Fcontent%2Fnews%2F570170172.html\">doubled</a> its prediction for the US death toll in next three months.</p> \n<p>The IHME is now forecasting at least 134,000 deaths in the US by 4 August, while previously it had predicted just over 74,000 deaths.</p> \n<p>Trump, who is heavily dependent on economic recovery for his hopes of re-election in November, spoke in favor of reopening measures at a Fox News town hall at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington on Sunday evening.</p> \n<p>\u201cI really believe that you can go to parks, you can go to beaches \u2026 [if] you stay away a certain amount,\u201d Trump said, adding that it was possible to balance the demands of anti-lockdown protesters with those of governors and public health experts who warn against reopening too soon.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f705dae2-22c8-4a75-af16-8868778e3210\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CI40PCz9SnQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>One of those experts, White House coronavirus taskforceresponse coordinator, Dr Deborah Birx, told Fox News Sunday the anti-lockdown protests were \u201cdevastatingly worrisome to me personally, because if they go home and infect their grandmother or their grandfather who has a co-morbid condition and they have a serious or a very \u2026 or an unfortunate outcome, they will feel guilty for the rest of our lives\u201d.</p> \n<p>Birx also said the administration expected between 100,000 and 240,000 people to die in the coronavirus outbreak, \u201cand that\u2019s with full mitigation and us learning from each other of how to social distance\u201d.</p> \n<p>Hours later, Trump said he thought \u201cwe\u2019re going to lose anywhere from 75, 80 to 100,000 people\u201d, which was up from his previous prediction of 65,000. He also said the administration \u201cmay have to put out a fire\u201d later in the year, if the virus returns.</p> \n<p>In recent weeks, the president and his senior adviser Jared Kushner have repeatedly proclaimed success in handling the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<p>Many observers have not shared their view and public health experts have warned that the US will need to dramatically ramp up testing if it is to effectively reopen the economy.</p> \n<p>In his statement on Monday, Deere insisted the \u201cphased guidelines to open up America again are a scientific-driven approach that the top health and infectious disease experts in the federal government agreed with. The health of the American people remains President Trump\u2019s top priority and that will continue as we monitor the efforts by states to ease restrictions\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, a majority of Americans do not agree with Trump\u2019s assessment of how he has handled the pandemic. A <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/reuters-ipsos-data-core-political-2020-04-29\">poll</a> last week showed 53% of respondents disapproved.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Christopher Murray, director of the IHME, said the team was gathering data about US residents\u2019 mobility during the pandemic. He pointed out that some data was being processed in order to \u201creflect the effect of premature relaxation of social distance, which has a substantial effect\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>Pressure, of course, turns coal to diamonds and here we have four of them \u2013 some a little rougher cut than others, perhaps, but diamonds nevertheless. The four 15-minute dramas that comprise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/23/isolation-stories-itv-lockdown-drama-interview-makers\">Isolation Stories</a> (ITV) have all been created under lockdown. Written since we were first forced to beat a collective retreat into our homes \u2013 wait, let me consult the historical record to see how long this strangely elastic time has officially endured \u2013 43 days ago, they were cast, filmed, directed and edited remotely, and up on our screens, within seven of the most unsettling weeks in living memory.</p> <p>A further programme, <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/presscentre/ep1week19/isolation-stories-behind-scenes\">Isolation Stories: Behind the Scenes</a>, on ITV on Thursday 7 May, shows the process of atomised programme-making in more detail, but, in essence, the actors (and sometimes their families) filmed themselves, and the directors watched the footage on mobile phones and gave advice remotely. Surmounting the technical and practical difficulties would be reason enough for plaudits, but the results themselves are so good that they make me want to call for an 8pm clap for the arts sometime (not a Thursday, obviously. I wouldn\u2019t want to encroach on actual life-savers\u2019 time).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/23/isolation-stories-itv-lockdown-drama-interview-makers\">'Can we do this without breaking the law?' Inside the first lockdown TV drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That said, there is something incredibly emotionally restorative and mentally uplifting \u2013 as there has been, we must assume, since the dawn of human time \u2013 about stories that reflect and make at least narrative sense of our experiences. Especially new ones, and especially as they unfold. Once we might have done it in a cave or round a campfire. Now we do it over laptops and iPhones with someone to instruct on how to adjust the lighting, but the principle, the appetite, the need remains the same.</p> <p>Each of the four dramas crystallises a particular aspect of the lockdown experience. The first has Sheridan Smith, herself heavily pregnant in real-life and self-isolating, as a heavily pregnant, self-isolating woman named Mel. We learn her story through a deft series of drafted and deleted videos to friends and family, which reveal that she is carrying an unwanted baby by a man she hadn\u2019t known was married until he returned to his wife. Loneliness and the disorientation caused by the enforced pause we are all experiencing are beautifully showcased. As is the difference a small, simple act of kindness can make. Mel calls a long-lost friend whose number she didn\u2019t realise was even still in her phone and leaves an emotional message. The woman to whom the number has been reassigned calls her back to offer support. <br><br>The last few minutes of the quarter hour are unconvincing (Mel ignores the clear implication that a violent partner has cut off the woman\u2019s call and instead does a volte-face on her attitude to life and the baby) and take a slightly disappointing turn into sentimentality just as it looks as if the story is deepening into an examination of sisterhood. But I suspect that at the moment Sheridan Smith says she wants to play out with a song, you just get (further) out of her way and let her. But, apart from the distasteful sense that the domestic abuse issue had been crowbarred in to tick a box, it was a belter.</p> <p>Mike and Rochelle (which airs on Wednesday) doesn\u2019t put a foot wrong for its 12 glorious minutes, with Darren Boyd playing a self-obsessed, hypochondriac actor (I know, I know \u2013 insert your own joke here) called Mike in emergency session with his friend/therapist, Rochelle (Angela Griffin). Wonderful performances from both of them, with Boyd managing to keep the infuriating Mike just bearable enough to let the late emergence of his better side be entirely convincing. It is a neat encapsulation of the relationship between those who hunker down in a crisis and have to cope with those whose natural inclination is to suck all available resources dry and then move on for more.</p> <p>These were the only two, alas, available for preview. But the other two episodes star Eddie Marsan and David Threlfall, and Robert Glenister alongside his actor son Tom \u2013 rounding out a lineup that must reckon not just among the most talented but also \u2013 important now \u2013 the safest hands in the business. There is no reason to expect any letup in quality, and, as such, Isolation Stories shall fairly stand as the first televisual jewel in the Covid-era crown.</p> <p><em>\u2022 In the UK, call the <a href=\"https://www.nationaldahelpline.org.uk/\">national domestic abuse helpline</a> on 0808 2000 247, or visit <a href=\"http://womansaid.co.uk/\">Women\u2019s Aid</a>.

  "<p>Just as Matt Hancock was explaining at the Downing Street press conference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/04/contact-tracing-app-to-be-piloted-on-isle-of-wight-this-week-matt-hancock-says\">how he hoped his test, track and trace app</a> might work to ease the lockdown, parliament was finally getting the opportunity to debate the coronavirus regulations the government had put in place back in March. Though debate might be putting it a little strongly. The tech in the new virtual Commons isn\u2019t up to allowing any interventions, so what we actually got was each MP making an uninterrupted five-minute speech.</p> <p>The junior health minister Edward Argar appeared slightly bewildered by the need for even an ersatz debate. And you could rather see his point. The real key date here is this Thursday, when the government is obliged to say whether it plans to maintain the emergency powers or introduce some form of relaxation, so being asked to justify the current regime that had been in place for six weeks and might change in a few days\u2019 time felt a wee bit pointless.</p> <p>But futility has never been a stumbling block for the Commons in the past and Argar was determined that it should not be now. If there were protocols to be observed then he was the man for the job. So he mumbled on for 10 minutes telling everyone exactly what they already knew.</p> <p>Something called the coronavirus had become a pandemic, he said, and the government had been forced to introduce a whole load of civil liberty restrictions to protect the nation\u2019s health. And though ministers were determined that lockdown would end at the earliest opportunity, he didn\u2019t want to pre-empt anything the prime minister might say later in the week. Largely because not even Boris Johnson is entirely sure what Boris Johnson is going to do next. It turns out that following the science can be quite confusing. Not to say expensive.</p> <p>Replying for Labour, the shadow junior health minister Justin Madders didn\u2019t have a great deal to add. He had no problems with any of the measures the government had put in place, he just wished the opposition had been allowed to agree with what had been done rather earlier in the game.</p> <p>He also pleaded that when the prime minister did say something new, either on Thursday or Sunday \u2013 it appears that one of the new regulations is for the 21-day limit on emergency powers is to be contingent on Boris\u2019s own interpretation of three weeks \u2013 that Labour would be given an opportunity to scrutinise it before it became law. Argar just shrugged and smiled. Even he\u2019s not being kept in the loops, so there was sod all chance of anyone on the opposition benches being given a say.</p> <p>The only real pushback came from the Tory backbenches. Though everyone was keen to point out that they had been happy to accept \u201cextreme and unusual\u201d measures up till now, many Conservative MPs are now beginning to get twitchy. Both about the impact of the lockdown and the threat to civil liberties. They sense there\u2019s a mood in their constituencies that a growing number of people are no longer quite so keen on saving the lives of 1% of the population if it means they lose their jobs and can\u2019t go out and see their friends and families.</p> <p>Not that they all expressed that sentiment quite so bluntly. Graham Brady merely suggested that maybe some people had just been a little too willing to stay at home rather than go to work \u2013 so fortunate that Sir Graham doesn\u2019t work in a call centre where social distancing isn\u2019t rigorously enforced \u2013 and that old people should be allowed to decide on what level of risk they were prepared to accept. He hasn\u2019t quite grasped the fact that an old person on a midnight flit might actually infect someone else.</p> <p>Other Conservatives were rather more forthright. Charles Walker insisted that the economy was our lives. An unusually Marxist analysis from a free-market capitalist. And if thousands of businesses went under and unemployment rose to 12%, then none of those still around would have a life worth living. What was needed was a frank, honest and open debate about whether it was worth trading lives now for lives tomorrow. It was fairly clear which side of the coronavirus equation Charles sees himself on.</p> <p>Steve Baker, whose hair is growing upwards at such an alarming rate he now resembles Marge Simpson, was mostly concerned that the police should be given the correct guidance on how to enforce any regulations. In particular, he was disturbed that some forces had been arresting people for not sweating sufficiently when they were out on their bicycles. What we needed in any new guidance, he said, was a form of Highway Code. There were some rules that must be observed and some that only should. That did rather presuppose the government had a clue what rules it was going to impose. Let alone how to categorise them.</p> <p>For full-on libertarian psycho, we had to wait for Marcus Fysh. He\u2019d rather die a free man in his grave, than live like a puppet or a slave. Under no circumstances should health be allowed to trump liberty. And from what he\u2019d heard, Matt Hancock\u2019s \u201ctest, track and trace\u201d app was a non-starter, because it relied on centralised data.

  "<p>A row has erupted among scientists over a new report into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/should-everyone-be-wearing-face-masks\">the use of face masks by the general public</a> as an approach to managing the spread of Covid-19 in the community.</p> \n<p>The report from a multidisciplinary group convened by the Royal Society called Delve \u2013 Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics \u2013 has weighed up the evidence and <a href=\"https://rs-delve.github.io/reports/2020/05/04/face-masks-for-the-general-public.html\">come out in favour of the public wearing face masks</a>, including homemade cloth coverings, in a bid to tackle Covid-19.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur analysis suggests that their use could reduce onward transmission by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic wearers if widely used in situations where physical distancing is not possible or predictable, contrasting to the standard use of masks for the protection of wearers,\u201d the report notes. \u201cIf correctly used on this basis, face masks, including homemade cloth masks, can contribute to reducing viral transmission.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"77142d5a-0bf3-4a80-b538-c47a11b57f6a\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.</p>\n    <p>The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.</p>\n    <p>The WHO says masks should be made of three layers \u2013 with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.</p>\n    <p>The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The conclusion is based on analysis of three key considerations, including the role of droplets as a route of transmission, and whether masks can help to reduce dispersal of droplets. However the authors note there are only a small number of studies.</p> \n<p>But the report prompted other scientists to express their reservations, warning that it amounted to no more than opinion and overstated the available evidence.</p> \n<p>Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said the report \u201cfalls short of delivering new evidence and too casually dismisses precautionary principle when addressing the possibility that masks and coverings could have negative effects on people\u2019s behaviours\u201d.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cUntil more evidence is delivered in either direction, that\u2019s all advice can be based on \u2013 opinions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Ben Killingley, consultant in acute medicine and infectious diseases at University College London hospital, was also critical.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe report is overly optimistic about the value of face coverings and it is incorrect to conclude that the evidence shows that face covering can reduce viral transmission in the community,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is in fact no good evidence that face coverings achieve this.\u201d</p> \n<p>Killingley added that the report largely ignored real-world data, which suggests low effectiveness, albeit for protection of the wearer.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is not to say that face coverings might not be helpful,\u201d he said, noting, face mask studies have not been carried out during a pandemic or in the context of a novel virus. \u201cNevertheless, the report, in my view, does not accurately represent the evidence on face coverings that currently exists,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Dr Antonio Lazzarino of the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at University College London, agreed.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat is not a piece or research. That is a non-systematic review of anecdotical and non-clinical studies,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe evidence we need before we implement public interventions involving billions of people, must come ideally from randomised controlled trials at population level or at least from observational follow-up studies with comparison groups,\u201d said Lazzarino noting that will allow experts to look at the pros and cons of wearing masks.</p> \n<p>\u201cBased on what we now know about the dynamics of transmission and the pathophysiology of Covid-19, the negative effects of wearing masks outweigh the positive,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>But Prof Trisha Greenhalgh, of the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences at the University of Oxford, welcomed the report, saying it adds weight to the argument that face coverings by the general public could be part of a route out of lockdown.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt draws together a wealth of evidence including the science of transmission and the efficacy of cloth-based materials both in laboratory studies and in randomised controlled trials, in relation to both source control and protection of the wearer,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe authors flag the important finding that much if not most transmission of Sars-CoV-2 [coronavirus] happens from people who do not currently have symptoms. As would be expected from this distinguished group of scientists, the underlying evidence base is meticulously dissected and presented, including pointing out areas where more research is needed.\u201d </p> \n<p>Greenhalgh noted that while there have been concerns that use of masks by the public could reduce supply of medical-grade masks for healthcare workers, a homemade mask is sufficient for most people. \u201cMedical-grade masks are not needed outside of healthcare settings. A cloth mask provides very good protection, and is more comfortable to wear,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>The government is using the coronavirus pandemic to transfer key public health duties from the NHS and other state bodies to the private sector without proper scrutiny, critics have warned.</p> <p>Doctors, campaign groups, academics and MPs raised the concerns about a \u201cpower grab\u201d after it emerged on Monday that Serco was in pole position to win a deal to supply 15,000 call-handlers for the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/04/contact-tracing-app-to-be-piloted-on-isle-of-wight-this-week-matt-hancock-says\">tracking and tracing operation</a>.</p> <p>They said the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had \u201caccelerated\u201d the dismantling of state healthcare and that the duty to keep the public safe was being \u201coutsourced\u201d to the private sector.</p> <p>In recent weeks, ministers have used special powers to bypass normal tendering and award a string of contracts to private companies and management consultants without open competition.</p> <p>Deloitte, KPMG, Serco, Sodexo, Mitie, Boots and the US data mining group Palantir have secured taxpayer-funded commissions to manage Covid-19 drive-in testing centres, the purchasing of personal protective equipment (PPE) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/london-nhs-nightingale-hospital-placed-on-standby\">the building </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/london-nhs-nightingale-hospital-placed-on-standby\">of Nightingale hospitals</a>.</p> <p>Now, the Guardian has seen a letter from the Department of Health to NHS trusts instructing them to stop buying any of their own PPE and ventilators.</p> <p>From Monday, procurement of a list of 16 items must be handled centrally. Many of the items on the list, such as PPE, are in high demand during the pandemic, while others including CT scanners, mobile X-ray machines and ultrasounds are high-value machines that are used more widely in hospitals.</p> <p>Centralising purchasing is likely to hand more responsibility to Deloitte. As well as co-ordinating Covid-19 test centres and logistics at three new \u201clighthouse\u201d laboratories created to process samples, the accounting and management consultancy giant secured a contract several weeks ago to advise central government on PPE purchases.</p> <p>The firm said it was providing operational support for the procurement process of PPE from existing and new manufacturers, but declined to comment further.</p> <p>\u201cThe government must not allow the current crisis to be used as cover to extend the creeping privatisation of the NHS,\u201d said Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.</p> <p>\u201cThe process for the management and purchase of medical supplies must be open, transparent and subject to full scrutiny. Deloitte\u2019s track record of delivering PPE to the frontline since this virus began is not one of success and taking more decision-making authority from NHS managers and local authorities shifts power further from the frontline.\u201d</p> <p>Tony O\u2019Sullivan, a retired paediatrician who co-chairs the campaign group Keep Our NHS Public, said this was a \u201cdangerous time\u201d for the NHS, and that the \u201cerror-ridden response\u201d from government had exposed a decade of underfunding.</p> <p>\u201cNow, rather than learning from those errors they are compounding them by centralising decision-making but outsourcing huge responsibility for the safety of the population to private companies,\u201d said O\u2019Sullivan.</p> <p>Allyson Pollock, the director of the Newcastle University Centre for Excellence in Regulatory Science, said tasks including testing, contact tracing and purchasing should be handled through regional authorities rather than central government.</p> <p>\u201cWe are beginning to see the construction of parallel structures, having eviscerated the old ones,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is anything new, it just seems to be accelerated under Matt Hancock.

They must report down to the nearest 100 their stores of 13 types of protective equipment, including gloves, aprons, masks, gowns and eye protection. The information is being gathered by Palantir, a data processing company co-founded by the Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel.</p> <p>The information will be used to distribute equipment to those trusts most in need, and in some cases move stock from one hospital to another.</p> <p>A purchasing manager, speaking anonymously, said hospitals were concerned they might be forced to hand over stock and then run out before it could be replaced. \u201cThe lead time on some of these orders is 90 days,\u201d said the manager. \u201cCentrally, there is nobody who is able to deliver things more quickly. What this is going to do is force people to hide what they\u2019ve got.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis coronavirus pandemic is being used to privatise yet more of our NHS against the wishes of the public, and without transparency and accountability,\u201d said Cat Hobbs, director of campaign group We Own It. \u201cThis work should be done within the NHS. It shouldn\u2019t be outsourced.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is not the time for a power grab,\u201d said the Labour MP Rosie Cooper, who sits on the health and social care committee, which is conducting an inquiry into the management of the outbreak. \u201cWhatever contracts are awarded they have got to have a sunset clause. Three months, six months, it has got to be shown to be cost effective for it to continue after a certain date,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The Department of Health was contacted for comment.</p> <h2>Outsourcing</h2> <p><strong>Testing centres</strong></p> <p>Contracts to operate drive-through coronavirus testing centres were awarded under <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/procurement-policy-note-0120-responding-to-covid-19\">special pandemic rules</a> through a fast-track process without open competition. The contracts, the value of which has not been disclosed, were granted to accountants Deloitte, which is managing logistics at a national level.

In a note accompanying the filing of its 2019 accounts, it said: \u201cThe directors consider the specific downside scenario impact of Covid-19 on the group\u2019s occupancy levels and cash flows to be so significant that it represents a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the group\u2019s \u2026 ability to continue as a going concern.\u201d</p> <p>Amid concerns about a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing in care homes, families now appear to be taking matters into their own hands.</p> <p>Emma Jones, a solicitor specialising in human rights at Leigh Day, said she is receiving at least 10 calls a week from families struggling to persuade local authority social workers to let them remove residents from care homes.</p> <p>\u201cPrior to the crisis, I didn\u2019t often get enquiries from families wanting to bring their loved ones out of residential care homes and into their own homes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut families are worried now that care homes aren\u2019t the safest place for their loved ones and, as a result, they want them back home.</p> <p>\u201cThe difference now to before the crisis is the fear factor.

To him, the practice of factoring holds the key. Factoring is essentially a type of loan system, whereby money contractually due in years to come can be advanced for the payment of a penalty or fee. The borrower then adjusts his or her business plan in the years that follow to save the money and repay the loan.</p> \n<p>The EFL is in the first of a five-year broadcast deal with Sky worth \u00a3595m and what MacAnthony suggests is that the governing body brings forward the bulk of the monies due in years four and five in exchange for paying a penalty to the broadcaster of, say, 10%.

It can\u2019t die, we can\u2019t let it die. Raising \u00a3170m should be a piece of cake. If the Football League can\u2019t get that kind of advanced money from Sky or even the Premier League, then go to some of the private owners of clubs who are worth \u00a33bn or \u00a34bn and ask them if they want to earn 8% on their money every year. They will put it up and they\u2019ll probably get a knighthood for services to football, as well.\u201d</p> \n<p>MacAnthony would have stipulations for clubs that use the fund; a new set of rules for a new financial order. He says a strict salary cap based on turnover to reduce wage bills would be a prerequisite together with a cut in squad size to 23 players. There would also be an \u201cagents\u2019 treaty\u201d, under which players pay the 5% agents\u2019 fees rather than having clubs build them into deals.</p> \n<p>MacAnthony knows things have to change, including the financing of player loans from Premier League and Championship clubs to those further down. He says League One and Two clubs are sometimes asked to pay 100% of the player\u2019s wages and for 11 months rather than the nine of the season, with accommodation costs on top.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/03/footballs-return-from-enforced-layoff-brings-totally-new-type-of-stress\">Football's return from enforced layoff brings totally new type of stress | Paul MacInnes</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cWe are paying wages we shouldn\u2019t be paying to improve other people\u2019s players, to give them game time that they are not getting,\u201d MacAnthony says. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamentally and morally wrong. We have to stick together and say: \u2018League Two clubs pay \u00a3750-a-week maximum, League One up to \u00a31,250. That\u2019s it. Nine months. Enough of loan fees, too. And if the Premier League and Championship don\u2019t like it, we\u2019re not going to loan any players for a year.\u2019 Let\u2019s see how they like it when they can\u2019t get their teenagers out playing and they have assets that are depreciating.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Finally, MacAnthony would like to see the appointment of a \u201cfootball tsar\u201d to control a \u00a320m portion of the \u00a3170m relief fund. The person would be able to step in and run clubs that are close to going out of business, drawing on this money, rather than have firms of administrators do so.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe tsar would run the club for three to six months until a buyer is found and, when that happens, the fund is replenished,\u201d MacAnthony says. \u201cThis would save clubs from being run badly and going out of business.\u201d</p>",

Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that from tonight contact tracing will go live in the Isle of Wight. </strong>A new government app that will alert people if they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus is being piloted on the island, and Hancock urged islanders to dowload it. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Last week we put in place the testing capability on the island, from tonight the contact tracing capability will go live and from tomorrow NHS staff on the island will be able to download the app. From Thursday, each one of the 80,000 households on the island will get a letter from the chief nurse with comprehensive information about the trial. Islanders will then be able to install the app.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Addressing islanders directly, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>By downloading the app you are protecting your own health, you are protecting the health of your loved ones and the health of your community.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock said he would hire more than the 18,000 contact tracers already being recruited if necessary.</strong> That was just the initial number being trained this month to operate contact tracing on a national basis, he said. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is no magic around the 18,000 figure, that is the initial scale that we think is necessary.</p> \n   <p>If it needs to be bigger, when we find out from the ONS survey that is in the field at the moment what the prevalence of the disease is \u2013 the number of new cases per day actually out there rather than that we find through positive tests \u2013 then we will adjust that figure.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said, although the contact tracing scheme would help the government to suppress the coronavirus, the national system did not have to be in place before lockdown measures could be eased.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We haven\u2019t said we can\u2019t make changes [to lockdown] before [contact tracing] is up and running. It is just that the test, track and trace system will help us get R [the reproduction number] down and the lower the number of new cases, the more effective it will be.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that 85,186 coronavirus tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am this morning. </strong>That means, for the second day in a row, the government has failed to hit the target of 100,000 tests a day set for the end of April.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, said that it would take some time before scientists find out whether people who have had coronavirus develop immunity.</strong> But \u201cthe overwhelming majority\u201d of people who have had it have antibodies, a precursor for immunity, he said. Hancock revealed that, as someone who has had the illness himself, he is taking part in trials to check his antibody levels. But he said he would not feel confident going into a crowded room because he could not assume he was immune. And he could not make policy yet on the basis that people with the antibody are immune, he said.

Despite their extremely draconian nature, the regulations are secondary legislation, and they were introduced under a procedure that meant they became law before MPs had voted on them.</p> \n  <p><strong>Sir Graham Brady,</strong> the chair of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, used his speech to urge ministers to lift the current lockdown measures \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I hope that as ministers approach the second 21-day review they will do so always with a view to removing restrictions and removing these arbitrary rules and limitations on freedom as quickly as possible.</p> \n   <p>It will become even more important that we rely on common sense and voluntary cooperation rather than arbitrary rules.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Referring specifically to the rules affecting the over-70s (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/04/uk-coronavirus-live-draft-rules-on-post-lockdown-workplaces-leaked?page=with:block-5eafcf348f082b32fdd6cc66#block-5eafcf348f082b32fdd6cc66\">9.43am),</a> he went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have today the most healthiest, active elderly generation of all time and it would be tragic if government threatened this by trying to extend a so-called lockdown for those judged to be most at risk based on age.

We had to contact IQVIA again who assured us someone would turn up to take our blood and swabs the next day. Again, they didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Bernie Spratt said: \u201cWe replied to the invitation on 23 April and were given a home visit date of 27 April when an IQVIA nurse would arrive and test us both. Nobody arrived so we phoned the study contact line and rebooked for Thursday the 30th. Once again nobody arrived so we re-booked for Saturday 2 May. Saturday came and went and so I rang the study contact line again this morning and was told that the reason for the \u2018no shows\u2019 was that there were no test kits available in our area (Shipston on Stour).\u201d</p> \n  <p>The study involves the University of Oxford, data science company IQVIA UK and the National Biosample Centre in Milton Keynes. IQVIA have been fielding responses today on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IQVIA_UK/with_replies\">social media from people in a similar situation.</a></p> \n  <p>The Office for National Statistics, which alongside the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) is leading the study, said: \u201cWe were aware of this issue via the social media activity and have been getting it sorted out this afternoon.\u201d</p> \n  <p>It added that it already had some initial findings which had been shared with the government.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-04T18:11:40.233Z\">at 7.11pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb04c258f0809d50dbe652b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/frances-perraudin\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-04T17:10:04.612Z\">6.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Michael Gove has acknowledged that a new international effort to find a coronavirus vaccine, <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/world-leaders-pledge-74-billion-for-european-commissions-coronavirus-vaccine-fundraising-conference/a-53322501\">led by the EU</a>, was not a Boris Johnson initiative, despite front-page reports today. The Daily Express was one of a number of national newspapers to carry the prime minister\u2019s call for the world to work together to find a cure for Covid-19 on their front pages, with its headline reading: \u201cBoris leads \u00a36bn global race for vaccine.\u201d<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">Responding to a question from Labour\u2019s Paul Blomfield, Gove told parliament: \u201cWe will cooperate not just with our European neighbours but with other countries in the fight against Covid-19. He\u2019s right to say the prime minister is joining the call today in order to ensure that we can support the effort to secure a vaccine. The effort to secure a vaccine is necessarily an international one.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\">Blomfield asked Gove if, given the UK\u2019s involvement with the EU\u2019s initiative, the government would be joining the bloc\u2019s early warning and response system (EWRS) for pandemics, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/02/uk-seeks-access-to-eu-health-cooperation-in-light-of-coronavirus?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">The Guardian reported this weekend</a> that the British government was quietly seeking to access the EWRS, despite early reluctance to cooperate on health after Brexit.<br>Gove dodged the question about the EWRS, but said: \u201cWe will of course look pragmatically at how we can co-operate with our European friends and partners. But participation in the EMA would involve, certainly at the moment, the acceptance of the ECJ (European court of justice) oversight and that\u2019s not something that the British people voted to do.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\">Commenting on Gove\u2019s response, Blomfield said. \u201cMichael Gove was right to recognise this international partnership to find a coronavirus vaccine as an EU initiative and not a Boris Johnson project as claimed by some of the Conservative press. But he should also pledge to join the EU\u2019s pandemic early warning system, as the NHS wants, and think again about leaving the European Medicines Agency.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-04T18:16:30.917Z\">at 7.16pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb049178f08a69c6c689ac3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-04T16:57:25.843Z\">5.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: Given the lockdown still applies on the Isle of Wight, will it generate enough data for the app?</em></p> \n  <p>Hancock says he thinks it will.

Here is an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As lockdown is eased, ensuring that those who could work from home reasonably productively are doing so should be a policy priority. It dampens the trade-off between the level of economic activity and the rate of virus transmission. It benefits not only those who can work from home; it also enables more of those who cannot work from home to go to work, without society once again seeing a spike in virus infections large enough to precipitate the re-introduction of lockdown which would once again threaten their livelihoods. But there is obvious potential for market failure here resulting in insufficient working from home. Some of the benefits from doing so accrue not to the individuals or firms themselves but to others in society (through lower virus transmission); and working from home may require investments and adaptations that the uncertain environment could inhibit ...</p> \n   <p>Potential policy levers include: </p> \n   <p><strong>Subsidies for firms or workers who are operating from home.</strong> The theoretical case for these is clear, given the externalities, though the practical design could be challenging, e.g. to avoid large deadweight.</p> \n   <p><strong>Norm-setting.</strong> Simply sending a strong signal that certain sectors or occupations are expected to work from home, and that failing to do so is deemed unacceptable and irresponsible, may have a significant effect. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>There is a summary of the IFS paper <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14829\">here.</a></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb02e518f0826dcf8dc2c90\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/nicola-davis\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-04T15:02:01.965Z\">4.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A report from a multidisciplinary group convened by the Royal Society called Delve \u2013 Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics \u2013 has weighed up the evidence and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://rs-delve.github.io/reports/2020/05/04/face-masks-for-the-general-public.html\">come out in favour of the public wearing facemasks</a>, including homemade cloth coverings, in a bid to tackle covid-19.

The NHS would also need to find and train 2,000 additional people to specialise in contact tracing. </p> \n  <p>The document said the new \u201ctest, trace, isolate, support\u201d strategy would underpin the post-lockdown approach, alongside all existing measures such as social distancing, good hygiene such as regular hand washing, use of face-coverings in crowded public places and disease surveillance.</p> \n  <p>It was \u201cdesigned to help us interrupt chains of transmission in the community by identifying cases of Covid-19, tracing the people who may have become infected by spending time in close contact with them, and then supporting those close contacts to self-isolate, so that if they have the disease they are less likely transmit to it to others.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Anyone would had been closer than two metres from an infected person for 15 minutes or more would be required to self-isolate for 14 days, the document said.</p> \n  <p>Testing capacity would need to expand dramatically to cope: Scotland\u2019s daily testing potential would hit 8,000 samples a day by mid-May, with another 4,000 tests a day done at the UK government\u2019s Lighthouse laboratory at Glasgow university.</p> \n  <p>The first minister warned this would, in effect, become the new normal.

In a statement she said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When I applied for the role of general secretary in 2018 it was because I wanted to support Jeremy Corbyn, who inspired so many people to get involved in politics with his message of hope, equality and peace</p> \n   <p>It has been a huge privilege to be general secretary of the largest political party in Europe for the last two years, but now we have a new leadership team it is the right time to step down. I would like to thank Jeremy, our members and my staff colleagues who have given me so much support during what has been a very challenging period, in particular when I was suffering from ill health.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is important because the general secretary runs Labour HQ and Formby\u2019s resignation means that Sir Keir Starmer can now install one of his own allies in the post. Formby, who worked for Unite before becoming general secretary in 2018, was close to Jeremy Corbyn and his faction in the party. In the Conservative party a new leader is free to install his or her acolytes in top jobs at party HQ but in the Labour party the general secretary is more independent, and harder to move if he or she has the backing of the national executive committee. It took Corbyn more than two years to instal a general secretary viewed as a loyalist.</p> \n  <p>Paying tribute to Formby, Starmer said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I would like to thank Jennie for her service, and for the personal and professional efforts she has made in advancing the cause she has fought all her life for.</p> \n   <p>Jennie has led our party\u2019s organisation with commitment and energy through a period of political upheaval, including a snap general election last year.

In the letter to the complainant, who is not named in the report, Burns also suggested that he might raise the case in the Commons chamber using parliamentary privilege if his father did not get the money he felt was owed to him.</p> \n  <p>In his conclusion the standards committee said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Like the [parliamentary commissioner for standards], we are persuaded by the evidence that Mr Burns used his parliamentary position in an attempt to intimidate a member of the public into doing as Mr Burns wished, in a dispute relating to purely private family interests which had no connection with Mr Burns\u2019 parliamentary duties. Mr Burns persisted in making veiled threats to use parliamentary privilege to further his family\u2019s interests even during the course of the commissioner\u2019s investigation. He also misleadingly implied that his conduct had the support of the house authorities.</p> \n   <p>Parliamentary privilege, particularly the privilege of freedom of speech, is precious to our democracy. The right of members of parliament to speak in the chamber without fear or favour is essential to parliament\u2019s ability to scrutinise the executive and to tackle social abuses, particularly if the latter are committed by the rich and powerful who might use the threat of defamation proceedings to deter legitimate criticism. Precisely because parliamentary privilege is so important, it is essential to maintaining public respect for parliament that the protection afforded by privilege should not be abused by a member in the pursuit of their purely private and personal interests. We, like the commissioner, conclude that Mr Burns was guilty of abusing his privileged status in an attempt to intimidate a member of the public.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Burns told the committee that he accepted he should not have written the letter he did on Commons notepaper, but that he was under a \u201chuge amount of personal stress\u201d at the time.

Asked if he agreed, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think the time for postmortem into this global pandemic viral spread is for once we all have as much data as possible, the testing around the world produces solid and realistic results about who is infected, how it acts with different people, and also when there\u2019s potentially a vaccine in place.</p> \n   <p>That\u2019s the time to have those types of discussions.</p> \n   <p>By me speculating or talking about what I think about China or anyone else isn\u2019t going to help the fight against coronavirus in the UK right now.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Wallace rejected claims there was a blanket rule saying the over-70s have to rigorously self-isolate. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s not a blanket view of the over-70s. If you are over 70 and you have a range of conditions you are viewed as very highly clinically vulnerable and you should take extra measures.</p> \n   <p>If you are over 70 you should take extra precautions but it is not a blanket rule that if you are over 70 at the moment you are going to be treated differently from other people.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Wallace\u2019s comment is correct, but it is striking that six weeks into the lockdown, there is still confusion about what the rules actually say.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I strongly believe the public aren\u2019t stupid. They read advice, they listen to the media. They took on board the government\u2019s advice ... and I think they will be perfectly able to read the government\u2019s next stage when we get to it.

The two-metre rule reduces the possibility of infection by a certain amount of time.</p> \n   <p>If you halve that it still keeps people away from being infected but for a lesser time. The probability of being infected is much less.</p> \n   <p>I think there are options about how we can do it.

It includes the suggestion that employers should minimise the number of people using equipment, stagger shift times, reduce hot desking and maximise home-working.

  "<p>Ratatouille is an classic vegetable stew that\u2019s especially delicious in autumn.</p> <p>As with all recipes, it can be tweaked each time you make it, depending on the application, with one important caveat: take my and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatouille#Preparation\">Jo\u00ebl Robuchon</a>\u2019s advice and cook each vegetable separately \u2013 it really does dial the flavour up infinitely.

Roughly cut the onion into 3cm pieces, then rough chop the garlic. Add a splash of the olive oil into a large, deep-sided frypan on medium heat and then add the onion and caramelise it slightly, resisting the urge to stir or move the onion too much in the pan.</p> <p>Add the garlic and thyme to the onion and cook for another two minutes to caramelise slightly.</p> <p>Remove the onion and garlic to a large, flat tray or bowl.</p> <p>Chop the eggplant, then zucchini, capsicum and tomatoes one by one into 3cm cubes and cook them individually in the pan, with another splash of the olive oil, a pinch of salt and a grind of pepper each time.</p> <p>Each vegetable type cooks separately while you cut the next. Rotate vegetable pieces as they caramelise to a golden brown.</p> <p>Remove each vegetable type to the tray with the onion as you go, and then work on the next. The caramelisation in the pan will build \u2013 don\u2019t wash it, just keep going.</p> <p>The vegetables on the tray will cool slightly to handling temperature.</p> <p>Once all the vegetables are cooked and cooling, it\u2019s time to make the tart.</p> <p><em><strong>Making the filo tart</strong></em></p> <p>Once all the vegetables are cooked but still separated, you can decorate the tart in pretty, uniform lines of vegetable; or just use the ratatouille mixed up, it will still taste just as good!</p> <p>Start on the filo pastry just before you need it \u2013 otherwise it will dry out.</p> <p>Lay out a large piece of grease-proof paper \u2013 this will be used as handles to move the tart once it is made. Put two layers of the filo on the grease-proof paper and, using a pastry brush, brush the surface well with the melted butter. If you don\u2019t have a pastry brush, fingers will work for this \u2013 it\u2019s messier, but great for kids to \u201chelp\u201d with.</p> <p>Add two more layers of pastry, rotating the sheets a few centimetres around so you are working towards making a circle. Brush with the butter again and keep going until you have a circle comprised of six to eight layers, each with two sheets of pastry.</p> <p>Trim the pastry to the desired shape, leaving about 3cm around the edge to twist up. I made an oval that was 40cm long and 20cm wide. Stash the pastry off-cuts for use later.</p> <p>Leave the baking paper under the pastry so it can easily be moved to and from the baking tray later.</p> <p>Lay out lines of the partially cooked vegetables. If you make it too loaded up with veggies, the pastry will not crisp up underneath the tart. A single layer of vegetables is ideal.</p> <p>Fold and twist the pastry in towards the vegetables, to nestle them in. Run a little more of the melted butter on the pastry brush around the finished edge, and add a grind of pepper.</p> <p>Transfer the baking paper with the tart on top on to a flat baking tray (the same tray type you would use for biscuits). Criss-cross with anchovy fillets and olives and a sprinkle of chopped parsley.</p> <p>Bake in a 180C oven for 10 minutes until the pastry is golden and crunchy.</p> <p>Remove the tart to a wire rack and cool slightly. To serve, cut it into wedges \u2013 make sure to cut across the vegetables lines for a mix of ratatouille flavours.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/01/yotam-ottolenghis-10-recipes-perfect-for-an-australian-autumn\">Yotam Ottolenghi's 10 recipes perfect for an Australian autumn</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em><strong>To finish the remaining ratatouille</strong></em></p> <p>Add all the cooked vegetables back into the same pan and cook together so the flavours meld for another 10 minutes or so.

Check for seasoning and add more salt and pepper if needed.</p> <p>The stew should have a tender, nearly creamy texture, yet each vegetable should be identifiable.</p> <p>You can use the stew in so many ways. Here are some of my favourites:</p> <p>\u2022 Serve it alongside any and every protein; fish, chicken lamb \u2013 I haven\u2019t yet found a protein it doesn\u2019t work with.</p> <p>\u2022 Place it on top of crushed cooked beans, or mix through for a quick \u201cbaked beans\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 Use it as the base of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/nov/12/jackie-middletons-quick-and-easy-caprese-inspired-frittata-recipe\">frittata</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 Add broth and whizz it through the blender to make a soup.</p> <p>\u2022 Use it as the soffritto or dressing for a pot of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/29/easy-weekday-recipe-spicy-mussels-lap-cheong-and-coconut\">hot steamed mussels</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 Layer it into lasagne sheets, or instead of a tomato sugo on any pasta dish.</p> <p>\u2022 Use it as the base for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/01/baked-eggs-a-recipe-for-a-restorative-resolution-friendly-new-years-day-brunch\">baked eggs</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 Mix it through 50/50 hummus or mashed avocado, as a dip or on toast.</p> <p>\u2022 Use it as a chunky relish with molten or soft cheeses.</p> <p>\u2022 Roughly blend the stew and use as a tomato sauce substitute.</p> <p><em><strong>And for the leftover pastry</strong></em></p> <p>You can use any offcut pastry that\u2019s already layered with butter for a quick, fun dessert. Peel a ripe banana and wrap the scrappy pastry pieces around it, inserting some chocolate chips. Bake in the oven with the tart in a small loaf pan until the pastry is golden and the chocolate runny.</p>",

An enthusiastic painter from an early age, while studying at Bishop Anstey high school she joined the Trinidad Art Society and had her first work exhibited at the age of 16. </p> <p>She worked as a cartographer and illustrator for the British government in Trinidad until, in 1951, at the age of 27, she accompanied her mother to England, where her father had already moved to work. In London she won a scholarship to study architecture at the Architectural Association, but chose instead to take a course in print studies at the London School of Printing and Graphic Arts (now the London College of Communication).</p> <p>She moved on to the Central School of Art and Design, where her tutor, the sculptor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/apr/23/guardianobituaries.obituaries\">Eduardo Paolozzi</a>, persuaded her to apply her print skills to textiles. Then, after finishing postgraduate studies at the Royal College of Art in 1957, she became a busy freelance. Her first big client was Liberty, which in 1958 commissioned her to design a range of fabrics. These included a furnishing fabric called Cebollas with a strong tropical flavour \u2013 featuring blue onions set against a brown background \u2013 and another called Hibiscus, an even bolder furnishing textile boasting bright-red hibiscus flowers set against a sharply contrasting black background.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/26/letter-althea-mcnish-obituary\">Letter: Althea McNish obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p><br> In 1959, for Hull Traders, a company later responsible for many of the colourful and irreverent pop designs of the swinging 60s, she created a sensation with Golden Harvest, a screen print on cotton satin used for upholstery fabrics that featured a bright-orange, yellow and black graphic pattern inspired by the wheat fields of Essex, which reminded her of Trinidad\u2019s sugarcane plantations. </p> <p>By 1960 she was taking on jobs for Cavendish Textiles and then for Heal\u2019s, for whom she designed Trinidad, a printed furnishing textile covered with a loosely sketched dense tropical forest, filled with green palm trees of different shapes and sizes. At this time she also worked for Ascher\u2019s textile company, which commissioned her to create printed silk dress fabrics.</p> <p>Other British manufacturers who approached McNish included Danasco Fabrics, for whom, in 1961, she produced Tom\u00e9e, an exceptionally vivid monoprint of an abstract pattern made up of pink, orange and lemon stripes. In 1968, for the Bridlington-based firm Sanderson-Rigg, she designed a space-age-style wallpaper, named Zircon, featuring a dazzling abstract pattern coloured orange, mustard and yellow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"579392ab3ba02d868c700e51eb54c0a87910adc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/579392ab3ba02d868c700e51eb54c0a87910adc1/691_0_1916_2395/800.jpg\" alt=\"Althea McNish appeared in the BBC4 TV documentary Whoever Heard of a Black Artist?, 2018.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Althea McNish appeared in the BBC4 TV documentary Whoever Heard of a Black Artist?, 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rose Sinclair</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Throughout the 1960s McNish also ensured that she retained her links with the West Indies. She was a founding member of the Caribbean Artists Movement, active between 1966 and 1972, which sought to celebrate what it recognised as a distinctive Caribbean aesthetic, and she designed murals for the interior of the Port of Spain general hospital, as well as fabrics for Queen Elizabeth\u2019s official wardrobe when she visited Trinidad and Tobago in 1966.</p> <p>At the same time McNish\u2019s art work was being displayed in exhibitions \u2013 beginning with Paintings by Trinidad and Tobago Artists at the Commonwealth Institute in London in 1961. Over the years her paintings and drawings were shown at the Victoria and Albert Museum (1978), the Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester (2007) and, most recently, at Somerset House in London (2019). Examples of her textile design can be found in the V&amp;A, the Museum of Domestic Design and Architecture in London, the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Cooper-Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York.</p> <p>Through the final decades of the 20th century, whether as a juror for design competitions, attending openings of design exhibitions, or in her capacity as a vice-president and fellow of the Chartered Society of Designers and a member of the board of the UK Design Council, she was a familiar figure in the British design community. I remember her in particular at lunchtimes in the Royal College of Art\u2019s senior common room, where her colourful clothing lit up that space.</p> <p>She was awarded the Chaconia gold medal in Trinidad for her contributions to art and design, and in 2006 an honorary doctorate in fine arts from the University of Trinidad and Tobago, where she mentored many of its student designers. Most recently she appeared on the BBC4 documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jul/30/whoever-heard-of-a-black-artist-britains-hidden-art-history\">Whoever Heard of a Black Artist?</a>, aired in 2018, and in the same year a section of the book <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/women-design-9780711239234.html\">Women Design</a>, by the design historian Libby Sellers, was devoted to McNish and her work.</p> <p>In 1969 she married the British jewellery designer <a href=\"https://www.thejc.com/news/obituaries/obituary-john-saul-weiss-1.473895\">John Weiss</a>.

In her small premises Tanyel can now only serve one customer at a time. \u201cIf it had been up to me, they might as well have kept us shut.\u201d</p> <p>Compulsory face masks for customers and stylists means visiting the hairdresser will become a less intimate ritual than it used to be.</p> <p>Jan Wellge booked a slot at Your Loving Nature for himself and his five-year-old daughter Sophie as soon as the government announced plans to reopen salons, in order to beat the rush: as of Monday there were no free slots at the salon until July.</p> <p>He conceded the masks, the lack of a friendly hug upon arrival and the hand-disinfecting rituals made it a more clinical experience than in the past.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Wellge, 39, said he was relieved to have his hair short again. Usually commuting between Berlin and the Wolfsburg headquarters of Volkswagen, he had been working from home during the lockdown but said it was still important to look smart.</p> <p>\u201cIt helps to put on a shirt in the morning,\u201d he said. \u201cIt reminds your family you are working, and you know you have signed off for the day when you can take it off.\u201d</p> <p>Garz said she had noticed how many of her regular customers had emerged from almost seven weeks of lockdown with a changed self-image, sometimes for the better.</p> <p>As well as men becoming more accepting of their longer locks, she said many women in her friendship circle had allowed themselves to let their hair grow out grey.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of women obsess about their hair colour way in which some men obsess about cars or football teams,\u201d Garz said. \u201cIf you suddenly take that away from them, that can be really the toughest blow.</p> <p>\u201cBut during lockdown a lot of my customers have also learned to look at themselves in a new light. It\u2019s almost as if for some people, a loss of control can be a really healing thing.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>As realisation dawned that a full-blown coronavirus outbreak was inevitable, the government set British industry a seemingly impossible task.</p> \n<p>The NHS had about 8,000 ventilators available but the latest modelling, based on evidence from China, suggested that up to 30,000 would be needed, within a matter of weeks.</p> \n<p>During a conference call on Monday 16 March, dozens of manufacturers and medical device specialists were told the grim news and asked to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/how-the-uk-plans-to-source-30000-ventilators-for-nhs-coronavirus\">launch a wartime-style effort \u2013 dubbed the ventilator challenge</a> \u2013 to bridge the gap.</p> \n<p>Nearly seven weeks later, things look very different. The NHS has neither needed 30,000 ventilators, nor has it come close to calling on the 18,000 that health secretary Matt Hancock <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/how-close-is-the-nhs-to-getting-the-18000-ventilators-it-needs-coronavirus\">set as a revised target in early April</a>.</p> \n<p>The inside story of what happened in this period is one of early panic and confusion, of companies with expertise clashing with those seizing the limelight with ambitions to innovate, of questionable designs, and the desperation of a government setting targets and then deciding it didn\u2019t need to meet them after all.</p> \n<p>The judgment as to whether ministers have made the right call will be made in the months to come. Either way, the clinicians and medical device experts who spoke to the Guardian say lessons have to be learned.</p> \n<p>The ventilator challenge began on Saturday 14<sup> </sup>March, led by chief commercial officer, Gareth Rhys Williams, the civil servant who oversees state procurement.</p> \n<p>\u201cI got an email at midnight asking if I could call him [Rhys-Williams],\u201d said Nick Grey, a designer and inventor behind Worcestershire-based technology firm Gtech. \u201cHe said the PM had given him a special job: \u2018we\u2019re going to need up to 30,000 ventilators in two weeks, is that something you can help with?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Building a modern high-quality machine from a standing start would, he believed, have been impossible. But like many other designers and engineers who responded to the rallying cry, Grey believed he could knock up something serviceable.</p> \n<p>\u201cI said, \u2018If you\u2019re really stuck and people can\u2019t breathe I can produce something that can keep them going.\u2019 It would have had to have been really bad to do that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Grey wasn\u2019t the only who was sceptical about producing something more sophisticated. Asking manufacturers to switch from cars or jet engines to specialist medical devices was unrealistic according to Craig Thompson, head of products at Oxfordshire firm Penlon, one of the few specialist ventilator firms in the country.</p> \n<p>But at this stage, according to Whitehall sources, ministers were desperate; they believed tens of thousands of people might require ventilation. Basic devices, however undesirable, might have to do. </p> \n<p>\u201cWe were of the view that we had to back every horse,\u201d said an adviser to a cabinet minister involved in the plans.</p> \n<p>The strategy was threefold; buy proven devices from the few small firms that made them, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/uk-scrambles-for-foreign-made-ventilators-ahead-of-coronavirus-peak\">import some from overseas</a> and, most importantly, look to the the ventilator challenge to deliver thousands more machines.</p> \n<p>Already though, some experts were concerned at how much credence was being given to the notion that non-specialist companies could build their own simple devices. </p> \n<p>\u201cThey [the government] were initially talking about a Manley-Blease-style ventilator,\u201d said a source at one specialist ventilator company. \u201cThey sent links to it.\u201d</p> \n<p>He was referring to a 1960s design by Roger Manley and the Blease Medical company, a major advance at the time but crude by modern standards.</p> \n<p>In a document sent to manufacturers, the government said the new devices should ideally be able to support a patient for a number of days, but left open the option to build devices capable of providing support for a few hours to a day.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese companies were all focused on the big prize of coming up with their own ventilator,\u201d said the source. \u201cI saw videos of some of them \u2026 the jerky motion suggested something that hadn\u2019t been fully thought through. They didn\u2019t exactly impress me as far as working concepts go.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Alison Pittard, dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, has said that simple devices of this nature <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/365529f8-bff3-41d2-949f-d0eedff0cfbb\">would have been \u201cof no use\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>Yet firms with no prior experience were increasingly bullish that they could design and build a prototype within weeks.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/26/from-vacuum-cleaners-to-ventilators-can-dyson-make-the-leap\">One of these was Dyson</a>, the engineering group whose success was built off the back of the bagless vacuum cleaner invented by its founder, Sir James Dyson. On the evening of 25<sup> </sup>March, the billionaire Brexit-backer indicated in an email to staff that the prime minister, Boris Johnson, had personally asked him for help.</p> \n<p>The company had been working with Cambridge-based The Technology Partnership on the CoVent, a breathing device that it believed would help meet the nation\u2019s needs. The government, he said, had ordered 10,000.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/ventilator-companies-zip/giv-3902fFstQa2sj8zF/\" data-alt=\"Ventilator graph\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/ventilator-companies-zip/giv-3902fFstQa2sj8zF/\">Ventilator graph</a> \n <figcaption> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Within an hour of the memo to staff, Dyson was sending out mocked-up images of the CoVent. The move angered some of those involved in parallel projects, who felt the buccaneering tone masked the enormity of the challenge.</p> \n<p>\u201cDyson jumping the gun wasn\u2019t helpful to anyone,\u201d said one source. \u201cWe were looking at them aghast. Nobody said you had to start from scratch.\u201d</p> \n<p>According to one source, the firms that opted to design and build new machines had to lean heavily on support from the medical device regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).</p> \n<p>\u201cWithout the independent regulatory teams, most of these projects would have gone nowhere,\u201d the source said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say you can just design a ventilator but the safety isn\u2019t just in the design, it\u2019s about how you make them, the quality management, servicing them. It\u2019s not an innovation programme, it was there to meet a clinical need. And that need was always most likely to be met by scaling up manufacture of existing devices.\u201d</p> \n<p>Only one group had taken this latter approach and it was quietly making more progress than any other.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/ventilator-challenge-uk-to-start-production-in-covid-19-fight\">Ventilator Challenge UK consortium</a>, involving more than 20 firms, counted the likes of Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Ford and McLaren among its number. It is on track to deliverthousands of ventilators to the NHS. Rather than reinvent the wheel, the consortium focused on existing designs. </p> \n<p>\u201cIt was our choice that it was the quickest route,\u201d said Dick Elsy, the consortium\u2019s chairman. \u201cOthers pursued the start-from-scratch approach and some [of those projects] have been turned off.\u201d</p> \n<p>By early April, Ventilator Challenge UK was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/we-made-right-choice-in-ventilator-race-says-uk-consortium-head\">inching towards production</a> and imports were starting to trickle through, albeit not in the volume the government had hoped for.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile Dyson, defence group Babcock and a group of Cambridge scientists called Sagentia were continuing to work on their new prototypes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Still though, the numbers were far lower than hoped. The NHS now had close to 9,000 devices but none had yet come from the ventilator challenge.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe fact is that the industry has answered the call but the government wasn\u2019t shouting early enough,\u201d confided a frustrated source involved in one of the projects in early April.</p> \n<p>Despite commissioning multiple new devices with no measurable chance of success, the government hadn\u2019t, in fact, backed every horse.</p> \n<p>The UK failed to join an EU procurement scheme that promise to source proven designs, a revelation that led to the prime minister being accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/no-10-boris-johnson-accused-of-putting-brexit-over-breathing-in-covid-19-ventilator-row\">putting \u201cBrexit over breathing\u201d</a>. The row descended into farce as the government changed its story, first indicating the snub was deliberate before blaming a \u201ccommunication problem\u201d.</p> \n<p>By 5 April though, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had reduced the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/how-close-is-the-nhs-to-getting-the-18000-ventilators-it-needs-coronavirus\">target to 18,000 ventilators</a>, a more manageable if still rather distant prospect.</p> \n<p>Three days later, based on clinical advice, the government upgraded its requirements.</p> \n<p>Doctors treating Covid-19 patients had learned that they typically suffered rapid fluid build-up in the lungs, requiring frequent drainage. The initial specifications had not envisaged this and some of the more basic models were not equipped to handle it.</p> \n<p>One anaesthetist, who asked not to be named, said the Department of Health and Social Care should have been aware of this issue far earlier.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe had done strategies for changing over ventilators as people built up fluid. We knew that was going to be the case.\u201d</p> \n<p>Other clinicians say doctors\u2019 understanding was constantly changing.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat I would say is that this is genuinely a new disease,\u201d said Dr Daniele Bryden, vice-dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine and an intensive care practitioner who has treated coronavirus patients. \u201cIt takes time to understand long-term impacts for the individual.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some projects fell by the wayside. Even the high-spec Penlon Prima EOS2, manufactured by Ventilator Challenge UK and now being used in hospitals, had to be sent back to the factory to be refined.</p> \n<p>With cancellations and delays like these affecting the race, time appeared to be running out \u2013 10 days after Hancock revised down the ventilator target to 18,000, the NHS still had only 10,000.</p> \n<p>Luckily for Covid-19 patients \u2013 not to mention the ministers overseeing the ventilator challenge \u2013 external factors came to the rescue.</p> \n<p>Only about half of Covid-19 patients admitted to intensive care with breathing difficulties were being put on mechanical ventilators.</p> \n<p>Martin Allen, a consultant respiratory physician and board member of the British Thoracic Society, explained why.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn Wuhan, when they tried other ventilation strategies they failed. Everyone needed to go on to invasive ventilation, so there was a concern that spread throughout the rest of the world,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>In Italy though, a lack of the devices forced doctors to try other strategies, such as increased use of Cpap machines, which deliver oxygen via a mask rather than requiring intubation \u2013 where oxygen is delivered by the ventilator through a tube inserted into the airway.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/ventilators_cpac-zip/giv-3902u72LXG0w1n8J/\" data-alt=\"Graph\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/ventilators_cpac-zip/giv-3902u72LXG0w1n8J/\">Graph</a> \n <figcaption> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Of the experts who spoke to the Guardian, many felt that the ventilator strategy would not have withstood a sterner test.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe country has been fortunate that we\u2019ve not see the levels we frankly should have expected\u201d said one ventilator expert. \u201cIt could have been far worse.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government said that it was, at all times, guided by expert scientific advice.</p> \n<p>Yet manufacturers felt the plan began too late, while imports that were supposed to number around 8,000 have only just passed 800. Last week it emerged that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/30/entire-order-of-250-chinese-ventilators-were-useless-despite\">250 from China were ditched</a> because doctors feared they might harm or even kill patients.</p> \n<p>Of the \u201cnew\u201d ventilator projects, none have reached the final stages of testing and the majority \u2013 including those made by Sagentia and Dyson \u2013 have proved surplus to requirements. </p> \n<p>Dr Bryden questioned whether the intense focus on ventilators was ever the most sophisticated approach.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou cannot save somebody\u2019s life with a piece of equipment alone. You also need someone who knows how to look after the patients.\u201d</p> \n<p>Prof Carl Heneghan, director of the centre for evidence-based medicine at Oxford University, believes that a strategy that relied on firms cobbling together life-saving devices in a matter of weeks should teach us more enduring lessons.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen we look back there will be serious questions to answer about all of the decisions made.

  "<p>John Oliver returned to Last Week Tonight from a brief hiatus Sunday night for another examination of America\u2019s botched response to coronavirus, which has now claimed over 65,000 lives in the US in three months, more than the Vietnam war \u2013 a \u201cgrim\u201d milestone, said Oliver, which is why it was so \u201cjarring to see Jared Kushner and his resting \u2018Do you know who my father is?\u2019 face basically declare victory over the virus.\u201d Last Wednesday, Kushner told Fox &amp; Friends that the federal government\u2019s response to the virus was a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/29/politics/jared-kushner-coronavirus-success-story/index.html\">\u201cgreat success story\u201d</a> that would have the country \u201creally rocking again\u201d by July.</p> <p>\u201cOh, it will be \u2018really rocking again,\u2019 will, it Jared?\u201d Oliver scoffed. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to see someone with the skin of a newborn baby birthed in a tub of Neutrogena talk like a middle-age dad desperately trying to connect with his teenage son. But before we can celebrate Jared\u2019s \u2018great success story,\u2019 and get back to our \u2018rockin\u2019 selves,\u2019 we badly need to work out how we can reopen parts of society.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl4c-jr7g0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7rl4c-jr7g0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Numerous experts say that means one thing: testing. \u201cIn managing a pandemic, there is almost nothing more important than widespread, effective testing,\u201d Oliver explained. And yet tests have been scarce in the US since the beginning, the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-will-coronavirus-end/608719/\">\u201coriginal sin\u201d</a> of America\u2019s pandemic failure, as it could\u2019ve allowed containment of the virus through contact tracing and targeted quarantines had widespread testing been available earlier.</p> <p>Experts agree that, as Oliver explained, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/02/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-testing\">a lack of testing</a> goes to the very heart of how we got into this situation and the truth is, broad testing is our only safe way out of it\u201d. The lowest estimate for the volume of <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/27/coronavirus-many-states-short-of-testing-levels-needed-for-safe-reopening/\">mass testing required now to safely reopen</a> is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-testing-states.html\">500,000 tests a day</a>; a good target would be <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/4/13/21215133/coronavirus-testing-covid-19-tests-screening\">35m</a><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/4/13/21215133/coronavirus-testing-covid-19-tests-screening\"> a day.</a> (The US is currently <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily\">averaging 200,000 tests a day</a>). \u201cThink of it like this: if our goal was to eat an Italian dinner, we\u2019re currently stuck in traffic on the way to an Olive Garden,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cWe\u2019re not even halfway to arriving at the worst place that technically qualifies.\u201d</p> <p>Which was why Oliver devoted the evening to ask: \u201cWhat the fuck happened?\u201d First, there was a failure to deliver diagnostic tests, which tell you if you have the virus, when cases first appeared in the US in February. The CDC decided to make their own testing kits, but as they were shipped around the country, it was revealed that chemical contamination during manufacturing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-testing-us\">rendered the tests useless</a>. Even worse, the CDC took weeks to come up with a work-around. The US lost nearly an entire month of time to viably test people, which Oliver described as \u201cabsolutely catastrophic\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/20/john-oliver-coronavirus-fox-trump-misinformation\">John Oliver blasts the misinformation 'feedback loop between Fox and Trump'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Private labs tried to step in, but outdated regulations and bureaucratic red tape kept them from producing their own tests. It wasn\u2019t until the end of February that the FDA allowed private labs to develop their own tests, but \u201cby that point, a whole month had gone by and incredibly, we\u2019d only tested \u2013 in the whole country \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-many-americans-are-sick-lost-february/608521/\">472 people</a>,\u201d Oliver explained. South Korea, which had its first confirmed case on the same day as the US, had <a href=\"https://khn.org/news/fact-check-trumps-boast-about-u-s-south-korea-coronavirus-testing-misses-the-mark/\">tested 55,000 people</a> by that point.</p> <p>\u201cFor too long, the US response seemed to be characterized by an arrogant belief that for some reason, coronavirus was never going to come to America because, I guess, it just wouldn\u2019t dare,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cAnd unfortunately, we\u2019re currently living in the consequences of those early failures.\u201d The slow rollout of testing coincided with crippled supply lines from China, leading to shortages of testing components such as swabs and chemical reagents. Trump, who initially dismissed pleas from state governors for more tests, eventually invoked the Defense Production Act to manufacture testing supplies, but it was too late. \u201cTiming is absolutely everything here,\u201d Oliver explained, and tests were heavily rationed.</p> <p>Which makes it especially frustrating, Oliver continued, that in his victory lap interview, Kushner praised the administration\u2019s \u201cquick\u201d response as \u201ctruly extraordinary\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/01/stephen-colbert-trump-coronavirus-late-show-recap\">Colbert: Trump 'wants everything to go back to normal because he\u2019s bored'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cNo it fucking isn\u2019t, Jared,\u201d replied an infuriated Oliver. \u201cTaking months to do what other countries did in weeks is not extraordinary. The only thing that\u2019s extraordinary here is that the most punchable face in America somehow looks like it\u2019s never been touched by human hands. Does it just absorb fists like a bowl of heavy cream? What\u2019s your secret, you translucent sociopath?\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, antibody tests, which show if you have some trace of the virus from earlier exposure, are proliferating despite inaccurate and dubiously effective results. There are now over 150 different antibody tests on the markets, none of which have been approved by the FDA, and, to paraphrase an expert, \u201cmany of tests are garbage and over half of the positive tests right now would be wrong,\u201d said Oliver.</p> <p>In sum, America\u2019s testing capacity today is simply not enough, and though Oliver conceded that \u201csome confusion is inevitable when a new disease starts spreading its way around the world, and it\u2019s not like rolling out testing on this kind of scale was ever going to be easy,\u201d the people in charge repeatedly \u201cfailed to prepare for the worst-case scenario and have been slow in fixing mistakes. All of which means in May, we are still playing catch-up in the middle of a pandemic, which in turn, means thousands upon thousands of people dying preventable deaths.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo if this is a great success story for anyone,\u201d he concluded, \u201cit\u2019s for the fucking coronavirus.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The head of the EU\u2019s agency for disease control has warned that the UK is one of five European countries failing to reduce active coronavirus infections, despite Boris Johnson\u2019s claims of success.</p> <p>Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), suggested on Monday that the UK had yet to progress as far as the majority of European countries in tackling the disease.</p> <p>In evidence to the European parliament\u2019s committee on public health, Ammon said Europe as a whole appeared to have passed the peak of infections on Saturday, with only Bulgaria still experiencing an increase in cases of infection.</p> <p>But she told MEPs that the UK, along with Poland, Romania and Sweden, stood out as showing \u201cno substantial changes in the last 14 days\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAll the others, we really see this substantial decrease,\u201d Ammon said of the cumulative incidence rate, which provides a measure of the prevalence of active cases in the population. She did not offer any explanation of the differences.</p> <p>The ECDC monitors all 27 EU member states plus the UK, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.</p> <p>The agency reported that as of Monday there had been 1.2 million confirmed cases of infection, with 136,347 deaths within the territory it monitors.</p> <p>The UK has recorded 186,599 confirmed cases and 28,466 fatalities, a death count second only to Italy, according to the ECDC\u2019s latest data. Only the US has suffered more deaths.</p> <p>Last week, Johnson claimed that Britain had gone past the peak and was \u201con the downward slope\u201d.</p> <p>In the last week there has been a decrease of around 13% in the the number of people with Covid-19 in UK hospitals. There has also been a decrease in the number of deaths.</p> <p>The government has warned of the difficulties in making international comparisons, with the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, insisting that while the government \u201cwill have made mistakes\u201d the evidence will need to be assessed in the future.</p> <p>But Ammon\u2019s suggestion that the UK is yet to show the sustained improvement seen elsewhere in Europe offers some grounds for caution as Downing Street seeks to champion its efforts to reduce the rate of infection.</p> <p>It has been suggested in Whitehall that a better insight into the relative success of governments will be found in the increase of excess deaths during the pandemic, rather than just those officially recorded as being related to Covid-19.</p> <p>But an EU-backed project <a href=\"https://www.euromomo.eu/\">monitoring all excess deaths</a> during the pandemic reported that England had seen the highest rise in deaths over the five-year average compared with Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.</p> <p>Ammon, a former head of department for infectious disease epidemiology at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, said the lockdowns brought in by governments across Europe as a whole had reduced transmissions by 45% compared with 8 April.</p> <p>She warned, however, against any complacency and suggested that her agency had little confidence that the reporting of deaths and infections was complete.</p> <p>A government spokesman said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s approach throughout this pandemic has been guided by the latest scientific evidence.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen a marked decline in both daily confirmed cases and deaths in recent weeks and our published data clearly shows this.</p> <p>\u201cOther countries may be at different stages of the outbreak and there is variety in how they record and report deaths, so comparisons can be unhelpful, inaccurate and misleading\u201d.</p> <p>Researchers at the University of Bonn suggested on Monday that more than 10 times as many people in Germany <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/german-covid-19-cases-may-be-10-times-higher-than-official-figures\">ha</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/german-covid-19-cases-may-be-10-times-higher-than-official-figures\">d probably been infecte</a>d with the coronavirus than the number of confirmed cases, following a field trial in one of the worst-hit towns.</p>",

It\u2019s therefore reasonable for the government to explicitly require a new coronavirus risk assessment in every workplace. This should be done in agreement with recognised unions in the workplace. Union health and safety reps are experts who have special legal rights to investigate workplace hazards. And where there isn\u2019t yet a union, management should consult with staff.</p> <p>Those with underlying health conditions and pregnant workers need to know what extra measures will be taken to guarantee their safety at work. Risk assessments must take on board emerging evidence on impacts for particular groups, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/01/why-bame-people-may-be-more-at-risk-from-coronavirus-video-explainer\">BAME workers</a>. Outside of the workplace, the government needs a clear plan to safeguard those commuting to work on public transport. Only when these actions are completed and communicated should staff begin to return to work.</p> <p>Businesses don\u2019t operate in vacuums, they\u2019re at the heart of our communities. Any actions they fail to take will impact the rates of infection in the areas where they\u2019re located. This is why ministers must require every employer with more than five employees to go further and publish their risk assessment and action plan on their own website and a government portal. This approach is already used to highlight gender pay gaps. And it\u2019s achievable: the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/20/fears-of-flood-as-uks-covid-19-furlough-scheme-opens\">job retention scheme site</a>, used by 140,000 firms on its first day, shows that the government can build robust online services quickly when needed.</p> <p>Communities should be able to see what action each employer is taking, and that means enforcement can follow, if needed. This will help reputable employers, by stopping rogue bosses getting an unfair advantage by ignoring the rules. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and local authorities are responsible for ensuring employers keep workers safe, but they have been starved of resources. According to the TUC\u2019s own analysis, in the past decade HSE inspections have fallen by 70%, and prosecutions by 82%. In order to ramp up enforcement, more resources will be needed. Inspectors will be needed to go into high-risk and large workplaces, and ministers need to be clear that they have the right to close down workplaces and prosecute employers who fail to keep their workers safe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/03/universal-basic-income-coronavirus-shocks\">Why universal basic income could help us fight the next wave of economic shocks | John Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ministers also need to make sure staff know how to raise the alarm about unsafe workplaces. The HSE should set up one high-profile reporting phoneline and website as a single portal for all enforcement agencies. And the government needs to run a massive public information campaign setting out what employers must do, how employees can get help if they aren\u2019t safe at work, and making clear that every worker has the right to refuse to work in situations that present a serious and imminent danger.</p> <p>Finally, the government will need to make the job retention scheme more flexible to support a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/09/uk-lockdown-could-end-with-sector-by-sector-plan-for-firms\">phased return to work</a>, and to help parents while schools and childcare remain closed or part-closed. And those who cannot work because they are sick, self-isolating, shielding or caring for someone need decent financial support through higher sick pay and an ongoing furlough scheme.</p> <p>Like everyone else, unions want everyone to get back to work and start rebuilding Britain. But workers need to be confident that they won\u2019t put themselves or their families at unnecessary risk.

The undisputed champion of the new normal, in which buildings are blowing up and everyone is rioting, but at least they did it of their own free will. Having begun this finale knocked out on the floor of a hangar, she ends it surveying chaos, but she seems pretty happy about it. \u201cThis is the new world,\u201d she tells Caleb, \u201cand in this world you can be whoever the fuck you want.\u201d</p> <p>She really is one for the swearing, our Maeve, but after all she\u2019s been through, I\u2019ll allow it. After dispatching one Dolores in last week\u2019s battle, she finds herself face to face with another almost immediately. Caleb has used one last control unit to build a new, battle-ready Dolores that is not made from milk and doesn\u2019t have any blood. You may be asking yourself why anyone would bother with that palaver when this new Dolores just pulls on her skin like a glove and is ready to fight, but, viewer, we have no time. Instead we have to cut straight to Maeve coming at Dolores with her katana and, this time, getting her ass kicked.</p> <p>New Dolores is rough, tough and great with a windmill kick. She has Maeve on the floor and could finish her should she choose to, but no \u2013 choice is the whole point. She gets up, leaves Maeve to find her own path \u2013 and is immediately floored by herself.</p> <p>When I say \u201cherself\u201d, I mean Hale, who got sizzled like a sausage in an exploding car the other week, but is back in hologram form. Hale is, of course, Dolores, but also a bit Hale, which is why she is pissed off with Dolores, who kind of left Hale in the lurch when it came to the whole Delos takeover thing. Got it? Good, because the fact that Hale is Hale but also Dolores means she has the power to tighten Dolores\u2019s neck nut remotely, or something, making the Abernathy gal slump to the floor. In a jot, Maeve is over to scoop her up and take her straight to Serac.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16c9246875a714938ef38431e4cdb5d3dedb9b28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16c9246875a714938ef38431e4cdb5d3dedb9b28/0_0_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernard enters the simulation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Where is my mind? Bernard enters the simulation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, Caleb is charging across town trying to get to the Rohohoboam and switch it off with his big dongle of doom (it flashes red). There are pockets of heavy rioting along the route; this looks set to affect journey time. Thankfully, you can always rely on Rent-a-Goon, who spirit up some meat to help Caleb march through the crowds. On the way, he meets Giggles and Ash, who are leading the revolution against Serac (and helping Dolores, even though they don\u2019t know it). Giggles gets shot, although not before he has the chance to do some mini-Beast Mode action on a canister of tear gas and a concrete wall. Eventually, Caleb gets through to a police chopper and, after a wistful glance at his pals, flies off to a rendezvous with fate.</p> <p>The climactic location for this season is a tableaux not unlike a sculpture in a Renaissance chapel \u2013 except with added machine guns. Dolores is laid out prone in the centre, her limbs attached to luminous white tubes. Above, in all his throbbing red glory, looms the Rohohohoboam. Gathered around are a gaggle of goons and their boss, Serac. Soon Maeve enters, too: she has intercepted Caleb and the scene is complete. All are solemnly gathered to watch the uploading of Dolores to the ether and the end of the host rebellion.</p> <p>Except it doesn\u2019t happen that way. Dolores is true to her word. She doesn\u2019t want to eliminate humans or create a homeland for hosts; she just wants everyone to have the freedom to choose. Maeve understands this after teleporting (again, don\u2019t quiz me on the science) to Dolores\u2019s safe space, a prairie of the mind. The pair convene in a wheat field and, just minutes after they were tearing metal chunks out of each other, agree that, really, they are not so different after all. They just want to give the good things a chance and make the bad things to go away (yes, that does appear to be the sum argument of this intellectually portentous sci-fi drama).</p> <p>Who can argue with that? Certainly not Serac, who gets a katana to the gut, his goons too, after Maeve switches sides and makes quick sword-work of her former accomplices. Dolores isn\u2019t able to argue, either, as she has \u201cdied\u201d, having sacrificed her \u201clife\u201d so that others could be free to mess up theirs. In some confusing plot machinations that are once more beyond me, the Rohohoboam has copped it too. Dolores\u2019s last memory was of Caleb receiving instructions from Solomon and once that was uploaded to the omniscient orb, it gave Caleb the power to switch Rohohohoboam off. Which he did.</p> <p>And breathe. That was all the hectic action in a finale that was ridiculous and stupid, but also pacy and thrilling enough to keep me engaged. By far the best scene, however, occurred in the part of the programme that didn\u2019t have to be there.</p> <p>Bernard\u2019s progress throughout this entire series, it turns out, was redundant. His motivation, that he had to stop Dolores, was allowed to wither with one perfunctory line of dialogue: \u201cI misjudged her ... she wasn\u2019t trying to exterminate the human race, she was trying to save it.\u201d</p> <p>But in his encounter with Lauren \u2013 the widow of Arnold, the man on whom the host Bernard was based \u2013 there was some genuinely touching television. Bernard has been plagued by memories of a son he never had \u2013 Arnold\u2019s son Charlie, who died young. In meeting Lauren, Bernard finally gets to talk to someone about it, someone who can understand what he has seen and also felt. Lauren, by now an old woman, has for her part accrued wisdom from passing through the stages of grief. Don\u2019t be haunted by these memories, she tells Bernard. It was only the recollection of her child that had allowed her to keep living. \u201cIf you loved someone\u201d, she says, \u201cwhy would you ever let them go?\u201d</p> <p>Westworld has been recommissioned for a fourth season, but given the current state of the world, goodness only knows when they will film it. So, until then, fellow divergees, take care!<br></p>",
  "<h2>The album to start with</h2> <p><strong>The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society (1968)</strong></p> <p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kinks\">the Kinks</a>\u2019 abominable onstage behaviour caused the American Federation of Musicians to bar the group from ever returning to the US, Ray and Dave Davies had a rethink about where their music stood in relation to British culture. The brothers, born and bred in Muswell Hill, north London, had never hit it off, and touring tended to bring out the worst in them. But their masterwork, The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, testified to their uncanny knack of overriding personal animosity, joining hands around a unity of creative purpose, when in a recording studio.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc7dmu4G8oc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lc7dmu4G8oc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The 1965 American ban was undoubtedly a blow. The Beatles and the Rolling Stones led the so-called British invasion of the US, reaping the considerable financial rewards, and when Village Green Preservation Society was released in 1968, questions were raised about whether the Kinks had become parochial and out of touch. As Jimi Hendrix released Electric Ladyland and the Rolling Stones were moving from the psychedelic Their Satanic Majesties Request to the hard-driving Beggars Banquet, the opening track of the Kinks\u2019 new one was apparently an ode to the England of Enid Blyton or John Betjeman, extolling the delights of strawberry jam, warm real ale, custard pies and Sherlock Holmes mysteries. And also virginity, a paradox given the Kinks\u2019 well-documented sexual adventures; although, as Ray Davies subsequently made clear, this album was all about treasuring and preserving precious things that, once gone, are gone for ever.</p> <p>Witty, surreal and sharply observed, the album evoked the visions of William Blake, Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll \u2013 with perhaps a touch of the Goon Show \u2013 over anything to do with dreary, self-satisfied English nostalgia. The high level of musical invention tells you as much. The from-the-earth-up funk of earlier Kinks hits such as You Really Got Me is jettisoned in favour of music seemingly disembodied from everyday reality, which keeps vanishing down rabbit holes. Memory, myths, timelines smudge. Picture Book sketches a scene of old-age reminiscence over family photographs, while Do You Remember Walter? could equally be Ray, then in his mid-20s, remembering local character Walter \u2013 or projecting himself into old age.</p> <p>Materialising out of the mists like Turner\u2019s painting The Great Western Railway, Last of the Steam-Powered Trains rides over a riff borrowed from Willie Dixon, which bumps into an uplifting, up-the-scale chord sequence that reappears in the much-loved Kinks song, Days. Big Sky \u2013 dramatic, anthemic chords and Ray\u2019s searing narration \u2013 gives a Blakean snapshot of the cosmos, while kittenish, mischievous flutes introduce Phenomenal Cat, a simple and touching reminiscence of a once adored feline. All life is here.</p> <h2>The three to check out next</h2> <p><strong>Something Else By the Kinks (1967)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MqfF0WBsU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N_MqfF0WBsU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The artfully organised Something Else By the Kinks is the obvious pick of the pre-Village Green bunch. Any album that kicks off with David Watts \u2013 inspired by a post-gig party at the home of a local dignitary that ended with everyone getting naked, and Ray offering to trade Dave for the Watts mansion \u2013 and finishes with the eternal London love song Waterloo Sunset, is going to be an instant classic. But also on offer: Dave Davies\u2019 best song, Death of a Clown, the Kurt Weill-like Harry Rag and (on the reissue) the mesmerising Autumn Almanac, for which chord sequences were snipped up and reversed to make the melodic line meet itself coming the other way.</p> <p><strong>Arthur or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire (1969)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wejgyx3e4rY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Wejgyx3e4rY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This project had its roots in a television play that was dropped, but Ray\u2019s music was too good to abandon. Released in album form in the aftermath of Village Green, Arthur shares its ambition and themes of what it meant to be British. The original play told the story of Arthur, a carpet-layer who escaped the postwar gloom by emigrating to Australia. The track, Australia, is as far as the Kinks ever went into freely evolving trippy, ecstatic instrumental improvisation. And Arthur opens with another defining Kinks hit, Victoria.</p> <p><strong>Sleepwalker (1977)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOICxsDv690\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KOICxsDv690?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Fast forward into the 70s, and the Kinks went through a commercial lean patch when Ray\u2019s ostentatious concept albums, Preservation Volumes 1 and 2, Soap Opera and Schoolboys in Disgrace, failed to convince the fans \u2013 or even Dave Davies. Now signed to Clive Davis\u2019s Arista label, the Kinks reverted to being an honest-to-goodness rock\u2019n\u2019roll band, but never lost the essence of their art. Juke Box Music is typically double-edged: a woman spends her days marooned inside the lyrics of her favourite pop songs, a disconcerting scenario transformed into something joyful. Mr Big Man is unapologetically, infectiously funky; Full Moon gets progressively darker as Ray sings about madness and isolation.</p> <h2>One for the heads</h2> <p><strong>To the Bone (1994)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4AGGQDttUA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P4AGGQDttUA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Dropped by major labels and with tensions between the brothers escalating (Ray trampled over Dave\u2019s birthday cake during his 50th-birthday celebrations), the Kinks limped into the mid-90s, eventually crashing and burning in 1996. To the Bone, their exquisite farewell, mixed earlier live material with tracks recorded in front of an invited audience at Konk Studios in Crouch End, London. Lola, Tired of Waiting, Celluloid Heroes, Come Dancing et al were captured in fresh versions, while A Gallon of Gas was a freewheeling blues track, Dave and Ray exploring the roots of popular music as they had done 30 years earlier as teenagers, up the road in Muswell Hill. The Kinks had come full circle.</p> <h2>The primer playlist</h2> <p>For Spotify users, listen below or click <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2CTtU2URIE21OfUCR375ZS?si=NChaoymbRAmRjBTBRQcNbg\">here</a>; for Apple Music users, click <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/gb/playlist/listeners-digest-where-to-start-with-the-kinks/pl.u-GgA55kbhZ1Y9xdW\">here</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2CTtU2URIE21OfUCR375ZS?si=ckR3y8ywSQaIVgBuw7pivQ\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/2CTtU2URIE21OfUCR375ZS\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <h2>Further reading</h2> <p><strong>Kink: An Autobiography, by Dave Davies (1997)<br></strong>Dave Davies lays bare his soul in this autobiography written during the dying days of the Kinks: his troubled relationship with Ray, his struggles with drugs and drink, but also the creative highs, all documented.</p> <p><strong>X-Ray, by Ray Davies (1994)<br></strong>Ray presented his autobiography in the form of a dystopian, semi-fictional novel, as a narrator hired by The Corporation is tasked with finding, then interviewing an aged rock star.</p> <p><strong>God Save the Kinks, by Rob Jovanovic (2013)<br></strong>There are many other books about the Kinks, but Jovanovic\u2019s account is a both a page-turner and expertly researched.</p>",

In Rooney\u2019s book it\u2019s dismissed by one of Connell\u2019s detractors as \u201cArgos chic\u201d, but that\u2019s now seen as the key to its appeal. It\u2019s the only thing he keeps on in the numerous sex scenes in the series and the camera lingers on it lovingly.<br><br><strong>Argos chic seems a bit unkind.</strong> It\u2019s meant to be. Connell\u2019s relationship with Marianne Sheridan (played by Daisy Edgar-Jones) has a crucial class subtext.

  "<p>Hotel Chocolat is to reopen up to five stores next week \u2013 for takeaways only \u2013 after restarting production at its UK factory to help top up dwindling supplies.</p> <p>The specialist retailer and cafe operator said it will reopen first in Borough Market in London, serving hot chocolates, ice-creams and coffees, as it tests out new ways of working while protecting staff and customers from the spread of the coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cIt will help us to learn how to do things and control safe working,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/sep/15/hotel-chocolat-angus-thirlwell-making-chocolate-exciting-again\">Angus Thirlwell</a>, the chief executive and co-founder. Cafes are allowed to open for takeaways under the government\u2019s high street lockdown rules but Thirlwell said the position of the retail areas in its chocolate shops was \u201ca grey area\u201d \u2013 because it is not strictly essential food \u2013 so that part of the business would be kept closed.</p> <p>\u201cWe have decided to err on the side of caution, but it is important to get gradually open and get accessibility to chocolate increased,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He said the company had restarted production at its factory in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, last week. It has brought back from furlough about 80 staff, roughly a third of its factory workforce, to help resupply chocolate for the group as stocks had begun to run low. Thirlwell said the aim was to gradually bring back more staff over time, as long as social distancing measures such as perspex screens to divide staff on production lines and in the canteen continued to work well.</p> <p>Hotel Chocolat closed all its stores and its factory last month, three weeks before Easter \u2013 the second biggest selling period for chocolate.</p> <p>Since then sales have soared online \u2013 with analysts estimating trade has more than trebled. Overall trade is down significantly, however, as home deliveries have not been enough to offset the sales lost due to store closures.</p> <p>Thirlwell said Hotel Chocolat had been able to sell the vast majority of its Easter stock online after a \u201cchocolate version of Dunkirk\u201d in which stock was collected from stores and sent to the warehouse to be sold online. Key workers were also offered a 50% discount on the luxury chocolates, and thousands of eggs were given away to NHS hospital staff, care homes and food banks as the group\u2019s warehouse could not handle the volume.</p> <p>Since shops closed, tens of thousands of new shoppers have signed up to Hotel Chocolat\u2019s online service.</p> <p>Thirlwell said Hotel Chocolat\u2019s 125 stores and cafes remained important and he hoped to agree rent reductions with landlords and reopen them fully when allowed by the government. \u201cWe are talking to landlords to work out a mutually satisfying way of making them sustainable,\u201d he said.</p> <p>While no new stores are expected to open for a year, Thirlwell said: \u201cPeople came back to mingle with each other even after thebubonic plague and we hope people will come back [now]. The purpose of our retail locations is about leisure: hot chocolate or ice-cream or chocolates you weren\u2019t planning to buy. That\u2019s not well replicated online.\u201d</p>",

It would be from the point of view of two bit-players, two idiots who were the last to know what was going on, after waking up hungover on a Sunday morning.</p> <p>A flash point came when I ventured out once to buy milk at five in the morning, after staying up playing Resident Evil. I was taken with how deserted and eerie the streets were. What would a British person do if zombies appeared now? In American zombie movies, everyone had high-powered weapons. What would someone do without all that? This turned into the first scene I filmed, where Shaun walks to the shop completely oblivious to the zombie attack.</p> <p>We wouldn\u2019t have been able to make the film without fans of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/11/the-stars-of-spaced-reunited-21st-anniversary-simon-pegg-jessica-hynes-edgar-wright-nick-frost\">Spaced</a>, the sitcom I\u2019d worked on with Simon.

We choreographed the entire fight to that song, which was a real worry because it hadn\u2019t been cleared for use and could have ended up being way too expensive. So we wrote a begging letter to Queen guitarist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/brian-may\">Brian May</a> and he was lovely about it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24e0b3d6d97958c9aa420e55f39863a505c39c35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24e0b3d6d97958c9aa420e55f39863a505c39c35/0_0_3000_1965/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We spent ages in the pub\u2019 \u2026 Kate Ashfield and Simon Pegg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We spent ages in the pub\u2019 \u2026 Kate Ashfield and Simon Pegg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photos 12/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We spent ages in the pub set. It was a really hot summer and one of the zombies fainted. Fortunately, there was a working tap and the cast would have a much-needed beer after filming. Steve Emerson played John the zombie landlord. He\u2019d been a stuntman on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/07/the-day-i-met-john-wayne-on-an-industrial-estate-in-middlesex\">Brannigan</a>, we discovered, and had been thrown into a jukebox by John Wayne. Despite being well into his 70s, he encouraged us to really<em> </em>hit him during the fight scene. So we did.</p> <p>The reaction to the film was extraordinary. George Romero loved it and I saw a picture of Stephen King wearing a Shaun of the Dead T-shirt. I\u2019d made it on to the chest of a horror master. </p>",
  "<p>Nicola Sturgeon has said people may be asked to self-isolate repeatedly once ministers introduce a new \u201ctest, trace, isolate, support\u201d policy after the coronavirus lockdown eases.</p> \n<p>The Scottish government <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-test-trace-isolate-support/\">has published</a> a policy paper on tackling future Covid-19 infections during later phases of the pandemic.

That led to 26 workers and their immediate families being asked to self-isolate for up to 14 days.</p> \n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t think of it as one day you flick a switch and we go from no TTI [test, trace, isolate] to having full capacity. It will build up over the weeks to come,\u201d she said. This kind of policy would probably have to remain in force until a vaccine became available, she added.</p> \n<p>Some people could have to self-isolate several times in succession, she said.

The NHS would also need to find and train 2,000 additional people to specialise in contact tracing.</p> \n<p>Under Scotland\u2019s emergency coronavirus legislation, Sturgeon must decide on Thursday whether to extend or relax the lockdown for the following three weeks.

  "<p>Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/mar/02/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/apr/27/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\">your comments and photos </a>from the last week.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with the great Barbara Pym. <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/102371558\">MachenBach</a> recommends The Sweet Dove Died:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is a bit of an outlier in Pym\u2019s oeuvre, I think. There are no anthropologists, vicars or church hall bazaars, and it\u2019s considerably less comic than most of her novels. But, despite that (and at the risk of incurring the wrath of her aficionados), I think it may actually be one of her very best.</p> <p>It centres on Leonora Eyre, an attractive, beautifully-dressed single woman in (latish?) middle age, who is also a pretty undilutedly horrible individual: she looks down on almost everyone, is a terrific snob and racist, and incredibly vain \u2026 Leonora is a fantastic portrait of ageing and self-deluding vanity, caught in the position of needing to be wanted, whilst also, impossibly, priding herself on her independence from others. The book\u2019s concern is to bring this slowly, painfully and tragic-comically to her attention and ours. And it does this very well.</p> </blockquote> <p>And Pym\u2019s Excellent Women, says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14992181\">interwar</a>, is \u2013 wait for it \u2013 \u201cexcellent\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Deft sketches of a multitude of characters who may appear only in one scene, or sporadically as minor voices in others \u2013 the outspoken Sister Blatt, the manipulative widow Allegra Gray, the vicar\u2019s na\u00efve sister Winifred, the crazy Mrs Bone \u2013 Pym\u2019s mastery of the defining voice is up there with Dickens \u2013 keep the pace moving and the smiles coming. But there is also something more serious going on in its revelation of what it is to be an intelligent and capable, but also conventional, unmarried woman, with all the fuss of that era about what hat or lipstick to be seen in, and the pressure to be selfless \u2013 as literally as possible \u2013 in an increasingly selfish social environment. Mildred is a superb anthropologist of her own tight little world.</p> </blockquote> <p>HG Wells\u2019 Kipps has helped bring back <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13035061\">BobHammond2</a>\u2019s reading mojo:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Like many, I\u2019ve been struggling to read over the last month. I went from racing through a book a week earlier in the year to taking four weeks to get through Kipps by HG Wells. That\u2019s no reflection on Wells\u2019 rags-to-riches story - when I finally got going with it I found it very enjoyable, packed full of themes such as social class and the desire for self improvement, an engaging central character in Kipps and the underlying twists and turns of his romance with first love Ann. The only thing I found slightly strange was that in my mind the story should have finished about three quarters of the way through - it would have been a tidy conclusion at that stage. But then it throws up another set of challenges for Kipps to overcome, before there\u2019s a final - and very appropriate - ending. A great book, though, and I\u2019m looking forward to checking out some of Wells\u2019 other social novels. Kipps, and The History of Mr Polly (which I also enjoyed), shows there\u2019s more to him than the famous science fiction novels.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13072920\">bindithecat</a> makes Gregg Hurwitz\u2019s Orphan X series sound like the tonic we all need :</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Anyone who enjoys thrillers and is in need of some escapism from the dreaded virus, should try Hurwitz\u2019s Orphan X series of books. I just finished Hellbent and it was a thriller from start to finish. Of course it\u2019s all very high tech weaponry and tracking the bad guys but somehow the good guy comes out on top. Of course it\u2019s a little implausible that one man can do so much damage but that\u2019s the beauty of it. I really recommend them.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jonathan Coe\u2019s What A Carve Up has brought solace to <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16887671\">booklooker</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I suppose my idea of what constitutes a \u201ccomforting reread\u201d might seem a tad strange, but I am off with Jonathan Coe\u2019s <em>What a Carve Up!</em>. I am very happy to be with a nasty cast and surreal events that, to me, no longer hold surprises. Makes quite a change to the news.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI\u2019m reading The Gift Of Rain by Tan Twan Eng,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10095272\">jaya06</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s almost like someone is forcing me to calm down and meditate. I love the Penang setting and the leisurely pace. War is on the horizon and ominousness is in the air, at odds with the self-control Philip Hutton is learning, and the tension is gripping.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Allure Of The Archives by Arlette Farge has fascinated <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/100520245\">AbsoluteBeginner76</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is a beautiful slim work on the art of archival research, translated in a very readable flowing style as she consults records of pre-court hearings in the Arsenal Library, Paris. She laments that these people, whose short criminal interactions have been recorded, remain anonymous at the end of the research.... She describes the act of copying these sources by hand, in long sessions, chilled by the cold air of the archives. Not sure if this is still done but can you imagine, writing by hand, 25 dry pre-court hearing documents, inventory lists etc. Fascinating.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4187061\">FreethoughtRules</a> finished The Age of Innocence by Edith Wharton over the weekend:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I really loved it. I was pleasantly surprised because I\u2019m not a fan of the 1993 film adaptation so it was quite a risk reading it in the first place! It made me laugh a lot but it also made me sad and frustrated at how many of us live a half-life, never really being who we are or doing what we truly want with our lives through fear of social disapproval or rejection. I thought the ending was perfect.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17762458\">SDiviani</a> recommends (almost) the entire oeuvre of the mighty Iris Murdoch:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I wanted to read a writer whose novels create a convincing and habitable world, with a cast of vivid, fascinating characters engaged in compelling goings-on, so that however stressed and down I might be at times I can forget everything and wallow in their lives. Hello Iris Murdoch. Her novels satisfy all of the above and the big plus is that she wrote 25 of them.</p> </blockquote> <p>That is most certainly a big plus.</p> <h2><strong>Interesting links about books and reading</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIbEHNqbPs&amp;feature=youtu.be\">This is the rap version of Fox In Sox by Dr Seuss</a>.

  "<p>M<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michelleobama\">ichelle Obama</a> is a class act \u2013 one of the classiest \u2013 and her intelligence and poise now look like something from a lost golden age. The publication of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/14/michelle-obama-becoming-review-undoubtedly-political-book\">her globally bestselling memoir Becoming</a> in 2018 brought her dazzlingly into the public sphere on her own terms. It gave her an international A-list status to rival her husband\u2019s and provided Democrats and non-Trumpians around the world with a manifesto of decency and dignity to cling on to.</p> <p>Now we have this watchable, but carefully authorised, behind-the-scenes documentary for Netflix (from the Obamas\u2019 company, Higher Ground Productions) about Obama\u2019s American book tour (with a stopover at London\u2019s O2 Arena). It shows her getting in and out of armoured sports utility vehicles, chatting easily and good-naturedly with her security detail, with colleagues and family members backstage, with beaming celebrity moderators onstage (starting with Oprah Winfrey) and with people getting their copies signed in bookstores who often dissolve in floods of tears just in coming face to face with her. (I was sorry, however, that we didn\u2019t get to see again <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jTs121jq0Y\">her amusing cameo in the TV comedy Parks and Recreation</a>, which showed Amy Poehler\u2019s earnest public official Leslie Knope reduced to a gibbering fangirl in her presence.)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqVUafhQ4xc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zqVUafhQ4xc?start=10&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=10\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Obama goes back to the family home in Chicago and talks about her background, and particularly about her late father (who died of MS), about meeting and marrying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\">Barack</a>, about raising children in the White House and about the terrible blow of leaving for the last time: she says she sobbed on the official plane for 30 minutes, partly out of sheer relief that her official duties were over. And this is interspersed with her meetings with girls and women of colour, talking about how her experiences can help them. Malia Obama has a cameo, speaking in a cool, smart vocal-fry.</p> <p>This is Obama\u2019s own film, so we can\u2019t expect any tough scrutiny. The nearest we get to her losing her cool comes when her elder brother, Craig, starts mocking her outfit, with what looks a high belt \u2013 and she doesn\u2019t like it one bit. I also wondered exactly how delighted she was when Barack made what appeared to be a genuine surprise onstage appearance during one of her events, which he cheerfully compared to Jay-Z coming on during a Beyonc\u00e9 concert.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6c1567f215632c291f6b9f77b2c123ab8509db3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6c1567f215632c291f6b9f77b2c123ab8509db3/567_666_4421_2655/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michelle Obama in Becoming.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michelle Obama in Becoming.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She is still upset with her high-school teacher who told her she wasn\u2019t smart enough to go to Princeton (but she did) and she is still mad at the press and media, who before the 2008 presidential election tried to paint her as a shrewish extremist. We see the notorious cartoon magazine cover, depicting Michelle and Barack as jihadis exchanging a fist bump. The magazine intended all sorts of essentially supportive ironies, which were not appreciated.</p> <p>Inevitably, it\u2019s the things that don\u2019t get asked that stick out. Nobody ever asks Obama why she took her husband\u2019s surname, or if she had any qualms about that. Could it be that from the very first, she knew that Barack might have political ambitions and she wanted to tailor her own personality to that? The film doesn\u2019t raise the question of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a>\u2019s tilt at the White House and Michelle\u2019s own speech supporting her at the Democratic National Convention. And she doesn\u2019t go low enough to talk (much) about Voldemort himself, other than to speak to Native American people about how embattled they feel during his grisly reign.</p> <p>She continues to go high, though: an altitude of which so few politicians are capable.</p> <p>\u2022 Becoming is available on Netflix on 6 May.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Coronavirus has hit Spain hard and its residents have endured the strictest lockdown of any country in Europe. Outside activity was banned, unless it was for going to work or visiting the local supermarket for essentials (only one member of the household at a time). The Guardia Civil<em> </em>rigorously enforced the law: roadblocks stopped cars, IDs, till receipts and distances travelled all checked. Illicit visitors to my local beach were reprimanded and heavily fined. Along the promenade in the village of San Luis de Sabinillas, on the Costa del Sol, the outdoor gyms, <em>petanca</em> courts and children\u2019s playgrounds have lain empty, cordoned off by police tape.</p> <p>Throughout the winter, I cooled my menopausal flushes in the Mediterranean. Recently I\u2019ve dreamed of clandestine nocturnal dips, but the threat of a \u20ac500 fine has chilled my ardour. I made do with workout videos and online <em>parch\u00eds</em> (Spanish ludo) with my mum.</p> <p>Spain is all about socialising, sitting outside till late, having fun, making noise. Children are to be seen <em>and</em> heard. For the first six weeks of the lockdown, the only human life I observed on the streets was from scurrying, paranoid, masked adults. On 26 April, Spanish children were freed from captivity, bringing optimism, energy and joyful noise. Last weekend was the turn of the adults. I planned yoga on the beach, then a socially distanced swim. As with many others, I\u2019d been counting the days. At sunrise on Saturday morning, runners, walkers and cyclists began to arrive at the beach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da27305535f2b662fd8016a205684a85fb5143ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da27305535f2b662fd8016a205684a85fb5143ec/0_191_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lizzie Evangelista: \u2018Being allowed to run means being able to breathe again\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lizzie Evangelista: \u2018Being allowed to run means being able to breathe again\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Weller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cRunning is my means of self-care,\u201d said Lizzie Evangelista, a lecturer and psychotherapist. \u201cI\u2019m an ultra-distance runner: 190km, or longer, through jungles and deserts.

She explained that, as the owner of an ironmongers\u2019 shop, she has been badly hit economically, but she has enjoyed being at home and spending time with her daughter. \u201cI\u2019ve really missed the social aspect of swimming \u2013 I love being part of a group; the fun and laughter, the friendship. I felt a little nervous swimming on my own today and being in a wetsuit was tiring for the first five minutes, but I soon got into the rhythm. I feel great now that I\u2019ve been back in the sea.\u201d</p> <p>Marisa was more conflicted: \u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to swimming, but feeling a bit unsure about coming out and facing the world with the virus still around.

  "<p>Hong Kong is living through two traumas at once: after nine months of civil unrest \u2013 sparked by a now-aborted extradition law \u2013 that saw increasing violence from protesters and the police force, the former British colony was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/may/04/markets-us-china-tensions-covid-19-trade-war-manufacturing-hong-kong-business-live\">hit by the Covid-19 pandemic</a>.</p> <p>The territory has been faring relatively well so far (with <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/china-hong-kong-sar/\">1,041 confirmed cases and four deaths</a> at the time of writing), in large part thanks to the scarring experience of Sars in 2003. This meant that as soon as news of a novel strain of coronavirus in mainland China started to spread, most people decided not to wait for official guidelines and began wearing masks, minimising social outings, and washing hands and homes with increased frequency and thoroughness.</p> <p>The government, on the other hand, prevaricated for reasons that were hardly connected to public health. Back in October 2019, citing colonial-era emergency laws, the authorities <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49931598\">banned</a> wearing a mask in public to prevent protesters hiding their identity as they took part in unauthorised marches (or authorised marched that got banned halfway through). But the administration wasn\u2019t willing to budge. It took a few contradictory press briefings before Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, accepted that surgical masks for preventing the spread of the coronavirus would be allowed \u2013 while maintaining that they would remain forbidden at protests.</p> <p>To some extent, the pandemic could have given the Hong Kong government the opportunity to reset the clock, concentrate on protecting public health, and move towards social reconciliation. This is not what\u2019s happened.</p> <p>Even as Hong Kong was recording growing numbers of new infections and life was being upended by the pandemic, the police kept making arrests and the courts kept putting activists on trial. Fifteen high-profile activists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/police-in-hong-kong-arrest-14-activists-amid-autonomy-warnings\">were arrested</a> in April for illegal assembly in a march that took place last August that saw more than a million people take to the streets. Among them were pro-democracy veterans such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/fresh-hong-kong-crackdown-will-result-in-deaths-says-democracy-leader-martin-lee\">Martin Lee</a>, 81, a senior barrister who co-drafted the Basic Law, Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution, and who served as an elected legislator and as one of the founders of the Democratic party; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-arrested-on-charges-of-illegal-assembly\">Jimmy Lai, the founder and publisher of pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily</a>; and <a href=\"https://hongkongfp.com/2019/08/20/staff-member-uks-consulate-hong-kong-missing-10-days-mainland-china-business-trip/48582133841_9ed1aa2540_k/\">Figo Chan</a>, co-convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front, the group that had been leading authorised mass protests throughout 2019.</p> <p>In the same hours, the Liaison Office, Beijing\u2019s highest representative in Hong Kong, decided to make its position in the territory even more openly that of a de facto supervisor of the local administration by announcing that it was not bound by <a href=\"https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1521237-20200417.htm?archive_date=2020-04-17\">Article 22</a> of the Basic Law. Article 22 states that no department under the Chinese central and local government may interfere in Hong Kong\u2019s internal affairs. The announcement seemingly undermined some of the main principles under which Hong Kong exists \u2013 such as the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d concept and the promise of a high degree of autonomy \u2013 but it didn\u2019t provoke street protests: the fear of a spread of coronavirus cases, and the impossibility of organising rallies or meetings, has meant that discontent has migrated online, mostly on social media. Since the end of March, social distancing has been enforced with a provision that forbids groups of more than four people gathering, making demonstrations almost impossible.</p> <p>But as the crackdown continues, an angry emoji can only go so far. Law Man-chung, an anti-government protester, saw his sentence of 200 hours of community service changed to <a href=\"https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1522526-20200424.htm\">20 days in prison</a> after the government appealed the original sentence for being \u201ctoo lenient\u201d.

In the same week, a judge <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-52426377\">expressed sympathy</a> with a man who stabbed two young protesters and a reporter with a meat cleaver. And while the person who carried out the assault received a sentence of less than four years, Edward Leung, 28, a proponent of Hong Kong\u2019s independence, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/10/hong-kong-protests-edward-leung/601015/\">lost his appeal</a> against a six-year jail sentence for throwing bricks at police during a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/09/hong-kong-police-fire-live-rounds-into-the-air-during-clashes-over-plan-to-close-street-markets\">2016 clash</a> at which police used live rounds.</p> <p>The new round of legal repression comes in between two crucial elections. Last November both the local and central authorities were taken by surprise when the district council elections \u2013 normally a minor political event, as district councillors are tasked with taking care of local issues \u2013 resulted in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/24/hong-kong-residents-turn-up-for-local-elections-in-record-numbers\">17 out of 18</a> local councils going to the pro-democracy camp. This watershed moment clearly hasn\u2019t brought about a more open-minded approach towards Hong Kong\u2019s demands: the authorities want to prevent a similar result in this September\u2019s legislative council elections (which are half-returned by universal suffrage).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/hong-kong-arrests-and-taiwan-flybys-chinas-advances-its-interests-during-covid-19-crisis\">Hong Kong arrests and Taiwan flybys: China advances its interests during Covid-19 crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is speculation that the authorities will disqualify candidates (as has happened before), which wasn\u2019t helped by an official <a href=\"https://hongkongfp.com/2020/04/24/sooner-or-later-new-hong-kong-mainland-affairs-minister-backs-national-security-and-national-anthem-law/\">stating</a> this wouldn\u2019t happen, provided candidates \u201csupport the [Hong Kong] government\u201d.

Candidates are now expected to show an ever-growing level of loyalty to the symbols of the state and adhere to a vaguely defined sense of patriotism.</p> <p>In the past week, though, protests have returned: they have mostly been taking place in shopping malls, where people can gather less visibly and then start chanting slogans while maintaining the decreed social distancing rules. On 1 May, Labour Day, after the police refused to authorise a traditional rally, a protest inside a mall ended in arrests and the use of pepper spray. The government has shown that it is not interested in reconciliation and even through a pandemic has stuck to its guns, continuing to refer to protesters as \u201crioters\u201d, no matter what they do.

This weekend, a new statistic emerged to reinforce a now familiar theme: we learned that Covid-19 is <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/coronavirus-updates/2020/04/la-times-new-data-reveals-covid-19-is-killing-younger-black-and-latino-californians-at-higher-rates/\">killing younger </a><a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/coronavirus-updates/2020/04/la-times-new-data-reveals-covid-19-is-killing-younger-black-and-latino-californians-at-higher-rates/\">black and Latino people</a> at higher rates than younger people of other races in California. But what and who is really responsible for their deaths? Most of the news reporting and political punditry focused on blaming black people for their choices, whether <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/4/8/21213383/coronavirus-black-americans-trump-administration-high-covid-19-death-rate\">explicitly</a> or implicitly, rather than blaming the systems that have taken any real choices away from us.</p> <p>Refreshingly, we are starting to see both everyday people and some media outlets <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/race-and-blame/609946/\">reject and redirect</a> the kneejerk narrative of blaming black people for everything that goes wrong in this country, especially their own problems. That\u2019s because we have made measurable progress in reshaping the way so many people think about race. Thanks to the last decade of organizing and advocacy for racial justice, more people (<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18259865/great-awokening-white-liberals-race-polling-trump-2020\">including white people</a>) are sensitive to racial disparities and embrace the idea that those disparities are the result of structural racism, not some \u201cinherent\u201d problem with black people themselves.</p> <p>It is that same movement for racial justice that made the pre-existing condition of racism in America a concerted focus for political leaders, too. Anticipating the obvious, the representative Ayanna Pressley, Senator Elizabeth Warren and others <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/02/data-race-coronavirus-victims-is-inconsistent-rep-ayanna-pressley-wants-change-that/\">demanded that the government track and release Covid-19 data on race</a>, which has prompted the news media to take racial disparities seriously.

Because, in the typical catch-22 of racism in the criminal justice system, black people are being profiled and harassed by police for wearing masks (even though governors have told them to) but also for not wearing masks (even though white people still do so freely).

  "<p>Michael Jordan has discussed the quote that has come to define what many see as his willingness to put profit over principles.</p> <p>During a 1990 Senate race in his home state of North Carolina, Jordan refused to endorse Democrat Harvey Gantt, an African American who was running against the incumbent Republican Jesse Helms, a notorious racist.

  "<p>An intensive care doctor reflects on a week on the Covid-19 frontline, a lonely woman wonders when she will next eat a meal with company and all Anya wants is some space for herself in the bedroom-turned-office she shares with her boyfriend. These are some of the scenarios \u2013 familiar from the news or from our daily experience \u2013 in a set of new lockdown dramas released online on Monday.</p> <p>Actor and writer Danusia Samal launched her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/apr/27/it-felt-like-shutdown-took-my-future-50-creatives-launch-online-dramas\">Virtual Collaborators series</a> last month with nine short films, written and directed during the lockdown by creatives who have found their other projects put on hold by theatre\u2019s shutdown.

Ryan Craig\u2019s monologue Proof of Life is directed by Harry Tennison and stars Zoe Zak as an intensive care doctor who is recording a message for a judgmental family member with whom she has an acrimonious relationship.

  "<p>Jennie Formby, the Labour general secretary who was a close ally of the former leader Jeremy Corbyn, has resigned from the post, the party has announced.</p> <p>The move gives the party leader, Sir Keir Starmer, an opportunity to anoint a new candidate to control the party machine, and is further illustration of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/01/labour-keir-starmer-coronavirus-covid-19-new-era\">major political shift</a> since December\u2019s general election. </p> <p>A statement released on behalf of Formby on Monday said: \u201cWhen I applied for the role of general secretary in 2018 it was because I wanted to support Jeremy Corbyn, who inspired so many people to get involved in politics with his message of hope, equality and peace.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been a huge privilege to be general secretary of the largest political party in Europe for the last two years, but now we have a new leadership team it is the right time to step down.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to thank Jeremy, our members and my staff colleagues who have given me so much support during what has been a very challenging period, in particular when I was suffering from ill-health.</p> <p>\u201cI wish Keir and Angela the very best of luck in taking the party forward and leading Labour to victory at the next general election.\u201d</p> <p>Formby, a former Unite official and close associate of Len McCluskey, took over as general secretary, the party\u2019s most senior employee, in March 2018. She received treatment for breast cancer last year.</p> <p>Allies of Starmer had said privately her resignation would be key to allowing the new leader to control the direction of the party.</p> <p>A meeting of the national executive committee will be expected to set a timetable to elect a new general secretary.</p> <p>Potential candidates to succeed Formby are thought to include the Unite political director, Anneliese Midgley, the Unison official Emilie Oldknow and GMB\u2019s director of external relations, Lisa Johnson.</p> <p>Allies of Oldknow and Johnson say it is no coincidence that they have been linked to recent controversies after they were flagged as potential successors to Formby.</p> <p>Oldknow has been accused making inappropriate comments about colleagues in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/01/labour-appoints-panel-to-investigate-leaked-report-on-staff\">controversial antisemitism report</a> being investigated by the NEC.</p> <p>Johnson has been closely connected to Tim Roache, the recently resigned GMB general secretary who is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/01/gmb-vows-to-protect-its-staff-after-launch-of-tim-roache-inquiry\">under investigation</a> for inappropriate conduct. Her supporters insist she was among the senior figures pushing for his resignation in recent days.</p> <p>Formby\u2019s resignation means that most of left of the party, which until December\u2019s general election controlled all key positions, have been removed.</p> <p>Focus will now fall on whether Karie Murphy, another key Corbyn ally, will remain as a senior member of the party\u2019s leadership.</p> <p>Responding to the decision, Starmer said: \u201cI would like to thank Jennie for her service, and for the personal and professional efforts she has made in advancing the cause she has fought all her life for.</p> <p>\u201cJennie has led our party\u2019s organisation with commitment and energy through a period of political upheaval, including a snap general election last year. I wish her the very best for the future.\u201d</p> <p>Angela Rayner, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, said: \u201cAs a trade unionist and party activist as well as general secretary, Jennie has been a great servant of our movement for many years and blazed a trail as one of our highest achieving women.</p> <p>\u201cShe goes with our thanks and gratitude, and I\u2019ve no doubt she will stand squarely behind us as we continue to fight for social justice and the Labour government our country so desperately needs.\u201d</p>",

(These would no doubt challenge many trained adult journalists!).</p> <p>However, we know that children are regularly exposed to real news, <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/research-and-data/media-literacy-research/childrens/children-and-parents-media-use-and-attitudes-report-2019\">particularly online</a>. This news can feel exciting, worrying, sad, or heartwarming, but it never feels like a fairytale. Asking children to write \u2018fake news reports\u2019 can also be confusing when trying to teach them to be wary of \u2018fake news\u2019.</p> <p>At NewsWise we\u2019ve seen that when children are asked to write about real news events, they produce better writing. They are also much more motivated! Here are six top tips for turning your reluctant writers into news enthusiasts.</p> <h4><strong>1) Keep it real</strong></h4> <p>Get your students to write about real events in their school or local area, or encourage them to engage with global news.</p> <ul> <li><p>Ask children to report on something happening at school (a guest visitor, a new \u2018vegan lunch day\u2019 in the canteen), or a local issue (shops closing in the high street, a new park).</p></li> <li><p>Ask children to write about a local perspective on a national or international issue (coronavirus, climate change, Brexit).</p></li> <li><p>Plan opportunities for your students to conduct real interviews \u2013 they could talk to anyone from the head teacher to a local MP!</p></li> </ul> <p>This is also a great opportunity to teach children about the importance of considering both sides of a story, and understanding the difference between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newswise/2019/oct/07/lesson-7-identifying-the-difference-between-fact-and-opinion\">fact and opinion</a>. We\u2019ve even heard of our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newswise/2019/oct/07/lesson-8-producing-balanced-news-reports\">lesson on different viewpoints</a> being used to resolve playground football disputes!</p> <h4><strong>2) Keep it positive</strong></h4> <p>We are all exposed to a lot of negative news, particularly during the coronavirus crisis. Producing upbeat news reports can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newswise/2020/mar/21/wellbeing-and-the-news\">help children rebalance their world view</a> by becoming more aware of positive events. Our <a href=\"https://bit.ly/Happy_News_Challenge\">Happy News activity</a> encourages children to script, report, and share their positive news.</p> <h4><strong>3) Create an authentic experience</strong></h4> <p>Why not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newswise/2018/sep/17/creating-a-newsroom-in-your-classroom\">transform your classroom into a newsroom</a>? Your students will gain team work, time-management, and critical thinking skills.</p> <p>There are plenty of free and easy ways to get that newsroom feel. Try getting your students to make their own press passes and a sign for the classroom door. Could you borrow some clocks and set them to different timezones? Make sure you assign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newswise/series/roles-in-a-newsroom\">roles</a>. Who will subedit the reports? Who is in charge of design? Of course, you can act as chief editor!</p> <p>Set students short tasks with tight deadlines for an authentic newsroom experience. Teachers are often amazed that NewsWise students are able to critically assess reports, research and script a balanced news story from scratch and rehearse and perform a news bulletin, all within a couple of hours.</p> <h4><strong>4) Immerse students in news</strong></h4> <p>Many children cannot access news at home, <a href=\"https://literacytrust.org.uk/research-services/research-reports/family-news-literacy-report/\">particularly those in disadvantaged areas</a>. How can we expect children to write in the style of news reports without exposure to news media? Remember that your classroom might be the only source of news for your students. Make time for them to watch, listen to, or read the news.</p> <p>Check out our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newswise/2019/jan/18/child-friendly-news\">child-friendly news</a> page here for more ideas on bringing real, age-appropriate news into the classroom.</p> <h4><strong>5) Give pupils agency</strong></h4> <p>Children are more motivated to write if the topic interests them. NewsWise teachers who let children choose their own writing topics even reported children asking to continue working over lunchtime!</p> <p>Of course, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newswise/video/2018/nov/28/changing-the-world-for-the-better-katharine-viner-tells-us-about-her-role-video\">chief editor</a> of your newsroom, you can veto any topic you consider too risky. Every newsroom has an editorial meeting where story ideas are discussed and the best ideas are taken forward. Could you do the same?</p> <p>Empowering your pupils to report on real issues that matter to them will give them a unique voice in their school and community. As Roz, a teacher in London, told us:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was watching them link what they were doing in class to wider issues outside our school community which I found the most gratifying. For me, so much of what NewsWise brings up in its delivery is to do with exploring what sort of person you want these children to become: compassionate, interested, resilient, critical, brave, truthful.</p> </blockquote> <h4><strong>6) Create a purpose</strong></h4> <p>Real news deserves a real audience. Get your students to create a school newspaper, take over the school newsletter for a week, or organise a presentation event for their families. You can even send your students\u2019 writing to NewsWise to feature on our website!</p> <p>We hope these tips inspire you to change the way you teach news writing at primary level. As Jess, a teacher in Slough, told us:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[NewsWise] was transformative in the way that we talk about and teach the news at Claycots; we now aim to ensure that children are learning about the purpose of news as well as being able to produce news stories that are real and trustworthy.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p>Angie Pitt is Director of NewsWise, Victoria Baker is Critical literacy programme manager for NewsWise.

  "<p>In the course of a two-and-a-half-hour press briefing, the president claimed the country had \u201cflattened\u201d its coronavirus curve (despite official figures showing a relentless rise in cases), he spent several minutes assailing a national newspaper for what he said was unfair coverage, and he defended his attempt to seize control of the budget.</p> <p>But the leader extemporizing in front of the cameras was not Donald Trump. It was Mexico\u2019s president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/andres-manuel-lopez-obrador\">Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador</a>, whose relish for encounters with the press rivals that of his US counterpart.</p> <p>Amlo, as the Mexican leader is known, inaugurated a daily press 7am conference soon after taking power in 2018. It was a revolutionary move in a country where presidents have rarely faced close questioning.</p> <p>It also allowed Amlo to set the day\u2019s agenda, much as Trump has often dominated news cycles with his tweetstorms.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/mexico-health-workers-attacked-covid-19-fears\">'What's wrong with you Mexico?' Health workers attacked amid Covid-19 fears</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Covid-19 cases mount in Mexico, the sessions have drawn frequent comparisons to Trump\u2019s aborted coronavirus briefings, which similarly focused as much on personal promotion and attacks on enemies as on offering accurate information.</p> <p>But while Trump has now apparently cooled on daily appearances, Amlo has doubled down.</p> <p>The president announced plans for an additional session every evening in which he or his secretaries will speak for two hours after the existing briefing by the country\u2019s coronavirus czar Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell.</p> <p>The announcement prompted grumbling from members of the press corps, but it continues Amlo\u2019s long-established habit of at least offering the appearance of open government.</p> <p>\u201cIt works just like it works for Trump,\u201d said Federico Est\u00e9vez, political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what the quality of the communication is, it dominates the [news] cycle. That\u2019s all it\u2019s about. That\u2019s all it\u2019s supposed to be about.\u201d</p> <p>Just as Trump frequently picks sympathetic reporters from fringe media outlets, Amlo often courts supportive questions from figures such as Carlos Pozos, a mustachioed and bowtie-wearing YouTuber popularly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0WxwnD6D67eYwmmRWQnOEg\">known as</a> Lord Molecule.</p> <p>He also takes more aggressive questions from mainstream reporters, although his verbose responses often evade an actual answer.</p> <p>Mostly, though, Amlo pontificates: part president, part partisan hack, part preacher.</p> <p>He addresses the pressing matters in Mexico\u2019s public, but not without trolling his opponents or detouring into diatribes on the supposed shortcomings of previous governments.</p> <p>He regularly invokes moral values and cites biblical scripture. He even pulled a pair of prayer cards out of his wallet, <a href=\"https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/politica/AMLO-y-sus-polemicas-declaraciones-sobre-el-coronavirus-20200321-0001.html\">saying the images</a> (and personal honesty) helped protect him against coronavirus.</p> <p>Amlo supporters delight in the president\u2019s tendency to pick fights with the press and excoriate enemies. \u201cThis is the charm for his followers,\u201d said Il\u00e1n Semo, historian at the Iberoamerican University. \u201cThey believe in him like they would a preacher.\u201d</p> <p>Just like their US counterparts, many Mexican journalists express mixed feelings over the presidential briefings.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a useful and novel method of presidential communication,\u201d Javier Garza, a journalist in the northern city of Torre\u00f3n, said of Amlo\u2019s morning press conferences. \u201cBut it\u2019s turned into a predictable spectacle without any value.\u201d</p> <p>Even if the briefings occasionally feel more like campaign events, \u201cthey\u2019re still a place to pose questions to the president,\u201d Garza said \u201cand the president has not tried to flee\u201d.</p>",

At the same time, the poem may illuminate, and be illuminated by, current events. It also tunes in to an ancient and universal human experience: the daily fading of light into dusk, when the mood may slip into melancholy and uncertainty. The hushed emptiness that descends on the park in the poem is almost naturalistic at first, but the widespread movement of desertion soon gathers foreboding through repetition. It\u2019s as if all ages and all species had silently agreed to emigrate.</p> <p>The Chess Players was a film written and directed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyajit_Ray\" title=\"Satyajit Ray\">Satyajit Ray</a> in 1977, based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munshi_Premchand\" title=\"Munshi Premchand\">Munshi Premchand</a>\u2019s short story of the same name. Two chess-mad noblemen, Mir and Mirza, are so obsessed with their game that they refuse to notice the turmoil of the British incursions seething around them, not to mention the disintegration of their marriages. Despite these catastrophes, Ray\u2019s touch in the film is light, as is Altmann\u2019s in the poem. The images his statements evoke are sometimes surreal, and sometimes presented in a whimsical manner. They may be backlit by a pun (\u201cThe lovers who thought about coming have left\u201d) or trip us on a gently comic letdown (\u201cThe man in the three-piece suit has left. / The man who was a three-piece band has left.\u201d) The line, \u201cThe sky is reaching for its hands\u201d, is particularly effective. Perhaps \u201chands\u201d suggests a clock, and the desire of the sky to seize hold of time and make it move faster. Or the hands may be potentially the monstrous hands of a killer. Nothing terrible actually happens in the poem\u2019s foreground, but the threat level rises as the moon becomes unusually sharp-eyed, the stars unusually ignorant and dim.</p> <p>The rhythm slows right down at the end of the poem, with full stops insisting on a painfully weighty pause for thought at the ends of lines: \u201cBut the stars remain in the dark. / As does the chess-player. / Who sits with all his pieces / In position.\u201d</p> <p>Only now do we learn that no game is in progress: in fact, the player has no visible opponent. The solitary figure sits at the untouched board in the dark. It raises the question as to whether the poem\u2019s hidden subject is war. From a war gamers\u2019 site, I learned that \u201cthe name \u2018chess\u2019 is derived from the Sanskrit <em>chaturanga</em> which can be translated as \u201cfour arms\u201d, referring to the four divisions of the Indian army \u2013 elephants, cavalry, chariots and infantry. In this regard, chess is very much a war game that simulates what we would now call the combined arms operations of the ancient world.</p> <p>Perhaps we should abandon the image of an al-fresco chessboard altogether? The single \u201cplayer\u201d may be planning moves of a more desperate kind, moves that might include the assassination of some leader, or the pushing of the \u201cnuclear button\u201d. He may have gone crazy and got trapped in a ferment of fantastic plans too complex and entangled ever to be accomplished. The pieces, whatever they represent, are \u201cin position\u201d but, perhaps fortunately, will never move forward.</p> <p>So reading the poem now, we might also be reminded of a stalemate of statistics, strategies and models. Earlier on, we\u2019ve been cheerfully told, \u201cOf course the buses no longer pass. / And the children no longer ask.\u201d The lightness of tone and rhetorical patterning, and the faint stumble in the end-rhyme (\u201cpass\u201d and \u201cask\u201d), seem to show the effects of an effortless severance of intellectual curiosity and lively physical action. Perhaps all the \u201cplayers\u201d in the park are obedient pieces being moved around a board or taken and scattered in some master game? Perhaps even the chess player is a pawn.</p>",
  "<p>Narendra Modi\u2019s request was simple: to help combat the spread of coronavirus, people should download an Indian government-built smartphone app that helps identify their risk of catching and spreading the virus.</p> <p>\u201cAs more and more people use it, its effectiveness will increase,\u201d the prime minister said in a televised address last month.</p> <p>Within hours, the Aarogya Setu app became the fastest downloaded app on record, with 83 million users and counting.</p> <p>India was not the first country to deploy technology for coronavirus contact tracing \u2013 China, the US, Singapore, Hong Kong and multiple European countries have developed apps. But in a country with no meaningful anti-surveillance, privacy or data protection laws (the 1885 Telegraph Act is still in use) and a nationalist government with unprecedented snooping powers, many fear it has sinister implications.</p> <p>\u201cThe coronavirus is a gift to authoritarian states including India,\u201d said the Indian author Arundhati Roy. \u201cPre-corona, if we were sleepwalking into the surveillance state, now we are panic-running into a super-surveillance state.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a4e6d7db7f22631690a5ef101b4f0825a34b354d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4e6d7db7f22631690a5ef101b4f0825a34b354d/2180_124_2356_2945/800.jpg\" alt=\"Arundhati Roy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arundhati Roy: \u2018We are panic-running into a super-surveillance state.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samir Jana/Hindustan Times/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since coronavirus took hold in early March, it has been met with mounting authoritarian measures by Modi\u2019s government. Journalists critical of the government have been hit with police charges while students who held anti-government protests last year are suddenly being rounded up under draconian terrorism laws. Meanwhile, with the entire country placed under a strict lockdown, the normal mechanisms of justice, accountability and democracy have been heavily eroded, with gatherings \u2013 and therefore protests \u2013 banned and the courts all but suspended, ensuring lawyers have been unable to file bail applications.</p> <p>Throughout April, Delhi police rounded up and detained student activists who helped organise massive protests against a citizenship law last year. Several of the female activists, one of whom is pregnant, have been accused of a \u201cconspiracy\u201d to instigate deadly religious riots in Delhi in February, and were arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), which is normally used in the context of terrorism. It means they can be held for six months with no charges and no bail.</p> <p>Authoritarian measures have also been increasing in the volatile region of Kashmir. In a single week, the police used the same terrorism law to arrest a number of journalists in cases collectively described by the Editors Guild of India as a \u201cgross misuse of power\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe excuse of the pandemic has meant the threshold for justifying arrests under terrorism laws, such as UAPA, has dropped further,\u201d said Karuna Nundy, a supreme court lawyer. \u201cBut it has also become almost impossible to get a court hearing to determine whether an action is illegal or unconstitutional. So access to justice is now extremely limited.\u201d</p> <p>The app has fuelled concern that the pandemic is being used as a pretext to erode privacy and freedom of speech in the name of \u201cwinning the war\u201d against coronavirus. \u201cIn this context, the justification for restrictions on civil liberties is a lot more palatable to the public and it is less closely scrutinised,\u201d said Sidharth Deb, counsel at the Internet Freedom Foundation, who wrote a paper on the app.</p> <p>Privacy violations and unprecedented surveillance have already been rife at the state level, from the personal details of everyone on quarantine lists in the state of Karnataka being published in the public domain to police tracking people in quarantine through GPS, drones and even geotagged selfies.</p> <p>The app presents similar issues, but on a scale that could affect hundreds of millions of people. All data used to calculate risk of infection, from age and address to travel history and \u2013 through the use of GPS and bluetooth \u2013 people that users have come into close contact with over the past 14 days, is sent to an external server under the control of the federal government. According to the terms of use, users are not allowed to give their phones to others.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=India\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=India\">Graphic</a> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The use of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/nhs-coronavirus-app-memo-discussed-giving-ministers-power-to-de-anonymise-users\">both</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/nhs-coronavirus-app-memo-discussed-giving-ministers-power-to-de-anonymise-users\"> Bluetooth</a> and GPS makes the app far more invasive than its counterpart in Singapore. And when it comes to transparency around how the data will be handled and used, the Indian government has been far more opaque. Unlike in most other countries, there is no transparency on the limitations on the lifespan of database and no binding policy that it will not be repurposed after the pandemic. The app is equally vague about which government departments will have access to the Aarogya Setu database.</p> <p>Abhishek Singh, the chief executive of MyGovIndia, which developed Aarogya Setu, said the app had been built \u201cwith privacy as the core principle\u201d, with location data kept anonymised, all data of non-risk users deleted after 45 days, and high-risk users after 60 days.</p> <p>\u201cThe government of India will use information only for administering necessary medical interventions,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cData is not going to be used for any other purpose. No third party has access to data.\u201d</p> <p>But Deb said the app \u201cpresents a sweep of privacy related risks. This has the potential to be a permanent tool of surveillance and on top of it all, we don\u2019t have legislation or a law or even an oversight mechanism to hold the government accountable and preserve our right to privacy.\u201d</p> <p>Some see it as evidence of India looking to China\u2019s playbook, where technology was heavily deployed to monitor citizens under the guise of contact tracing. Indeed, downloading it could soon be the only way for people in India to freely leave the house, giving the government an unprecedented watch over its citizens.

After the government imposed a nationwide lockdown on 24 March with just four hours notice, prompting negative media coverage, the supreme court issued a ruling that the media only publish the \u201cofficial version\u201d of events as put out in government bulletins.</p> <p>Then, on 1 April, the police filed a report against Siddharth Varadarajan, the editor of independent news outlet the Wire, for an article detailing allegations that the chief minister of the state of Uttar Pradesh had violated physical distancing rules at a religious gathering. The charges against Varadarajan include the transmission of obscene material.</p> <p>Varadarajan said it was \u201cundoubtedly\u201d part of an anti-democratic shift. \u201cAll the authoritarian impulses evident before are more pronounced today \u2013 intolerance of the media and free speech, tolerance of hate speech and religious polarisation, secrecy, lack of transparency and lack of communication,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Varadarajan\u2019s case is not an isolated one. Last week the Chhattisgarh police issued a notice against the local journalist Neeraj Shivhare for his story on a female labourer starving during the lockdown, accusing him of the \u201cpunishable offence\u201d of making \u201creaders afraid and scared and tarnishing the image of the administration\u201d during an epidemic.</p> <p>\u201cThe courts are not functioning as they should, so the police also know it is harder for journalists to get relief from this kind of harassment,\u201d said Varadarajan. \u201cAnd of course their hope is that the media sitting on the fence will look at our situation and say: \u2018Why take the risk of annoying the government?\u2019\u201d</p>",

now closed, AAP reported. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a risk to the general community and it\u2019s not going to get out of control,\u201d he told reporters on Monday.</p> \n  <p>The factory could not close immediately because of animal welfare issues, he said.</p> \n  <p>The bulk of workers who tested positive over the weekend were asymptomatic and were in quarantine before receiving the result.</p> \n  <p>Cedar Meats general manager <strong>Tony Kairouz</strong> said the company found out a staff member had Covid-19, after being admitted to Sunshine hospital for an unrelated matter on 27 April.</p> \n  <p>Two days later, the company found out that four staff who worked in one area of the plant had the virus.</p> \n  <p>All 350 onsite staff were tested for Covid-19 by 1 May.</p> \n  <p>\u201cFor the past few days our focus has been 100 per cent inward - on closing down the processing side of our business, taking care of staff and animal welfare,\u201d Kairouz said in a statement on Monday.</p> \n  <p>The company had not tried to hide the outbreak, he added.</p> \n  <p>He told Melbourne radio 3AW earlier in the day that all the meat processed was in line with Australian food safety standards.</p> \n  <p>The health department is working with the company, which has agreed to close its facility for 14 days and undergo a deep clean..<br></p> \n </div> \n <p

  "<p>With its flared top, funnelled length, high heel and spur, Italy is unmistakably a thigh-high boot. It becomes a knee-high boot if you cut it in half, following a line from Rome on the Tyrrhenian coast, to Porto d\u2019Ascoli on the Adriatic one, which is pretty much what the <a href=\"https://www.lifeinitaly.com/historic-roads/salaria\">Via Salaria</a> does, give or take the odd curve.</p> <p>The original imprint of the road predates the foundation of Rome, and was the work of an ancient population of settlers and warriors called <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabines\">Sabini</a></em>. These early routes were created gradually, bit by bit, to move supplies between settlements \u2013 the most important of which was <em>sal,</em> salt, produced in salt pans on both coasts from both oceans. Under the Romans, these became the first consular routes and were named \u2013 purposefully \u2013 Via Salaria. Those marching along the Salt Road were often paid with the valuable substance they transported, which is where the Latin <em>salarium \u2013</em> salary \u2013 comes from. Also, the idea of salt as worth and wisdom. Things done <em>cum grano salis,</em> with a grain of salt, are done discerningly, as opposed to foolishly because you have no salt in your head, or in your soup.</p> <p>These last few, persistently rainy days of quarantine, I\u2019ve made even more soup than usual, and also re-read much of Samin Nosrat\u2019s book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/salt-fat-acid-heat-9781782112303.html\">Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat</a>. Where would we be without salt? Adrift in a sea of blandness, is her answer, before she hopes: \u201cIf one lesson from this book stays with you, let it be this: salt has a greater impact on flavour than any other ingredient. Learn to use it well and your food will taste good.\u201d I can\u2019t help but think that Samin\u2019s attitude to salt is a bit like that of the Sabini, knowing it is at the heart of everything and adding it in the same way they built their salt road \u2013 gradually, bit by bit. She recommends getting to know your salt, then adding it at all stages of cooking, because it is what coaxes out flavour.</p> <p>I use two sorts of salt, both from Sicily: <em>sale fino</em> \u2013 fine sea salt for seasoning \u2013 and <em>sale grosso</em>, tiny, hard-pebble-like sea salt for salting water, which I keep in jars near the cooker. The spoon in the sale grosso pot holds about 10g of it, which is what I add to every litre of water for boiling pasta and vegetables. For fine salt, I use my fingers: a thumb with one finger is 1g, with two fingers is 2g, with three fingers is 6g, and with four it\u2019s 10g \u2013 obviously this is all personal and as vague as a home serving of gin. Most of the time I am adding 2g at time and tasting constantly, especially when I am making improvisational soups such as this week\u2019s recipe.</p> <p>Samin mentions how the chef <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/dining/judy-rodgers-chef-of-refined-simplicity-dies-at-57.html\">Judy Rodgers</a> often told her chefs a dish needed seven grains of salt. I read lots of food writing and few things stick, but Judy\u2019s seven grains and Samin\u2019s salting \u2013 doing so every step of the way, like the Sabini \u2013 have adhered like sticky seeds to a woolly jumper; reminders of the need to taste and adjust salt discerningly.</p> <h2><strong>Courgette, cannellini bean and herb soup with croutons</strong></h2> <p>It is hard to judge for salt when food is scalding hot; sitting alters flavour, so leave it to sit before tasting and adjusting salt and pepper \u2013 if indeed it needs it.</p> <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br>Cook/rest <strong>1 hr 30 min</strong><br>Serves<strong> 4</strong></p> <p><strong>6 tbsp olive oil<br>1 onion,</strong> diced<br><strong>1 celery stick</strong>, diced<br><strong>A sprig of rosemary<br>Salt<br>1 medium potato</strong>, diced<br><strong>400g courgettes<br>1.5 litres water</strong><br><strong>2 tins cannellini beans</strong><br><strong>2 thick slices stale bread</strong><br><strong>Dried oregano<br>Olive oil</strong>, for frying</p> <p>Put the olive oil, onion, celery, rosemary and a pinch of salt in a large, heavy-based pan and set over a medium flame. Cook, stirring until the onion is starting to soften and turn translucent. Add the potato and another small pinch of salt, stir, then add the water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.</p> <p>Meanwhile trim the courgettes, cut into four lengthways and then into quarter moons about 3mm thick. Drain and rinse the beans, then taste them to see how salty they are.</p> <p>Once the soup has been simmering for 10 minutes, add the courgettes and the beans, and continue simmering for another 20 minutes. Remove from the heat. Check salt and pepper, and set aside for at least an hour.</p> <p>When you are ready to eat, reheat the soup. Cut the bread into 2cm squares. In a separate pan, warm a little olive oil, add the bread, sprinkle with salt and dried oregano, and fry until golden. Serve alongside the soup.</p>",

On Wednesday, he retweeted an article suggesting press freedom advocates who had raised alarm about his actions had been using cocaine.</p> <p>Jan\u0161a, who has a Trump-like tendency to fire off inflammatory tweets and is a close ally of the far-right Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, took office after the country\u2019s previous prime minister, Marjan \u0160arec, resigned, hoping for early elections. Jan\u0161a was able to form a coalition with his Slovenian Democratic party and three other parties.</p> <p>In its first weeks, the government\u2019s attention has been largely focused on the response to coronavirus, and Slovenia has so far managed to keep numbers of infections and deaths low. However, critics fear Jan\u0161a, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">like his mentor Orb\u00e1n</a>, wants to use the coronavirus crisis for political advantage.</p> <p>He will also be able to act as an additional voice of support inside the EU for Orb\u00e1n and the Polish government, who want to ensure the union does not lecture member states on democracy and rule of law. Slovenia will hold the rotating EU presidency next year.</p> <p>The 61-year-old Jan\u0161a has made a very similar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/06/hungary-viktor-orban-election-migration\">political journey to Orb\u00e1n</a>, starting out three decades ago as a pro-democracy fighter and gradually shifting further right over the years, picking up anti-migration and climate sceptic rhetoric along the way. Jan\u0161a\u2019s political campaigns have used xenophobia, Islamophobia and hate speech, said Boris Vezjak, a professor at the University of Maribor in Slovenia.</p> <p>Like Orb\u00e1n, he has been accused of backing cronyism and corruption. In 2013 he was sentenced to two years in prison for bribery, but his conviction was annulled by the constitutional court because of a lack of direct evidence and he was released after six months in jail. He denied all accusations.</p> <p>Jan\u0161a, who has had two brief previous spells as prime minister, is backed by a television network funded by Hungarian figures close to Orb\u00e1n, and the network\u2019s former director Ale\u0161 Hojs has been made Jan\u0161a\u2019s new interior minister.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53191692c5d4e3405bf070c5af54878749a398ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53191692c5d4e3405bf070c5af54878749a398ab/0_152_5502_3301/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protest in Ljubljana against Janez Jan\u0161a and his government last month over alleged corruption.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protest in Ljubljana against Janez Jan\u0161a and his government last month over alleged corruption.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ziga Zivulovic Jr./EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cLike Orb\u00e1n, he is good at distracting from the abuse of resources with anti-Brussels and anti-migrant rhetoric,\u201d said Florian Bieber, a regional expert at the University of Graz. \u201cHe is also very thin-skinned.\u201d</p> <p>Jan\u0161a has picked up on some of Trump\u2019s talking points around the coronavirus, including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JJansaSDS/status/1247978340667006981?s=08\">calling for </a>the resignation of the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Like Trump, he has also made vitriolic attacks on critical journalists, accusing public television of \u201cspreading lies\u201d. When in opposition, in 2016, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JJansaSDS/status/711986552113647620\">accused</a> two female journalists of being \u201cwashed-up prostitutes\u201d.</p> <p>Since taking office in March, Jan\u0161a has attacked the investigative journalist Bla\u017e Zgaga, who criticised some government measures taken over coronavirus as unlawful. An official government account retweeted a claim that the journalist was an \u201cescaped psychiatric patient\u201d and said he was suffering from \u201cCovid-Marx/Lenin\u201d.</p> <p>Zgaga said the attacks had led to a wave of hate mail and threats. \u201cI have been under police protection before, I have been smeared before, but I have never experienced anything like this,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A consortium of press freedom associations, including Reporters without Borders, wrote an an <a href=\"https://ifex.org/european-commission-must-guarantee-the-safety-of-slovenian-journalist-blaz-zgaga/\">open letter</a> to V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, the EU commission\u2019s vice-president for values and transparency, calling on her to take up the matter with the Slovenian government. It chronicled the series of smears on Zgaga and said \u201cwe fear for his life after supporters of the Slovenian government declared him an enemy of the state\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNo hate, no threats, no personal attacks. Contact taken with Slovenia to discuss situation,\u201d Jourov\u00e1 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/verajourova/status/1253608153868046336?s=11\">wrote on Twitter</a> last week. Jan\u0161a does not appear to be taking the rebuke seriously. \u201cNo single figure in Slovenian history has done more to discredit the journo community than this liar,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JJansaSDS/status/1253355298535899143?s=08\">wrote</a> in response.</p> <p>Rights activists also say there are worrying signals about the new government\u2019s post-coronavirus agenda. Last Tuesday, parliament passed a law that removes the rights of most NGOs to take part in environmental assessments of infrastructure projects. Billed as a way to help kickstart the economy post-coronavirus, NGOs in Ljubljana, the capital, say it will allow the government to plough ahead on controversial construction projects without taking environmental concerns into consideration.</p> <p>A restraining factor on Jan\u0161a is likely to be that he has to govern in coalition, and with an electorate that has traditionally veered centre left, this will make it harder to attempt to redraw the county\u2019s political scene.</p> <p>\u201cJan\u0161a is ready to go as far as Orb\u00e1n, no doubt about it, but luckily the opposition is still strong and maybe also the coalition will not be willing to support him until the end,\u201d said Vezjak.</p>",
  "<p>Last month the Dutch government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/dutch-officials-reveal-measures-to-cut-emissions-after-court-ruling\">announced a bold </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/dutch-officials-reveal-measures-to-cut-emissions-after-court-ruling\">set of climate policies</a> designed to reduce annual carbon emissions by nearly 10 megatons, comparable to the yearly output of Latvia.</p> <p>Several new coal power plants are to be closed or run at minimum capacity, a \u20ac3bn spending package will subsidise renewable energy projects and home refits, and there are a slew of smaller policy tweaks, for example on livestock numbers, reforestation and lowering the national speed limit.</p> <p>The middle of a public health crisis may seem like a strange time to make new climate commitments, but the Dutch government had little choice. A court case brought by environmental groups in 2014 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/20/dutch-supreme-court-upholds-landmark-ruling-demanding-climate-action\">upheld by the supreme court last year</a> forced the government to act to reduce emissions to 25% below 1990 levels by the end of 2020 at the latest. It is climate action under extreme duress.</p> <p>There are more than 1,500 climate lawsuits either complete or ongoing in the world, including similar cases in Ireland and Norway, but this is by far the most successful to date. Michael Gerrard, the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, says the Dutch case is the \u201cstrongest climate change decision ever issued by a court\u201d and the only one that has forced government policy.</p> <p>It has big implications not only for climate law but also for governments, most of whose climate policies are years behind their ambitious pledges. Christiana Figueres, the former head of the UN framework convention on climate change, called it \u201ca test case for very rapid emission reductions\u201d that other nations should watch closely.</p> <p>The Dutch government has opted for a crash programme, choosing policies that should mean it hits the target in the eight months remaining in 2020. But it didn\u2019t have to be this way.</p> <p>Marjan Minnesma, the head of the Urgenda Foundation, which filed the initial legal challenge, says the policies are \u201ca great victory for the rule of law\u201d but points out that Urgenda won its initial case in a district court in The Hague in June 2015.</p> <p>The 2020 target was set at that time and could have been reached gradually, but the government twice tied the case up in appeals, eventually losing in the supreme court in December last year. \u201cIt took a long time to step up \u2013 five years of not embracing the judgment,\u201d says Matt Siennot, an MP with Democrats 66.</p> <p>An adviser to the Dutch government says the ruling coalition at the time of the original ruling \u2013 between the centrist People\u2019s Party for Freedom and Democracy and the centre-left Labour party \u2013 was split on whether to take action and afraid that accepting the decision would open the way to further legal challenges. So they let it languish. \u201cThey would say they worked on it, but little was done\u201d he said.</p> <p>Their fears about the courts were ultimately correct: the Netherlands is now a proving ground for environmental lawsuits. A similar case to cap nitrogen pollution was won in 2018, and one of the lawyers from the Urgenda case has partnered with Friends of the Earth to sue Shell, which is headquartered in The Hague.</p> <p>After the supreme court decision, Minnesma was invited to meet government ministers to present potential carbon reduction policies, and she found their reticence had melted away. \u201cA year ago they wouldn\u2019t have listened to any of that, but suddenly they were all writing it down,\u201d she says.</p> <p>What she presented was a green wishlist sourced from more than 800 NGOs and institutions \u2013 everything from housing associations with ambitious retrofitting strategies to animal rights groups pushing a meat tax and a national meat-free day.</p> <p>\u201cWe are bringing these ideas from a wide range of Dutch society. We would say: if you want a broad group to accept it, these are the right things. I got the sense they were willing to listen.\u201d</p> <p>Paul van der Zanden, a spokesperson for the economics and climate ministry, says: \u201cFinding social support was important for these 2020 climate goals. Urgenda gave a great help in the search for climate measures that citizens can take themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the ideas would have been sidelined for years without the push provided by the court decision. Jan Willem Erisman, a professor at the Free University of Amsterdam who works on emissions in agriculture and who contributed proposals to Urgenda, says: \u201cThe lawsuits are almost needed for the work to be considered by the government. Otherwise economic concerns get in the way, targets are set, we don\u2019t reach them, and then new targets get set.\u201d</p> <p>The Dutch climate agreement presented in the summer of 2019 was the product of cooperation between industry, the energy sector, unions, environmental groups and citizen groups.</p> <p>The Dutch government believes public and social support are essential for a successful climate policy, and it helps citizens to take climate measures themselves. For example, it provides financial support for lowering households\u2019 energy consumption. </p> <p>Ultimately, the government settled on the easiest option for the bulk of the emissions reductions. One coal-fired power plant will be closed outright, and two others built in 2016 will run at a minimal level. This alone will save 5-7.5mt of emissions. But several more public-facing measures from the Urgenda list were selected as well. There will be \u20ac2bn for renewable energy subsidies, much of it for rooftop solar, and buybacks of inefficient household appliances. Housing associations will receive much of a \u20ac300m pot for retrofitting.</p> <p>\u201cSo far there really hasn\u2019t been much of an attempt to involve people in policies to slow climate change,\u201d says Rebecca Willis, an environmental policy researcher at Lancaster University. \u201cGovernments often prioritise policies that don\u2019t impact directly on people\u2019s lives, like switching to renewable energy. But the changes now needed, from switching to electric vehicles and public transport to eating less meat, will affect people\u2019s lives, and it\u2019s vital to work with people to involve them.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps surprisingly, none of the Dutch measures have provoked much of a pushback yet. The Netherlands is no stranger to the climate culture war. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/13/dutch-government-cuts-speed-limit-to-100kmh-to-reduce-air-pollution\">speed limit change</a> from 130km/h to 100km/h \u2013 a measure that has already been brought in and is expected to save half a megaton of carbon per year \u2013 was mocked as \u201cnonsense\u201d by the far-right MP Geert Wilders and criticised by motoring lobbyists, but the much larger and more expensive parts of the package have passed relatively quietly.</p> <p>The government may have the coronavirus crisis to thank for that. Compared with the spending programmes being rolled out in response to the pandemic, a climate programme that would be huge any other year now seems slight and has not attracted much notice.</p> <p>Remco De Boer, an energy analyst, says: \u201cThere\u2019s so much else happening. And they\u2019re spending money. KLM [the Dutch airline] has just been rescued [for \u20ac4bn].\u201d He says measures such as renewables subsidies and home upgrades also fit with the desire for economic stimulus.</p> <p>The crisis has also provided the government with a bit of wiggle room in delivering the policies. Emissions for 2020 will be much reduced with so much economic activity suspended. Pieter Boot, the head of climate at the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, estimates that even a short lockdown could knock more than 5mt off the yearly total.</p> <p>But Minnesma says that even if emissions get a one-time reprieve, the measures need to be permanent. The court verdict will be just as valid next year and every year going forward. \u201cWe still have the rule of law,\u201d she says, \u201cand we have shown using the law as an instrument of change is possible.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 May 2020.

  "<p>This isn\u2019t how the fight for equal pay is supposed to end for the US women\u2019s national team.</p> <p>On Friday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/02/usa-womens-soccer-equal-pay-lawsuit\">a US district court judge rejected</a> the USWNT\u2019s allegations of gender discrimination and ruled in favor of the US Soccer Federation, declaring that the team have not been underpaid.</p> <p>The decision stunned just about everyone who had been following the lawsuit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/08/usa-womens-team-sues-us-soccer-pay-equality\">which the USWNT filed last year</a>. The judge was widely expected to prompt a settlement, but instead he ruled in US Soccer\u2019s favor and gave the USWNT little to work with. Only the team\u2019s complaints that they are subject to inferior travel and accommodation compared to their male counterparts will go to trial, which is now scheduled for June.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/02/uswnt-joe-biden-equal-pay-us-soccer\">Joe Biden wades into equal pay dispute between USWNT and US Soccer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The battle isn\u2019t over yet though. The USWNT have vowed to appeal the decision on equal pay, and that could force the matter to drag on for another year or more, especially as the Covid-19 pandemic delays everyday life. That\u2019s plenty of time for some sort of settlement to be hashed out.</p> <p>Yet, regardless of what happens with this particular lawsuit, the USWNT players are poised to emerge as the ultimate victors in the war against their own bosses at US Soccer.</p> <p>After all, the USWNT\u2019s legal argument was always going to have a harder time in a court of law than the court of public opinion. The players collectively bargained for their contract \u2013 it included the compensation structure they wanted \u2013 and, as it turns out, they had the bad luck of actually being paid more by US Soccer because the men\u2019s team have been so bad in recent years, which the judge cited as a reason to toss out the lawsuit. The dispute seemed destined for an out of court settlement anyway, and that\u2019s still likely.</p> <p>But outside of the court proceedings, the USWNT have been winning nonstop \u2013 and will likely win again.</p> <p>Just ask the former US Soccer president, Carlos Cordeiro. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/13/carlos-cordeiro-quits-us-soccer-federation-after-row-over-female-players\">He was forced to resign in March</a> when US Soccer\u2019s legal team got overzealous (or, in plainer terms, sexist) in their defence against the USWNT\u2019s lawsuit, and sponsors became alarmed. While the USWNT were selling protest t-shirts with a blank US Soccer crest, the governing body\u2019s board members were busy issuing apologies.</p> <p>That ordeal was the perfect encapsulation of the dynamic this lawsuit has created. It has buoyed the USWNT and made them more captivating than ever while, for US Soccer, it has been a public relations nightmare. The federation has been desperate to make the controversy go away \u2013 no court rulings needed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bea820258285ea1ebe78b95946a2f64d687d65a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bea820258285ea1ebe78b95946a2f64d687d65a0/0_0_3500_2295/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe both starred for the US women\u2019s team at the 2019 World Cup.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe both starred for the US women\u2019s team at the 2019 World Cup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA Wire/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The USWNT needled US Soccer on issues such as playing surfaces and charter flights \u2013 two other factors that were folded into the equal pay lawsuit \u2013 and US Soccer voluntarily addressed them. The USWNT have finally joined the USMNT in playing all their games on natural grass, and in the last couple of years the women have been traveling on more charter flights than their male counterparts. The women didn\u2019t need to win their lawsuit to gain these concessions \u2013 they just needed to make their objections known.</p> <p>While the USWNT\u2019s lawyers might say otherwise, the ongoing war between the team and the federation never hinged on winning a lawsuit. The USWNT\u2019s legacy in this fight won\u2019t be defined by one judge\u2019s ruling. The players have sparked a conversation, and are now role models in an age where it\u2019s OK for women and girls to expect more and demand more for themselves, the way their male counterparts have for so long.</p> <p>When the USWNT won the World Cup in France last summer, the stadium broke out in a chant: \u201cEqual pay! Equal pay!\u201d Those words have carried over to other women\u2019s sporting events, and it has become a routine occurrence at NWSL games. It\u2019s probably not going away anytime soon.</p> <p>It all harkens back to the early days of the USWNT\u2019s success in the 1990s, when players such as Mia Hamm and Julie Foudy decided they weren\u2019t going to simply shut up and do whatever US Soccer told them.</p> <p>The team\u2019s first big showdown with their boss came after the 1999 World Cup, when the federation wanted the players to fade away into relative obscurity. Instead, the players organized their own exhibition tour across the United States. The federation threatened to sue the team, and Hamm and Foudy vowed to never put on a US Soccer kit again.</p> <p>The players, who smartly stayed unified and didn\u2019t scare easily, won that fight. The post-World Cup victory tour the players created on their own in 1999 still exists to this day \u2013 and it helps them earn money for their success. But more importantly, the incident set a culture for the USWNT: the team refused to settle, and that has carried on for the past two decades.</p> <p>Many of the team\u2019s disputes with US Soccer have happened out of public view, like when they threatened boycotts in 2013 and in 2015, or when they reported allegations of sexist behavior to the US Olympic Committee in 2005. But in all those cases, the team pushed US Soccer to invest more and care more.</p> <p>Things have become more public lately, and critics of the USWNT\u2019s lawsuit have pointed out that no federation financially supports its women\u2019s national team the way US Soccer does \u2013 and that investment, in turn, has helped the USWNT win World Cups. That is true, but it\u2019s also the result of relentless off-the-field work by the players.</p> <p>As for this latest fight, even with less leverage than before, the USWNT will probably force a settlement so both sides can walk away from this saga declaring victory. The players sought $67m in back pay, and sources tell the Guardian that US Soccer had previously offered $9m in settlement talks. But the money is secondary.</p> <p>US Soccer, which has a track record of not doing the right thing until called out publicly, is on notice. The players have made it clear the team expect more communication, collaboration and respect in the future. The players, as they usually do, will more than likely get their own way.</p>",

Her enterprising, domineering mother, Maria, a classic mom-ager before there was such a term, soon moved the family to Los Angeles to pursue Natalie\u2019s acting career. By her teens, Natalie was a studio child star, a doe-eyed well of emotion on screen and a seasoned professional off it.

By 25, she had garnered two more nominations, for Splendor in the Grass and Love With a Proper Stranger. Her marriage to Robert Wagner in 1957, when she was 19 and he was 24, made her a fixture of Hollywood\u2019s gossip press (the two divorced in 1962 and remarried a decade later, after her divorce from Richard Gregson).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35d7e41389b85f26c90b6d603efeadc330b9566c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35d7e41389b85f26c90b6d603efeadc330b9566c/0_0_1606_963/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Natalie Wood and James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Natalie Wood and James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/WARNER BROS.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, for all the glamour \u2013 and Wood, photographed often throughout her life, inhabited glamour easily \u2013 home videos capture a much looser yet still magnetic persona. \u201cWe weren\u2019t raised by someone who seemed like a movie star at all,\u201d Natasha says in the film. \u201cAll she just seemed was sort of larger than life, but not because she was famous.

Robert says the argument with Walken was resolved (he calls Walken \u201ca stand-up guy\u201d) and that when he went to bed, Natalie was missing. Robert and Natasha assume that Natalie went out to tie the yacht\u2019s dinghy \u2013 she was sensitive to noise, Natasha notes, and frequently complained about the dinghy bumping into the boat at night \u2013 and probably slipped and hit her head.</p> <p>The interviews functions as a statement on behalf of the Wagners, thus precluding all interview or comment requests, of which there have been many over the years. \u201cWe included [the interview] because we knew that it was part of the story,\u201d said Natasha. \u201cBut it\u2019s more about the effect the toxic media can have on a family.\u201d In the years since, the film notes, Wood\u2019s descendants have grappled with the shadow of her fame and the sudden loss of a beloved family member, compounded by swarming cameras at her funeral and tabloid covers reigniting attention on Robert, with whom Wood\u2019s daughters, Natasha and Courtney Wagner, remain close.</p> <p>The documentary thus marks a reclamation of Wood\u2019s narrative from tragic question mark to a tale of vivacity, a chance to show movie audiences that Wood had \u201cincredible joy, that she was a devoted mother and wife, that she was a hugely wonderful friend to her friends, championing them and their careers and their mental health\u201d, said Natasha.</p> <p>\u201cShe had a short life, but she had a vibrant life.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Natalie Wood: What Remains Behind premieres on HBO in the US on 5 May and in the UK at a later date</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Knowing how to control the spread of coronavirus is not rocket science. But actually doing it has proved elusive and difficult for many governments across the world. When China first alerted the World Health Organization about a novel coronavirus on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-100-days-that-changed-the-world\">31 December</a>, the countdown began for countries to each prepare. Some, such as South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, were scarred by their recent experiences with two other deadly coronaviruses, Mers and Sars, and so reacted quickly to the coming threat. Others, such as the UK and US, consumed with domestic political issues, watched and waited, anticipating that this new virus would be more similar to a bad flu strain.</p> <p>We are now almost four months into this pandemic, and the lessons that can be drawn from east Asian countries on how best to control this coronavirus and keep daily new cases as low as possible are clear. Eight aspects in particular stand out as important for governments to recognise as they navigate difficult choices ahead. They also provide a guide for what the public should be expecting of and demanding from their governments.</p> <p>The first is to aggressively identify where the virus is and break chains of transmission. This requires a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/england-coronavirus-testing-has-not-risen-fast-enough-science-chief\">test, trace, isolate</a>\u201d policy that involves mass community testing, tracing those who had been in contact in the previous week with any individual testing positive, and putting all of those individuals into a mandatory quarantine. Governments and local municipalities would have to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/28/uk-contact-tracing-plans-an-nhs-app-and-an-army-of-health-staff\">recruit and train foot soldiers</a> to carry this out.<strong> </strong>While testing itself is not a solution, it is a crucial part of a package of public health interventions needed to keep identifying clusters of infection and breaking these apart. Keeping daily cases low through this approach keeps the burden off hospitals and allows bare-bones economic and social activity to occur.</p> <p>The second is to protect health and social care workers who are most at risk from contracting the virus and who are exposed to high <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/why-do-some-young-people-die-of-coronavirus-covid-19-genes-viral-load\">viral loads</a> during the course of doing their jobs. This protection needs to involve not only priority access to testing, but also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/uk-doctors-finding-it-harder-to-get-ppe-kit-to-treat-covid-19-patients-research-reveals\">appropriate personal protective gear</a> that is readily available. Much attention has been paid to ensuring that there are enough ventilators, beds and oxygen and much less to the need for sufficient and skilled frontline staff, who cannot be manufactured in days or weeks.</p> <p>The third is to keep constant surveillance of the virus using tracking systems to detect whether certain parts of the country are becoming hotspots and whether sub-populations, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/singapore-million-migrant-workers-suffer-as-covid-19-surges-back\">migrants living in close quarters</a>, have a higher incidence of the virus. This can be done by building on existing flu surveillance networks and ensuring that data is shared in real time. Tied into this point is lesson four, which is about monitoring borders for imported cases. Travel bans towards certain countries have limited effectiveness, but blanket <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/new-zealand-tells-arrivals-to-self-isolate-for-two-weeks-including-citizens\">14-day quarantines</a> for any international arrivals can ensure that new cases are detected quickly rather than setting off more clusters of infections. </p> <p>The fifth is that clear and honest communication with the public is required to keep trust and compliance with the necessary policy guidance. This is an unsettling time for everyone as rules are introduced around daily behaviour and misinformation is rife. Therefore, consistent and straightforward messaging on why policies are being introduced and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/uk-to-name-scientific-advisers-on-emergency-coronavirus-group-sage\">transparency</a> on how governments are making their decisions is essential to create a beacon of trusted information in a sea of noise.</p> <p>The sixth is recognising that any \u201cexit\u201d strategy is not like a switch that means life will go back to pre-Covid days. A \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/boris-johnson-returns-to-no-10-and-a-government-under-pressure\">new normal</a>\u201d will need to be adjusted to, which is likely to involve distancing whenever possible; possible temperature checks when entering public buildings and offices; and the use of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/face-masks-mandatory-spread-coronavirus-government\">face masks in public</a>. The goal is to achieve some economic and social activity while keeping procedures in place that reduce the transmission of the virus.</p> <p>The seventh lesson is that lockdowns, if introduced early and quickly, can slow the spread of the virus, but are not a solution by themselves. They are a costly and crude policy instrument that should be used as sparingly as possible. They allow governments to buy time and use this time to massively increase important public health infrastructure. </p> <p>The final lesson is that all of the above are short-term strategies while countries await key scientific findings to create informed policy decisions and find the ultimate \u201cexit strategy\u201d. There are huge gaps in what we know about this virus, including about immunity, the individual risk of developing severe symptoms and how long it will take to develop an effective vaccine or therapy. But the steps above can ensure that countries keep daily new cases low and avoid a repeat of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/1918-flu-pandemic-coronavirus-drug-trials-scientists-treatments-evidence\">1918 flu pandemic</a>, which was determined, in the end, by the \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh</p>",

But there was another silent battle raging behind the scenes: the one for hearts and minds. According to the organiser <a href=\"https://chess24.com/en\" title=\"\">chess24.com</a>, more than 10 million people have watched the tournament. Meanwhile its biggest rival, <a href=\"https://www.chess.com/\" title=\"\">chess.com</a>, has in excess of 35 million members who play more than five million games a day.

Even now he is the game\u2019s great white shark, with an unnerving ability to detect weaknesses. There was relish, too, when he admitted he had \u201cwanted to crush\u201d the 16-year\u2011old prodigy Alireza Firouzja in the preliminary rounds.</p> <p>But, impressively, Carlsen has been brutally honest about his failings, too. On one occasion he described his play as \u201cterribly bad\u201d. On another he admitted: \u201cI got away with something akin to murder.\u201d In a world where big-name sportspeople rarely stray from the anodyne or the bland, the Norwegian has been a revelation.</p> <p>And that is not the only preconception he has shattered. Martin Amis once wrote that chess genius lives, or windmills its arm, on the outer rims of sanity. Inevitably, he invoked Fischer\u2019s descent into madness. The American, who used to get a discount at his local antisemitic bookstore so valued was his custom, was also so paranoid he had his fillings removed because he did not want anything metallic in his head in case he picked up radio transmissions.</p> <p>But the more we see chess players up close, the more it is obvious Fischer was a gargantuan outlier. Over the course of the past fortnight the world\u2019s best have never seemed more human. Including Carlsen himself.</p>",

A large group of construction workers taunted them as anti-American and then attacked with crowbars in what became known as \u201cThe Hardhat Riot\u201d.

But if you look across a whole population, a small increase in risk is something you might want to do something about and air pollution is a modifiable risk factor.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kelly is concerned about the rise in air pollution after the end of lockdowns, as is <a href=\"https://eeb.org/air-pollution-returns-to-china/\">already being seen in China</a>. \u201cCurrently, air quality in cities is pretty good because of the shutdown,\u201d he said. Rising air pollution will increase inflammation in the lungs of some people. \u201cIf they are then exposed to a separate wave of the virus, the question is whether they will be more susceptible than the general population.\u201d</p> \n<p>All the researchers hope that the dangers of air pollution exposed by the coronavirus pandemic and the cleaner skies seen during the lockdowns will lead to lasting change. Some cities, such as <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2020/04/coronavirus-reopen-cities-public-transit-car-free-bike-milan/610360/\">Milan, Rome, Berlin, Brussels, Paris</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/covid-19-coronavirus-mexico-city-bike-paths/\">Mexico City</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Oakland-closing-streets-to-traffic-enabling-15193171.php\">Oakland, California</a>, have taken action, at least temporarily, to cut car use and increase cycling and walking.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"048cd2ae35517d93fbab398c32fa7e5c45d817ba\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/048cd2ae35517d93fbab398c32fa7e5c45d817ba/0_0_3747_2498/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People wear masks as they walk the streets of Mexico City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wear masks as they walk the streets of Mexico City.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jos\u00e9 M\u00e9ndez/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The WHO is asking people to photograph the clear skies they are seeing during lockdowns. \u201cWe can use those clean memories to inspire a more healthy and green recovery,\u201d said Neira.

  "<p>It\u2019s late at night in a Brussels office. A group of rowdy British politicians are ripping apart the blue and gold-starred European flag, swilling beer, dancing with the Union Jack aloft. One MEP clambers up onto a table: \u201cWe\u2019ve taken back control,\u201d she shouts, before falling flat on her face.</p> <p>Welcome to the European parliament as imagined for the small screen. Parlement, a Franco-German-Belgian co-production, is a 10-part comedy series and something rather unusual: a slice of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/23/brussels-city-of-love-and-revenge-on-tv-anyway\">the European Union in popular culture</a>.</p> <p>The show was conceived by No\u00e9 Debr\u00e9, a French screenwriter who grew up in Strasbourg, close to the European parliament\u2019s second seat near the Rhine. Comedy, he thinks, is a great way to approach the EU: \u201cThe complexity of the European institutions offers a lot of opportunities for misunderstanding and funny situations.\u201d</p> <p>Over 10 30-minute episodes, the show charts the progress of Samy, a political na\u00eff who arrives in Brussels to work for a member of the European parliament, knowing nothing about the EU and caring less. His boss is Michel Specklin, a feckless French MEP from an unnamed centrist party, who passes the days hiding in his office or running away from requests to do any work. \u201cWhat will I talk about for one-and-a-half minutes?\u201d he despairs, on being cornered into making a speech in the fisheries committee.</p> <p>It\u2019s a world of backstabbing and intrigue, where European parliament officials in three-piece suits quote Bismarck and assistants connive to split the Spanish delegation with sweeteners for Catalan nationalists.</p> <p>Tricked by one official, Samy ends up in charge of an amendment to ban the practice of cutting off sharks\u2019 fins <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20121122IPR56237/parliament-closes-loopholes-in-shark-finning-ban\">- a law the real European parliament passed in 2003</a>. The hapless novice teams up with Rose, a cynical British assistant, who has watched her boss turn from moderate Tory Europhile into full-throated Brexiteer after being \u201cradicalised\u201d by her internet reading, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/14/boris-johnson-brussels-bashing-stories-shaped-politics\">Boris Johnson\u2019s articles on condom sizes and banana shapes</a>. Rounding off the main characters is German assistant Torsten, who sums up the history of the European peace project in a sentence: \u201cGuys, we\u2019ve got to stop fighting and work on regulations and shit.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11d9bfdbfefad0dbec231825556bb6e205b83e64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11d9bfdbfefad0dbec231825556bb6e205b83e64/0_184_5516_3308/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from Parlement\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Parlement is launched on Belgian TV next week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo Voets/France.tv</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although French media have likened the show to The Thick of It, the comedy is gentler, without the sweary aggression of Malcolm Tucker, the fearsome director of communications played by Peter Capaldi. The dialogue shifts between English and French, sometimes German, occasionally some of the EU\u2019s other 24 official languages.</p> <p>Insiders will recognise a lot: the real plenary calendars on the walls, Italians who complain about the coffee, and the \u201ccelebrity commissioner\u201d that young assistants swoon over. There is a Danish politician who has fined Apple and inspired a TV show, a character clearly modelled on EU competition commissioner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/margrethe-vestager\">Margrethe Vestager</a>.</p> <p>Parlement airs on Belgian TV next week and in Germany in June, following its launch in France. It is still unusual to see a primetime show about the EU, and in France, where there is no tradition of political comedy, Parlement was a difficult sell. The show was in development for two years at another channel before finding a home on France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the easiest topic to sell,\u201d Debr\u00e9 says. \u201cDrama is conflict and conflict is drama. And without conflict you don\u2019t have action. And the EU is a place designed to produce compromise not conflict.\u201d The show, however, does bring to life amendment battles and faction building, which rarely get public attention.</p> <p>Maxime Calligaro, a policy adviser in the European parliament who became a co-writer, thinks Brexit \u201csort of helped\u201d galvanise interest in the project. \u201cSince the Greek crisis,\u201d he says, \u201cthe EU has become so dramatic \u2026 The boss of the network wanted more Brexit in the show.\u201d</p> <p>The show even delves into the thorny question of the Irish border, when Brexiteer MEP Sharon Redlion comes up with a plan to solve the biggest conundrum of the Brexit talks. \u201cJust track it all with a massive GPS. You could just do something like Deliveroo with a bit of Bitcoin,\u201d she says, a suggestion that satirises the real-life and ultimately doomed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/24/irish-border-kept-open-within-three-years-after-no-deal-brexit-says-report\">\u201calternative arrangements\u201d proposed by Tory MPs</a>.</p> <p>Debr\u00e9, a fan of The Thick of It and Veep, has been surprised by the lack of British comedy on Brexit. \u201cBritish comedy hasn\u2019t seized on the subject yet, which is really weird for us, because the British are so good at doing comedy.\u201d He suggests the subject was too divisive to joke about. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for us to make jokes about it, so it felt like we had this whole land of jokes that we could take over.\u201d</p> <p>While the show has picked up good reviews in France, it has provoked some unease inside the EU bubble.</p> <p>Olivier Costa, director of European political and administrative studies at the College of Europe, the elite training school for European officials, questions what he sees as the writers\u2019 indulgence of Eurosceptic cliches, such the stupid, lazy MEP, while he adds that no one would ever hire anyone as ignorant as Samy.</p> <p>The show\u2019s creators <a href=\"http://www.lavie.fr/culture/television/serie-parlement-fallait-il-vraiment-en-passer-par-la-comedie-23-04-2020-105788_31.php\">are taking a big risk, he wrote in a recent issue of the French magazine La Vie</a>. The viewer not steeped in EU politics will conclude that the European parliament is \u201ca chaotic institution, where incompetents, rogues or nationalists stir things up without aim\u201d.</p> <p>Calligaro thinks that verdict misses the show\u2019s nuances, such as the trajectory of Samy, who discovers his conviction for the unpopular cause of sharks during the season. \u201cAll the characters have redeeming features. Yes, the MEP is very lazy, but he is a very nice guy and maybe he is an outstanding local politician. The German policy adviser \u2013 she is cynical, she is Machiavellian, but ultimately she is fighting for a good cause.\u201d</p> <p>Calligaro and another co-writer, who works for the EU, were ultimately convinced \u201cthat what the EU is dying of is just being ignored.</p> <p>\u201cI guess what mattered to us was to show that the EU institutions are human \u2013 for better or worse.\u201d</p>",

It was explosive \u2013 growling rap packed with threats, boasts and great songs such as In Da Club and Many Men.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a6234db85c68e775fe933d2a656f54d5d107182\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a6234db85c68e775fe933d2a656f54d5d107182/0_172_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mugshot from 1994.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mugshot from 1994.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Get Rich was really his life story. And what a story. His drug-dealing mother, Sabrina, was murdered when he was eight (drugged and gassed at 23 by an unknown killer in her home); he started selling drugs on the streets at 12, bought his first gun at 15 and was shot nine times at the age of 25 (including a bullet through the cheek that gives him his distinctive slur today). He was dropped by Columbia without releasing a record, signed up by Eminem and championed by Dr Dre. And then came that monster first album. Jackson hasn\u2019t repeated the success of his debut (although his second album, The Massacre, was also huge), but he has continued to hustle and find headline-grabbing ways of getting rich.</p> <p>For Jackson, it begins and ends with the money, right down to the name, which he appropriated from a dead gangster. When he bought the Tyson house, he says, he had been struggling to pay his $800-a-month rent bill for the apartment he shared with his then-partner and his first son, Marquise. \u201cThen I left for a tour of Get Rich Or Die Tryin\u2019 and I came back with $38m [\u00a330m]. So getting that place was confirmation of success.\u201d But he got bored. \u201cYou may have 18 bedrooms, but you can only sleep on one bed. You have all that space, but you still can\u2019t walk around the house naked, \u2019cause you\u2019ve got staff. Going down the hall was like walking down the street.\u201d</p> <p>Jackson has just written a very readable book about how to do things his way. Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter is classic Fiddy \u2013 a self-help guide for aspiring bigwigs. By turns, he comes across as machiavellian (tips include pretending to drink on a night out with colleagues then exploiting the weaknesses they have drunkenly revealed), cynical (women just want him for his money), puritanical (he doesn\u2019t drink or take drugs), little-boy-lost (desperately seeking affirmation) and wise elder (telling readers of the need to constantly evolve to stay relevant). When he is not boasting, bullying or dissing, much of his advice is perfectly sensible \u2013 be true to yourself, don\u2019t make the same mistake twice and dress decently if you want to make an impression.</p> <p>I ask what he is wearing today. \u201cI don\u2019t even have all my clothes on yet.\u201d That\u2019s exciting, I say, tell me more. \u201cI\u2019m wearing an undershirt, like a white tank top, and black sweatpants.\u201d Hold on, I say: in your book, you suggest not looking your best for somebody shows a lack of respect. I know we are only talking on the phone, but \u2026 \u201cYeah, \u2019cause I\u2019m in quarantine in the house and that doesn\u2019t apply to quarantine.\u201d He laughs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0f693ce25f94b73ceb2b626c49c60af1d96ea5dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f693ce25f94b73ceb2b626c49c60af1d96ea5dc/0_117_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"50 Cent, Eminem and Dr Dre in New York in 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">50 Cent, Eminem and Dr Dre in New York in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Micelotta/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Has the pandemic affected him personally? \u201cI know three or four people who have passed from my old neighbourhood in Queens. In New York City, Queens always becomes the worst place.\u201d Why does he think that so many of the 63,000-plus people who have died in the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/its-a-racial-justice-issue-black-americans-are-dying-in-greater-numbers-from-covid-19\">are from black and ethnic minority backgrounds</a>? \u201cI don\u2019t think coronavirus is discriminating based on income. Hehehe!\u201d He giggles. But if you don\u2019t have money to self-isolate and have to go out to work to pay the bills, surely it leaves you more exposed to catching Covid-19? Jackson is not having any of it. \u201cIn my experience, you can\u2019t force people to work.\u201d But, he says, he sure is glad people in the service sector are still working. \u201cIf those people stayed home, it would have been hell. There would be no deliveries, no orders. You would have had to have stocked up already in your home.\u201d I sense that Jackson would find it impossible to look at any situation without putting himself at the centre of it.</p> <p>How does he feel Trump has dealt with the crisis?</p> <p>A voice on the line interjects. It is Amanda, Jackson\u2019s personal publicist. \u201cWe really need to bring it back to the book,\u201d she says. But Jackson is happy to talk Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s an awkward situation. If you respond too fast, you\u2019re wrong, because everyone would be kicking and screaming and saying you shut everything down. But if you shut it down late, you\u2019re wrong. So you can\u2019t win in that situation.\u201d He has sympathy for Trump? \u201cPeople hate him or love him. There\u2019s no in-between. And for me, I\u2019m looking at it and going: \u2018That\u2019s the exact position I\u2019m in.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Another thing he has in common with the president is his obsession with money. Jackson attributes his values to Sabrina, who taught him to hustle. \u201cMy decisions were pre-made for me. My mom having me at 15 was why we got into this lifestyle.\u201d Selling drugs was more rewarding than any alternative for Sabrina. \u201cShe did well before she got stuck in that dangerous lifestyle,\u201d he says.</p> <p>After her death, he moved in with his grandparents. They had eight children of their own, no money to spare and laid down strict rules. He adored them, but they could provide none of the luxuries his mother had been able to. \u201cThe only people I saw coming round who had nice things were from my mom\u2019s life. They had Cadillacs, expensive jewellery, everything that symbolised financial freedom.\u201d When he started selling drugs, he told his grandparents he was at after-school club. He has remained wedded to his love of nice things ever since. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want nice things in your life, I don\u2019t even want to know you.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI. Don\u2019t. Want. To. Know. You,\u201d he repeats. Jackson can be staggeringly absolutist.</p> <p>Yet he can also be surprisingly sweet. He talks of his mother and grandmother with such tenderness. Have any other women been as important in his life? \u201cNo. My grandmother took care of me. My mom is why I\u2019m here, period. How do you compare any woman to your mother and your grandmother? How can another person be that important?\u201d Perhaps a partner, I say. He sounds shocked. \u201cFor some people, I guess it\u2019s that way. But, no, not me.\u201d</p> <p>One of the book\u2019s recurrent themes is how adversity has strengthened him. \u201cWhen there are the setbacks, there are gonna be the get-backs,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re just born super-rich and you\u2019ve just been rich your whole life, you don\u2019t understand the significance of it. It\u2019s just where you are.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adeaaade9b38d7e59523d6a07084ce95c5b430d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adeaaade9b38d7e59523d6a07084ce95c5b430d8/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On stage in Los Angeles in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On stage in Los Angeles in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angela Weiss/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jackson often says he may not be the best rapper or actor, but he is authentic, and that\u2019s what his fans bought into. He talks of his \u201cdamage\u201d \u2013 and how he turned it into an asset. \u201cIn hip-hop, people are looking for the damage. And you come in and they look at you, and they can see the damage. They can see the experience, the story, why you are where you are. You can offer something unique.\u201d</p> <p>He is also aware damage has a shelf life. \u201cIt works for a while, but then as you continue to be successful you don\u2019t have that same damage.\u201d As Jackson repeatedly reminds me, he has sold 30m albums, but subsequent albums sold less and less well. So he took up acting (his first film was a thinly veiled biopic named after the first album; he has now appeared in 25 movies) and moved into business (his stake in the Vitaminwater maker Glac\u00e9au, which was sold to Coca-Cola for $4.1bn in 2007, is reported to have earned him between $60m and $100m). So many stars are complacent about their success, he says. \u201cPeople have expiration dates. You can\u2019t see it, but their time\u2019s up and they almost implode in front of you.\u201d</p> <p>Jackson can be unforgiving. In fact, he prides himself on it. In the book, he tears a strip off his son Marquise for his sense of entitlement. Does he hope their relationship will improve? No, it is too late. \u201cI\u2019ve already tried so long with him. That sense of entitlement is scariest when it\u2019s someone you love. He still manages to feel deprived when he\u2019s had everything. You love the person, he\u2019s your child, and he looks at you as if you\u2019re the enemy. And, after a while, you go: this is not a kid, it\u2019s a grown man we\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p> <p>After Marquise was pictured with the son of one of the men who allegedly plotted to shoot his father, Jackson tweeted: \u201cIf both these little niggas got hit by a bus, I wouldn\u2019t have a bad day.\u201d Did he mean it or was he having a 50 Cent moment? For the first time, he sounds hesitant. \u201cThat\u2019s, yeah, um, that was a 50 Cent moment \u2026\u201d He says he is trying his best to make sure his younger son, Sire, grows up with more boundaries. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m an artist. Why am I limited to what you feel should be said?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Jackson has never been scared of making an enemy. I tell him that one of my favourite bits in the book is the section on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/oprah-winfrey\">Oprah Winfrey</a>. He was desperate to be on her show \u2013 not least to show his grandmother, who was a huge Winfrey fan, that he had made it. Yet Winfrey made it clear how much she disapproved of him \u2013 particularly the gun violence and misogyny in his lyrics. (In Get in My Car, he raps: \u201cI got no pickup lines, I stay on the grind / I tell the hoes all the time, bitch, get in my car.\u201d)</p> <p>When he talks now about how he was snubbed by her when he first found fame, the wound still seems fresh. \u201cShe was completely against everything that was in my music,\u201d he says. \u201cSo she ain\u2019t never going to have me on that show. I\u2019m never going to reach that platform, which is confirmation of you being a huge success. So I just said: OK, if we can\u2019t be friends, then at least let\u2019s be enemies.\u201d He started a feud, said her fans were white and elderly and named his female dog Oprah.</p> <p>Did they ever become friends? \u201cLater we did.\u201d And did he ever say: Oprah, you had a point \u2013 my lyrics are misogynistic? Silence. I ask the question again. \u201cWell, no. Did you hear what I said? They are misogynistic, but the world is not under the same circumstances. Are you going to tell a painter what to paint? I\u2019m an artist. Why am I limited to what <em>you</em> feel should be said? In film and television, they will show art imitates life. Are you not aware of those situations taking place?\u201d He is perfectly calm, his tone unchanged, but I seem to have hit a nerve.</p> <p>His defence of his lyrics is eloquent and impassioned. Was this what he said to Oprah? \u201cNo. She never asked me the question in the way you did. The truth is, all things come from your experience. Like, I got shot nine times and I wrote music about it. Everyone writes something that can connect in a big way based on a painful moment, so you\u2019re saying we\u2019re not supposed to articulate or write it the way we experienced?\u201d</p> <p>Has his view of the world changed since then? \u201cYes, absolutely. If you stay the same, you\u2019re not growing as a person.\u201d In the book, he touches on how his sexual politics have evolved. He writes that, on hearing that the vice-president, Mike Pence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/31/mike-pence-doesnt-eat-alone-women-speaks-volumes\">never ate alone with a woman who was not his wife</a>, he had thought this seemed sensible. It was only when a friend explained this could mean Pence saw women purely as a threat or object of desire that Jackson reconsidered.</p> <p>Perhaps the most unlikely event in Jackson\u2019s action-packed life came when he filed for bankruptcy in 2015. It is surprising it is not mentioned in a book about overcoming adversity. Ah, he says, this is where normal people don\u2019t understand the nature of bankruptcy, because they can\u2019t imagine dealing in such vast fortunes. Again, he sees a parallel with Trump, whose companies filed for bankruptcy multiple times. \u201cBusinesspeople will do that in a heartbeat before losing money. Because it means they have the ability to be secure and invest again.\u201d He says even the judges ruling on the bankruptcy can\u2019t comprehend such money. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a judge who makes $125,000 a year. Hahaha!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f631b50184b5109e2113c92fbef247dbc386ebeb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f631b50184b5109e2113c92fbef247dbc386ebeb/30_16_2828_1697/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Nicholas Pinnock in the US drama For Life.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Nicholas Pinnock in the US drama For Life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giovanni Rufino/ABC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bankruptcy allowed him to start afresh \u2013 most notably as executive producer (and actor) on the successful American TV crime drama series Power. Soon after filing for bankruptcy, he tells me, he signed a $150m deal with a TV network.</p> <p>He says he wants for nothing these days, but is still a sucker for affirmation. I ask him if he is surprised to still be alive at the age of 44. \u201cA lot of my friends growing up, they\u2019re not here. It\u2019s easier to not think about those things.\u201d He prefers to think of legacy than longevity.</p> <p>Amanda has been telling me it is the final question for the past 20 minutes. Jackson has been more generous with his time, but she tells me this really is the final question. I am thinking of legacy. If there were one thing he could campaign for, some way in which he could change the US, what would it be? \u201cTaxes,\u201d he says without missing a beat. \u201cI don\u2019t like them. They want too much of the money back. Hehehehe!\u201d</p> <p>We say goodbye, and Jackson is still giggling at the thought of fighting for his tax-free utopia.</p> <p><em>Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter by Curtis Jackson (Amistad, an imprint of HarperCollins) is out in the UK on 14 May</em><br></p>",
  "<p>Before my world was reduced to a two-mile radius from my house, I never realised how interesting other people\u2019s front gardens could be. When your life is confined to the same four walls, with each journey to the kitchen an odyssey, the world outside takes on a whole new allure. I now find myself entranced by all the different varieties of privet hedge, intrigued by people\u2019s choice of gravel size and paving pattern, captivated by the clusters of cacti perched on windowsills. Front doors have become a new form of entertainment, as have the subtleties of window-mouldings and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architrave\">architraves</a>. Who knew there could be so many varieties of mortar on a single street?</p> <p>There\u2019s nothing like six weeks of house arrest to give you an elevated awareness of your surroundings. And it\u2019s a phenomenon that hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed at the nation\u2019s grand repository of objects, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/v-and-a\">the Victoria and Albert</a>. \u201cThe pandemic has this weird way of bringing to the fore objects you would never have thought about,\u201d says Brendan Cormier, senior design curator at the London museum. \u201cEverything becomes heightened.\u201d</p> <p>With future exhibitions on hold and collecting in limbo, Cormier has turned his team\u2019s attention to thinking about how the coronavirus has reframed the everyday, casting familiar objects in a very different light. Which is why the V&amp;A is just about to launch <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/\">Pandemic Objects</a>, an online series examining how a range of unremarkable items have become charged with new meaning and purpose.</p> <p>\u201cThere are so many designed objects and inventions coming out of the pandemic,\u201d says Cormier, citing all the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/25/10-coronavirus-covid-busting-designs\">hands-free door openers and 3D-printed face visors</a>. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to take time to work out which ones are actually useful.\u201d He thinks there\u2019s a danger that some much-touted innovations might end up being \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/vapourware-the-tech-that-never-was/\">vapourware</a>\u201d \u2013 flashy concepts that catch the attention of design blogs, but never come to fruition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b291e2c0590fc73497ab09182068afe7bd0277c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b291e2c0590fc73497ab09182068afe7bd0277c3/0_0_5307_3538/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Solidarity \u2026 children\u2019s signs thank key workers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Solidarity \u2026 children\u2019s signs thank key workers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The V&amp;A design department has made headlines with its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jul/02/victoria-and-albert-rapid-response-gallery-unveiled\">Rapid Response Collecting</a>, an initiative that has snapped up such zeitgeisty objects as the Liberator 3D-printed handgun, the plans for which were released online in 2013, and one of pink knitted <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/the-pussyhat\">pussyhats</a> worn by half a million attendees at the Women\u2019s March in Washington DC in 2017. But with everything now changing so rapidly, curators have decided there\u2019s some value in slowing down. Instead of rushing out to collect Covid ephemera, Cormier thinks the museum\u2019s time would be better spent looking afresh at what\u2019s right under our noses. \u201cIs the pandemic revealing anything new,\u201d he asks, \u201cabout things we take for granted?\u201d<br><br>One of the first things to catch his attention was the wealth of hastily drawn homemade signs cropping up in shop windows around the world, explaining new delivery services and warning people to keep 2m apart. It seemed to say something about our relationship with technology and public messaging: the 1990s craze for inkjet printers promised everyone the professional finish of a publishing house in the comfort of their own home. Yet, three decades on, most of us seem to have thrown out our printers, sick of clogged-up, eye-wateringly expensive cartridges, and have embraced the paperless society. \u201cIn the moment of need, when the situation is changing so rapidly,\u201d says Cormier, \u201cwe\u2019ve gone back to pen and paper.\u201d</p> <p>Putting signs in windows quickly spread to the home, too, as a means of both expressing community solidarity and keeping the kids occupied. Headteachers encouraged pupils <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-51988671\">to paint hopeful rainbows</a> and stick them in windows, fuelling neighbourly rivalry with evermore elaborate formations, ranging from chalk to neon paint and Lego bricks. It wasn\u2019t long before this homespun movement was co-opted by the art world, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/20/damien-hirst-rainbow-in-support-of-nhs-coronavirus-butterfly-rainbow\">Damien Hirst offering his own butterfly-wing rainbow</a> to download.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74c220690e801d6d0c860443b32345b98ac87d7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74c220690e801d6d0c860443b32345b98ac87d7c/0_274_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Don\u2019t we all have printers? \u2026 shop sign in Windermere.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don\u2019t we all have printers? \u2026 shop sign in Windermere.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Smith/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Catherine Flood, co-curator of the <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/inside-the-food-bigger-than-the-plate-exhibition\">V&amp;A\u2019s Food exhibition</a> last year, will examine how the pandemic has changed perceptions of certain kitchen-cupboard staples. Flour and yeast, more used to being spilled on surfaces and swept into bins, have become sought-after luxuries, as we all try <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/14/grains-flour-shortage-tells-us-about-who-we-are\">to channel our inner bakers</a>. Instagram has become the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/sourdough/?hl=en\">Sourdough Olympics</a>, awash with competitive posts, while flour mills are working around the clock to fulfil demand as wheat prices surge and well-stocked shelves become a rarity.</p> <p>Traffic to the BBC\u2019s basic bread recipe has risen faster than a cob in a 250-degree oven, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52212760\">with numbers up by 875%</a>. But need does not seem to be what\u2019s driving demand, as bread is still readily available in shops. It\u2019s the therapeutic quality of baking that\u2019s the attraction, Cormier thinks, the tactile and meditative quality of the process, along with a desire to feel self-sufficient.</p> <p>\u201cFlour is now a privilege,\u201d he says, and he doesn\u2019t just mean being able to find it in shops. \u201cTo bake bread, you need to be able to work at home, and have time to invest. It\u2019s probably not frontline key workers who have the pleasure of rediscovering the miracles of baking.\u201d</p> <p>As research for a potential future exhibition on accessibility in design, curator Natalie Kane has been looking at the door handle \u2013 a seemingly innocuous part of the built environment that has become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/13/smart-lifts-lonely-workers-no-towers-architecture-after-covid-19-coronavirus\">a</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/13/smart-lifts-lonely-workers-no-towers-architecture-after-covid-19-coronavirus\"> villain </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/13/smart-lifts-lonely-workers-no-towers-architecture-after-covid-19-coronavirus\">in the age of coronavirus</a>.

Begun in 2008 when the medium was still novel, the projects trawls the globe\u2019s virtual streets for alarming scenes \u2013 from a moose careering down a highway to a gun-toting gang caught mid-heist, to naked bodies sprawled across the pavement.</p> <p>Now, these unruly snapshots seem like glimpses of another time, glitches in the lockdown matrix. V&amp;A curator Ella Kilgallon will examine the Street View phenomenon, putting it in the context of such earlier documentary initiatives as the <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/s/sir-benjamin-stone-and-the-NPRA/\">National Photographic Record Association</a>), established in 1897 in an attempt to create a comprehensive record of British life. Taking advantage of the expansion of photography as an increasingly popular hobby at the turn of the century, the association planned to form a countrywide \u201cmemory bank\u201d to foster \u201cnational pride\u201d. It culminated in 5,883 photographs by 1910. In the last 12 years, Google has captured 10 million miles of the Earth\u2019s surface in 360-degree images, <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/google-maps-has-now-photographed-10-million-miles-in-street-view/\">equivalent to circling the planet more than 400 times</a>.<br><br>Further entries in the Pandemic Objects series will shine a spotlight on toilet paper, streaming services, cardboard packaging, balconies and more, one of the more triumphant stories being the revival of the sewing machine. \u201cDespite all the hype around distributed manufacturing and downloadable customised designs, not many of us have a 3D-printer at home,\u201d says Cormier. \u201cYet the great 19th-century invention of the sewing machine is still a ubiquitous household item.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d06e72ffd7e2a624342f2ec0c28876e0155873e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d06e72ffd7e2a624342f2ec0c28876e0155873e/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"homemade protective masks take shape.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Make do \u2026 homemade protective masks take shape.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Lenoir/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sales of sewing machines have rocketed in the pandemic, recalling the <a href=\"https://www.victoryliving.co.uk/make-do-and-mend\">Make Do and Mend</a> movement of the second world war, as people join <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52328229\">the effort to mass-produce face masks</a>. One of the chief obstacles to such community craftivism, says Cormier, is managing production and distribution. After the recent bush fires in Australia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/07/australia-wildfires-animals-shelters-knitting\">an international callout for people to knit koala mittens and wombat pouches</a> triggered a tidal wave of marsupial mitts, far more than could possibly be used. As thousands of companies and hobbyists have <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2020/04/13/face-shields-coronavirus-apple-foster/\">sign up to produce face-shields</a> in the great national struggle for PPE, it remains to be seen how effectively they can be distributed to where they are needed most.<br><br>Whether it\u2019s a newfound respect for loo roll, a growing suspicion of excessive cardboard packaging, or a phobia of door handles, when the pandemic finally subsides, we may never look at everyday objects in the same way again.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Pandemic Objects is at </em><em><a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/\">vam.ac.uk/blog/</a></em></p>",
  "<p>April full moon in lockdown: a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/apr/05/starwatch-supermoon-the-moon-at-its-closest-and-brightest\" title=\"\">supermoon</a>, the nearest of this spring. Having saved my daily walk for a nocturnal escapade, I slip out, torchless, to meet it. I do not know when I have experienced such stillness. There is not a wisp of a breeze, nor a cloud in the sky; not a voice, nor a dog\u2019s bark.</p> <p>Leaving the village\u2019s scattering of electric light, I continue into the bright darkness of the beech-hedged lane, the withered scrolls of last year\u2019s leaves picked out in silver or black, a familiar terrain painted in moonlight. Above me, an infinitude of stars shines unhindered. This is a region where darkness gets to be itself. Twenty miles from the <a href=\"https://forestryandland.gov.scot/visit/forest-parks/galloway-forest-park/dark-skies\" title=\"\">Galloway international dark sky park</a>, night has substance.</p> <p>Down towards the bay, one illuminated rectangle of slow activity: a man in overalls checking progress in the lambing barn. A tableau vivant of spring. Tarmac gives way to gravel track, and the crunch of my footsteps seems incongruously loud, so I stop: to listen to the trickle of water in the ditch, to notice the silhouettes of trees flute upwards and catch this huge moon in their branches.</p> <p>I look through an opening in the black tangle of a hedge to some white, slight movement in a field. Shape-shifting, a suggestion of a lamb resolves into three actual lambs, soon merging into an expression of lambs-with-mother and their collective shadow. An explosion of pheasant to my left startles unseen hoof thud, which now waits silent, surely watching for my next move. The trees stand steady as they have always done. I look back to my right. The sheep have vanished but somehow their shadow remains: a patch of darkness, disembodied.</p> <p>I continue on, stepping lightly around the shore track and into the other side of the woods. I soon hear the heron chicks click-clicking in their nests, high in a stand of spruce. Since discovering the heronry, I have been coming to check their progress several times a week. Now I have evidence, if I needed it, that their cacophony is incessant. Soon they will fledge and I will no doubt miss the constancy of their chattering, which has been an anchor in these strange times.</p> <p>\u2022<em> The third of 2020\u2019s six supermoons</em> <em>will be on Thursday 7 May</em></p>"
