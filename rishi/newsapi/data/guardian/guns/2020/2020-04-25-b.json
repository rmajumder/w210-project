  "<p>China has been accused of using the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to take some bold and provocative actions, including expansions in the South China Sea, crackdowns on activists in Hong Kong and further detention of activists in the mainland. Some analysts have suggested Beijing is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-security/china-rattles-sabres-as-world-battles-coronavirus-pandemic-idUSKBN2230GC\">sending a message that China\u2019s aggressive foreign policy is still business as usual</a>, or <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2020/04/same-as-it-ever-was-chinas-pandemic-opportunism-on-its-periphery/\">testing its adversaries for weaknesses</a>.</p> <h2>Rounding up activists</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong+protest\">frequent protests</a> that have rocked Hong Kong for months were already in a lull when the outbreak started, but amid fears of an epidemic in Hong Kong they have almost completely stopped. The Chinese government and its supportive Hong Kong counterparts are taking advantage of the break to try ensure they don\u2019t start up again.</p> <p>More than 7,000 people have been arrested on charges relating to the protest rallies, some of which drew millions to the street, but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-arrested-on-charges-of-illegal-assembly\">arrests of senior figures in February</a> and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/police-in-hong-kong-arrest-14-activists-amid-autonomy-warnings\">again on Saturday</a> have drawn sharp rebuke. </p> <p>Martin Lee, the 81-year-old founder of Hong Kong\u2019s Democratic party, has said there will be more fatalities and protests if authorities try to pass anti-subversion laws \u2013 which would outlaw \u201csedition, subversion and the theft of state secrets\u201d \u2013 before the September legislature election. \u201cThe Communist party won\u2019t show any mercy\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/fresh-hong-kong-crackdown-will-result-in-deaths-says-democracy-leader-martin-lee\">he told the Guardian</a>. \u201cThey have already stated their stance.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/hong-kong-using-covid-19-crisis-as-golden-opportunity-for-crackdown-says-arrested-leader\">Veteran activist and politician Lee Cheuk Yan,</a> who was arrested in both roundups, said: \u201cThey are using this opportunity of the pandemic so we can\u2019t come out in the marches.\u201d</p> <p>The arrests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/us-and-uk-condemn-arrest-of-hong-kong-democracy-activists\">drew condemnation from around the world</a>, and China director at Human Rights Watch, Sophie Richardson, said the arrests of the 15 activists were \u201canother nail in the coffin of \u2018one country two systems\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>Authorities maintained the action was about the rule of law, creating a deterrence, and securing the city before the protests started up again.</p> <h2>\u201cNon-release releases\u201d</h2> <p>After four-and-a-half years in prison for \u201csubversion\u201d, human rights lawyer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/china-quarantines-human-rights-lawyer-wang-quanzhang-400km-from-home\">Wang Quanzhang was released from a Chinese prison two weeks ago</a>. But he was immediately sent to compulsory quarantine in his home town of Jinan, not in Beijing where he lives with his wife and son.</p> <p>The US state department and human rights groups have called for Wang, jailed after the 2015 roundup of more than 300 human rights lawyers and legal associates, to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/us-urges-china-to-let-human-rights-lawyer-return-home-after-unjust-detention\">released from \u201cunjust detention\u201d</a> and allowed to return home.</p> <p>Poet and activist Li Bifeng was <a href=\"https://www.nchrd.org/2011/01/prisoner-of-conscience-li-bifeng/\">released on 7 April</a> after serving a 10-year sentence but forced into \u201cquarantine\u201d in a guesthouse in Sichuan province. Authorities refused to disclose his location to his family.</p> <p>The practice of \u201cnon-release releases\u201d of dissidents has been criticised by rights groups.</p> <h2>Further detentions</h2> <p>Police detained film maker and poet Chen Jiaping in early March, according to his wife. Chen had been making a documentary about legal scholar and activist Xu Zhiyong, who went missing in February and is believed to be held by police under a secretive detention system known as residential surveillance at a designated location.</p> <p>Zhao Huaiguo, the pastor of an underground house church in Hunan was detained on 14 March on charges of \u201cinciting subversion\u201d. Consumer rights activist Wang Qing, known for using China\u2019s open government information system to hold officials accountable, was charged alongside three other men for extortion and blackmail last year. In April, he was denied an appeal on his case.</p> <p>Three citizen journalists disappeared in Wuhan after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/li-zehuajournalist-wouldnt-stay-quiet-covid-19-coronavirus\">reporting on the outbreak</a>, Chen Qiushi, Fang Bin and Li Zehua. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/missing-wuhan-citizen-journalist-reappears-after-two-months\">Li resurfaced in the past week</a> with a video detailing his detention by police and forced quarantine.</p> <p>Numerous activists and lawyers remain in jail, despite international calls for their release. Veteran activist and founder of a human rights website, 64 Tianwang, Huang Qi was detained in November 2016, on suspicion of \u201cillegally leaking state secrets abroad.\u201d Last year he was jailed on a 12-year sentence.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch said authorities have refused requests from his lawyers for documents, and disbarred two of them. Sichuan police have also harassed his mother, a woman in her eighties, including placing her under house arrest and sending government agents to live in her home, HRW said.</p> <p>\u201cWhile everyone\u2019s attention is on Covid-19, we should not let the Chinese government off the hook for their ongoing crackdown on human rights activists, lawyers and independent journalists,\u201d said Human Rights Watch China researcher, Yaqiu Wang.</p> <h2>One country, one system</h2> <p>While Hong Kong is supposed to enjoy semi-autonomy until 2047 before it is returned to Chinese rule, the past week has seen some suggest China is trying to bring that deadline forward.</p> <p>Last week Beijing\u2019s top organisations in the region, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) and the liaison office, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/police-in-hong-kong-arrest-14-activists-amid-autonomy-warnings\">weighed into domestic political arguments</a>, criticising pro-democracy legislators over filibustering tactics and creating a backlog of legislation.</p> <p>The office was accused of overreach and intruding into Hong Kong affairs in contravention of Hong Kong\u2019s mini constitution, the Basic Law, which guarantees non-interference.</p> <p>Beijing authorities claimed the protections in the Basic Law article didn\u2019t apply to them, and that the Central government exercised \u201cfull governance\u201d over Hong Kong.</p> <p>It came as the head of China\u2019s liaison office in Hong Kong, Luo Huining, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/china-official-hong-kong-luo-huining-pushes-national-security-law\">called for long-shelved national security legislation to be introduced</a> as soon as possible to safeguard against threats to national security, like the protests.</p> <h2>South China Sea</h2> <p>The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has accused China of exploiting the world\u2019s focus on the virus with \u201cprovocative behaviour\u201d, including <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-security-malaysia/australia-joins-u-s-ships-in-south-china-sea-amid-rising-tension-idUSKCN2240FS\">advancing its presence in the South China Sea.</a></p> <p>China claims ownership of much of the South China Sea, but this is disputed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan and Malaysia.</p> <p>State broadcaster CGTN<strong> </strong>said on Saturday that China had established administrative districts on the Paracel islands and Spratly islands, the site of overlapping ownership claims.</p> <p>Zhang Junshe, a senior research fellow at the People\u2019s Liberation Army naval military studies research institute, told China\u2019s Global Times the new districts would \u201cfulfil the responsibility of safeguarding our national sovereignty\u201d and \u201cbring convenience to residents on the islands and fishermen\u2019s lives\u201d.</p> <p>Vietnam\u2019s foreign ministry quickly accused China of having \u201cseriously violated its sovereignty\u201d, demanding it \u201cabolish its wrongful decisions\u201d.</p> <p>Last week a Chinese survey ship was seen tagging a Malaysian state oil company drillship, just north of Malaysia\u2019s exclusive economic zone, in disputed waters claimed by Vietnam and Malaysia.</p> <p>It also drew criticism from the US, but the Chinese foreign ministry accused US officials of smearing Beijing and said the vessel was conducting normal activities.</p> <p>US and Australian warships also arrived in the region this week.</p> <p>Vietnam also lodged a formal protest after a Chinese military ship rammed and sank a Vietnamese fishing vessel off the coast of the Paracels, in the second such confrontation in a year.</p> <h2>Buzzing Taiwan</h2> <p>China has also been <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3075526/taipei-says-chinese-military-aircraft-flew-night-exercise\">flying regular fighter patrols near Taiwan</a>, which China claims is part of its territory despite having not governed the island in modern times. In mid-March the People\u2019s Liberation Army sent warplanes across the median line of the Taiwan Strait, and briefly approached Taiwan. The move, which analysts said was at least partly to intimidate Taiwan, prompted Taiwan to scramble fighter planes to intercept.</p> <p>China is also <a href=\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/04/13/china-sends-aircraft-carrier-near-japan-taiwan-us-navy-struggles-coronavirus.html\">sending military flotillas</a> past Taiwan and Japan on a semi-regular basis. Last week a six-vessel strike group led by China\u2019s only aircraft carrier sailed through the Miyako Strait and past Taiwan, under watch by the Taiwanese and Japanese defence forces.</p> <p>In January, a military flotilla, again led by the aircraft carrier, passed through the straits of Taiwan. It didn\u2019t enter Taiwan\u2019s waters, but did cross its air defence identification zone.</p> <h2>Investing in India</h2> <p>Several countries <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-india-investments/india-toughens-rules-on-investments-from-neighbours-seen-aimed-at-china-idUSKBN2200LQ\">including India and Australia</a> have introduced new laws or regulations covering foreign investments amid concerns about Chinese acquisitions while nations and companies struggle during the pandemic.</p> <p>This month the People\u2019s Bank of China bought shares in HDFC, India\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, eventually obtaining more than 1%.</p> <p>Under the new laws in India, anyone from a country sharing a border with India needs government approval before any kind of investment, local media reported. While this included many nations, it has been seen as geared towards China, since it includes Hong Kong.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 April 2020. An earlier version said that China had never governed Taiwan. This has been corrected to say that it has not governed the island in modern times.</p>",
  "<p>After more than a month of near-daily White House coronavirus press briefings, Donald Trump stayed behind closed doors on Saturday after advisers reportedly warned the president that his appearances were hurting his campaign.</p> \n<p>Trump himself referenced his absence when he wrote on Twitter that the briefings are \u201cnot worth the time &amp; effort\u201d.

Not worth the time &amp; effort!\u201d</p> \n<p>In recent weeks Trump has used the briefings to dole out unproven and debunked medical advice, suggesting that things like sunlight and an anti-malaria drug are cures to Covid-19, often causing his own medical experts to try to correct the record.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/donald-trump-coronavirus-disinfectant-sarcastic-tipping-point\">Debacle of Trump's coronavirus disinfectant comments could be tipping point</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But on Friday Trump surprised observers by taking no questions and stalking out of the room after an unusually short briefing of just 22 minutes. Some took the move as an acknowledgement from Trump himself that he may have taken things too far when he said on Thursday that disinfectant could be used to cure Covid-19.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ad6c83b5-067f-4fb6-983e-2764c3175db2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BalDN6iGYpE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Those comments sparked shock and ridicule \u2013 and warnings from healthcare experts \u2013 and prompted Trump to make a ham-fisted attempt at a clawback when he later said he had made the remarks sarcastically \u2013 despite video proving he had not.</p> \n<p>While the press briefings are meant to give members of the coronavirus task force an opportunity to provide updates on the state of Covid-19 in the country, the attention around the briefings has been centered on Trump\u2019s use of the podium as his bully pulpit.</p> \n<p>The president has used the briefings as uncensored airtime, praising his administration for its response to the crisis while criticizing the media and Democrats for any negative comeback.</p> \n<p>Advisers close to the president told him to stop making appearances at the briefings unless special announcements needed to be made, according to multiple reports published Saturday morning. The advice comes as Trump trails Joe Biden in polls from swing states.

  "<p>When the publisher Martin Hughes talks about the moment five weeks ago when the coronavirus crisis first hit Australia full throttle, he talks about panic. \u201cPanic in the community, the business community and the publishing community. Everyone was looking for plan B.\u201d</p> <p>The CEO of Affirm Press, Hughes was about to oversee the release of two big titles when the shutdowns started \u2013 Pip Williams\u2019 escapist historical drama, The Dictionary of Lost Words, and forthcoming thriller The Safe Place by Anna Downes. Rights had been sold internationally for both debut novels, and staff had been working on the publicity campaigns since January. The dilemma: \u201cThese are big books, it\u2019s really important for our business that these go well; do we move them [back] now that certain parts of the infrastructure are crumbling?\u201d</p> <p>The kinds of calculations that Hughes and his team made five weeks ago have been happening in publishing houses around the country as the coronavirus crisis and shutdown measures to control it take a massive bite out of the arts sector.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/23/malcolm-turnbull-memoir-new-book-a-bigger-picture-bestseller-after-launch\">Malcolm Turnbull's book A Bigger Picture 'a bestseller' days after launch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other publishers were postponing their releases, in some cases for 12 or 18 months. Trent Dalton\u2019s follow-up to his bestselling Boy Swallows Universe has been held by HarperCollins until September; novelist Kathryn Heyman announced last week that her forthcoming memoir has been postponed by Allen &amp; Unwin until 2021. Hughes and his team, however, foresaw a frenzy of delayed big-name titles all coming out at once. They felt that releasing books in that competitive landscape would hurt more than it helped.</p> <p>\u201cWe decided we\u2019d stick with plan A,\u201d Hughes tells Guardian Australia.</p> <p>There were early signs that the enforced stay-at-home measures were having a positive effect on book sales. Nielsen Book Australia reported industry revenue for the week ending 28 March \u2013 the first of widespread shutdowns \u2013 was up 15% on the same time last year. But it has since <a href=\"https://www.asauthors.org/news/sales-data-for-authors-applying-for-jobkeeper\">reported</a> a \u201csharp decline\u201d in the following weeks, and Bianca Whiteley from Nielsen told Guardian Australia that the Australian book market had recorded a 7.1% decline in value sales in 2020 so far, though unit sales were up slightly, at 1.5%. Children\u2019s books and adult fiction were strongest, while trade nonfiction has continued to slow.</p> <p>The reasons for the decline are multifaceted: the books industry relies on an ecosystem of bookstores, festivals, events and media interest to shift copies. Many bookstores have shut their physical premises since the lockdowns started, airports are closed, festivals cancelled. Manufacturing and supply have also been affected \u2013 early on in the crisis, shutdowns in China caused printing delays; more recently, increased burdens on freight and logistics networks are affecting stock management and distribution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edf0398dfebd9d9570c1c8d25e8e43bbc6f5bd33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edf0398dfebd9d9570c1c8d25e8e43bbc6f5bd33/0_0_3500_1576/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some bookstores in Australia have started up free local bicycle delivery services during the lockdowns\" width=\"1000\" height=\"450\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some bookstores in Australia have started up free local bicycle delivery services during the lockdowns.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cordelia Hsu/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many publishing houses have responded to the market shocks by reducing salaries and cutting staff. Thames and Hudson, Allen &amp; Unwin and Hardie Grant have cut salaries locally by up to 25%, with the latter also making seven of its 200 staff redundant. Melbourne-based small press Scribe issued redundancies to two of its 27 staff, an editor and a publicist \u2013 the first time the publishing house has made anyone redundant in its 44-year history.</p> <p>Affirm is in the unusual position of having neither laid off staff nor reduced hours. It doesn\u2019t rely on deals with bigger publishing houses to sell to retailers, so it has that advantage over similarly sized companies who are at the mercy of their larger competitors. Nevertheless, uncertainty is still rippling through the industry. Hughes says his own staff\u2019s fears were quelled somewhat by the fact that he was upfront with them about the company\u2019s contingency plans: \u201c[We told them that] if we had to reduce overheads in a hurry \u2026 we would all go down to 80% of our salary if needed, but that any pain that had to be felt would be felt evenly across the team.\u201d</p> <p>Likely also helping morale is the fact that The Dictionary of Lost Words has been one of the fastest selling books this month. It\u2019s no prime ministerial memoir \u2013 Hardie Grant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/23/malcolm-turnbull-memoir-new-book-a-bigger-picture-bestseller-after-launch\">reported on Friday</a> that Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s A Bigger Picture has sold more than 50,000 copies in four days \u2013 but it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/16/all-words-are-not-equal-the-debut-novelist-whos-become-a-lockdown-sensation\">a solid showing for debut fiction</a>, especially with so many curtailed publicity avenues.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4c47f222defefb5432c7795b8caf5dbea11b3961\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c47f222defefb5432c7795b8caf5dbea11b3961/0_0_1664_2500/667.jpg\" alt=\"Australian author James Bradley\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australian author James Bradley, whose novels include Wrack, The Resurrectionist, Clade and the forthcoming Ghost Species.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>James Bradley, whose seventh novel, Ghost Species, is out on 27 April, describes the usual book tour for an Australian author with a new release: \u201cYou\u2019d go to several capital cities, you\u2019d do some events, you\u2019d do a lot of radio, and you\u2019d probably visit a number of bookshops,\u201d he says. That would be followed by a run of interstate appearances, usually in the form of panels or keynote addresses over the autumn and winter festival season.</p> <p>While sales yields from festival appearances can vary, the direct income to a writer from the event fee is often more important \u2013 something Bradley says has become more apparent in the decades since 1997, when he published his first book. \u201cAs the book trade has changed, I think authors tend to make more of their money from those ancillary events and appearances than they did when I was first writing.\u201d</p> <p>Bookstore visits and signings also make a noticeable difference to sales, and the curatorial aspect of a physical store, geared towards browsing \u2013 tables of new releases, posters, staff picks and so on \u2013 are difficult to replicate online.</p> <p>Still, some literary organisations have tried to adapt to the new world. The Sydney Writers\u2019 festival has started to schedule online panels; the Wheeler Centre collaborated with the Stella prize to stream the prize ceremony via YouTube; the prestigious Vogel award for an unpublished manuscript followed suit; and smaller festivals like the Emerging Writers festival have been running digital supplementary programs for years.</p> <p>The Melbourne Writers festival, which was not scheduled to take place until August, announced in mid-April that it would be putting forward \u201ca smaller online program to keep literary arts audiences connected\u201d. A festival spokesperson told Guardian Australia that while it was too early to put a number on events, they were planning the digital program to run across the previously announced dates of 7-16 August.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At the moment I think it is difficult to have a conversation about anything other than coronavirus</p> <footer> <cite>James Bradley, author</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>MWF\u2019s early forecasts are not promising for those hoping to see digital events become sustainable through ticket sales: the festival is \u201cexploring opportunities for ticketing a digital program\u201d but expects revenue to drop by a third as a consequence of being unable to run in-person events \u2013 an amount roughly equivalent to its income from ticket sales. They say the organisation will rely on philanthropy and sponsorship to tide it over.</p> <p>New outfits are popping up, too. The Pulitzer-prize winner Andrew Sean Greer, Irish novelist Colum McCann and musician Amanda Palmer will headline a new online-only, rolling writers festival, <a href=\"https://www.together-remotely.com/\">Together Remotely</a>, created and curated by the former SWF director and Stella prize shortlistee, Caro Llewellyn. Llewellyn says she launched into action after 10 days in lockdown, \u201cwatching in despair as cultural programs and gatherings, literary launches and events were falling over like dominoes\u201d.</p> <p>There remains, however, the ever-present challenge of getting audiences to pay attention.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/21/the-world-my-book-is-published-into-looks-very-different-from-the-world-i-started-writing-in\">The world my book is published into looks very different from the world I started writing in | Ronnie Scott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bradley feels lucky that the themes of his book \u2013 the ethics of our schemes to fix a world falling apart from environmental crisis \u2013 resonate with the coronavirus crisis, but he acknowledges that many writers may be facing a profound sense of irrelevancy.</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment I think it is difficult to have a conversation about anything other than coronavirus, and I think that does make promoting a book which is about other things more difficult.\u201d</p> <p>He says most of his worries are reserved for the sector in the medium to long term. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened is a huge shock, which means that everything marginal collapses \u2013 and the problem is the entire publishing and arts sector is marginal.\u201d What little government support there is has come too little, too late: \u201cThey starved the arts sector for 20 years and now we\u2019re just not in any position to survive.\u201d</p> <p>Hughes, meanwhile, is more optimistic about the industry\u2019s capacity to rally. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pulling together really well,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think there\u2019ll always be a soft spot for people whose debuts, in particular, were affected by the coronavirus crisis.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><strong>Essential equipment:</strong> guide (book, app, website, or household member) to help identify birds, sense of humour.</p> <p><strong>Non-essential equipment:</strong> binoculars, notebook, sense of adventure.</p> <p><strong>How to do it: </strong>you just watch birds.</p> <p>Bird-watching is for everyone, whether you\u2019re on your own or with your significant other, family or friends. Neither special skills nor fancy equipment are required. There\u2019s no need to have a degree in ornithology. And you certainly don\u2019t have to dress up in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghillie_suit\">ghillie suit</a> and tote a Swarovski spotting scope. I mean, you can if you want, but it\u2019s not necessary. Especially if you\u2019re watching birds through your kitchen window while doing the washing up.</p> <p>In fact, you don\u2019t even have to watch them. Listening to birds and learning to identify them by their songs is an excellent way of getting to know the species around your home. </p> <h2>I can see a bird. What is it?</h2> <p>Identifying birds is a matter of experience.</p> <p>Some species are so distinct \u2014 brush turkeys, galahs, the rainbow lorikeet at the top of this page, for example \u2014 that it\u2019s a doddle to put a name to them. Others take a more effort.</p> <p>You might have to spend time leafing through the bird guide, so take a photo or make notes in case the bird flies off before you\u2019ve identified it. Some of the key features are the bird\u2019s size, colour, pattern, and beak shape. Focus your attention on these.</p> <p>Taking notes will also help you with LBBs (little brown birds), those small nondescript bundles that all look the same. You will get a great deal of satisfaction when you manage to identify one. This feeling will be immediately replaced by uncertainty. By then, the bird will have disappeared, so you will never know if you were correct. Note: some LBBs are actually grey.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01c15d2ce89277f113c65eaaab454e311f28863b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01c15d2ce89277f113c65eaaab454e311f28863b/0_1449_2666_2094/1000.jpg\" alt=\"White Throated Tree Creeper (Cormobates leucophaea) eating on the side of a tree\" width=\"1000\" height=\"785\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A notorious LBB (little brown bird), the white throated tree creeper.

You can get a head start by going to <a href=\"https://ebird.org/home\">eBird</a> to find which species have been recorded from your area. Local birding societies might also have websites with similar information. For bird calls, check out <a href=\"https://www.xeno-canto.org/\">xeno-canto</a>, which is a citizen science project sharing recordings from across the world.</p> <h2>I need to write down names or I\u2019ll forget them</h2> <p>A lot of bird-watchers make a list of which species they\u2019ve seen, where they\u2019ve seen them and when. If you do keep a list, there are as many ways of doing it as there are bird-watchers. We\u2019re an idiosyncratic bunch.</p> <p>I have two: my Australian life list and my world life list (a life list is a compilation of all the species you\u2019ve seen). I only add species I saw well enough that I could identify them again, and because I\u2019m a very mediocre bird-watcher, my list covers only about 75% of the species that I\u2019ve laid eyes on. Quite a lot of my time is spent asking \u201cwhat was that?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s handy to have a list, but if it\u2019s not your thing, don\u2019t worry about it. Nothing about backyard birding is compulsory.</p> <h2>They won\u2019t sit still</h2> <p>Some species are absolutely brazen, but others take off at the slightest movement. How do you get a good enough view to identify them?</p> <p>Bird hides, that\u2019s how.</p> <p>A hide is a structure that conceals you from the birds. Houses, as it turns out, are really good hides. As are cars. Garden birds will ignore you, as long as you don\u2019t move too quickly or attract notice through flashes of light reflecting from watches, spectacles, and other hard surfaces.</p> <p>But if you\u2019ve got a large garden, you might like to try a real hide. You can buy a fancy portable one, but you can also make your own. I\u2019ve seen a delivery box for a refrigerator used as a bird hide. You don\u2019t even have to paint the cardboard; birds have no interest in brand names or whether you\u2019re adhering to instructions about \u201cthis side up\u201d. All you need to do is cut a door in the back of the box for entry and exit, and a slot in the front for viewing, grab a camping stool for comfort, and you\u2019ve got yourself an effective, if slightly claustrophobic, hide. Just don\u2019t leave it out in the rain.</p> <h2>But there are no birds in my garden</h2> <p>No problem! Virtual birding is a thing. Across the world, trail cameras have been set up at bird baths and feeding stations. Cornell University\u2019s ornithology lab has <a href=\"https://www.allaboutbirds.org/cams/\">cameras in a range of birding locations</a>, including Panama, Bermuda and the USA. The <a href=\"https://www.audubon.org/birdcams\">Audubon Society </a>links to a variety of bird cams across the Americas. A web search will offer access to a bird cams in backyards and national parks all over the world. You might even set up a trail camera to record the avian activities in your own garden.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9271e838b1c6c93d9a67b65a8acd5c3bfc1a847\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9271e838b1c6c93d9a67b65a8acd5c3bfc1a847/105_0_3150_1890/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ospreys captured by a bird cam set up by Cornell University\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ospreys captured by a bird cam set up by Cornell University</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cornell Lab Bird Cams</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Okay, I think I\u2019ll give it a go</h2> <p>There\u2019s no right or wrong way to watch birds.

government needs 40% of the population to agree to use the app in order for it to be effective, and he will need to win over some of the last category in order to meet that target.</p> \n<p>The problem he faces is that the government\u2019s history in this area is littered with tech fails, data breaches and misuse of personal data.</p> \n<p>Less than two months ago, senior bureaucrats were being accused by the deputy chair of the parliament\u2019s national security committee, Labor MP Anthony Byrne, of having a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/28/australian-government-officials-accused-of-cavalier-disregard-for-unauthorised-metadata-access\">\u201ccavalier disregard\u201d</a> for the handling of Australians\u2019 personal data.</p> \n<p>When the parliament passed mandatory data retention legislation in 2015 (which requires internet companies to hold much more personal data than would be held by the app for two years), promises were made that only 21 agencies, including law enforcement, would be able to access the data without a warrant.</p> \n<p>Then the internet companies began reporting councils and 87 other agencies that should not have access to the data were still accessing it, over 8,000 times in the 2018-19 financial year.</p> \n<p>Law enforcement were supposed to get special warrants if needing to access a journalist\u2019s metadata, but the AFP failed to do that in one instance.</p> \n<p>Some agencies were getting sent the history of websites people had been visiting, despite the government ruling that out five years ago.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\"

They met in 1983 as student nurses studying in Canberra. He was 20 and, as a second year nursing student, he was sent to meet the incoming first year students. He caught sight of the then 21-year-old Margaret. \u201cI can remember thinking, \u2018Oh, hello, I like the look of you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>They quickly became close friends, frequently spending time together. One night, she invited him along to a friend\u2019s dinner party, purportedly to make up the numbers. Harry remembers the night vividly: \u201cIt was cold and it was dark and I can remember thinking to myself, \u2018I\u2019m going to marry this girl\u2019.\u201d He says he just knew: \u201cIt just felt so comfortable that I knew this would be the person I\u2019d spend the rest of my life with. Margaret agrees: \u201c[It was like] putting the key in the lock and it fits and you turn the key and your life was on the other side of the door.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f474b1fcc52cef7940a45cae854563d295cb5e25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f474b1fcc52cef7940a45cae854563d295cb5e25/0_0_558_372/500.jpg\" alt=\"Harry and Margaret Burkett after their engagement 1983\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry and Margaret were engaged eight days after their first official date.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harry and Margaret Burkett</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That night, they shared their first kiss \u2013 and eight days later, they got engaged. \u201cI was taking Margaret to the bus in the city and she said to me, \u2018If someone were to ask me to marry them right now, I would say yes.\u2019 So I did. I said, \u2018Will you marry me?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Yes\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>They were married a year later. \u201cWhen we look back on it, we were mad,\u201d says Margaret, \u201cand everyone else said we were mad, but back then we thought we were king and queen.\u201d They find it difficult to articulate how they knew that they were well suited, particularly as they were from different backgrounds. But they do share similar values and interests. \u201cJust simple things,\u201d says Margaret, \u201cbut if you pare your life back to what\u2019s important, I think that\u2019s where we have a lot of similarities [like] the way we communicate with each other. We don\u2019t always agree but we have this open pathway for being able to thrash things out if something\u2019s bothering us.\u201d</p> <p>As nurses, they both did shift work. When their children came along a few years into the marriage, they had to work opposite shifts to share the child caring duties. They became, in Margaret\u2019s words, like ships passing in the night.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/19/how-we-stay-together-i-still-think-hes-the-most-beautiful-man-in-the-world\">How we stay together: 'I still think he\u2019s the most beautiful man in the world'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So they borrowed an idea from the hospital: they had a communication book to help them parent. Just as nurses write notes about patients for those who come after them, Harry and Margaret would write notes in the book for each other. Small things like whether the kids had been fed or whether there was washing to be hung out. There were love notes too. \u201cEvery so often, you\u2019d have your sandwich and there\u2019d be a little note there from Margaret saying, \u2018Miss you. Hope you have a good day\u2019,\u201d says Harry.</p> <p>There was an equal division of the domestic chores and so, in some ways, it was almost like they were single parents. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of weird to say that,\u201d says Margaret, \u201cbut we didn\u2019t have regular time off together, so the one that was not working that particular day would do all the chores and get the kids organised and then the other one would do the same on their days off.\u201d There was a curious side-effect to the arrangement: \u201cIt was like absence makes the heart grow fonder.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75fd7e3effa210b5d7f83a0ba9b768cbbd0a8d52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75fd7e3effa210b5d7f83a0ba9b768cbbd0a8d52/26_17_721_512/500.jpg\" alt=\"Harry and Margaret Burkett in 1994\" width=\"500\" height=\"355\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry and Margaret Burkett in 1994.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harry and Margaret Burkett</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because they were doing the same job, they each understood what the other was going through, particularly in more traumatic situations. \u201cI remember once very clearly resuscitating an eight-week-old baby,\u201d says Harry. \u201cIt was a cot death, and I can remember doing that when I was working in emergency when our son was eight weeks old. So I didn\u2019t sleep terribly well after that for quite a few weeks. Margaret got that. She understood the time it takes to work through that, so we were able to give each other the space instead of [saying], \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re still going on about that\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Margaret also remembers when she was suffering from traumatic stress but didn\u2019t recognise it \u2013 although Harry did. After a few months, he suggested that she should get help. \u201cThat was a wake-up call. At that point, I said, \u2018Oh, what have I been like? What do you think is going on?\u2019 And we\u2019d start a conversation based on a gentle alert, I suppose, that things aren\u2019t quite right.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/12/how-we-stay-together-we-cared-about-the-consequences-of-our-own-actions\">How we stay together: 'We cared about the consequences of our own actions'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Situations like that helped to remind them that they had to work through things in their own way, as individuals. \u201cThere\u2019s no one way of doing things \u2026 we\u2019re gentle with each other, we are respectful of each other\u2019s needs, we are constantly reevaluating who we are and where we are,\u201d says Harry. \u201cAnd just because we\u2019ve been together that length of time, we have changed so much \u2026 but allowed each other to change.\u201d</p> <p>There have been strained times too. After Harry had a severe injury and then retrained to be a teacher, Margaret carried the load financially and domestically. It wasn\u2019t easy: \u201cSometimes I\u2019d mutter under my breath as I was cleaning the shower, \u2018Oh dear, I just can\u2019t keep doing this,\u2019\u201d she says.</p> <p>But they navigated it by putting one foot in front of the other and at times seeking outside help through counselling. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been alive to what opportunities there are for maintaining good physical, mental and emotional health,\u201d says Margaret. \u201c[Some] people say, \u2018Well, this is who I am, take it or leave it.\u2019 I think a lot of people can feel like that: \u2018I don\u2019t want to self-reflect so if you don\u2019t like it, bugger off\u2019. We\u2019ve never been like that, we\u2019ve always been open to what it is about ourselves that needs attention.\u201d</p> <p>In the tough times, it helped to remind themselves of their commitment to each other, says Harry. \u201cWe knew that there was nobody else, there was just us. And right at the beginning when we decided to get married, we thought that we\u2019re in it for the long haul.\u201d It was what they wanted. \u201cAnything that you really want, you have to work for, and so we just worked hard. Our first priority was to each other. It wasn\u2019t to the job and it wasn\u2019t even to the kids because we recognised that looking after each other, everything else would fall into place.\u201d They\u2019ve maintained this throughout their marriage: \u201cI\u2019d come home from work, Margaret had been home with the kids, and we\u2019d go to time out. We\u2019d say to the kids, \u2018We\u2019re in time out.

They\u2019ve become more patient and forgiving. They\u2019ve also learned what happiness means to them. \u201cIt\u2019s not that heady rush of excitement and the anticipation of something good is going to happen,\u201d says Margaret. \u201cYes that\u2019s part of it, but it\u2019s really more about that deep-seated contentment. You don\u2019t have to be sitting at 10 all the time to be happy.\u201d</p> <p>Caring for each other has always been part of the success of their relationship but the greatest lesson they\u2019ve learned is a simple one. \u201cTo talk,\u201d says Harry. \u201cCheck in with each other every day. [Ask] are you all right? Anything I can do? Would you like a cup of tea?\u201d</p> <p>When asked what commitment means to them, Harry paraphrases the Apache Wedding Prayer. \u201c[It\u2019s] basically, now that you\u2019re married, you will need no shelter because you\u2019ll be a shelter to each other; you\u2019ll need no warmth because you\u2019ll be warmth for each other,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s that concept of being there unconditionally for the other person all the time. I\u2019m not religious but I made a promise to Margaret that I would give myself wholly to her and I think that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done and that\u2019s what she\u2019s done to me as well. That\u2019s the thing that certainly sustained me in good times and in rough times \u2013 that you\u2019re always my shelter, you\u2019re always there, and it\u2019s a safe place to be.\u201d</p> <p>Margaret agrees before adding, with a wry laugh: \u201cI can\u2019t be bothered to train anybody else.

The maternity ward will be reopened next, with a date not yet confirmed. Patients in the two hospitals were transferred to the Mersey Community hospital. Most new patients requiring admission are in the meantime being sent to Launceston hospital or, if they need high-level care, Hobart. But it takes more than 1.5 hours to drive from Burnie, where the north-west hospitals are located, to Launceston, and almost four hours to drive to Hobart.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How did it get out of control in the first place and what procedures should have been in place that weren\u2019t?</p> <footer> <cite>Jacqui Lambie</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cMassive distances are now being covered by ambulance,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cThere is also a major problem with ambulance resourcing.

What happened between the Ruby Princess passenger becoming sick and being in hospital?\u201d Lambie said people in the region of Burnie were particularly vulnerable to the virus, with a large elderly population and people in poor health.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a fairly high unemployment rate, we have fourth-generation welfare recipients, and we know people on welfare often don\u2019t have the best health outcomes,\u201d Lambie said. \u201cWe are among the oldest, poorest and sickest in the country.\u201d</p> <p>Infection control procedures will be examined as part of the public health investigation into how the virus took hold. Golden staph infections acquired in hospitals are one of the indicators health departments use to examine how strong a hospital\u2019s infection control procedures are.

The North-West Regional hospital has the lowest rate in the state.</p> <h2>Questions over spread</h2> <p>However, there have been serious concerns raised about how some hospitals have handled aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic. In late March, a unit manager from Launceston general hospital told staff in an email to \u201ccollect all used, undamaged and unsoiled P2 masks\u201d so the masks could be investigated for reuse. But P2 masks are recommended for single use only.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until Sunday, almost three weeks later, that the Tasmanian health service issued a notice to all staff clarifying the masks were being collected as part of a trial to see if they could be successfully decontaminated, but were not to be reused, and that there was sufficient mask stock.</p> <p>Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation Tasmanian branch secretary, Emily Shepherd, said \u201cit does appear there was a miscommunication in terms of the rationale for collecting the masks\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s now been very firmly clarified,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/apr/23/australian-job-loss-tracker-employment-unemployment-numbers-industries-places-most-affected-coronavirus-crisis\">Australian job loss tracker: the industries and places most affected by the coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Jacobson, from the health services union, is sceptical. \u201cWe raised the issue weeks ago and it\u2019s only after media attention the email went out clarifying what the masks were to be collected for, so that makes me suspicious and cynical,\u201d he said. \u201cAgain, there has been a lack of clarity.\u201d</p> <p>Shepherd and Jacobson both say doctors, nurses, paramedics and other health staff have been through a traumatic time.

  "<p>The Club World Cup has never stimulated universal enthusiasm. \u201cThe whole case goes to show how undesirable such events are from a sporting point of view, and what a prostitution of titles they are,\u201d raged the <em>Edinburgh Evening News</em>, but that was 1895 and it wasn\u2019t talking about the soft-power festival of greed that, in the distant days before the virus, was supposed to be taking place in China in the summer of 2021.</p> <p>Rather it was talking about the first meeting of league winners of England and Scotland, of the match played 125 years ago on Monday, in which Sunderland became world champions.</p> <p>There had been two \u201cworld championships\u201d before but they, in theory at least, pitted cup winners against each other. As it turned out, in 1887, England\u2019s representatives were Preston North End, who had gone out in the FA Cup semi-final. They lost, 2-1, to Hibernian (although the Cup winners, Aston Villa, did beat Hibs 3-0 in a friendly).</p> <p>The title stayed in Scotland as Renton hammered West Brom the following year. And there it remained, uncontested, until in 1895 Hearts, flush with their first league success, invited Sunderland, who had just won a third English title in four years, to dispute the world crown.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/apr/04/the-english-game-netflix\">The English Game's few charms lie in the background, not centre stage | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hearts\u2019 success owed much to two new signings, the full-back pairing of James Mirk and Barney Battles, who implemented an offside trap so effective that Hearts conceded eight goals in 18 league matches that season, eight fewer than anybody else.</p> <p>Sunderland, meanwhile, were an aggressive, attacking side, one that had dominated English football since beating Aston Villa 7-2 in a friendly in 1890. That game had led the Villa chairman, William McGregor, to describe Sunderland as a team with a \u201ctalented man in every position\u201d and the \u201cTeam of All Talents\u201d duly became the first club from outside the north-west and Midlands to be admitted to the league later that year.</p> <p>If their remoteness \u2013 Burnley, 110 miles away, were their nearest rivals \u2013 hampered them on away trips, Sunderland reaped the benefits at home, losing three games at their Newcastle Road ground in their first six seasons in the league \u2013 and two of those in their first season. But even more crucially, they were situated a lot closer to Scotland than any other league club.</p> <p>Between the first international fixture in 1872 and 1888, England won two of 16 matches against Scotland. The Scottish game, exploring the potential of passing, was more advanced than England, where the outmoded dribbling and charging traditions lingered. By 1890, English football had learned its lesson, but Scotland remained the heartland of the passing game. Naturally, once clubs began, first under the counter and then, after 1885, legally, to pay players, Scottish players were in demand. Sunderland who, before being admitted to the league, had existed largely on a diet of friendlies, many of them against Scottish sides, were ideally placed to take advantage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/14/my-favourite-game-sunderland-v-chelsea-1992-fa-cup-replay\">My favourite game: Sunderland v Chelsea, 1992 FA Cup replay | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The traffic in players, understandably, was resented by Scottish fans, which made scouting a dangerous pursuit. For that reason Samuel Tyzack, a wealthy mine owner who, along with the shipbuilder Robert Turnbull, funded Sunderland\u2019s rise, used to don a dog collar and pretend to be a priest while on the trail of potential targets. He was evidently skilled in recruitment: every one of Sunderland\u2019s starting XI against Hearts was Scottish \u2013 as were all the Hearts players.</p> <p>So, too, were Sunderland\u2019s three major absentees, their captain, Hughie Wilson, whose long one-handed throw-ins caused such chaos they led to the law being changed, the winger John Scott, who was fit enough to serve as linesman, and the defender Andrew McCreadie. Hearts were also without two key players: the captain, Isaac Begbie, and their top-scorer, Johnny Walker.</p> <p>Despite that, and heavy drizzle, a record crowd of 12,000 had packed into Tynecastle by kick-off. They saw Hearts begin the brighter but be thwarted by a series of blocks from Sunderland\u2019s renowned goalkeeper, Ned Doig, who wore his trademark cap to disguise a receding hairline. Twice, though, the visitors struck from corners, first through the left-half Harry Johnston and then through the prolific John Campbell, who remains the club\u2019s fifth-highest goalscorer. It was 2-0 at half-time, by which point the crowd had swelled to 15,000.</p> <p>Hearts continued to dominate, and at last got their reward. The right-winger, Willie Taylor, pulled one back and Robert McLaren levelled with a deflected free-kick. A quick counter then left George Scott clear and, as Doig appealed fruitlessly for offside, the inside-right put Hearts ahead.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/apr/11/pivotal-pivatelli-how-random-events-helped-elevate-two-great-milan-sides\">Pivotal Pivatelli: how random events helped elevate two great Milan sides | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Sunderland\u2019s Jimmy-James-John-John-Jimmy frontline was also dangerous when it had space to run into \u2013 a feature of the organisation instilled by the former tobacconist Tom Watson, who was arguably the first manager in anything approaching the modern sense of the term \u2013 and Hearts kept attacking. Jimmy Millar levelled from Campbell\u2019s pass with 10 minutes to go. Jimmy Hannah led a counter after counter, one of which led a free-kick. Robert McNeill took it, and Campbell\u2019s glancing header put Sunderland ahead again. John Harvey rounded off a 5-3 win.</p> <p>The Scotsman, far more impressed than the Edinburgh Evening News, hailed a match \u201cfull of excitement and fast play\u201d, while the Sunderland Echo insisted Sunderland had proved themselves \u201cthe premier football team of the globe\u201d. But an ageing side finished fifth the following year and Watson left, lured away by Liverpool where he established their first title-winning side.</p> <p>What is perhaps most striking now is how familiar so many of the themes remain, 125 years on. The game was clearly thrilling, and yet there was unease, doubts about the influence of money, about the import and export of players, about fixtures arranged under the guise of a new competition but essentially to generate income.</p> <p>There is a sense of impermanence, too, of the transient nature of glory, as a great team reached the end of its cycle, undone in the end by the departure of a manager they had perhaps never fully appreciated as he sought new challenges and better prospects elsewhere.</p> <p>Football has got bigger and these issues are now played out on a global scale but the fundamental tension remains: this is a sport, about fair competition and excitement, but it is also a business, about generating revenue, buying a great team and burnishing the reputation of businessmen and their homes.</p>",
  "<p>The government is \u201creviewing\u201d the surcharge that some migrant doctors and nurses working in the NHS must pay to access the health service, the home secretary Priti Patel has said.</p> <p>In the daily press conference at Downing Street on Saturday, after the UK became the fifth country to pass 20,000 total deaths from coronavirus \u2013 behind the US, Italy, Spain and France \u2013 Patel reiterated the government\u2019s stay-at-home message and rejected suggestions that allowing non-essential work to continue sent mixed messages.</p> <p>The government has been criticised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/28/scrap-625-pound-surcharge-for-nhs-ovserseas-staff\">for planning to increase the immigration health surcharge for migrants</a> from outside the European Economic Area, including nurses and doctors, from \u00a3400 to \u00a3625 a year each from October.

  "<p>The global toll from Covid-19 passed 200,000 on Saturday, with over 2.8 million people infected, as the WHO warned against issuing \u201cimmunity passports\u201d because there is no evidence people who recovered from the disease are protected against a second infection.</p> <p>It took more than three months after the coronavirus first emerged for deaths from the disease to pass 100,000, a grim milestone that was reached on 10 April. It took just over two weeks for that toll to double, and worldwide the number of confirmed infections is creeping towards 3 million.</p> <p>Pressure is mounting on authorities to bring socially and economically costly lockdowns to an end, but most governments are acting only after they believe the virus is under control in their territory.</p> <p>India, Greece and Belgium were the latest countries to announce a tentative easing of restrictions, but said these first steps can be reversed if cases start to rise again.</p> <p>The Belgian prime minister, Sophie Wilm\u00e8s, said it was \u201ctime to look to the future\u201d as she announced that outdoor sports will be permitted and certain shops including garden centres will be allowed to lift the shutters from 4 May.</p> <p>A week later, all shops will reopen and some school classes will recommence, with the wearing of masks will be mandatory on public transport. If the country has avoided a second wave of coronavirus infections, restaurants could open in June.</p> <p>\u201cWe can do (this) because the figures show that we were able to slow down the spread of Covid-19 in Belgium. But the virus hasn\u2019t disappeared yet. It\u2019s still present and dangerous for the population,\u201d Wilm\u00e8s said.</p> <p>In Greece reopening is expected from Monday 4 May, when small shops, hairdressers, barbers and beauticians will be to go back to work again. \u201cThe objective of the confinement measures is not to remain in a glass bowl,\u201d government spokesman Stelios Petsas said earlier this week. \u201cThe objective is to take back our lives.\u201d</p> <p>The centre right administration took a \u201chard and early\u201d approach to enforcing restrictions, amid fears of Greece\u2019s austerity-hit health system being quickly overwhelmed. As a result Greece, to date, has had a sum total of 2,490 confirmed coronavirus cases and 130 fatalities.</p> <p>However, Hong Kong\u2019s top epidemiologist has warned against easing lockdowns in Europe too soon, saying \u201cyou need a sledgehammer\u201d to bring down the rate of infections first.</p> <p>Gabriel Leung, the dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, told Der Spiegel that lockdowns will be \u201ca marathon, not a sprint\u201d, and that the world needs to learn to live with the coronavirus, tightening and easing restrictions as outbreaks emerge.</p> <p>\u201cContainment has failed everywhere,\u201d Leung said. \u201cWhat we need is suppression, or better: cycles of suppression and lift, probably many of them,\u201d he said. He added that measures needed to be tuned to the \u201csurge capacity\u201d of national health systems.</p> <p>One region that appears to have been relatively successful so far in containment efforts is Africa, with strict lockdowns across the continent apparently halting the spread of the virus and staving off a feared spike in infections.</p> <p>South Africa will begin lifting lockdown restrictions from 1 May although people will have to wear face masks in public when they go out.

Asked about attacks on phone masts by his confederates in duncery, Icke didn\u2019t fall over himself to condemn them. \u201cIf 5G continues and reaches where they want to take it, human life as we know it is over... so people have to make a decision.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-04-09/facebook-removes-david-icke-coronavirus-5g-conspiracy-video/\">Facebook said</a> it was \u201ccommitted to removing misinformation which could contribute to physical harm\u201d as it took down the interview with Icke and the London Real conspiracist site. (There\u2019s little real about it, I should add.) YouTube said it had no truck with \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d and did the same.</p> <p>They weren\u2019t serious. If they had been, they would have banned Icke and his imitators. As it was, Facebook and YouTube did not say they could no longer tolerate Icke on their platforms. They gave him the aura of being a free speech martyr by removing one interview, which he gratefully <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB4TZ8vMFuE\">exploited</a>, then allowed him to carry on as before. At the time of writing, close to 500,000 had watched a recent Icke video entitled \u201cIs There a Virus?\u201d that YouTube had not taken down. Icke\u2019s jowls bubble with suppressed fury. \u201cThey\u201d were \u201credesignating\u201d deaths from flu and from 5G waves as deaths from Covid-19, he explains. And why would \u201cthey\u201d go to the time and trouble of doing that?

The legacies of religious, fascist and communist antisemitism are invisible forces propelling them forward to the irresistible conclusion that only one people had the occult power to fool and impoverish the whole wide world without anyone except the wised-up Icke and his kind noticing. Who are his \u201cthey\u201d? Where can we find \u201cthem\u201d? They are the 1%, Icke explains. Specifically, an \u201cultra-Zionist billionaire\u201d.</p> <p>I spoke to Google, the owner of YouTube, and asked why, if it meant what it said, it had not closed Icke down. Apparently most Icke content was still within its guidelines and would not be censored, I was told, an answer that leads us into a swamp.</p> <p>I can\u2019t think of a subject more saturated with dishonesty than freedom of speech. Opponents say it does not matter if a social media platform or a university bans speakers. Private organisations deciding for themselves who they wish to be associated with cannot be compared to state censors. They refuse to acknowledge that if a feminist academic is deemed transphobic and cannot talk in universities, there are precious few other venues open to her. Nor that many public figures are heard on social media or not heard at all. In the past decade, to cite the case of an almost forgotten figure, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/milo-yiannopoulos-nazi-salutes-video-karaoke-richard-spencer-white-nationalists-karaoke-bar-a7987486.html\">the far-right fop</a> Milo Yiannopoulos was a social media celebrity feted and hated in equal measure.

If Facebook and YouTube were to ban the corona conspiracists, that would be censorship too, and it is deceitful to pretend otherwise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/coronavirus-sparks-perfect-storm-of-state-led-disinformation\">Malicious forces creating 'perfect storm' of coronavirus disinformation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alongside the pretence that censorship is not censorship is a hyperinflation in the notion of what speech should be punished for causing harm. The liberal, as distinct from the libertarian, argument is that only speech that directly incites crime should be prohibited, a demagogue whipping up anti-Muslim sentiment outside a mosque, for instance. Since the 1970s supposed \u201cliberals\u201d have wanted offence to be included as a harm. No one should deny that words are weapons that can hurt more than a blow. Unfortunately, no one can measure the psychic wounds that an offended person feels with the accuracy of a doctor measuring physical wounds on a victim of crime. The woolliness of their \u201chate speech\u201d laws all but guarantees that they will punish the innocent.</p> <p>Yet, in the case of Icke, there is no need for debates about whether the harm is real or whether it is just hurt feelings. Knuckle-dragging fantasists have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/06/at-least-20-uk-phone-masts-vandalised-over-false-5g-coronavirus-claims\">physically attacked phone masts</a>. Daniel Allington and his colleague Nayana Dhavan at King\u2019s College London have shown that Ickean conspiracy theories pose <a href=\"https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/127048253/Allington_and_Dhavan_2020.pdf\">a physical risk to public health</a>. Conspiracists put their own lives and, crucially, the lives of those around them at risk. Because their gurus have persuaded them that health advice is a giant lie, they see no need to stay at home, wash their hands or observe social distancing. YouTube and the social media companies are complicit, because they want the audience and revenue that crank celebs bring.</p> <p>They can pocket it because of a legal absurdity. Television broadcasts are regulated. Last week, Ofcom <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/latest/features-and-news/david-icke-and-eamonn-holmes-decision\">sanctioned a tiny TV station</a> called London Live because it broadcast Icke \u201ccasting doubt on the motives behind official health advice to protect the public from the virus\u201d. Yet it has no power to regulate YouTube when it broadcasts Icke saying that health workers and governments were responsible for deception on a supernatural scale.</p> <p>Parliament should have intervened in 2016 when the extent of Russian manipulation of social media was made painfully clear. There is a stronger argument for forcing the tech companies to live by their pious words now that so many are suffering. Liberals should always defend freedom of speech. But they have no obligation to help turn their countries into morgues.</p> <p>\u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist</p>",

He looks for Pickering in the middle, but Mabbutt, desperately tracking back, sticks out his left leg in the hope of blocking and bundling out for a corner.

What he eventually delivers is neither a shot nor a cross, the ball dropping softly into Clemence\u2019s grateful arms.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ea4556e8f08e05690dc4840\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-25T15:21:36.284Z\">4.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>66 min: </strong>Waddle drifts in from the right and curls a cross towards Thomas, bombing in from the other flank.

The tussle ends with Allen clambering all over Peake\u2019s back, ending up horizontal in mid-air, posing in the Superman position as his opponent keeps hold of him with a smile. They spin round so everyone can get the joke before Peake plops him softly back down to earth. A couple of friendly pats are exchanged, and we\u2019re on our way again.

He\u2019s got Paul Allen to his right, and a flick inside will send the midfielder clear on goal. Peake sticks out a boot, it\u2019s all he can do. And he manages to deflect the ball away from Allen and back to Ogrizovic. What an interception! And that should be the end of that, but Coventry, attempting to play out from the back in the continental style, nearly concede in farcical circumstances! Ogrizovic, taking reception of a backpass, decides to go on a C64 International Soccer style dribble upfield! He eventually clanks a dreadful pass straight to Hoddle, who attempts to dispatch it into the unguarded net from 40 yards. Fortunately for the keeper, Peake has read the danger and is back covering. He blocks and taps the ball to the right, assuming his keeper will flop on it when he gets back to his box. But Ogrizovic somehow overruns it, and Peake\u2019s lay off isn\u2019t perfect either, and Clive Allen scampers away with the ball! The net\u2019s still unguarded, but Allen is forced wide by Peake and lashes the ball into the side netting. Coventry dodged a bullet there.

That November, after several rich nations had secured vaccines, officials from the World Health Organization aired concerns that disaster could lie ahead.</p> \n<p>\u201cThings would be much worse if the pandemic had been more severe, and it would be more difficult to create some fairness in the distribution of vaccine,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2009/11/challenge-getting-swine-flu-vaccine-poor-nations#\">Marie-Paule Kieny</a>, the then head of the WHO\u2019s initiative for vaccine research. \u201cGovernments might be less inclined to share the vaccine that they have.\u201d</p> \n<p>With vaccines seen as one of the few real routes out of the coronavirus crisis, fears of \u201cvaccine nationalism\u201d are already increasing. Each step of creating, testing and mass-producing a vaccine is an epic challenge \u2013 but the political and ethical decisions around its subsequent distribution pose another. Governments, including in the UK, are being questioned about how they will get to the front of the queue. How will any eventual vaccine be shared out? Who decides? Will supplies go to the highest bidder? Are rich nations buying up potential vaccines already? And what will stop governments from simply seizing vaccines made in their country?</p> \n<p>According to experts and industry, it will take at least a year to vaccinate the world from the moment vaccines become available. That\u2019s a 12-month queue, if things go well \u2013 after a vaccine is found. \u201cThe reality is that there is no process established for this,\u201d says Steven Jones, a Canadian member of a team that created a successful Ebola vaccine.</p> \n<p>The potential problems have been spotted. On Friday, a parade of world leaders, charity bosses and industry chiefs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/us-stays-away-as-world-leaders-agree-action-on-covid-19-vaccine\">including French president Emmanuel Macron</a>, German chancellor Angela Merkel and philanthropist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/melinda-gates\">Melinda Gates</a>, united to back a WHO initiative to ensure any treatments and vaccines are shared equitably around the world. Dominic Raab also supported it. Yet just as notable were the nations not in attendance \u2013 the US, China, Russia and India.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8d44f6cb-8bf2-41dd-92c4-edd6935c8fb7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NLSnWeeZuXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A delicate system of international cooperation is having to be pursued in the middle of a crisis. \u201cWe are talking about billions of doses being available to all,\u201d says Charlie Weller, the Wellcome Trust\u2019s head of vaccines. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got a roadmap for how to do that.

However, some are blunt about the hopes of centrally-managed global cooperation. \u201cCan you imagine the WHO telling Donald Trump that he can only have one tenth of the vaccine that he wants,\u201d says David Salisbury, the former director of immunisation at the Department of Health. \u201cSurely, he\u2019s going to look to see who can make a vaccine in the quantities needed in America, and he\u2019s not going to let the vaccine out. That will happen.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jones is also pessimistic. \u201cThe WHO can try to take a leadership role but they are in a difficult situation. They can try to apply moral and ethical guidelines.\u201d</p> \n<p>UK ministers, too, have already been under pressure to guarantee that Britain will benefit first from vaccines discovered here. Matt Hancock has said he is \u201censuring the UK is both contributing to and benefiting from efforts around the globe\u201d.</p> \n<p>It is inevitable that some nations will try to use \u201cadvance purchase agreements\u201d to secure supplies, paying potential vaccine producers on the off-chance that their product works. Such agreements provide funds for research, but there is no system for policing their impact on fair distribution.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, a vaccine queue is inevitable. Making billions of doses, rather than millions, adds another order of difficulty. Hence, Weller told a briefing last week: \u201cFor at least a year after the Covid-19 vaccine becomes available, it is very likely that there\u2019ll be insufficient supply to meet the global demand of billions of doses.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"Thomas%20Breuer,%20chief%20medical%20officer%20of%20GSK%20Vaccines\">Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer of GSK Vaccines</a>, paints an even starker picture. His company is working with fellow pharmaceutical giant Sanofi to develop a production process that could deliver big quantities. \u201cLet\u2019s say the GSK-Sanofi approach succeeds, that alone will not be enough to supply 20% of the world\u2019s population within one year,\u201d he says. \u201cSeveral of the large-scale solutions have to come into play if we want to cater for the world\u2019s population over a period of one to two years. One company alone is not enough.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/the-hunt-for-a-coronavirus-vaccine-a-perilous-and-uncertain-path\">The hunt for a coronavirus vaccine \u2013 a perilous and uncertain path</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There is also concern from industry about being thrust into the middle of an impossible political tug of war. \u201cThey are going to have huge numbers of customers, a lot of whom are going to be waving dollar bills, euros and pounds,\u201d says Salisbury. Hence, many are praying for an international agreement. \u201cNow is the time to be having the government conversation about those allocation principles,\u201d says Richard Torbett, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. \u201cLet\u2019s not wait until we\u2019ve got something to fight over.\u201d He adds that it simply will not be left to manufacturers to decide who gets what. \u201cThey will start from the point of saying, we want to maximise global access.\u201d</p> \n<p>The threat of export bans on vaccines is clearly a concern. \u201cIt would really be a mistake for global leaders to be tempted into that sort of behaviour,\u201d says Torbett. He hopes that, in the end, the need for multiple vaccines from many different global sources could encourage international cooperation: \u201cEvery country will want to have fair allocation.\u201d</p> \n<p>While some leaders may be tempted to go it alone, Weller says such actions could ultimately come back to haunt them: \u201cAs long as Covid is out of control somewhere, it threatens everyone, everywhere.

Last week, in the third and last episode of the third series, we got up to the 1970s.</p> <p>The three series have been riveting, so check out the earlier shows. Peters presents beautifully, and I forgive him for being the standard \u201dreads out what\u2019s in front of you\u201d actor host, because he has a long connection with UK music (through <em>Five Guys Named Moe</em>), because he was Lester Freamon in <em>The Wire</em> and because, well, he does his job so well. </p> <p>But, as ever, the true credit should go to the producer; this time, Tom Woolfenden from Loftus Media. It was Woolfenden who found the relevant archives, whether that be Neneh Cherry talking in 2011 about her father, the jazz musician Don Cherry; Martin Simpson, in 2005, explaining the Moroccan way of tuning a guitar; John Craven doing a <em>Newsround</em> round-up of the 1975 decolonisation of Suriname. And it was Woolfenden who did the interviews: with Johny Pitts, the British writer of <em>Afropean</em>; Surinamese flute player Ronald Snijders in the Netherlands; Patrick Bebey, son of Cameroonian guitarist and composer Francis Bebey; Janet Kay, of Silly Games fame\u2026 So many excellent interviews: informative and detailed, well edited, revelatory. They underpin these shows.</p> <p>The story, this series, is of post-colonialism, and how the people of former British, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Dutch and Belgian colonies used their newly given freedom (after the second world war, many colonial countries waived restrictions on visitors from colonies) to come to Europe. Many stayed. And over and over again, those that did stay explain how it\u2019s this consequent mix of cultures that results in their brilliant music. They make us understand that it\u2019s not just the bumping up of different musical techniques, but how the new arrivals\u2019 optimism and hope were muddied and muddled with the racism that they encountered, and how they eventually reclaimed their musical heritage to show it off to Europe. It\u2019s this musical melange that creates the gorgeous soundtrack that we hear throughout the shows. And, in the background, the political culture is creaking. General Franco and Eric Clapton make passing appearances, as baddies.</p> <p>A lot of work has gone into this series and it shows. When a flamenco dancer walks into a Spanish studio, we hear her footsteps; her voice is beautifully recorded. The levels of music and speech are impeccable, the sound moving from ear to ear in your headphones, but remaining clear at all times. It\u2019s all lovely stuff. There\u2019s a list of the tracks played on the show\u2019s website: the BBC should make it into a playlist and put it up on Sounds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca85b382f4f6fed2efb938fdac6d3cc245dd294b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca85b382f4f6fed2efb938fdac6d3cc245dd294b/0_0_3008_1960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neil MacGregor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neil MacGregor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a different angle on colonialism, Neil MacGregor\u2019s classic series <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nrtd2/broadcasts/upcoming\">The History of the World In 100 Objects</a></strong> is being repeated, reassuringly, on Radio 4.

Josie Bevan, who writes a blog with the same name, is our host: she\u2019s telling the story of what it\u2019s like to be a prison wife. Middle-class and a bit naive, Bevan confesses that, after her husband Rob was sentenced to nine years (for tax fraud), she expected a phone call from someone \u2013 social services? The police? The prison system? \u2013 asking her if she was OK. There was no phone call. There is not much help for anyone wanting to support their partner in prison. \u201cI spend my life trying to get <em>into</em> prison,\u201d she says, early on in the programme.</p> <p>Bevan talks to Lisa, a university lecturer who has experience of addiction and prison. They are different, but connected. \u201cI talk about this stuff in front of a lot of people,\u201d says Lisa, \u201cbut I feel\u2026 overwhelmed and tearful.

As with Brexit, the news-based station has gone big on coronavirus, with presenters taking politicians to task. And listeners are responding, whether by tuning in for longer, or by phoning in and asking silly, obvious, unexpected or intelligent questions.</p>",
  "<p>Businesses are used to being prepared for a disaster and most will have had a well-rehearsed continuity plan in place in case one struck. But even the best plan couldn\u2019t have effectively anticipated the wholesale overnight shift to home working that Covid-19 has caused.</p> <p>\u201cAs a result,\u201d Morgan Wright, chief security adviser at cybersecurity firm SentinelOne says, \u201cissues of privacy, collaboration, access and compliance have highlighted weakness in policies and gaps in security.\u201d One of the problems is that even at many larger companies, being caught on the hop by the lockdown has meant that individual departments have been left to find their own ways to work collaboratively.</p> <p>Videoconferencing applications such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2020/mar/25/zoom-the-29bn-video-call-app-youd-never-heard-of-until-coronavirus\">Zoom</a> have made the headlines not only for the unprecedented increase in user numbers \u2013 Zoom saw daily traffic to its official download site increase by 535% and the number of daily meeting participants hit 200 million in March \u2013 but also for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/02/zoom-technology-security-coronavirus-video-conferencing\">privacy and security concerns</a>. Although Zoom itself has tried to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/02/zoom-says-engineers-will-focus-on-security-and-safety-issues\">address those concerns</a>, the question remains: do you have to sacrifice security at the altar of collaborative apps when working from home?</p> <h2>Cybersecurity gaps</h2> <p>The very act of working from home introduces cybersecurity gaps. Remove that person in the next cubicle or at the desk opposite and you remove part of the human-error buffer. Human nature is such that we are more likely to ask that person for reassurance if we aren\u2019t sure about a configuration option than risk looking stupid by calling tech support or even emailing a departmental manager. This has played into the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/27/trolls-zoom-privacy-settings-covid-19-lockdown\">zoombombing</a>\u201d problems that have plagued Zoom as millions of users new not only to the app itself but videoconferencing itself have rushed to connect.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/22/the-digital-spring-clean-how-to-sort-out-passwords-privacy-photos\">The digital spring clean: how to sort out your passwords, privacy and bulging photo folder</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cVideoconferencing systems often come with default settings which are open in nature and vulnerable to being compromised,\u201d says Mark Rodseth, technical director at digital transformation agency Somo. Default settings such as passwords are not being enabled. Although Zoom rectified this on 4 April and added a waiting-room feature so that you can only join a meeting when the host lets you in, it\u2019s a setting that needs to be checked no matter what collaboration app you are using.</p> <p>Ensure that you are using a different strong password for each application, as password reuse enables attackers to walk into several accounts if just one gets compromised elsewhere. Use a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2019/oct/23/guide-secure-online-passwords-memorable-details\">password</a> manager. Not only will this enable you to set different passwords for every app, but their built-in password generator functions will ensure it\u2019s a strong one.</p> <p>Adam Palmer, at cyber exposure specialist Tenable, has some more configuration advice for your videoconferencing tool of choice. \u201cWhen creating virtual meeting rooms, do not make them public,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen configuring a meeting, opt to create a randomly generated ID rather than checking the personal meeting ID option and set meetings to private.\u201d Palmer also suggests disabling any \u201cjoin before host\u201d option to prevent potential trouble before a host arrives. \u201cAdditional precautions include disabling the option to allow removed participants to rejoin and share files,\u201d Palmer adds.</p> <p>Do not overlook the privacy and security implications of what\u2019s on view when you\u2019re making a video call.File sharing is another problem area. Many videoconferencing tools, along with collaborative messaging apps, are vulnerable to the threat of malicious links and attached documents sent by someone masquerading as a work colleague or customer. These attacks will be highly targeted \u201cspear phishing\u201d ones, unlike the spam email variety. But the safeguarding rules you would apply to email still apply to your work-from-home collaboration apps, says Oz Alashe, chief executive of cybersecurity awareness company CybSafe. \u201cAsk yourself if you were expecting the message, ask yourself if the message conveys an undue sense of urgency, check the sender details.\u201d. Of course, it\u2019s not just incoming links and file sharing that\u2019s an issue - outgoing ones can be just as problematic.</p> <h2>Data sharing</h2> <p>Mark Rodbert, boss of identity analytics company Idax, says his biggest concern right now is with data-sharing tools such as Dropbox and Google Drive. \u201cThere has been a sudden and unprecedented need for people to share data over, above and around the ways they have in the past,\u201d he warns, \u201cand that\u2019s where you lose control.\u201d To regain control, you need to follow a few relatively simple guidelines. As we are talking specifically about collaboration here, you\u2019ll be giving other users editing rights to your Google Drive document. That\u2019s a problem, as they can then share it on as well, something you\u2019ll need to prevent. To do this, click on \u201cshare\u201d and select \u201cadvanced\u201d. From here, you can opt to \u201cprevent editors from changing access and adding new people\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Do not overlook the privacy and security implications of what\u2019s on view when you\u2019re making a video call</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You\u2019ll need to do this for the files inside a folder rather than the folder itself, by the way. You should also choose who you are sharing the data with, which may sound obvious, but if you use the \u201cshareable link\u201d option, your document will be available to anyone with that link, including people without Google accounts and hackers. Far better to be more specific by using the \u201cpeople\u201d share option where you specify the email address of those who can get access. To make this easier for larger teams, if you don\u2019t have access to workgroups through a corporate G Suite account, you can create a \u201ccollaborative inbox\u201d <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/\">Google Group</a> and specify access to that instead. Add everyone who needs access to the document with different groups for different projects; it makes collaborative sharing easy enough. Be sure to set group visibility to members only, though, and make joining any group invite only.</p> <h2>Two-step authentication</h2> <p>As far as any app is concerned, enabling two-step authentication should be a priority. That way, even if a hacker gets access to your login credentials, there\u2019s an extra layer of protection stopping them from accessing files. Use the mobile app option for code delivery, though \u2013 it\u2019s safer than using SMS text delivery. Authenticator apps such as Google Authenticator and Authy are free and easy to set up. Two-step options are found by clicking your username, then settings/security. From here, you can check to see which web browsers and devices are signed in or connected to your account. Unlink any devices you don\u2019t recognise or haven\u2019t used for a while, and if you don\u2019t recognise a web session, you can simply delete it to boot them off (and then change your password to be on the safe side). Both Google and Dropbox offer security audits, or check-ups, that will guide you through all these processes and are well worth spending a few minutes on.</p> <p>Do not overlook the privacy and security implications of what\u2019s on view when you\u2019re making a video call. Many people will forget they have sticky notes with login credentials stuck on a noticeboard behind them - don\u2019t do that. \u201cA useful feature we recommend using for any video meetings with external parties in Microsoft Teams is the \u2018blur my background\u2019 feature,\u201d says Bruce Penson, managing director of Pro Drive IT, \u201cwhich protects against this happening.\u201d Zoom users can also apply a virtual background.</p>",

  "<p>It\u2019s hard, stuck inside for weeks on end, not to notice how much your four walls could do with some paint \u2013 if, like me, you haven\u2019t had them done for a while. To be honest, it\u2019s been troubling me for ages \u2013 lockdown has just made it worse. As long ago as February I\u2019d wandered into a <a href=\"https://www.farrow-ball.com/\" title=\"\">Farrow &amp; Ball</a> shop wanting advice for my daughter\u2019s small bedroom. It was still decorated for a young child, but she\u2019s 16 now and she yearned for something more grown-up \u2013 a calming escape where she could study and relax with friends. And I spied on a Farrow &amp; Ball noticeboard an advertisement for their colour consultancy service.</p> <p>Colour curator Joa Studholme has worked at Farrow &amp; Ball for 24 years, inventing colours that have become legendary among decorators, including the charming Nancy\u2019s Blushes, named after her daughter\u2019s pink cheeks.</p> <p>She started advising on decorating after her children were born, having previously worked in advertising. This unlocked a real passion for colour. \u201cWhen I was a child, I was obsessed with colour,\u201d she says. \u201cMy father bought me a box of <a href=\"https://www.carandache.com/gb/en/\" title=\"\">Caran d\u2019Ache</a> crayons and it was literally my pride and joy. I would spend hours rearranging them in the tin. At 12, I painted my ceiling yellow because I wanted it to be sunny, and I painted the inside of my cupboard in stripes.\u201d</p> <p>What would she recommend for us? Our house is a typical London Victorian terrace. It\u2019s painted in various shades of elegant off-white that my husband says have always bored him. As she enters our porch \u2013 pre-lockdown \u2013 she exclaims: \u201cOh, this is crying out for colour!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0c4bdbc711e0148384fb387d106e3c55633cf56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0c4bdbc711e0148384fb387d106e3c55633cf56/0_274_1200_1226/979.jpg\" alt=\"Let the light in: the walls are painted in Dimpse; the Woodwork is All White; and the floor is Down Pipe.\" width=\"979\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Let the light in: the walls are painted in Dimpse; the woodwork is All White; and the floor is Down Pipe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Merrell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She sets off for a wander through the house, notebook in hand. At the end, she lines up colour swatches on large pieces of card representing a harmonious journey through the house: muted whites, grey-blues, pinks and greens, yellow and black. For my daughter\u2019s room, she chooses a wonderful dusky pink that she devised and named Peignoir \u2013 feminine but not sugary \u2013 which she promises will turn to grey in the afternoon light. \u201cIt has a big dose of black in it,\u201d she explains.</p> <p>Joa adds an accent of a darker pink (Sulking Room Pink) behind the bookshelves. \u201cI love adding bits of hidden colour, where you\u2019re not expecting it. It\u2019s the equivalent of a bright green lining in a sober black suit.\u201d</p> <p>Painting a house from top to bottom is expensive. So we pick out a few key rooms to focus on. An easy start is the front door and porch. She recommends creating a space quite distinct from the open living room that comes after by painting the front door (inside and out) and inside the porch in a blueish grey called Pigeon. For the small downstairs loo, currently a pale blue that feels cold in winter, she selects a deep muddy pink (Dead Salmon).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"08f30435cf21ce749968778e6d6c094eec1c303a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08f30435cf21ce749968778e6d6c094eec1c303a/0_0_4789_7176/667.jpg\" alt=\"Shades of perfection: Dead Salmon in the kitchen.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shades of perfection: Dead Salmon in the kitchen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Merrell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Our next project is the office in the converted loft, where my husband says he\u2019d like yellow. Fine, says Joa. Being at the top of the house, the office is a kind of final destination rather than a part of the journey through the house, and needn\u2019t conform so closely to the overall colour mix. She prescribes a cheerful shade called Hay for the walls and ceiling, with a few accents of dark brown on woodwork. He looks delighted.</p> <p>The most dramatic elements are the staircase spindles (currently white), which she\u2019d like to see painted deepest black (Railings). This, she says, will give a structure rising all the way up the house.</p> <p>\u201cYour house is a treasure chest of opportunity,\u201d says Joa. \u201cI am not in the game of changing things for the sake of it. I want to create something you\u2019ll be comfortable with, to reflect your personality, but with a bit more character. To make you smile!\u201d</p> <p>But the colour should make its presence felt differently in each space. For our bedroom, she suggests a soft mix of blues and greens (Cromarty and Grey Blue), \u201cso you barely notice the colours and your shoulders relax as soon as you step into the room.\u201d</p> <p>The aim in these troubled times, says Joa, is to create a sense of wellbeing, as though your house is giving you a hug. \u201cThere has been a seismic shift in the way we are using colour in the home,\u201d she says. \u201cThe huge popularity of the neutral home is on the wane. When the world is in turmoil, what better way to comfort ourselves than embracing stronger colours that have an air of nostalgia and nourish not only our homes but also our souls?\u201d</p> <p>I ask if she has ever made mistakes with colour. \u201cI did once make a big mistake with the children\u2019s bathroom. I wanted to make it look like a 1950s caravan. I used Churlish Green, which has yellow in it. When the children got in the bath, they looked so ill! I had to change it quickly.\u201d She painted it pink instead, \u201cwhich made them look very bonny\u201d. Now our Pigeon-coloured porch is bonny, too.</p> <h2>Colour codes: Joa Studholme\u2019s easy rules for living with brighter hues</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"91977f9c4aa642f57227adb98df1a81592da8ff8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91977f9c4aa642f57227adb98df1a81592da8ff8/0_419_3744_4569/819.jpg\" alt=\"Can of red paint and paintbrush cut out isolated on white backgroundB40HY1 Can of red paint and paintbrush cut out isolated on white background\" width=\"819\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Red alert: If you are wary of colour, start by using stronger tones in smaller places.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>1.</strong> There are three basic ways of decorating: a) using colour on the wall and a complementary white on the woodwork; b) using the lightest colour on the walls and a darker tone on the woodwork; and c) use one colour on both walls and woodwork.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> If you have an entrance hall or porch, then consider painting it a dark colour. You will create some drama on entrance and everything after it will feel lighter.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Think about the light and how and when you use different rooms.

  "<p>Repeat after me: there is no magic bullet for getting us through this pandemic. And smartphone-based proximity-sensing is definitely not that bullet, though it might be useful if two conditions are met. One is that it\u2019s perceived by citizens to be trustworthy and protects their privacy; the other is that it\u2019s deployed in conjunction with a massive increase in state capacity for testing and treatment. Neither condition will be easy to satisfy.</p> <p>There are clear indications that the UK government is now actively considering use of the technology as a way of easing the lockdown. If this signals an outbreak in Whitehall of <a href=\"http://bostonreview.net/books-ideas/whats-wrong-technological-fixes\">tech \u201csolutionism</a>\u201d \u2013 the belief that for every problem there is a technological answer \u2013 then we should be concerned. Tech solutions often do as much harm as good, for example, by increasing social exclusion, lacking accountability and failing to make real inroads into the problem they are supposedly addressing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/france-apple-google-privacy-contact-tracing-coronavirus\">France urges Apple and Google to ease privacy rules on contact tracing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The technology involved, though complex, in essence provides a way of automating what has been a way of dealing with plagues since at least the 1600s: find those infected, lock them away or treat them and then trace everyone with whom they\u2019ve been in contact and quarantine them too. This is a very labour-intensive task that is not feasible in a society such as the UK\u2019s. But many smartphones have low-energy Bluetooth sensors that automatically register the proximity of other similarly equipped phones, while most smartphones also log their location using GPS signals. So in principle we could use smartphones to do contact-tracing on a large scale.</p> <p>That\u2019s the principle. In practice, there are various ways of using these capabilities in the Covid-19 context. Centralised models involve phones equipped with an app to relay their data, supposedly anonymised, to a central server run by a government health authority. This may make things simple for the government, but it\u2019s a nightmare in terms of state surveillance especially if the authorities try to make installation of the app compulsory.</p> <p>Decentralised models involve keeping most of the data on your phone and only broadcasting to all the phones to which you\u2019ve been close via a secure relay server if you\u2019ve been diagnosed. All of your contacts\u2019 phones will then inform their owners that they\u2019ve been in contact with a diagnosed case of Covid-19. And of course all of the communications implied by this are encrypted by default. Because the individuals involved are notified immediately as soon as someone in their proximity is diagnosed, this method shortens exposure risk and enables health providers to suppress the virus rapidly. It restores agency to the individual, lessens the risks of state surveillance and better protects users\u2019 privacy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Smartphone contact-tracing would mark a step-change in state surveillance capabilities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You don\u2019t need to be a rocket scientist, let alone an IT expert, to realise that there are legions of devils in the details. (Harvard\u2019s Safra Center for Ethics has a <a href=\"https://ethics.harvard.edu/files/center-for-ethics/files/white_paper_5_outpacing_the_virus_final.pdf\">very good guide</a> to some of them.) Who tells your phone that you\u2019ve been diagnosed, for example? Given the possibility that \u2013 in a post-lockdown scenario \u2013 individuals with Covid-19 might be subjected to stigma, harassment or dismissal, they might be understandably reluctant to broadcast the fact.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the problem that not everyone has a smartphone, even though it\u2019s commonly supposed in tech circles that they do. The pandemic has revealed that a significant minority of the population (mostly older people) still relies on olde-worlde feature phones. Moreover, it turns out that not all smartphones are created equal: <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/04/2-billion-phones-cannot-use-google-and-apple-contract-tracing-tech/\">one estimate</a> is that 50% of all smartphones can\u2019t use the proximity-sensing systems being developed by Apple and Google. Given that any proximity-sensing system would probably have to cover at least 60% of the population to be truly effective, does this mean that Matt Hancock is going to be giving out Huawei handsets like Smarties to the Nokia-using poor?</p> <p>I could go on but you get the point. The problem with magic bullets is that they sometimes miss their target. The biggest issue of all with smartphone contact-tracing, though, is that it would mark a step-change in state surveillance capabilities. Such a momentous decision cannot be left to Matt Hancock and his colleagues in their Downing Street bunker. This is a central point in a <a href=\"https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/exit-through-the-app-store-how-the-uk-government-should-use-technology-to-transition-from-the-covid-19-global-public-health-crisis/\">landmark review</a> of the issue conducted by UK research group the Ada Lovelace Institute. A decision to deploy mandatory proximity-sensing technology, says the institute, is too important to be left to technocrats. There has to be proper parliamentary scrutiny and primary legislation with real sunset clauses. No fudging with orders in council by frightened ministers. I agree. If we get this wrong, not only will we not succeed in easing the lockdown, but we might also be kissing goodbye to the shrivelled democracy we still possess.

Last week, Adam Tschorn, deputy fashion editor of the <em>LA Times</em> , <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2020-04-17/working-from-home-regular-work-wardrobe-dress-up\">wrote an impassioned plea</a> against the rise of the tracksuit bottom in our work-from-home environment. \u201cPlease, can we put away those sweatpants, ratty, grey, decades-old collegiate sweatshirts and obscure minor league baseball caps, and start our workdays looking like we deserve the pay we\u2019re lucky enough to be earning while the world around us burns?\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps he was recalling the last time sweatpants were popular \u2013 in the early 2000s, with the rise of brands like Juicy Couture, and celebrities such as Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, Amy Poehler (as the naff \u201ccool mom\u201d in <em>Mean Girls</em>) and Paris Hilton (she<a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2019/10/29/paris-hilton-says-she-owns-100-juicy-couture-tracksuits/\"> infamously said</a> she owned 100 pairs), wearing them as loungewear.</p> <p>The popularity of the jogging bottom has prompted questions about our post-coronavirus workwear: will we be trading our pencil skirts and chinos for something with an elasticated waist? \u201cI was wondering that myself,\u201d says Sofia Prantera, the designer behind label Aries Arise, whose No Problemo tie-dyed tracksuits have become a cult favourite. </p> <p>\u201cI think there are two outcomes: \u2018I never want to see sweatpants ever again\u2019 or \u2018how will I ever be comfortable in fixed-waist trousers?\u2019 Hopefully for us the latter.\u201d </p> <p>Rees says: \u201cWe\u2019ve moved a long way (forward) with office attire. There\u2019s absolutely a place for them in the workplace.\u201d</p> <p>But, cautions David Telfer head of design at <a href=\"https://info.sunspel.com/latest-from-sunspel/made-in-britain-the-road-trip\">Sunspel</a>, \u201cit is about what you feel socially comfortable going to work in\u201d.</p> <p>Are joggers indicative of a bigger change? A hitherto previously unexplored era where all areas of our lives are inextricably mixed? Kim Toffoletti, associate professor of sociology at Deakin University in Australia, thinks so. \u201cTheir popularity at the moment might precipitate a move away from more formal attire, an emphasis on looking \u2018professional\u2019 at work, and more flexibility between boundaries of living and working,\u201d she says.</p>",
  "<p>UK arms sales to repressive regimes increased by \u00a31bn last year compared with 2018.</p> <p>The increase, of more than 300%, has been condemned by arms control campaigners, who accuse the government of putting profits before human rights.</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.caat.org.uk/resources/export-licences/dashboard?date_from=2019\">analysis of </a><a href=\"https://www.caat.org.uk/resources/export-licences/dashboard?date_from=2019\"> figures for arms sales</a>, just released by the government, reveals that in 2019 the UK sold \u00a31.3bn worth of weapons to 26 of the 48 countries that are classed as \u201cnot free\u201d by Freedom House, the US government-funded pro-democracy institution.

  "<p>For Donald Trump, it was the strangest and most news-making thing he could have done: instead of taking questions from journalists, dominating the nation\u2019s airwaves yet again, the US president gave a short pre-written statement and then stalked off the stage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/us-coronavirus-timeline-trump-cases-deaths\">Three months and 50,000 deaths: the defining Covid-19 moments in the US \u2013 timeline</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The abrupt end of Friday night\u2019s daily press conference, which has become a ribald, unruly and often shocking ritual in America during the coronavirus pandemic, was probably the clearest sign yet of how badly Trump\u2019s bizarre statements over disinfectant have shaken his administration.</p> <p>Instead of going on the offensive after the world reacted with shock and horror to his Thursday night suggestion that the coronavirus might be treated by injecting disinfectant into a human body, Trump claimed he was being \u201csarcastic\u201d and then retreated from public view.</p> <p>The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">reported</a> that some officials in the White House thought \u201cit was one of the worst days in one of the worst weeks of his presidency.\u201d</p> <p>But it was Trump\u2019s silence on Friday night that spoke volumes.<br><br>White House coronavirus taskforce briefings are often two-hour primetime marathons but on Friday Trump turned on his heel as reporters shouted questions in vain. Perhaps it was a fit of pique, or perhaps revenge on the reporters that he sees as persecutors. He may also have reached a tipping point, with his own advisers warning that the televised briefings are hurting him far more than they help.<br><br>Right on cue, minutes later, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-daily-coronavirus-briefings-809becf3-9913-4b71-9f92-1930ad1d29b0.html\">the Axios website reported</a> that Trump plans to \u201cpare back\u201d his coronavirus press conferences, according to four of its sources. Next week, it said, \u201che may stop appearing daily and make shorter appearances when he does\u201d.</p> <p>If he does that then Trump\u2019s remarks over disinfectant will have been the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back over the nightly ritual of the virus briefings. For weeks they have dominated the US headlines as the nation struggles to come to terms with a pandemic that has cost 50,000 American lives. They have provided a canvas for Trump\u2019s rage, a platform from which he can attack his enemies and \u2013 only occasionally \u2013 a place where an American president can seek to reassure a scared and besieged public enduring stay-at-home orders to curb the virus.</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s remarks over disinfectant changed all that.</p> <p>On Thursday, Trump had suggested that doctors study the idea of people receiving injections of disinfectant to combat the virus. He also extolled the potential and unproven benefits of ultraviolet light. Medical experts, politicians and even disinfectant makers denounced the suggestion and warned the public against consuming the product. Trump\u2019s comments generated internet memes and headlines around the world.</p> <p>His old rival from 2016, Hillary Clinton, chimed in with a quick jab on Twitter. \u201cPlease don\u2019t poison yourself because Donald Trump thinks it could be a good idea,\u201d she said. His new rival for the 2020 election, former vice-president Joe Biden, also pitched in. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I have to say this, but please don\u2019t drink bleach,\u201d he said, mixing mockery with a public service announcement.</p> <p>From almost the moment the words left Trump\u2019s mouth it was clear some sort of damage limitation was needed.</p> <p>But, as shock and amazement traversed the globe, it was slow in coming. When it did arrive, on Friday lunchtime, it was a clean-up attempt that clearly could have gone better. At a White House event Trump tried to justify his dangerous comments, falsely claiming that he was \u201casking a question sarcastically to reporters\u201d.</p> <p>On Friday, even as the US death toll topped 50,000 and the grim milestone of 1 million coronavirus cases grows nearer, Trump tried to make what critics saw as a desperate and dishonest U-turn.</p> <p>\u201cI was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen,\u201d the president, sitting at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, told reporters as he signed emergency funding legislation.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was asking a sarcastic \u2013 a very sarcastic question \u2013 to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside, but it does kill it, and it would kill it on the hands and that would make things much better. That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to a reporter.\u201d</p> <p>But video of the briefings clearly demonstrated otherwise. There was no hint of sarcasm and Trump\u2019s attempts to rewrite the immediate past were undermined by the evidence just a simple Google search away.</p> <p>When Trump posed the question about the efficacy of disinfectant injections, he had turned to his right and was looking in the direction of Bill Bryan, the acting homeland security undersecretary for science and technology, and Deborah Birx, the coronavirus taskforce coordinator.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2781403745ca17a81608365b41ca63c031f48e2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2781403745ca17a81608365b41ca63c031f48e2c/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump turns to the homeland security official William Bryan during the briefing at which the president extolled the virtues of ingested disinfectant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump turns to the DHS official William Bryan during the briefing at which the president extolled the virtues of ingesting disinfectant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: White House/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Trump \u2013 in his attempt at damage limitation \u2013 gamely pressed on. The Reuters reporter Jeff Mason asked if Trump wanted to clarify that he was being sarcastic and ensure no one misunderstood him.</p> <p>He replied: \u201cYes. I do think that disinfectant on the hands could have a very good effect. Now, Bill is going back to check that in the laboratory. You know, it\u2019s an amazing laboratory, by the way. It\u2019s amazing the work they do.\u201d</p> <p>One more time, Mason gamely pressed: \u201cJust to clarify, you\u2019re not encouraging Americans to inject disinfectant?\u201d</p> <p>Trump: \u201cNo. Of course not. Interior-wise, it was said sarcastically. It was put in the form of a question to a group of extraordinarily hostile people, namely the fake news media.\u201d</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s familiar turf of attacking the media was not working. In the middle of a pandemic, with Americans dying in their hundreds every day, the leader of the administration trying to guide the nation back to safety and normality had put even more lives at risk. His jumbled, inaccurate assertions only deepened concerns about Trump\u2019s embrace of flawed science that could endanger public health.</p> <p>Scott Gottlieb, Trump\u2019s own former Food and Drug Administration director, was among those many people now forced to warn Americans not to follow their own president\u2019s advice. He told a CNBC interviewer: \u201cI think we need to speak very clearly. There\u2019s no circumstance under which you should take a disinfectant or inject a disinfectant for the treatment of anything, and certainly not the treatment of coronavirus.\u201d</p> <p>The scandal exploded just a day after a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/us/politics/coronavirus-trump.html\">New York Times report</a> that detailed how Trump is coping with the pressures and isolation caused by the coronavirus pandemic. In a lengthy piece it portrayed a US president who has become cut off from many of his former friends and associates as he lives and works in the White House, unable to leave and travel and hold the campaign rallies that he appears to crave.</p> <p>It described Trump bingeing on cable news for many hours each morning and often late into the night, surveying the wreckage of a once-booming economy that he had planned on being the main plank of his reelection strategy.</p>",
  "<p><br>The lockdown has played havoc with album release schedules, sending new records by Haim, Rufus Wainwright, Jarvis Cocker and the Pretenders back several weeks. But adversity can create opportunity \u2013 or at least the chance to nerd out over a reissue by a little-known electronic auteur: Pole, the alias of German musician Stefan Betke.</p> <p>Betke knows all about taking advantage of an opportunity, joining a long artistic tradition of making great art from mistakes. Just as Leonardo da Vinci famously instructed his students to study stains and blots for inspiration, and the Japanese pottery technique of <em>kintsugi</em> repairs broken earthenware with precious metals, creating beauty from a flaw, Pole turned his butterfingers into a masterstroke.</p> <p>Some time around 1996, Betke dropped a piece of kit. His damaged <a href=\"https://waldorfmusic.com/en/hardware-archive/4-pole\">Waldorf 4-Pole analogue filter</a> still worked, but issued unruly hisses and pops. Rather than chucking out the offending item, its itchy static became the operational conceit of Pole\u2019s subsequent trilogy of albums, completed across the cusp of the millennium \u2013 innovative electronic works now remastered and reissued as a box set, with a bonus 12in from the same period, Raum (1998). Immersive to the point of obsession, detailed like a cathedral ceiling, the first three Pole records not only take a glitch and make it a feature, they serve up vast, emotional music that spans the gamut from would-be thriller soundtracks to ambient awe.</p> <p>It is not without precedent \u2013 there are obvious links to systems music; \u201cglitch\u201d became a busy subgenre around the same time, with the German experimental label Mille Plateaux releasing a series of compilations called<em> Clicks and Cuts</em> \u2013 but Pole\u2019s<em> 1</em> (it has a blue cover), <em>2</em> (red) and <em>3</em> (yellow) have not only stood the test of 20 years, they still sound like little else around. You could just as easily file these notionally techno albums under contemporary classical, or dub reggae. They went on to influence any number of electronic auteurs; dubstep exists in the same continuum, and the quiet intimacy of these records finds a forward echo in the club-at-home sounds of the xx. Betke himself continues to record and play \u2013 he released <a href=\"https://thequietus.com/articles/18852-pole-wald-review\">another great album, </a><em><a href=\"https://thequietus.com/articles/18852-pole-wald-review\">Wald</a></em><a href=\"https://thequietus.com/articles/18852-pole-wald-review\">, in 2015 </a>\u2013 but lives quietly as a mastering engineer and label boss.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-nY_IrLGoU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k-nY_IrLGoU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=79&amp;v=k-nY_IrLGoU&amp;feature=emb_title\">Listen to Modul, the opening track on the first Pole album.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Much electronic and digital music thumbs its nose at the vinyl crackle and tape hiss of analogue, producing cleaner machine sound; Betke\u2019s Pole trilogy made this sleekness dusty again. In Berlin in the late 90s, he was working in the thick of minimal techno, a subgenre that took this most relentless of club musics and dialled it down to a gestural ghost of its former self. Betke had grown up studying piano, playing jazz and getting into hip-hop, so had particularly open ears. In a ninja move, he chose to pair the cockroach skitter created by the broken filter with the barely-there twitch of minimal, adding the wide-open vistas of dub reggae. He offset the trebly ASMR frissons with spacious echo and lush bass.</p> <p>A lot happens in a very confined creative space. Modul, the first track on<em> 1</em>, begins in near silence, looping what sounds like vinyl crackle into a beat. Disembodied notes gradually coalesce into a hint of a melody; sonar bloops serve as bass. This basic template is reborn again and again, with what reveals itself to be a startling range of variations. If you are the sort of person who can find the melodies in the hum of the spin dryer and the plaintive whalesong in feedback, Pole is your guy.</p> <p>As the albums go on, the affinity to techno gradually falls away. You can, just about, dance to Pole\u2019s stuff \u2013 Kirschenessen on <em>1</em> is a microtonal rave, which features a set of birdlike chirps, miniature rushes and a dancefloor build that is one huge tease, promising a climax that never comes. Tanzen is a banger, with nods to Kraftwerk.</p> <p>Really, though, these are dub albums, in which the BPMs reduce to a stately and calming nod. But this is dub with the compositional clout of modern classical and the ordered mindset of digital music; a chiaroscuro of cold and warmth. There is an arc: roughly, <em>1</em> cleaves the closest to minimal techno, while <em>2</em> represents the giddy high point of the trilogy, where it goes seriously reggae. <em>3</em> stays with dub, but gets even more detailed and abstracted, its genius only marred by the intrusion of human found sound on tracks like Taxi and Karussell.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t6Z4ohHanE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7t6Z4ohHanE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=7t6Z4ohHanE&amp;feature=emb_title\">Listen to Stadt, from Pole 2.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>My favourite is <em>2</em>, whose opening clarion of melodica-like notes on Fahren (\u201ctravel\u201d) elicits a Pavlovian response. With its acrylic near-beat, Stadt once again mobilises minimal techno as Betke detonates resonant fireworks in the background. By Uberfahrt (\u201ccrossing\u201d) on <em>3</em>, the mood is pensive and wistful. Throughout, Betke is hugely concerned with space, with radio silence, which is never really silent, with the decaying and reflowering of sound.</p> <p>Put one of these records on in the dark and it might sound austere, or even threatening, as though insect armies were busy inheriting the earth. Unleash Pole in the sunshine and you can hear the joy Betke takes in the natural world, in the microtones actually going on all around us; his later work \u2013 <em>Wald</em> means \u201cforest\u201d \u2013 made this inclination more plain. It\u2019s absolutely worth staying with Betke, because the itchiness doesn\u2019t stay haunted for long. Everything here plays out into a kind of symphonic beauty.</p>",

The group now hopes to turn the anti-lockdown protests into a movement which could help re-elect Trump in November.</p> <p>The Tea Party Patriots, another group forged amid the Tea Party movement of 2009, has also weighed in, promoting the rallies to its 3 million members nationwide, while a group of gun-enthusiast activist brothers bought up webpages in an effort to further the movement\u2019s aims.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tea-party-supporters-who-they-are-and-what-they-believe/\">The Tea Party</a> supported lower taxes, but was also accused of representing a racist reaction to the election of the first black president.

Wall, at FreedomWorks, was also keen to stress it did not organize events, but the organization\u2019s ability to reach its 5 million members is hardly a small matter in promoting the events.</p> <p>In any case, the protests and the fawning news coverage by the rightwing media serve as a handy shot in the arm for less-publicized work both organizations are doing behind the scenes.</p> <p>FreedomWorks and Tea Party Patriots have joined with <a href=\"http://v\">the American Legislative Exchange Council</a>, a controversial rightwing network that pushes policies by creating model legislation, to create a \u201cSave Our Country\u201d coalition, which is quietly lobbying Trump to reopen the economy.

Undertakers said they were overwhelmed.</p> <p>With 1.6 million inhabitants, making it one of France\u2019s most densely populated departments, Seine-Saint-Denis has the lowest number of doctors per head, but the highest rates of obesity and diseases including cancer, diabetes and asthma.</p> <p>\u201cMany arrive at hospital already in a critical condition because they tend not to have regular care or contact with the health system,\u201d said Corbi\u00e8re, a member of the hard-left La France Insoumise. \u201cAnd a lot of people here have jobs that can\u2019t be done from home: underpaid frontline jobs like cleaners, builders, refuse collectors \u2013 people who have to use public transport and so are more exposed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28bde5ce278562c7c47571656d5b8b7e7a95b9e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28bde5ce278562c7c47571656d5b8b7e7a95b9e0/0_91_2290_1374/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charity workers from the Banlieues Sant\u00e9 team check on a vulnerable resident.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charity workers from the Banlieues Sant\u00e9 team check on a vulnerable resident.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samir El Badaoui, Banlieues Sant\u00e9</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mehdi Bigaderne, 37, co-founder of Aclefeu, a collective set up in 2005 after rioting in the mostly north African Clichy-sous-Bois neighbourhood, said problems had all been exacerbated by the virus.</p> <p>\u201cIt has exploded the myth that we are all equal because clearly we\u2019re not. People are trying to respect the lockdown, but what do you do if you\u2019re a family of five or more in a small apartment on the 15th floor? How do you keep children in? How do you feed them when the markets where you buy cheap fruit and vegetables have closed and you can\u2019t afford supermarkets? How can families whose children normally eat in school canteens now make three meals a day?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not new that Seine-Saint-Denis is a place of inequality, discrimination and social problems, but coronavirus has crystallised this.\u201d</p> <p>As well as distributing \u201clockdown packages\u201d of food, toiletries and a mask, Banlieues Sant\u00e9 has recruited doctors to make multilingual videos explaining how people can protect themselves and has translated the document that all French people needed to carry to leave their homes into around 20 languages.</p> <p>Among those it has helped is Yvette Maurice, 85, who lives alone in a 12-storey block. Suffering from diabetes and high blood pressure, she was worried about buying food. \u201cI received food packages for the last three weeks and it was a huge relief as it meant I could stay at home,\u201d said Maurice. </p> <p>Badaoui, a hospital cleaner who trained as a nurse, recalls a single mother of four who had symptoms of Covid-19 but was threatened with the sack if she didn\u2019t turn up for her cleaning job: \u201cWe were able to advise her of her rights \u2013 that she could self-isolate at home without losing her job. In so many cases, social problems have to be resolved before medical issues.\u201d </p> <p>Not all his stories have happy endings. On a visit to one housing estate, volunteers found an elderly Algerian man, a former caretaker who had lived in France since the 1940s, dead in his home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like nothing we have experienced,\u201d Badaoui said. \u201cWe are the very last chance for many people. We act as a bridge between the health service and those most in need, some of whom are no longer in contact with health services or never were.\u201d</p> <p>Seine-Saint-Denis<em> </em>saw clashes last week between youths and police, sparked by a motorcyclist hitting a police car and being thrown from his bike, suffering a broken leg. There were accusations of heavy-handed policing of the lockdown.</p> <p>\u201cThe banlieue is not aflame,\u201d said Corbi\u00e8re. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a few fireworks, not riots. We\u2019ve seen worse.\u201d</p> <p>Bigaderne agreed: \u201cThose involved in recent events are a very small minority and a lot of it is down to frustration.\u201d</p> <p>The government and local authorities have pledged emergency payments to struggling families, but many in Seine-Saint-Denis will see little benefit .</p> <p>\u201cNot everyone, including the homeless and those without official papers, has the same access to rights,\u201d Bigaderne said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t reduce the social inequalities in these areas, there will always be problems. We\u2019ve been saying this for 15 years. We cannot keep putting plasters over serious wounds.\u201d</p> <p>Corbi\u00e8re added that the crisis had also shown the depth of human solidarity within the banlieue\u2019s many communities: \u201cThe virus has rocked society. Will it change things? We can but hope.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>We don\u2019t yet know the number of NHS staff who have lost their lives in the battle against Covid-19. On Wednesday, Dominic Raab put the figure at 69, but the true figure is considered to be far greater. The Guardian has recorded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/doctors-nurses-porters-volunteers-the-uk-health-workers-who-have-died-from-covid-19\">more than 100 deaths so far</a>, but even this is an underestimate because not all deaths are in the public domain. </p> <p>These deaths are not \u201cnatural\u201d casualties of the coronavirus pandemic. In fact, they may be the result of a failure in the government\u2019s duty to care for NHS staff, which is why<strong> </strong>it is vital it is properly investigated under the law.</p> <p>Since the pandemic reached the UK, we have heard countless reports of doctors and nurses raising the alarm over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/nhs-frontline-staff-may-refuse-to-work-over-lack-of-coronavirus-ppe-says-union-unison\">lack of personal protective equipment</a> (PPE) when treating Covid-19 patients. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/consultant-who-pleaded-for-more-nhs-hospital-ppe-dies-of-coronavirus\">Abdul Mabud Chowdhury</a> was one of those who raised the alarm, and he has since tragically died. He worked as a consultant urologist at the Homerton hospital in east London. In March 2020, in a Facebook message to Boris Johnson, he called urgently for PPE for frontline NHS staff and the need for testing.</p> <p>Josiane Zauma Ebonja Ekoli was a nurse at Harrogate and District NHS Trust on a Covid-19 ward before becoming ill. She died in a hospital she had previously worked in. Her daughter Naomie reported her mother\u2019s description of the \u201cpoor\u201d availability of PPE equipment for nurses and doctors. Naomie has called on the government to get better PPE for NHS frontline staff: \u201cThe least they could do is up the PPE so they can make sure it doesn\u2019t happen to another family.\u201d</p> <p>How many of these deaths could have been prevented had sufficient PPE been provided to NHS workers? And if there is a lack of PPE, how did this happen? The health secretary, Matt Hancock, says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/revealed-private-firm-running-uk-ppe-stockpile-was-sold-in-middle-of-pandemic\">the biggest challenge</a> is \u201cone of distribution rather than one of supply\u201d. Should more have been done to meet this challenge, and if so what? Does the government have a legal duty to do more to protect the lives of healthcare workers?</p> <p>The World Health Organization has prepared guidance on the \u201crational use\u201d of PPE. It states that preventative measures are key to stopping the spread of the disease. Those most at risk are those in close contact with infected patients. The guidance makes recommendations for optimising the availability of PPE, but there is no transparency over whether the UK is putting them into practice.</p> <p>There must be investigations into the individual deaths of NHS workers, out of respect to them, and also so that future deaths can be prevented. The evidence appears to be that the government has failed to protect them from risk to their lives, and if that is the case then an investigation will be required by law.</p> <p>Article 2 of the European convention on human rights (which is not part of the EU) provides that not only must states not take life, they must protect it as well, taking measures to provide that protection for those at risk. The state is also under a duty to ensure there are appropriate systems and regulatory frameworks in place to protect individuals from risk to their lives. If there is evidence that this has not happened, there is also a procedural duty to initiate an effective public investigation into the deaths and the circumstances in which the obligation to protect lives may have been violated.</p> <p>If this government has failed to involve itself in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/eu-turns-up-pressure-on-matt-hancock-over-covid-19-ppe-scheme\">EU\u2019s bulk-buying scheme</a> for PPE and other health equipment, or if it has failed to implement the WHO guidance on optimising the PPE that is available, and failed to put in place sufficient procedures to distribute lifesaving PPE, then it will have failed the frontline workers it has a legal duty to protect.</p> <p>No doubt in some cases, the lack of PPE will have allowed the virus to spread from patients to staff. Several bereaved family members have expressed their belief that their loved ones caught the virus at the hospitals where they worked because of a lack of PPE.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/23/cabinet-blame-game-matt-hancock-coronavirus-test-scientists\">The cabinet blame game has begun \u2013 but Matt Hancock may yet escape unscathed | Katy Balls</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A number of legal forums can investigate deaths in such circumstances. Section 1 of the 2009 Coroners and Justice Act requires a senior coroner to conduct an investigation into a death if there is reason to suspect, among other things, that the deceased died of violent or unnatural death. Although the chief coroner has produced guidance stating that Covid-19 can be a natural cause of death, which is not on its own a reason to refer it to a coroner, once issues of systemic failure are also raised then the need for inquests might well be essential to satisfy Article 2 of the European Convention.</p> <p>It may also be necessary for a public inquiry under the 2005 Inquiries Act, as in the case of the Grenfell disaster, to investigate possible systemic breaches that have contributed to the deaths of NHS workers.</p> <p>In the words of Dr Chowdhury, healthcare workers have a \u201chuman right like others to live in this world disease-free with [their] family and children\u201d. The state has a duty to protect their lives as it does to all its citizens. Their deaths should not be treated as a regrettable necessity. If they have been failed then there should be full investigation to uncover the extent of the mistakes, so more lives are not lost in the future.</p> <p>\u2022 Stephen Cragg is a barrister specialising in public law, healthcare law and human rights at Doughty Street Chambers.

They have a reasonable set of controls on the outside too, but two different volume levels that can be a bit confusing.</p> <p>They\u2019re a bit cheap-feeling, and fairly tight on the head. They also don\u2019t fold up particularly compact for travel, which probably isn\u2019t a concern right now.</p> <p>The battery lasts for up to 12 hours and charges via the older microUSB. You get a choice of a solid Bluetooth 4.1 connection, with support for AAC and aptX Bluetooth audio standards, or an included 3.5mm audio cable. They sound better with noise cancelling turned on with bright and punchy audio \u2013 better than you would expect for \u00a350 \u2013 that\u2019s a little over accentuated in the treble.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: </strong>A cheap and cheerful bargain.</p> <h2><strong>Sony WF-1000XM3</strong></h2> <p><strong>RRP:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/truly-wireless/wf-1000xm3\" title=\"\">\u00a3220</a> \u2013 deals from \u00a3170</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adbf60492f15d747c62ebb6bd9cbfc79262bc5fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adbf60492f15d747c62ebb6bd9cbfc79262bc5fb/405_457_4147_2489/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sony WF-1000XM3\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Impressive noise-cancelling true wireless earbuds cut wires and bulk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Want noise cancelling without the bulk of headphones or a cable? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/14/sony-wf-1000xm3-review-updated-noise-cancelling-earbuds-sound-great\" title=\"\">Sony\u2019s WF-1000XM3</a> are the best sounding, most effective noise-cancelling true wireless earbuds you can get.</p> <p>They feature impressive noise-cancelling technology that rivals the best full-size headphones.

  "<p>We have always given each other strange advice in times of plague. During the yellow fever outbreak in Philadelphia in 1793, it was thought you could purify the air by firing muskets, both indoors and out, and for a while it became impossible to go for a walk without some earnest citizen shooting you in the ear. In London in 1665, it was said that powdered dried toad would protect against the terrifying sweep of death. Tobacco was used to ward off bubonic plagues, with toddlers puffing at pipes at the kitchen table.</p> <p>But there has been good advice, too, and that advice is more constant across history: we have always told each other to tell stories and try not to despair. Tomaso del Garbo, a Florentine physician working during the 14th-century Black Death, wrote that those who could not \u201cflee the pestilence\u201d must \u201cuse songs and games and pleasant stories that do not exhaust the body\u201d. Writing at the same time, Nicholas de Burgo urged that people \u201ctake care to be able to be joyful \u2026 listen to lullabies, stories and melodies\u201d. A 15th-century revised edition of Aldobrandino of Siena\u2019s <em>R\u00e9gime du Corps</em>, which circulated widely during epidemic outbreaks, told its readers to \u201cread joyful and strange things\u201d.This prescription was down, in part, to the ancient Galenic idea that fear and sorrow could alter the temperature of a person\u2019s body and thereby render them more prone to sickness: but it was also a sense that, in the midst of horror, we need to be transported.</p> <p>I am not in the Galen camp: I don\u2019t believe stories will protect us against Covid-19, any more than would strength of character or moral probity. The solutions lie with science and the radical global cooperation of governments, but we will need the stories, even so. Tales of transformation and of emancipation, both real and fictional, can be a set of stars and maps. They point us both towards action and hope. Real hope, I think, is not the promise that everything will be all right, but a sense that the world has so many complexities and possibilities that despair is misplaced; that we still live in a universe shot through with the unexpected. There has never been a decade when we have not taken ourselves by surprise: we have never yet exhausted our capacity for change. I struggle with optimism, but nor am I a pessimist; I tell the children I write for that I am a possibilityist. I truly believe in the potential for human transformation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The world has so many possibilities that despair is misplaced \u2013 our universe is shot through with the unexpected</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So a few weeks ago, in search of that defibrillation for the imagination that happens when the right reader meets the right story (and in truth, in part to fight back at my own sadness and fear), I emailed some of the children\u2019s writers and artists whose work I love most. I asked them to write something, or draw something, anything, that would offer that galvanic sense of possibility even in darkness. The response was glorious, which shouldn\u2019t have surprised me. So many children\u2019s writers and illustrators are themselves already hunters and gatherers of hope; manufacturers and peddlers of wonder.</p> <p>Now, a few weeks later, the pieces have been collected into <em>The Book of Hopes</em>. The stories and essays and images aren\u2019t explicitly about hope: rather, they aim to create it, through delight or comfort or new ideas, ridiculous jokes, wild heroic tales. There are true accounts of cats and hares and plastic-devouring caterpillars, there are doodles and flowers, revolting and beautiful poems, there are stories of space travel and new shoes and dragons. They are designed to be dipped into: you can eat one with your breakfast and another at midday. The psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott believed that during times of privation, the imagination can be a place of shelter for children. I hope that <em>The Book of Hopes</em> might help, even if only a little.</p> <p>The collection is a free downloadable PDF, hosted on the website of the <a href=\"https://literacytrust.org.uk/\">National Literacy Trust</a>.

He sits on his branch and listens.</p> <p>It was blackbird\u2019s idea. He sang out this morning at dawn from his treetop in the garden, to fox half asleep behind the garden shed. She thought it a good idea too. It was a wake-up call. Fox was on her feet at once, and trotting through Bluebell Wood, where she barked it to deer who ran off across the stream. Kingfisher was there, otter and dipper too. They heard, and piped it on, and swallow swooped down over the meadow, and passed it on to cows waiting to go into their milking, and to sheep resting quietly under the hedge with her lambs in the corner of the dew-damp field.</p> <p>And they all agreed, bleating it out to bees already busy at their flowers, to weaving spiders, and grasshoppers, and scurrying mice. Trees heard sheep calling too, the whole flock of them, and waved their budding leaves in wild enthusiasm; and high above, the clouds wandered through the skies driven by wind, and wind took blackbird\u2019s idea over the cliffs across heaving seas, where gulls and albatross cried it out, and whales and dolphins and porpoises heard it, and wailed and whooped it down into the deep, where turtles listened, and they too loved the idea. So did plankton and every fish and crab and sea urchin and whelk, they all whispered that it was a fine notion, the best they ever heard.</p> <p>And the whisper went over the sea on the curling waves to the shores of Africa, where lions roared their approval, and elephants trumpeted it, leopards yawned it, water buffalo belched it, wild dogs yelped it. Wildebeest murmured it out across the savanna; and storm lifted the idea up over rainforests, where rain took it and poured it down on gorillas in the mist, on chimpanzees in their sleeping nests. Howler monkeys and gibbons echoed their calls loud over all the earth \u2013 they are that loud; and then from far up high, sun heard it too and shone it down over deserts where oryx stamped her foot impatient to be getting on with it and doing it \u2013 she loved the idea that much. Even camel, who rarely joined in anything, thought this was the best and most beautiful idea he had ever heard.</p> <p>Back in the garden, blackbird waited till everyone was ready. And then he began to sing. And the whole carnival of animals, every living thing on this good earth joined in, until the globe echoed with the joy of it.</p> <p>And blackbird was very pleased.</p> <p>But I was still lost in sadness, as I heard the earth singing around me. It was a song of forgiveness. I knew that. So I asked blackbird if I could join in. And he sang his answer back to me.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you think we are doing this, you silly man? We want you and yours to be happy again. Only then will you treat us and the world right again, as you know you should. Only then will all be well. Sing, silly man, sing, sing. Our song is your song, your song is our song.\u201d</p> <p>So I sang, we all sang, sang away our sadness. In every house and flat and cottage, we clapped and sang, in every hut and tent, in every palace and hospital and prison. And they heard and we heard our song of gladness echoing all together, in glorious harmony across the universe.</p> <p>\u00a9 Michael Morpurgo 2020<br>\u2022 <em>Michael Morpurgo</em> <em>founded the <a href=\"www.farmsforcitychildren.org\">Farms for City Children</a> charity.</em></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Peanut<br></strong><em>by Rob Biddulph</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97ccaf2f2ed23fd17f16e7c59c3ef9fcda4407bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97ccaf2f2ed23fd17f16e7c59c3ef9fcda4407bc/0_690_4134_4131/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rob Biddulph.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p><em>Rob Biddulph is the illustrator of books including Blown Away, GRRRRR! and Odd Dog Out (HarperCollins Children\u2019s Books).</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>HOPE<br></strong><em>by Chris Haughton</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6ce77ff717277ce6e9ffa057388af2e406abff5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6ce77ff717277ce6e9ffa057388af2e406abff5/0_1228_7441_9296/800.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Haughton\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p><em>Chris Haughton is the illustrator and author of Oh No, George! and A Bit Lost (Walker Books).</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Care of Exotic Pets: Number 1.<br>The Axolotl at Bedtime <br></strong><em>by Catherine Johnson</em></h2> <p>Never give your axolotl chocolatl in a botl<br>Serve it in a tiny eggcup, not too cold and not too hotl.<br>Make him sip it very slowly, not too much, never a lotl.<br>After all, he\u2019s just a sleepy, snuggly, bedtime, axolotl.<br><br>Then tuck him \u2013 very gently \u2013 in his hand carved wooden cotl.<br>Turn the light out, seven thirty, never later, on the dotl.<br>Sing him songs of salamanders, give it everything you\u2019ve gotl<br>As there\u2019s nothing like a tune to serenade your axolotl.</p> <p>Brush his gills out on the pillow, never mind the whys or whatl.<br>Once he\u2019s deeply all a-slumber, sweetly snoring, off you trotl.<br>Think of him, snug in his dreamland, flying kites or sailing yachtl.<br>Then you\u2019ll sigh, you\u2019ve done your duty, time to clean the pans and potl.<br>Come tomorrow he\u2019ll be one fresh, keen as mustard, axolotl.<br><br>\u00a9 Catherine Johnson 2020<br><em>Catherine Johnson\u2019s latest books are Race to the Frozen North (Barrington Stoke) and Freedom (Scholastic).</em></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Everything Crossed<br></strong><em>by Steven Lenton</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0da6af7bada70faa4f4800017503039d85f9ccb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0da6af7bada70faa4f4800017503039d85f9ccb4/0_371_2480_3137/791.jpg\" alt=\"Everything Crossed (c) Steven Lenton\" width=\"791\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p><em>Steven Lenton is the illustrator of Shifty McGifty and Slippery Sam by Tracey Corderoy (Nosy Crow), as well as books by David Baddiel and Frank Cottrell-Boyce.</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Fake a smile<br></strong><em>by Jim Smith</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78ef512f308571a91a92a13663ad8caa770c6759\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78ef512f308571a91a92a13663ad8caa770c6759/0_0_2480_1748/1000.jpg\" alt=\"jim smith\" width=\"1000\" height=\"705\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p><em>Jim Smith is the illustrator and author of the Barry Loser series and the Super Weird Mysteries series (Egmont).</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>New Boots <br></strong><em>by Jacqueline Wilson</em></h2> <p>There\u2019s a huge hole in my right boot and the sole flaps madly on my left. Our Lily used to pass down her boots to me, but now my feet have grown too big, even though she\u2019s much older than me. She\u2019s away in service, working as a lady\u2019s maid.</p> <p><em>I </em>don\u2019t want to be a lady\u2019s maid. I want to be the lady! My teacher says I\u2019ve got a chance of getting a scholarship to the Girls\u2019 High School next year. I go past it when I go to Biggerton market on errands for Ma. I can\u2019t see me fitting in with all those posh girls in their fancy uniform to be honest. Mind you, I don\u2019t really fit in at the village school either.</p> <p>They all call me Spud. It is not my real name, obviously. Ma gave us girls flowery names. I\u2019m Rose, and my older sisters are Lily and Violet. I\u2019m called Spud because of my brown frock. Ma made it out of cheap material, and it\u2019s so coarse it sets me itching something chronic. The children at school say it\u2019s made out of old potato sacking. Hence Spud.</p> <p>If I ever get to be a Lady I shall wear silk frocks all the shades of the rainbow. Though a queen is the highest lady in the land and poor old Victoria wears nothing but black every day.</p> <p>There\u2019s a wonderful evening gown in the Draper\u2019s shop window in Biggerton. It\u2019s a rich Prussian blue, with red satin trimmings and red cut-glass beads on the bodice. Someone has arranged a pair of scarlet kid boots beside the deep blue hem, the perfect touch.</p> <p>I am here to buy flour and cheese and a dozen eggs because our old Henny Penny\u2019s stopped laying, but now I have the groceries I must have one more look at the dazzling gown.</p> <p>But when I glimpse the Draper\u2019s window the dress is missing! Has someone purchased my beautiful gown? I rush to see, and the sole on my left boot catches on a pebble. I stagger and land on my knees, juggling flour and cheese and eggs.</p> <p>The lady from the Draper\u2019s shop dashes out and picks me up.</p> <p>I burst into tears, and then duck my head, ashamed.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, child! You\u2019ve saved every single egg! But oh dear, look at the state of your boots!\u201d she says.</p> <p>The sole has torn right off, and my bare foot is touching the ground now.</p> <p>\u201cAre these your only pair?\u201d she asks gently, and I nod.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t really stock children\u2019s boots. The only footwear I have in my shop are scarlet boots to go with an evening gown, but the lady who bought it didn\u2019t care for the ensemble. They\u2019re ridiculously fancy and probably far too big for you, but you\u2019re welcome to try them,\u201d she says.</p> <p>They\u2019re a perfect fit for my big feet! The kid feels soft as a glove but the sole is stout.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re the most beautiful boots in all the world \u2013 but I couldn\u2019t possibly afford them,\u201d I say, sniffing.</p> <p>The lady looks at me. She looks at the boots.</p> <p>\u201cTake them, dear,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you start earning you can come and pay me. How about that?\u201d</p> <p>Oh joy! When I am a lady I shall buy <em>all</em> my gowns and boots from her! And though I\u2019m still an ungainly girl in a brown dress I feel like a queen.

  "<p>Until recently, one of the best British postwar ceramics collections was to be found on a council estate in east London. \u201cIt was a bit like walking into a reliquary,\u201d says the ceramicist Annie Turner, a regular visitor to the two-bed flat. \u201cYou\u2019d go into a pretty brutal-looking 1970s building and up a dull concrete stairwell and think, \u2018Am I in the right place?\u2019. Then you opened this door, and it was like entering another world.\u201d</p> <p>Behind that very ordinary front door was a treasure trove. Mostly British, French or Japanese, around 1,200 ceramic works clustered on shelves, grouped on tables and desks, and even used as planters on the tiny balcony. Among the objects were key pieces by <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaries-dame-lucie-rie-1614074.html\">Lucie Rie</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/may/29/edmund-waal-hare-amber-netsuke\">Edmund de Waal</a>, and contemporary works by <a href=\"https://cavalierofinn.com/2019/06/in-conversation-with-annie-turner-loewe-craft-prize-finalist-2019/\">Turner</a> herself, and <a href=\"https://pinupmagazine.org/articles/artist-sara-flynn-ceramicist\">Sara Flynn</a> \u2013 two award-winning artists whose prices have recently risen sharply.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"41e97c51ccc3f54e044cff7cb0099eb8d9e73ece\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41e97c51ccc3f54e044cff7cb0099eb8d9e73ece/0_0_650_650/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sara Flynn\u2019s Double Hipped Vessel (2012) from the collection.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sara Flynn\u2019s Double Hipped Vessel (2012) from the collection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of MAAK</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This collection belongs to Michael Evans, a former mechanical engineer and local government officer, who has been known by his Buddhist name Dayabandu since his ordination in the early 2000s. Dayabandu\u2019s interest in ceramics started 60 years ago when he used to visit two maiden aunts after church and admire their Doulton Lambeth stoneware pots. \u201cThey said they\u2019d give them to me as soon as I bought my own property,\u201d he told the i newspaper in <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/money/spend-save/can-ceramics-make-investors-pots-of-money-51637.html\">one of his only interviews</a>, back in 2004. The aunts kept their promise \u2013 though soon that property was more the home of the ceramics than Dayabandu. \u201cThey allow me to live with them,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople think I live in a store room.\u201d</p> <p>But many of the pieces are coming to auction this month. Dayabandu has suffered from increasingly severe vascular dementia, and the collection \u2013 instead of being a pleasure \u2013 has become a burden.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019d started getting concerned about it around 10 years ago, the same time his behaviour became more eccentric,\u201d says his friend Clive Barnett, a textile designer who lives in Suffolk. \u201cHe knew he was becoming unwell. He wanted the work to stay together, but he couldn\u2019t find anyone to take it on as a whole.\u201d Indeed various museums were happy to cherry pick; no one wanted the job lot. \u201cHe was very knowledgeable,\u201d says Barnett, \u201cbut we never quite understood why he bought certain things.\u201d</p> <p>Dayabandu\u2019s friends describe him as anything from focused to intense to obsessive. His delight was in the ceramics themselves rather than their value or maker\u2019s reputation. As he said: \u201cI don\u2019t buy for investment, I only buy what I like. I know people who regard their collection in financial terms \u2013 for the names on the bottom of their pots. For me, that\u2019s not collecting for the right reasons.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"596b8761682088d4e0a81f4ae6dbf070e5ad8238\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/596b8761682088d4e0a81f4ae6dbf070e5ad8238/0_0_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pothead heaven: inside Michael Evans\u2019s two-bed London flat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pothead heaven \u2026 inside the two-bed London flat of Michael Evans, now known by his Buddhist name Dayabandu</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artists</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once he\u2019d retired from his life in local government, the suit and tie was abandoned for jeans and leather jacket. He moved from Leicester to Sandwich in Kent, where he took a part-time degree in fine art at Canterbury and finished with a first.</p> <p>According to Barnett, his Buddhism followed a chance meeting with someone on Sandwich beach not long after the ending of a long relationship. He sold his house and downsized to the flat partly to release money to continue collecting, and partly to be near the London Buddhist Centre in Roman Road. He ate his lunch most days at the Cafe from Crisis in Commercial Street, where homeless people and ex-offenders are trained in catering. \u201cNot the sort of staff you get everywhere \u2013 he liked that,\u201d says another friend, <a href=\"https://www.martinpearceceramics.com/\">Martin Pearce</a>, a ceramicist, based near Battle.</p> <p>\u201cHe never did anything by halves, once he was interested he got really involved,\u201d continues Pearce. \u201cTo be honest, he could be abrasive. He\u2019d come to see me once or twice a month in my studio when I was still working in London, and criticise my work. But if he saw someone who was struggling or needed advice, he\u2019d really take it upon himself to sit down with them, and spend time talking it all through.\u201d Turner, another beneficiary of his time and interest, says she would spend a day at a time at his house. \u201cWe\u2019d have green tea in beautiful hand-thrown tea bowls \u2013 everything was handmade,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019d tell great stories about all the work in the flat; he\u2019d never buy anything that didn\u2019t \u2018speak\u2019 to him.\u201d His preference veered towards the natural, not the decorative, ceramic tradition; one can see the appeal of Turner\u2019s exquisitely controlled and austere work inspired by the natural fragments she collects from the River Deben in Suffolk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3ca2edf3ef30bdec24a219b8fa6d40d313238867\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ca2edf3ef30bdec24a219b8fa6d40d313238867/0_0_4312_4312/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Akiko Hirai\u2019s Sake Bottle will be auctioned by MAAK this May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Akiko Hirai\u2019s Sake Bottle will be auctioned by MAAK this May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of MAAK</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once when she was installing a six-part piece on his kitchen wall, and having trouble doing so, she recalls how he walked past and stopped in the corridor. \u201cHe just said: make sure you\u2019ve got the nails exactly straight. He was an engineer \u2013 he could tell what I was doing wrong. But he just gave me the advice from a distance. It was kind, he didn\u2019t want to make me feel stupid.\u201d (The piece is in the auction, with an estimate of \u00a3800-\u00a31,200.) Turner recalls the flat as full of big dark furniture. \u201cThere was even a big four-poster bed with curtains around it. He just wasn\u2019t afraid to fill up space,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd maybe I shouldn\u2019t say this, but there was always a big spliff, ready rolled for bed time. He often had a lot of pain,\u201d she says. Martin Pearce says that \u201che loved the austerity of Annie\u2019s work, the absolute control and the links with the River Deben\u201d. Dayabandu went there often on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jul/15/vajrasana-retreat-centre-review-suffolk-london-buddhist\">Buddhist retreats</a>.</p> <p>After being given his aunts\u2019 Doulton Lambeth pots, he went on to collect Moorcroft \u2013 20th-century British hand-painted pottery with vibrant high glazes \u2013 and then, having become increasingly enamoured of more contemporary works, he sold the lot. <a href=\"https://www.moorcroft.com/\">Moorcroft</a> had become sought after, and it was a handy way to finance this new strand of acquisition.</p> <p>\u201cHe liked being able to visit the potters, and going to fairs and open studios and talking to the makers,\u201d says Pearce. \u201cIn a way, he was really interested in people.\u201d The gallerist Matthew Hall, of London ceramic specialists <a href=\"https://www.erskinehallcoe.com/\">Erskine Hall</a>, agrees, adding: \u201cHe was always looking for the connection to the maker, an entry point to the life behind the work.\u201d Hall also visited the east London flat and remembers looking at the Buddhist shrine that Dayabandu had created there. \u201cThere was one object, a brick from the exterior of a Buddhist temple that was at least 1,500 years old. It had the figure of a robed monk on the front,\u201d says Hall. \u201cBut then he picked it up and turned it over and there was the impression of the craftsman\u2019s hand on the back. He put his own hand in that handprint. It made so much sense.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0e6e452ce1d24fc341936e1b994021b06cb09ad5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e6e452ce1d24fc341936e1b994021b06cb09ad5/0_0_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018They allow me to live with them\u2019 \u2026 ceramics on every surface of the east London flat \" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018They allow me to live with them\u2019 \u2026 ceramics on every surface of the east London flat <br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artists</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Marijke Varrall-Jones, the founder of <a href=\"https://maaklondon.irostrum.com/\">MAAK</a>, the auction house organising the Dayabandu sale, says that this won\u2019t be the first time she has broken up a collection. \u201cThey are transient things in the end,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd you have to remember, these pieces didn\u2019t start out all being together.\u201d MAAK \u2013 which specialises in ceramics and has offered a very slick online platform since it started in 2009 \u2013 will be offering nearly 200 lots in the auction Unifying Eye: The Dayabandhu Collection, including some by <a href=\"https://www.thenewcraftsmen.com/makers/akiko-hirai/\">Akiko Hirai</a>, another rising star. \u201cHe came to my studio a lot,\u201d Hirai says. \u201cHe was always looking for movement, for something kinetic and tactile in a piece of work.\u201d</p> <p>Dayabandu was amassing his collection in the noughties, a time when work by postwar practitioners including John Maltby, Ewan Henderson, <a href=\"http://www.galeriebesson.co.uk/godfrey.html\">Ian Godfrey</a> and Gordon Baldwin was still affordable. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that what counts in forming a collection is the depth of your eye and enduring curiosity, not the depth of your bank balance,\u201d says Hall. \u201cHe didn\u2019t spend excessively on a single item.\u201d So he would most likely be rather surprised by the results that are likely to emerge in May. Works by Lucie Rie have sold for upwards of \u00a3150,000 in the last few years; <a href=\"https://www.lanticgallery.co.uk/new-gallery\">John Maltby</a> and Ian Godfrey are highly sought after by younger collectors including Jonathan Anderson, the creative director of Loewe, who has himself found a passion for pots. \u201cWe saw a real change around 2016,\u201d says Varrell-Jones. \u201cOur clients used to be couples of a certain age, who\u2019d retired with a disposable income. Now it\u2019s younger collectors who want to live with handmade objects. And besides, there\u2019s room on a bookshelf for a pot.\u201d Or for 1,200 of them, if you happen to be Michael Evans.</p>",
  "<p>It is 11am LA time and Diana Gordon is feeling, as she puts it, \u201chazy\u201d. We were meant to start our interview half an hour ago, but Gordon\u2019s sleeping pattern has gone out the window, a symptom of lockdown\u2019s anxiety-tinged paranoia. There is a more practical reason, too. The day we speak, the 34-year-old singer has just released Wasted Youth, her second EP under her own name: a low-slung, eight-track collection that fuses her love for female-fronted 90s alt-rock and cranium-rattling trap. \u201cI\u2019ve been editing videos until 4am every day,\u201d she says softly. \u201cI woke up at 7am to post the EP and then I fell asleep again.\u201d</p> <p>Gordon has been her own boss since 2016, when she co-wrote three songs on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade, including the bitter kiss-off Sorry. The infamous lyric \u201cHe better call Becky with the good hair\u201d was all Gordon\u2019s doing. \u201cI still laugh at that to this day,\u201d she says when I mention the tabloid speculation over the mysterious \u201cRebecca\u201d at the heart of Jay-Z\u2019s alleged infidelity. Working with Beyonc\u00e9 gave Gordon the confidence to be herself after years of releasing more pop-leaning music under the moniker Wynter Gordon. While 2016\u2019s The Legend Of, her first single under her real name, found her playfully bragging about her new status (\u201cI just gotta fat cheque from Beyonc\u00e9\u201d), the poem she released to accompany it was more sobering. \u201cMy real name is Diana \u2026 and it\u2019s time for me to get to know her,\u201d it read.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlyA0kS1EGo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RlyA0kS1EGo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Born and raised in Queens, New York, Gordon\u2019s upbringing was tough. She didn\u2019t know her father, while her ultra-religious mother wasn\u2019t \u201cable to handle being a single mum with six kids\u201d. It fell to Gordon and her sister to keep the family together. Her mum banned secular music from the family home, so Gordon would gorge on it at her best friend\u2019s house, educating herself on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Chapman\">Trac</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Chapman\">y Chapman</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_McLachlan\">Sarah McLachlan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/09/alanis-morissette-ex-boyfriends-irony-home-births-jagged-little-pill\">Alanis Morissette</a>.</p> <p>As a teen, Gordon landed a place at New York\u2019s prestigious performing arts school LaGuardia but it didn\u2019t work out so she started working \u201ca lot of jobs\u201d. One of these was as a coat-check girl in a nightclub owned by a friend of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/05/mary-j-blige-i-lost-my-gut-and-my-gift-but-i-got-it-back\">Mary J Blige</a>. \u201cI gave him my CD, he let Mary hear my music and she gave me a beat to write on,\u201d she explains. The result was Gonna Breakthrough, the near-title track from Blige\u2019s 2005 album The Breakthrough. </p> <p>Signed to Atlantic and renamed Wynter, Gordon continued to write for others, before finding success singing the hook on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4WS_Q5Mq2s\">Flo Rida\u2019s hit Sugar</a> in 2009. She remembers being styled for photoshoots and it being the first time she\u2019d worn make-up, or high heels. \u201cThe way I grew up, I wasn\u2019t allowed to explore,\u201d she says. She quickly found herself stuck in an EDM cul-de-sac, with 2010\u2019s solo track <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38IOqcYxgqc\">Dirty Talk</a> landing her a UK Top 30 hit. As a kid, she says, she dreamed of being a \u201cpower woman\u201d like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/feb/12/whitney-houston-obituary\">Whitney</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\">Beyonc\u00e9</a> but \u201cyou don\u2019t think of being the voice on an EDM track. Well, maybe somebody has that goal, but it wasn\u2019t mine.\u201d There was also a more practical problem. \u201cAt that time, and still, I hadn\u2019t had a drop of alcohol, I didn\u2019t do any type of drugs. When you\u2019re out at 5am at a dance festival and everyone else around you is on some shit...

While she had made good money, she had been burned by managers giving themselves production credits and, thus, 50% of the profits. By 2015, she was lost. \u201cI was having anxiety all the time,\u201d she sighs. \u201cI had all these dreams of getting my family to a better place and now I felt worthless,\u201d she says. After five days without sleep, her anxiety got so bad she was admitted to the psych ward of a hospital. \u201cThe doctors sat me down and told me I was suffering from PTSD, that I needed to see a therapist and I needed to sleep,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were like: \u2018You\u2019re going to be OK.\u2019 That\u2019s when I decided to move to LA.\u201d</p> <p>Los Angeles was where Gordon got the call to work on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/24/beyonce-lemonade-review-a-woman-not-to-be-messed-with\">Lemonade</a> after some songs she had made with producer Melo-X in a Brooklyn attic seven years earlier ended up being played to Beyonc\u00e9. More miraculously, a few months after Lemonade came out, Gordon found her older brother David sleeping rough a few streets away from her new home. A person with schizophrenia who had been in and out of foster care when Gordon was young, he\u2019d been missing for 16 years. \u201cIn my heart I\u2019d put him to rest because we\u2019d been searching for so long,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Gordon poured all her trauma into 2018\u2019s tender Pure EP, but for <a href=\"https://wr.lnk.to/wastedyouth?ref=https%3A//www.youtube.com/\">Wasted Youth</a>, led by party anthem <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ES8L9DFxL5M\">Rollin</a>, she wanted to finally puff out her chest. \u201cMy friends are like: \u2018Talk your shit, you\u2019ve earned the right to say you\u2019re great,\u2019\u201d she laughs.

Banner Road\u2019s second street disco, held on a sunny weekend in Bristol, brought people out to dance and chat (all spaced by social distance markers painted on the road) and eventually join in the Macarena together.</p> <p>\u201cI was thinking of a group dance we could do and everyone knows the Macarena,\u201d says Jesse Meadows, one of the organisers, along with her three housemates. An actor, Meadows has lived on the street for six years and has been a driving force behind its community feel. A few years ago, keen to meet more neighbours, she organised a street drink. Last month, she helped set up a support group; one neighbour printed flyers, another delivered them, and their WhatsApp group now has more than 70 members who can ask for help with anything from shopping to collecting prescriptions. Meadows currently shops for a woman she has never met, leaving her groceries outside her front door. Neighbours have been sharing seeds; one resident left Easter eggs on doorsteps for the children. Before the one-hour street disco, residents from the whole street took part in a clean-up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"c1e01e08e59717cd845d810b318f8d79ffdf8d7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1e01e08e59717cd845d810b318f8d79ffdf8d7b/0_468_3879_4847/800.jpg\" alt=\"Banner Road residents Nola and Ava sit on the step outside their home\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nola and Ava watching the disco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Redman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"c3584e5fc3140da248a7eebbd739c4522ed376b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3584e5fc3140da248a7eebbd739c4522ed376b9/0_468_3879_4847/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jen Law paints social distancing markers on the road.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jen Law painting social distancing markers on the road.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Redman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Nola and Ava watching the disco, above left; Jen Law painting social distancing markers on the road.

So for her to be outside and have a bit of a dance is lovely.\u201d</p> <p>Lily Griffiths is in her mid-60s and has left her house for the first time in 30 days, to stand outside her front door and join the party. \u201cLots of people on the street are young, maybe 80%,\u201d she says, adding that it has been rewarding getting to know them. There have been other street events since lockdown; one recent Saturday, people came out of their houses to sing Happy Birthday to a neighbour.</p> <p>Most of the terrace houses on Banner Road have steps leading up to the front door and people have taken to sitting on them and chatting to neighbours passing by. \u201cHopefully, when this is all over, this sense of community will remain,\u201d Meadows says. \u201cAnd this time, we can do things in close proximity.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>\u2018Everybody used to mind their own business.

Last month he started taking portraits of the people who live on his road, having found the idea of lockdown difficult at first; he was used to travelling and meeting people for work. But if he couldn\u2019t go anywhere, he could at least turn his attention to what was happening outside his front door.</p> <p>For the past eight years Sinibaldi has lived on Evering Road in Hackney, east London, a long residential street which links the rapidly-gentrifying Clapton at one end and the more affluent Stoke Newington at the other. An attractive, leafy stretch with a mix of Victorian houses, mostly converted, and small blocks of flats, it also has a notorious past: Reggie Kray murdered Jack McVitie here in 1967.</p> <p>Sinibaldi says he stopped to talk to anybody who was outside their house. \u201cOne morning I walked out and started seeing all these people at home. You can see the traces of people\u2019s lives [through their] windows.\u201d Some tended to their front gardens, like Hasam, who is originally from Cyprus but has lived on the road for 35 years; his lush garden features the street\u2019s biggest fig tree. \u201cI photographed everybody where I met them and how I met them,\u201d Sinibaldi says, explaining why people are casually dressed, some still in their pyjamas. He photographed Mohammed, who cleans the street, and Zeynep, who delivers the post. She knows the street well, of course, and introduced Sinibaldi to Helena, who has lived here for 25 years (she always gives Zeynep a mint when she sees her).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"b4c523daed7ffcf9047c3cc40d03bd0eadba77fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4c523daed7ffcf9047c3cc40d03bd0eadba77fb/0_1308_5231_6539/800.jpg\" alt=\"Evering Road residents Karen and Vicky embracing in their garden\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karen and Vicky decided to join forces, swapping keys,<br>removing their fence and cooking together.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"f803aeb33cfbffb7bec71ce78d8bb662333593fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f803aeb33cfbffb7bec71ce78d8bb662333593fd/1188_2498_4101_5126/800.jpg\" alt=\"Joyce, who has lived on Evering Road for 50 years\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joyce has lived on Evering Road for 50 years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Above left: Karen and Vicky decided to join forces, swapping keys, removing their fence and cooking together.

Before lockdown, he knew four or five people on Evering Road; now, he\u2019s met around 100. While there has been a large influx of younger people, he was interested in the residents who were here long before the coffee shops and pop-up art galleries. Joyce has lived on the road for 50 years and is close to her neighbour, Helena. Desmond has lived in the area for 63 years, and told Sinibaldi he is \u201csimply missing the freedom to walk around. We don\u2019t think about freedom, in the same way we don\u2019t think about our feet until we are unable to walk.\u201d</p> <p>Taking these photographs has changed his relationship with his street, Sinibaldi says. It\u2019s one thing to walk down it on the way to somewhere else, \u201cit\u2019s another to \u2018observe\u2019 it. I\u2019ve made a lot of new friends, and been promised lots of barbecues and beers when we\u2019re all allowed to meet up in the future.

They asked Walsh to take care of it, \u201cbecause they know I\u2019m not shy. We saw song being used in Italy in the bad times, and I know that this whole thing has really brought us together.

It is already a road with an active community spirit: there have been annual street parties since 2012. Once the country went into lockdown, one resident, Sonia, coordinated the delivery of flyers to every house, offering support to people. Those with gardens have been cutting flowers and leaving them on the doorsteps of neighbours who live in flats. Others have been sharing the bread they\u2019ve baked, or swapping plants. People have been decluttering and recycling things to other households. One man, Parin, who lives in a neighbouring street, has been running a popular curry-cooking club on Google hangouts. And now there is the Sunday-morning disco.</p> <p>\u201cI think there are a lot of good things coming out of what is a very difficult time,\u201d says Rob Cockburn, a lawyer and one of the DJs behind the event. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why we should only have this strength of community in adverse times. We should remind ourselves to keep this going.\u201d</p> <p>People observe social distancing but come out in the street to dance, or just sway by their front gates. \u201cRob normally puts on a costume,\u201d says Simon Lycett, who runs an event floristry company. \u201cSome of the kids will get their coloured chalks out and scribble on the pavement, and people will jig around in the street.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a336ab0e58ec9c0af28db853dd7db086b90ee644\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a336ab0e58ec9c0af28db853dd7db086b90ee644/15_1560_4211_2525/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlie and Idris look out of a window with a rainbow picture stuck to the glass\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlie and Idris enjoy the music.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Orlando Gili/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Above: Charlie and Idris enjoy the music.

She is a single mother to two children, and a rescue bulldog. She lives with several chronic health conditions and recently spent 10 weeks in hospital, before being discharged into the lockdown, so needs to shield herself.

The global African diaspora has put pressure on African embassies and institutions to act. Last weekend the Kenyan government announced plans to allow its citizens stranded in China to be evacuated.</p> <p>The official Chinese responses were at first silence or denial. State media such as Global Times and Xinhua failed to report the story in the first few days after the news broke in African news outlets. Later, the Chinese authorities began to recognise the reports of racism as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/chinese-official-claims-racial-targeting-reasonable-concerns\">reasonable concerns</a>\u201d, though migrants continue to feel unsafe.</p> <p>To outsiders, this horrendous racism may appear \u201cunprecedented\u201d. But ethnic minorities in China would find it all too familiar. In Shaoguan, not far from Guangzhou, the racist murder of two Uighur workers in 2009 triggered a series of events, such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_2009_%C3%9Cr%C3%BCmqi_riots\">\u00dcr\u00fcmqi Inciden</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_2009_\u00dcr\u00fcmqi_riots\">t</a>, which led to further repression in the north-western region of Xinjiang.</p> <p>The ideology of \u201crace\u201d in China goes back a long way.

National revival has been a key ideological driver behind modernisation. </p> <p>Today, assimilationism is at the centre of the concept of nation. <em>Minzu</em>, a key term used interchangeably for both ethnic group and nationality, refers to a group of common descent, with a distinct culture and territory.</p> <p>In 2012, Xi Jinping began his rule by saying: \u201cThe China dream gathers Chinese aspirations and wishes for generations and manifests the interests of the whole Chinese nation (<em>zhonghua minzu</em>) \u2026\u201d The \u201cChina dream\u201d became the political-economic programme for \u201cthe realisation of the great revival of the Chinese nation\u201d.</p> <p>This century is the \u201cChinese century\u201d, Xi said. His multibillion-dollar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/what-china-belt-road-initiative-silk-road-explainer\">Belt and Road Initiative</a> was launched in 2013 as a massive global investment programme.

China now holds <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2018/04/16/competing-in-africa-china-the-european-union-and-the-united-states/\">14% of the total debt stock</a> in sub-Saharan Africa and has become the largest owner of public debt in Africa.</p> <p>China\u2019s growing presence brought with it labour migration from African countries from the late 1990s. People from Nigeria, Mali, Kenya, Senegal, Ghana and other west African countries came for work opportunities, mostly in the metropolis of Guangzhou. Many work in the city\u2019s wholesale markets as other types of employment, including factory work, are closed to them. It\u2019s commonly said by them that Africans are often \u201caccepted as traders but discriminated against as people\u201d. There are currently more than 15,000 African migrants with formal immigration status living in Guangzhou.</p> <p>Although China has the lowest immigration in the world (migrants account for just <a href=\"https://qz.com/1163632/china-still-has-the-smallest-share-of-incoming-migrants-in-the-world/\">0.07% of the population</a>), the authorities impose harsh \u201cmigrant management\u201d. African migrants can often be criminalised in a similar way to the internal migrants from the countryside. Apart from immigration checks and crackdowns, the authorities consistently discourage migrants from living in certain neighbourhoods. There is no legal protection against racial discrimination.</p> <p>The Covid-19 crisis has highlighted this longstanding anti-African racism. With all the damage this pandemic has done to the economy and people\u2019s livelihoods, scapegoating and hostility towards an imagined outside threat clearly helps to divert domestic frustration away from the ruling elite \u2013 a trend we are all seeing worldwide.

  "<p>Given that my response to the start of the Gulf war was to write that night in my diary, \u201cRenewed my membership to the New Kids On The Block fanclub!!!!\u201d, I am very familiar with being accused of caring too much about frivolity in times of gravity. The day Diana died, I made the schlep to Kensington Palace to see the flowers; but I also stopped in at Tower Records afterwards to buy an album (Backstreet Boys by the Backstreet Boys: Diana would have approved). Even now, when I know I should be spending every spare minute studying a long read about contagion/China/capitalism, I am instead reading Craig Brown\u2019s ridiculously enjoyable new biography of the Beatles, One Two Three Four. Because, sure, we\u2019re living through history. But did you know that Ringo once tried to save money on house repairs by buying his own building company?</p> <p>At the time of writing, the British lockdown has lasted a month and, initially, it was pretty much all I could talk about: the fear, the weirdness, the uncertainty. \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d my friends and I would sigh down the phone to each other, because when you have no idea what to say but think you need to say <em>something</em>, you turn into an Alison Steadman character. But after a certain point, there isn\u2019t \u2013 if you\u2019re lucky \u2013 much else to say. If you and your family are well and have enough to eat, what\u2019s your conversation going to be? \u201cYup, still inside. Still washing my hands. Doing the same tomorrow \u2013 catch up then?\u201d If the lockdown experience was a movie, even Terrence Malick would be thinking, \u201cYou know what? This story really needs some plot.\u201d</p> <p>Slowly, we have started talking about other things: celebrity gossip, sharing photos of outfits and hair experiments \u2013 things that have nothing to do with the virus. \u201cSorry for mentioning this <em>now</em>\u2026\u201d a friend will begin, a version of a sentiment you see a lot on social media, usually in relation to any article that dares to be about something other than the virus. \u201cDoes this writer not know <em>people are dying</em>?\u201d is the traditional format. It\u2019s always tempting to respond, \u201cNo, they totally didn\u2019t! Thank God you\u2019ve let them know \u2013 they thought the whole world was doing a re-enactment of Shaun Of The Dead!\u201d</p> <p>I may have mentioned this once or a million times, but I recently published a book about my family\u2019s lives through the 20th century, including during the second world war. I don\u2019t have much time for politicians who make the link between all of us having to stay inside and our grandparents trying not to be bombed, but one of my favourite discoveries while researching the book has been on my mind recently. Throughout the war, despite being in hiding in Poland and France, my relatives somehow managed to write to one another. They were in enormous danger, and yet their letters were only occasionally about the conflict. Instead, they mainly complained: which daughter-in-law wasn\u2019t showing enough respect, which father snored too loudly. I loved all this, not just because it confirmed that I come by my pettiness naturally, but because it proves that human nature will always reassert itself, like weeds re-growing on a charred landscape after a natural disaster.</p> <p>For this reason, I would argue very strongly in defence of thinking, talking and writing about extremely stupid stuff that has nothing to do with the current hellishness. I don\u2019t mean posting twee photos of just-baked bread, or attempting to read Finnegans Wake. You are only doing those things because of the virus; they are coronactivities, and therefore do not count.

  "<p>Research to find a cure and effective treatment for Covid-19 is well under way, with <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01010-7\">hundreds of trials</a> already announced. But very few involve African researchers, and this is a mistake.</p> <p>Although Africa has yet to feel the full force of the coronavirus, preventing severe cases is a higher priority than it is elsewhere. Africa needs research that is tailored to our reality.</p> <p>Even hospitals in New York are overwhelmed; hospitals in many African countries barely have enough ventilators to fill one room. So research needs to be directed towards preventing hospitalisations, potentially though treatment of mild cases as early as possible.</p> <p>If research is not conducted in Africa, potential life-saving innovations will be delayed, not least because regulatory authorities in Africa will require local data on Covid-19 patients to register any new drug.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Local researchers are also more likely to maintain the trust of the population.

I have dedicated my career to developing better treatments for kala-azar, the \u201cblack fever\u201d, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/may/18/hope-in-battle-against-deadliest-disease-youve-never-heard-of\">deadly parasitic illness</a> that affects the most vulnerable people across eastern Africa. Too many patients \u2013 especially children \u2013 die because of the lack of effective tests and treatments for this disease.</p> <p>I see doctors on the news in New York and Milan telling their harrowing experiences of battling for patients with Covid-19 in the absence of a cure. As it knocks on our doors, I see their helplessness as a mirror of my own: when the treatment you need to save a life simply does not exist.</p> <p>I believe that our response to Covid-19 can be informed by our experience with kala-azar research.</p> <p>To find an effective treatment, I have travelled to the remotest areas of Kenya to sit with local leaders and gain their trust \u2013 explaining why clinical trials are vital to their communities. They have welcomed us as African researchers. As the Covid-19 threat looms, I feel this goodwill is at risk.</p> <p>In 2003, scientists, doctors and ministries of health from Kenya, Sudan, Ethiopia and, eventually, Uganda, decided that we needed to set our own research priorities for kala-azar. Collectively, we ran large multi-country clinical trials to improve the toxic, ineffective, burdensome treatment options for kala-azar at the time.</p> <p>It was not easy \u2013 clinical sites were in areas marked by conflict and extreme poverty. But we endured, bringing clinical trial sites up to international standards, and together delivered an effective, shorter-course treatment that is now recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).</p> <p>We need to now come together in the same spirit to develop adapted solutions for Covid-19 in Africa.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/solidarity-clinical-trial-for-covid-19-treatments\">Solidarity</a> trial being run by the WHO has begun to include African countries, which is a good sign.

  "<p>Every technological innovation both changes its human users and uncovers something new about our nature. In this ingenious novel, Argentinian author Samanta Schweblin conducts an unnerving thought experiment: if an individual could be virtually inserted into the life of a random stranger, anywhere in the world, what effects would that have on them both? And what hidden truths would be revealed?</p> <p><em>Little Eyes</em> follows her gripping 2017 novella <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/24/fever-dream-by-samanta-schweblin-review\">Fever Dream</a></em>, a destabilising parable about GM farming and maternal anxiety, and a story collection of domestic surrealism, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/09/mouthful-of-birds-by-samanta-schweblin-review\">Mouthful of Birds</a></em>; all three books have been long- or shortlisted for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/man-booker-international-prize\">International Booker</a>. In her new novel the gadget that\u2019s sweeping the globe is called a kentuki. It\u2019s not much more, says one character, than \u201ca cell phone with legs\u201d, but the camera and speaker are housed within the felt-covered, remotely propelled body of a toy animal \u2013 rabbit or panda, dragon or crow, the buyer or \u201ckeeper\u201d decides. What the keeper can\u2019t choose is who the \u201cdweller\u201d connecting with the robot and watching online is, while dwellers have no control over where, and with whom, they \u201cwake up\u201d. As with a human life, the stakes are high; there is one connection per kentuki, one mind per body. When the keeper destroys their pet or forgets to charge its batteries, or the dweller disconnects, it\u2019s game over, no replays. If death is what gives life reality, the life of a kentuki is real.</p> <p>Schweblin familiarises the reader by artful degrees, introducing us to dwellers and keepers around the world, all reacting differently to the new gizmos. For Emilia in Peru, globalisation has meant profound loss; her grown-up son has been \u201csnatched away\u201d to Hong Kong for a glittering career. When he gives her a connection, she turns on her computer and wakes up in a flat in Germany, where she enjoys being a pet bunny for a young woman: attention at last, and day-to-day intimacy. In Mexico, purposeless Alina finds herself choosing between a crow and a dragon for \u201cthe miraculous distraction\u201d of unboxing a new product. In Antigua, a stifled little boy called Marvin who is grieving for his mother wakes up at the top of the globe and goes looking for snow: \u201cAt least in this other life, he wouldn\u2019t let himself be locked up.\u201d Italian Enzo falls into easy companionship with the mole that follows him around his greenhouse. And the consequences of capitalism never stop evolving: in Zagreb Grigor starts a business buying and tending connections through multiple tablets, so he can offer tailor-made experiences to those who want more consumer choice than the market officially offers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Alina wants to keep her crow as a toy, but gradually it becomes the conduit and eventually target for her rage and shame</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There has always been a tinge of horror to Schweblin\u2019s work, and here she gets full effect from violent interludes where the connections go sour. That hoary staple of an inanimate object coming alive can be just as frightening when you\u2019ve paid for it to happen \u2013 even, or perhaps especially, when it\u2019s a cuddly panda rolling closer with unknown intent. But as she works through the implications of her premise in a nimble, fast-moving narrative, what\u2019s most impressive is the way she foregrounds her characters\u2019 inner hopes and fears.</p> <p>The kentuki can hear and translate speech, but only respond with animal-appropriate squeaks or purrs, so the first issue is always communication: whether dweller and keeper will connect in the wider world. For Alina, the relationship is about control. She wants to keep her crow as nothing more than a toy, but gradually it becomes the conduit and eventually target for her rage and shame. Marvin finds he has more power and agency when negotiating the world as a kentuki: \u201cMarvin was no longer a boy with a dragon; he was a dragon with a boy inside him.\u201d When the characters happen by chance to glimpse their kentuki selves, they feel an overwhelming tenderness for the ball of plastic and felt that is the vessel for their consciousness. In a disassociated world, they are seeing themselves at last.</p> <p>Like Mohsin Hamid\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/02/exit-west-mohsin-hamid-review-andrew-motion-migrants\">Exit West</a>, in which magical doors act as portals out of conflict zones, <em>Little Eyes</em> has much to say about connection and empathy in a globalised world. On a personal level, its investigation into solitude and online experience becomes only more poignant in a global lockdown. Marvin has never seen snow; he longs to roll his little dragon into an untouched snowbank, to leave his mark. It would be \u201cjust like touching the other end of the world with your own fingertips\u201d. If a virtual reality is all we can have, we will still reach out to explore its limits.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Little Eyes by Samanta Schweblin, translated by Megan McDowell, is published by Oneworld (RRP \u00a314.99).

  "<p>\ufeffFrom the moment in 1976 that Serbian and German performance artists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/marina-abramovic\">Marina Abramovi\u0107 </a>and Ulay (Frank Uwe Laysiepen, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/02/a-pioneer-and-provocateur-performance-artist-ulay-dies-aged-76\">died last month</a> aged 76) clapped eyes on each other they were inseparable. Ulay found Abramovi\u0107 witchy and otherworldly; she found him wild and exciting. Even their initial encounter was propitious: they met in Amsterdam on their shared birthday of 30 November.</p> <p>The pair began to perform together, describing themselves as a \u201ctwo-headed body\u201d. For years they lived a nomadic lifestyle, travelling across Europe in a corrugated iron van and performing in villages and towns. Their artistic collaborations matched their personalities: they focused on performances that put them in precarious and physically demanding situations, to see how they and their audience would respond. In one, called Relation in Time, they remained tied together by their hair for 17 hours. They explored conflict, taking their ideas to extremes: running full pelt into each other, naked, and slapping each other\u2019s faces until they could take no more.</p> <p>One of their pieces, Rest Energy, performed in Dublin in 1980, saw them balance each other on opposite sides of a drawn bow and arrow, with the arrow pointed at Abramovi\u0107\u2019s heart; one slip from Ulay and he could have killed her. Uncomfortable viewing, this was relationship therapy played out as art \u2013 and, perhaps, vice versa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa186172e57b5024f4b37a70b619f6878ce293f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa186172e57b5024f4b37a70b619f6878ce293f4/0_164_5328_3197/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marina and Ulay perform Rest Energy in 1980.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marina and Ulay perform Rest Energy in 1980.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gryf/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1983, Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay announced their ultimate collaboration: The Lovers. They proposed to be the first people to walk the Great Wall of China. Setting off alone from opposite ends, they planned to meet in the middle, where they would marry. Exhilarated by the emotional and physical scale of The Lovers, the pair imagined themselves walking alone across great expanses of the Chinese landscape, camping under the stars and concluding the journey with the ultimate commitment. They saw The Lovers as an odyssey and a performance in which they alone would be both players and audience.</p> <p>Eager to prepare, and ever-practical, Ulay laid in a year\u2019s supply of dried tofu and seaweed, together with tents and camping stoves. What the pair were less prepared for, however, was Chinese bureaucracy. The Beijing authorities struggled to comprehend the pair\u2019s motives for the journey. No one camped or walked the Great Wall as an \u201cart project\u201d. And who in their right minds would want to get married on it? Paper trails were endless. Permissions and visas were granted then denied. The pair were told that it would be too dangerous to do the walk alone and they would be required to have an accompanying crew. As phone calls, letters and documents were fired back and forth between China and the artists, years rolled by.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9fa58bedea93bf58eb5a10df6441888e7cfd9d49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fa58bedea93bf58eb5a10df6441888e7cfd9d49/130_0_3732_2242/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial view of the Great Wall of China\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aerial view of the Great Wall.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Real444/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1986, they went to China to visit parts of the Great Wall, to familiarise themselves with it and meet some of the villagers they would be staying with. Permission was finally granted for the walk to take place the following year. Then, inexplicably, the authorities postponed it again. A frustrated Ulay confessed: \u201cI have been living with the wall in my thoughts for five years. Already I feel I have walked it 10 times. Already it is worn, it is polished.\u201d </p> <p>Finally, having also agreed to participate in a film of their \u201cstudy\u201d of The Great Wall for Chinese Central Television, they were granted permission.</p> <p>Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay began their walks on 30 March 1988, from either end of the Great Wall, known to the Chinese as The Sleeping Dragon. Abramovi\u0107, set off westwards from the dragon\u2019s head at the Bohai Sea, an extension of the Yellow Sea between China and the Korean peninsula. Dressed in baggy red clothes, she was given the nickname Pa Ma Ta Je \u2013 big fat sister mother.</p> <p>Much of her trek proved arduous. Abramovi\u0107 was walking through the mountainous regions of eastern China. On such difficult and inaccessible terrain, she had to watch every step. On her fourth day, after slipping on rocks as slippery as polished ice, Abramovi\u0107 and her guide found themselves hanging by their fingertips over an abyss. She found homes and stables built into sections of the winding wall, and other parts that had been dismantled by locals who, under Mao\u2019s encouragement to \u201ckill the dragon\u201d, had removed the clay and stones to build with. Once, Abramovi\u0107 claimed to have walked through a kilometre of human bones. Her accommodation in villages and hostels each night was often a two-hour trek from the wall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f4e906721f95a251ad568abfbe9e763e11b22f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f4e906721f95a251ad568abfbe9e763e11b22f1/0_49_1188_713/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marina Abramovic on the wall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marina Abramovi\u0107 found much of the walk arduous.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: publicdelivery.org</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At every village she stayed in, Abramovi\u0107 asked to meet its oldest resident and for them to share a local legend. Inevitably these were dragon stories, often related to the wall itself. While built more than a 1,000 years as a defence against invaders from the north and west, the serpentine spine of the Great Wall had been carefully mapped out by geomancers for its \u201cdragon energy\u201d. Abramovi\u0107 would occasionally find copper pots placed along the wall, as energy spots: acupuncture points to control the forces that rippled up and down the creature\u2019s back.</p> <p>Five thousand kilometres west of Abramovi\u0107, Ulay had started his walk at the dragon\u2019s tail in the Gobi Desert. Moustachioed and lean, with long hair and matching bright-blue drawstring trousers and cape, Ulay would have looked to a westerner every bit the bohemian traveller. Most of his journey would be spent trekking through China\u2019s deserts. Rickshaws and donkeys were familiar sights, as were camels pulling ploughs. Ulay crossed the great Yellow River on a raft covered with sheepskins and, like Abramovi\u0107, saw families living in caves within the wall itself. He managed to sleep under the stars some nights, while his bemused crew watched over him from their jeeps. Most of the time, however, Ulay also had to sleep in nearby villages. While the simplicity of the trek stirred Ulay\u2019s soul, its fragmentation by bureaucracy and restrictions meant it was not the romantic sojourn the pair had dreamed of.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dc4407d3b37bd577d7ecc4d6a83b16ec6949f23a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc4407d3b37bd577d7ecc4d6a83b16ec6949f23a/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Great Wall of China is a collective name for fortifications that started being built in the seventh century BC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Great Wall of China is a collective name for fortifications that started being built in the seventh century BC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zhaojiankang/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To the Chinese who encountered the artists, they were of great curiosity. Having originally believed themselves to be the sole players and audience for their walk, they found everything they did was witnessed as if a performance. In towns and villages, silent crowds followed them wherever they went. In one settlement, villagers gathered to watch Abramovi\u0107 sleep. When she awoke, a different group were present, silently observing her.</p> <p>More by happenstance than planning, Ulay and Abramovi\u0107 met at the centre of a stone bridge in Shenmu in Shaanxi province, among a series of temples built in the Ming dynasty. They had averaged 20km a day, walked 90 days and covered roughly 2,000km each. As they embraced affectionately, Ulay shared with Abramovi\u0107 his desire to continue the walk \u201cforever\u201d. Abramovi\u0107 was unequivocal in her desire to get home. Ulay made a comment about her shoes that seemed to annoy her; to his irritation she began to cry.</p> <p>While musicians, the Chinese press and even a fireworks display had been laid on for the pair, there would be no wedding ceremony. After a press conference in Beijing, they returned separately to Amsterdam and didn\u2019t speak or see one another for 22 years. What had gone wrong?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"605b9277eb9e6afdd1e984682e3116eff92f2b67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/605b9277eb9e6afdd1e984682e3116eff92f2b67/63_80_1411_847/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ulay and Marina approach each other at the end of their trek.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ulay and Marina approach each other at the end of their trek.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: publicdelivery.org</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the five years that Ulay and Abramovi\u0107 had been waiting for permission for the walk, their lives had changed irrevocably. Their work had became internationally renowned. Abramovi\u0107 was fed up with being the archetypal poor artist, so she welcomed the success, but Ulay had no interest in celebrity. An anarchist who enjoyed solitude, he rebelled against what he saw as a growing commercialisation of their work. In short, they had grown apart. Both had had affairs; communication and trust had broken down.</p> <p>Ulay and Abramovi\u0107 were not, however, the kind of couple to be easily defeated. They decided to go ahead with the walk, not in order to marry but to spilt up. The Lovers transformed from wedding to divorce. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just make a phone call and break up like normal people?\u201d one friend allegedly quipped.

Walking the dragon\u2019s spine had, for Ulay and Abramovi\u0107, been intended as a great motif for transcending the barriers that divide us \u2013 it was to be a totem of love and reconnection. Instead, the wall came to represent a division in myriad forms, not just physical but also the political barriers they then perceived between east and west, as well as the emotional barriers that had grown between the pair. Since planning to walk the wall, their differences had become more apparent and more difficult to reconcile. Abramovi\u0107 embraced the growing success of their work; Ulay withdrew from it.</p> <p>Unlike in China, the dragon in western mythology is perceived as a symbol of malevolence, a destructive creature to be hunted down and destroyed. Abramovi\u0107 claimed that the idea for The Lovers came to her in a dream, a vision in which the pair would wake a sleeping dragon through their epic walk. They had, it seemed, woken the wrong dragon.</p> <p>Over the next two decades, Abramovi\u0107\u2019s work continued to reach larger and larger audiences; her celebrity grew. Her work inspired Lady Gaga and Jay-Z, she made adverts for Adidas and she came to be known as \u201cthe grandmother of performance art\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04e944d5cd38da8aba296ec1913f494f5212dcad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04e944d5cd38da8aba296ec1913f494f5212dcad/623_316_2977_1786/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ulay and Marina sit opposite each other in 2010\u2019s The Artist is Present.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ulay and Marina sit opposite each other in 2010\u2019s The Artist is Present.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick McMullan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2010, at a New York Museum of Modern Art retrospective of her work entitled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/05/marina-abramovic-artist-present-review\">The Artist Is Present</a>, Abramovi\u0107 sat for eight hours a day \u2013 750 hours in total \u2013 in silence, at a table. Members of the public were invited to come, sit and hold her gaze. They were kept two metres apart at opposite ends of a table. Contact was not permitted. The show was spiritual and cathartic for some, pretentious and self-indulgent to others. Many queued for hours for the opportunity to sit opposite Abramovi\u0107 for a few minutes or, in a few cases \u2013 and to the irritation of those in the queue \u2013 the whole day.</p> <p>One moment, however, was to capture the world\u2019s attention and amass close to 20 million views on YouTube. On the opening night of the show, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS0Tg0IjCp4\">Ulay made a surprise appearance, </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS0Tg0IjCp4\"> step</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS0Tg0IjCp4\">pping from the audience to sit and face his former lover</a>. He nervously stretches his legs, adjusts his jacket and, as Abramovi\u0107 opens her eyes to see him, the pair smile. It is the first time in 22 years that they have seen each other. Tears fill their eyes.</p> <p>Finally Abramovi\u0107, in a flowing blood-red dress, leans across the two-metre division and \u2013 breaking her own rule of non-contact \u2013 takes Ulay\u2019s hands. Onlookers begin to applaud. It is impossible to watch this moment without also being moved to tears. After their arduous journey and a long time apart, they are finally reunited. A new dragon is awakened. Intimacy is rekindled.</p> <p>While their separation was a choice, ours \u2013 for now \u2013 remains a necessity. In time, physical intimacy will return to us all. And with it, perhaps, the opportunity for us all to awaken a new dragon.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s easy to forget just how much sex there is in Sally Rooney\u2019s Normal People, when many of its greatest romantic beats are carried in a furtive glance or something left unsaid. But when putting the novel\u2019s most intimate scenes between Marianne and Connell on screen, what was once a matter of lines on the page becomes minutes of closeups on flushed and sweaty skin.</p> \n<p>Every sex scene in the BBC\u2019s much-anticipated adaptation, starting on Sunday, even the clumsiest teenage fumblings \u2013 a bra getting stuck over Marianne\u2019s head, Connell tripping over his trousers \u2013 was carefully choreographed by Ita O\u2019Brien, an \u201cintimacy coordinator\u201d who makes sure actors are comfortable while filming rumpy pumpy. Over the last decade, intimacy coordinators have become more commonplace on theatre, film and TV sets, particularly in the aftermath of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s fall. Suddenly, producers and directors are falling over themselves to hire someone like O\u2019Brien, who has worked on everything from Netflix\u2019s Sex Education to HBO\u2019s Watchmen and BBC\u2019s Gangs of London.</p> \n<p>O\u2019Brien, who has trained as a ballet dancer since she was three, and has worked as an actor herself, says she should be regarded as akin to a stunt coordinator. \u201cI once called the role \u2018intimacy director\u2019, which was completely wrong, I made lots of directors very nervous,\u201d she says. \u201cBut just like a stunt coordinator, I\u2019m trying to improve communication, streamline production, serve the director\u2019s vision and bring my skill of choreography and dance to the set.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"71684261bff96acf127e3c5118232e48194edc5c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71684261bff96acf127e3c5118232e48194edc5c/0_1_1467_1833/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ita O\u2019Brien.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I made lots of directors very nervous\u2019 \u2026 Ita O\u2019Brien.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicholas Dawkes Photography</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On a normal day on Normal People, O\u2019Brien would meet with the directors, Lenny Abrahamson and Hettie Macdonald, then visit the actors, Paul Mescal and Daisy Edgar-Jones, to check for any nerves. Then after quickly popping in to wardrobe to make sure they had enough genital guards, she\u2019d head to set, making a plan for every significant moment in a scene, \u201cwhere is a gaze, where is a touch, where does a no become a yes\u201d.</p> \n<p>Once on set, \u201cDaisy, Paul and I would talk through where they could touch each other, where they could kiss each other \u2013 as an example, in the early scenes Daisy had to wear a wig, so she had a rule about Paul not running fingers through her hair,\u201d O\u2019Brien explains. \u201cWhile that might sound banal, it is really important because an actor doesn\u2019t want to have to worry about that while filming sex, they want to be relaxed.\u201d</p> \n<p>Then, when everyone is ready, time for a quick hug as an icebreaker \u2013 and filming can begin.</p> \n<p>In interviews, Edgar-Jones and Mescal have raved about O\u2019Brien. \u201cShe\u2019s the go-to,\u201d Mescal told the Observer, while Edgar-Jones called her \u201cbrilliant \u2026 it was her job to worry about how it would work and we just turned up, did the choreography and carried on\u201d. But director Lenny Abrahamson has cheerfully admitted that he was anxious about working with O\u2019Brien, \u201cbecause I thought the most subtle and important moments would be between me and the actors.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cBut working with Ita, it was a lovely creative conversation and there was always a way in which they could say no. They were encouraged to talk about whether they felt OK or not. \u201cIt was never, \u2018Will you do that?\u2019\u201d he told the Observer.</p> \n<p>O\u2019Brien laughs: \u201cI didn\u2019t know that Lenny was sceptical when we first met. But he knew very quickly that I wasn\u2019t there to get between him and Daisy or Paul. I\u2019m there to provide some professional structure that hasn\u2019t been there before.\u201d</p> \n<p>Not all of her experiences are as happy as Normal People. She recalls one director shouting at his actors: \u201cGive her a good rogering, harder, harder, harder!\u201d (\u201cI had to say, \u2018Can we maybe pause and talk about penetration and the rhythm of intercourse?\u2019\u201d she said). And while demand for her skills is higher, O\u2019Brien feels that she is often viewed as a tick box by producers and directors who want to be seen as observing best practice in the wake of #MeToo, but don\u2019t want to provide it.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis year, more than ever, I\u2019ve worked for producers who don\u2019t actually want me there, who say to me, \u2018Come in, get our nudity waivers ready and then stand back and do nothing\u2019,\u201d she says. She describes one set, where an actor asked for help while performing her first ever oral sex scene. \u201cThe director refused her a rehearsal and I stepped in and the director said, \u2018Well, you\u2019re directing now.\u2019 It\u2019s absolutely awful and the poor actors are then working in this terrible atmosphere. I\u2019m still encountering this and it feels like I\u2019m on the frontline of a war.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rooney herself has likened sex scenes to just another form of dialogue; for O\u2019Brien, the sex in Normal People \u201cisn\u2019t just there to show us sex \u2013 those scenes chart the delicacy, the beauty, the openness of this incredible, something-other relationship. It was crucial for me to honour Sally\u2019s writing. There is nothing gratuitous. But there is also <em>a lot</em> of sex.\u201d</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p089gyp5\">The first episide of Normal People screens on Monday at 9pm BST on BBC One</a>.</p></li> \n</ul>",
  "<p>Thelma Wright Edwards knows this is the last chance for justice for Emmett Till. The next few weeks and months will determine whether there will ever be closure for her beloved cousin \u201cBobo\u201d, as the family affectionately call the child.</p> <p>The Guardian has learned that a reinvestigation of the boy\u2019s murder that has been carried out by the FBI over the past three years could be wrapped up in weeks. For Thelma and the rest of the Till family, a decades-long struggle for justice is fast approaching its conclusion.</p> <p>In August, it will be 65 years since the battered and bloated body of the 14-year-old Till was fished from the muddy waters of the Tallahatchie River in Mississippi. His kidnapping, torture and murder on 28 August 1955 for having whistled at a white woman was a defining moment of postwar American history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"90e84b49567e5e201fc2c649d97fc5a0db5812b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90e84b49567e5e201fc2c649d97fc5a0db5812b3/0_0_1837_3000/612.jpg\" alt=\"An undated portrait shows Emmett Till, a black 14-year-old Chicago boy, who was brutally murdered near Money, Mississippi, Aug. 31, 1955, after whistling at a white woman.\" width=\"612\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An undated portrait shows Emmett Till, a black 14-year-old Chicago boy, who was brutally murdered near Money, Mississippi, on 28 August 1955.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It set in train a sequence of events that led African Americans in the south to make an unprecedented stand, sparking the civil rights movement.

In all those 65 years, not a single person has been held accountable for the teenager\u2019s death.</p> <p>Not a day has been spent in jail nor a penny paid in compensation. In the only trial ever to be held after Emmett\u2019s body was retrieved from the river, the two white men who later confessed to murdering him were acquitted by an all-white, all-male jury, and spent the rest of their lives in freedom.</p> <p>The FBI decided <a href=\"https://apnews.com/719f1c4c2daf4d72a720d56000ccacda/Official:-Renewed-Emmett-Till-probe-prompted-by-2017-book\">to revisit the case in 2017</a> in the light of new leads concerning the woman who Emmett whistled at \u2013 Carolyn Bryant. What the FBI may or may not have discovered about her role in the abduction of the boy and the aftermath of the murder amounts to the final hope for resolution in the case.</p> <p>Two white men confessed to the murder: Roy Bryant, Carolyn Bryant\u2019s husband, and his half-brother JW Milam. Both men are dead, as are all other individuals directly linked to the events leading up to the killing. With one exception: Carolyn Bryant, and even she is understood to be in poor health.</p> <p>As a result, the Till family knows that if justice is ever to be done, it must be done now.</p> <p>\u201cI have never got over the shock and pain of losing Emmett, it was barbaric what they did to him, he was just a kid,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting 65 years and still nothing.

In it, Bryant is quoted by author Timothy Tyson as saying \u201cThat part\u2019s not true\u201d, referring to her allegation that the boy had sexually accosted her.</p> <p>Carolyn Bryant\u2019s apparent recantation, her admission that she had lied to the court during the only trial ever to take place over the murder, was so significant it sparked the FBI\u2019s current investigation. The Guardian has learned that as soon as the FBI began reinvestigating the Till case three years ago, following the publication of Tyson\u2019s book, the author handed over all his manuscripts and notes on the murder to detectives.</p> <p>That included a manuscript that Carolyn Bryant had written and had given him for safe keeping. Tyson classifies the writings in his book as an \u201cunpublished memoir\u201d with the title More Than a Wolf Whistle.</p> <p>Tyson had agreed with Bryant that her manuscript, together with tape recordings of the interviews she gave the author, would be held at the Southern Historical Collection at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill\u2019s Wilson library. The documents and tapes are stored among Tyson\u2019s wider collection of research materials and as part of the agreement have been placed under a routine archival stipulation that they remain closed to the public until 2036 or until Bryant dies, whichever comes sooner.</p> <p>Tyson told the Guardian that having deliberated about the matter, he came to the conclusion that the FBI\u2019s investigation into such a critical case trumped the archival agreement he had reached with Bryant. He added that her manuscript, which he had correctly but perhaps unwisely termed a \u201cmemoir\u201d, was of little or no value to investigators.</p> <p>It runs to a mere 30 pages and is not complete. Tyson went as far as to describe the document as \u201cflimsy\u201d.</p> <p>To add to the complexity of the FBI\u2019s job in revisiting the case, since Tyson\u2019s book came out<a href=\"https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2018/08/24/what-did-carolyn-bryant-say-and-when/1030483002/\"> the Bryant family has denied</a> that she ever recanted her 1955 testimony.

For that insolence, for that violation of the rules of white supremacy, Roy Bryant and Milam took the boy from his bed in the middle of the night, drove him in a pickup truck to Milam\u2019s shed and tortured him over several hours.</p> <p>Witnesses passing by said they could hear a young boy\u2019s frightened voice crying out: \u201cMama, please save me\u201d; \u201cPlease, God, don\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p> <p>Later that day, the brothers shot the child above the right ear and threw his body in the river weighed down with a cotton-gin fan.</p> <p>When Mamie Till-Mobley saw the corpse for the first time, she could not recognize her own boy. His disfigured face, she said, had its \u201cright eye lying midway of his chest, his nose broken like someone took a meat chopper to it, and a bullet hole which I could look through and see daylight on the other side\u201d.</p> <p>One hundred days after the murder, Rosa Parks was riding on a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama, when the driver ordered her to move to the segregated black seats at the back.

It was to Edwards\u2019 family home in the tiny hamlet of Money, in the cotton-picking Mississippi delta, that Emmett travelled on vacation that summer of 1955 to stay with her parents, Moses and Elizabeth Wright.</p> <p>Edwards\u2019 late brother Simeon, then 12, was asleep in the same bed as Emmett when he was abducted.</p> <p>The trouble began three days after Emmett arrived in Mississippi. On the afternoon of 24 August 1955, he teamed up with Simeon and another cousin, Wheeler Parker, who had travelled down with him from Chicago.</p> <p>Together with a few friends they went to hang out at the Bryant\u2019s Grocery and Meat Market, a general store located in a wooden shack a couple of miles from the Wrights\u2019 home.</p> <p>What exactly happened when Emmett Till entered the store and encountered Carolyn Bryant, then 21, minding the counter, has been a matter of conjecture over many years. It is understood to be one of the key questions that the FBI has been grappling with in its reinvestigation.</p> <p>Wheeler Parker, 80, recently gave a speech at the New Brunswick Theological Seminary in New Jersey attended by the Guardian. He told the audience that he had been in touch with the FBI and was hoping to learn the fruits of its latest efforts, though he declined to discuss details. Parker said he plans to reveal anything he learns in a forthcoming book about his cousin\u2019s murder, A Few Days Full of Trouble.</p> <p>Parker recounted his eyewitness recollections of that fateful afternoon. \u201cA lot of things have been said about what went on, things that incriminated Emmett, made him out to be a bad boy from Chicago,\u201d he said. The truth was more mundane.</p> <p>\u201cNothing happened. Nothing at all happened inside that store.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"347ff591f5e443bbe42adea9b056468577d3c495\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/347ff591f5e443bbe42adea9b056468577d3c495/0_0_2100_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene in Mississippi around the time of the trial of Roy Bryant and J.W.

He whistled outside the store. He gave the wolf whistle. Man, we could have all fainted. In Mississippi, in 1955! We knew he\u2019d violated southern mores, that in their eyes he\u2019d committed a great crime.\u201d</p> <p>What, if anything, will come of the current FBI investigation remains to be seen. It would be difficult to prosecute Bryant for lying at the trial because the statute of limitations on perjury has long since passed.</p> <p>The Guardian asked Emmett Till\u2019s three cousins to set out what they hoped would arise from the FBI investigation now drawing to a close.</p> <p>Deborah Watts answered the question as though talking to Carolyn Bryant. \u201cYou lied, Emmett died. If you were there, and we know you were, then you need to be held accountable.\u201d</p> <p>Wheeler Parker said his priority was for the real Emmett Till to be remembered. \u201cHe was painted in such a bad light. I want people to know him as he was.\u201d</p> <p>Thelma Wright Edwards said she had no hankering to see Carolyn Bryant put behind bars. \u201cShe\u2019s old, I don\u2019t want her in jail,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But she did have one final desire after so many years of waiting. \u201cI do want Miss Bryant to admit she lied. Stand up and tell the truth. We can\u2019t move on until we hear it from her mouth.\u201d</p>",

Frederiksen\u2019s no-punches-pulled speeches and clear instructions to the nation have been widely praised.</p> \n<p>She even managed to show a sense of fun, posting a clip on Facebook of herself <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mettefrederiksen.dk/videos/2629150217332069/\">doing the dishes</a> while singing along to the 1980s Danish popsters Dodo and the Dodos during the nation\u2019s weekly TV lockdown singalong. The Scandinavian country\u2019s youngest-ever prime minister, whose approval ratings have doubled to more than 80%, has now begun easing its lockdown.</p> \n<p>Taiwan\u2019s president Tsai Ing-wen responded equally fast, activating the country\u2019s central epidemic command centre in early January and introducing travel restrictions and quarantine measures. Mass public hygiene measures were rolled out, including disinfecting public areas and buildings.</p> \n<p>In all, Taiwan adopted 124 control and contain measures in weeks, making a full lockdown unnecessary. It has reported just six deaths, and is now dispatching millions of face masks to the worst-struck parts of the US and Europe. Tsai\u2019s warm, authoritative style has won her plaudits, even from political opponents.</p> \n<p> Norway, with 7,200 cases and 182 deaths, this week began relaxing its restrictions by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/nursery-but-not-as-they-knew-it-norway-adjusts-to-life-after-lockdown\">reopening kindergartens</a>. The prime minister, Erna Solberg, told CNN she had made a point of \u201cletting scientists make the big medical decisions\u201d, adding that she thought her country\u2019s early lockdown and thorough testing programme had been key.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/deaths-comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Following an example set earlier by Frederiksen, Solberg also took the unusual step of directly addressing the country\u2019s children, telling them in two press conferences \u2013 from which adult journalists were banned \u2013 that it was \u201cpermitted to be a little bit scared\u201d and that she, too, missed being able to hug her friends.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Iceland, under the prime minister, Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir\u2019s, leadership, has offered free testing to all citizens, not only those with symptoms, and has recorded 1,800 cases and 10 deaths. Some 12% of the population has taken up the offer, and an exhaustive tracing system has meant the country has not had to close schools.</p> \n<p>Finland\u2019s prime minister, Sanna Marin \u2013 who last year became the world\u2019s youngest head of government \u2013 also moved decisively to impose a strict lockdown, including a ban on all non-essential travel in and out of the Helsinki region. This has helped her country contain the spread of the virus to just 4,000 cases and 140 deaths, a per-million toll 10 times lower than that of neighbouring Sweden.</p> \n<p>Not all the women who have excelled in the corona crisis are national leaders. Jeong Eun-kyeong, the unflappable head of South Korea\u2019s centre for disease control, has become a national icon after overseeing a \u201ctest, trace, contain\u201d strategy that has made the country the world\u2019s coronavirus role-model, with daily infections in single digits and a death toll of less than 250.</p> \n<p>Jeong, a former rural doctor dubbed \u201cthe world\u2019s best virus hunter\u201d, <em><strong> </strong></em>has delivered no-nonsense daily press conferences, including demonstrating the ideal way to cough. While these have won praise, her work ethic \u2013 she has left an emergency operations bunker only for quick visits to a food truck \u2013 has prompted concern for her health.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"15ba1c07-a175-467d-89ed-756d44480b14\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kRNt8LQRWl4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Whatever conclusions we may draw from these leaders\u2019 performances during the pandemic, experts caution that while women are \u201cdisproportionately represented to a rather startling degree\u201d among countries managing the crisis well, dividing men and women heads of state and government into homogenous categories is not necessarily useful.</p> \n<p>Complicating factors may be at play. Kathleen Gerson, a professor of sociology at New York University, notes, for example, that women leaders are more likely to be elected in \u201ca political culture in which there\u2019s a relative support and trust in the government \u2013 and that doesn\u2019t make stark distinctions between women and men. So you\u2019ve already got a head start\u201d.</p> \n<p>In addition, it may be harder for men to escape \u201cthe way they are expected to behave\u201d as leaders, Gerson <a href=\"https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/equality/493434-countries-led-by-women-have-fared-better-against\">told The Hill</a> website. And since the very best leaders are both strong and decisive and capable of displaying feeling, women could, perhaps, \u201clead the way in showing that these are not competing and conflicting attributes, but complementary \u2013 and necessary for good leadership\u201d, she said.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 April 2020.

Capacity for performing wellness checks on vulnerable residents will also be expanded. </p> \n  <p>Local agencies will begin distributing criteria on who qualifies for the program, but of highest priority are seniors who live below the poverty line and those with compromised immune systems. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThese programs will provide older, vulnerable Californians with access to nutritious meals in the safety of their homes and the opportunity to connect with someone who can listen to their concerns and make sure their needs are met.

So, the vision is already in place. </p> \n  <p>This is why the ban, with its exceptions, was interpreted as a largely political move.

Medical experts, politicians and even disinfectant makers denounced the suggestion and warned the public against consuming the product.</p> \n  <p>On Friday, even as the US death toll topped 50,000, Trump tried to make what critics saw as a desperate and dishonest u-turn. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen,\u201d the president, sitting at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, told reporters as he signed emergency funding legislation.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhen I was asking a sarcastic \u2013 a very sarcastic question \u2013 to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside, but it does kill it, and it would kill it on the hands and that would make things much better. That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to a reporter.\u201d</p> \n  <p>A video of the briefings demonstrates otherwise. </p> \n  <p>When Trump posed the question about the efficacy of disinfectant injections, he had turned to his right and was looking in the direction of <strong>Bill Bryan</strong>, the acting homeland security undersecretary for science and technology, and <strong>Deborah Birx</strong>, the coronavirus task force coordinator.</p> \n  <p><strong>Reuters</strong> reporter <strong>Jeff Mason</strong> asked if Trump wanted to clarify that he was being sarcastic and ensure no one misunderstood him. </p> \n  <p>He replied: \u201cYes. I do think that disinfectant on the hands could have a very good effect. Now, Bill is going back to check that in the laboratory. You know, it\u2019s an amazing laboratory, by the way. It\u2019s amazing the work they do.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But returning to the effect of sunlight, he added: \u201cI\u2019d like them now to look as it pertains to the human body. Not just sitting on a railing or sitting on a wall. I\u2019d like to look as it pertains because maybe there\u2019s something there. They have to work with \u2014 I\u2019m not a doctor. They have to work with their doctors. But maybe there is something to light, and the human body, and helping people that are dying.\u201d</p> \n  <p>One more time, Mason gamely pressed: \u201cJust to clarify, you\u2019re not encouraging Americans to inject disinfectant?\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump: \u201cNo. Of course not. Interior-wise, it was said sarcastically. It was put in the form of a question to a group of extraordinarily hostile people, namely the fake news media.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Mason answered: \u201cSome doctors felt you needed to clarify that after your comments.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump said: \u201cOf course, all they had to do was see just \u2014 you know the way it was asked. I was looking at you.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Mason shot back: \u201cNo, you weren\u2019t, sir. I wasn\u2019t there yesterday.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Weijia Jiang</strong> of <strong>CBS News </strong>pointed out that Trump had been looking at Birx. Changing his story, Trump claimed: \u201cI was looking at Bill. I was looking at the doctor. I was looking at some of the reporters. I don\u2019t know if you were there. Were you there? </p> \n  <p>Jiang said: \u201cI was there and I watched you ask her.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump, who has clashed with Jiang in the briefing room, added: \u201cYou were there. You were there. You I never forget.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The jumbled, inaccurate assertions are likely to have the opposite of the desired effect, only deepening concerns about Trump\u2019s embrace of flawed science that could endanger public health.</p> \n  <p><strong>Scott Gottlieb</strong>, Trump\u2019s former <strong>Food and Drug Administration</strong> director, told <strong>CNBC</strong>: </p> \n  <p>\u201cI think we need to speak very clearly. There\u2019s no circumstance under which you should take a disinfectant or inject a disinfectant for the treatment of anything, and certainly not the treatment of coronavirus.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no circumstance in which that\u2019s appropriate, and it can cause death and very adverse outcomes, so people should not be doing that if that was an impression that was left by any of the reporting around comments that have been made in the last 24 hours.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea33b128f08e05690dc4319\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T19:19:03.758Z\">8.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Navy leader recommends reinstating fired captain</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Officials with the US Navy recommended the reinstatement of the commander of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt.</p> \n  <p>Roosevelt was fired after he pleaded for help with a coronavirus outbreak onboard.

Now disinfectant or doing this maybe on the hands would work. I was asking the question of the gentleman who was there yesterday, Bill [Bill Bryan, the acting homeland security undersecretary for science and technology], because when they say that something will last three to four hours or six hours, but if sun is out, or if they use disinfectant, it goes away in less than a minute. Did you hear about this yesterday?</p> \n  <p> POTUS: When I was asking a sarcastic \u2014 a very sarcastic question to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside, but it does kill it, and it would kill it on the hands and that would make things much better. That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to a reporter.</p> \n  <p> Reporter: But you were asking your medical experts to look into it.</p> \n  <p> POTUS: To look into whether or not sun \u2014 and disinfectant on the hands \u2014 but whether or not sun can help us. Because, I mean he came in yesterday and he said they\u2019ve done a big study. This is a study. This isn\u2019t where he hasn\u2019t done it. This is where they\u2019ve come in with a final report that sun has a massive impact negatively on this virus. In other words, it does not live well with humidity and it doesn\u2019t live well with sun, sunlight, heat. It doesn\u2019t live well with heat and sun and and disinfectant. And that\u2019s what I brought up, and I thought that was clear.</p> \n  <p> Jeff Mason [Reuters journalist]: Just to follow up on the comments from yesterday you said you were being sarcastic, but some people may have misunderstood you. Do you want to just clarify?</p> \n  <p>POTUS: I wish they [\u2026]</p> \n  <p>Jeff Mason: Do you want to clarify to Americans if you don\u2019t want people to think that?</p> \n  <p>POTUS. Yes. I do think that disinfectant on the hands could have a very good effect. Now, Bill is going back to check that in the laboratory. You know, it\u2019s an amazing laboratory, by the way. It\u2019s amazing the work they do. So, he\u2019s going to check because a hard surface. This is a hard surface I guess maybe depending on whose hand you\u2019re talking about, right? But this is a hard surface and disinfectant, disinfectant has an unbelievable \u2014 it wipes it out. You saw it? Sun and heat, and humidity and you wipe it out. And this is from tests \u2014 they\u2019ve been doing these tests for a number of months. And the result \u2014 so then I said, \u2018Well, how do we do it inside the body or even outside the body with the hands and disinfectant I think would work.\u2019 He thinks it would work. When you use it when you\u2019re doing your hands. I guess that\u2019s one of the reasons they say wash your hands, but whether it\u2019s washing hands or disinfectant on your hands, it\u2019s very good. So, they\u2019re going to start looking at that. And there is a way of, you know, if light \u2014 if sun, sun itself that sun has a tremendous impact on or kills it like in one \u2014 it goes from what was it? Hours to like one minute instead.</p> \n  <p>So, I said you got to go back and look, but I\u2019d like them now to look as it pertains to the human body. Not just sitting on a railing or sitting on a wall. I\u2019d like to look as it pertains because maybe there\u2019s something there. They have to work with \u2014 I\u2019m not a doctor. They have to work with their doctors. but maybe there is something to light, and the human body, and helping people that are dying.</p> \n  <p>Jeff Mason: Just to clarify: You\u2019re not encouraging Americans to inject disinfectant?</p> \n  <p> POTUS: No. Of course not\u2026It was said sarcastically. It was put in the form of a question to a group of extraordinary hostile people. Namely, the fake news media.</p> \n  <p>Jeff Mason: Some doctors felt you needed to clarify that after your comments.</p> \n  <p>POTUS: Of course, all they had to do was see just \u2014 you know the way it was asked. I was looking at you.</p> \n  <p> Jeff Mason: No you weren\u2019t sir. I wasn\u2019t there yesterday.</p> \n  <p> Weijia Jiang: You were looking at Dr. Birx.</p> \n  <p> POTUS: What\u2019s that?</p> \n  <p> Weijia Jiang: You were looking at Dr. Birx.</p> \n  <p> POTUS: I was looking at Bill. I was looking at the doctor. I was looking at some of the reporters. I don\u2019t know if you were there.

Officials had insisted until recent days that travel restrictions would remain for the foreseeable future, with the country\u2019s president, Milos Zeman, suggesting last weekend that frontiers should stay closed for the next year.</p> \n  <p>However, Vojt\u011bch heralded a dramatic reversal in a late-night press conference on Thursday but indicated the onus would be on travellers to prove they were uninfected on their return.</p> \n  <p>\u201cUpon return, travellers will either have to present confirmation of a negative test for coronavirus, or be forced to spend 14 days in quarantine,\u201d he said. Commuters would also be able to cross the borders daily if they presented a negative test for coronavirus every 14 days, Vojt\u011bch added, a move that will affect a relatively small number of people who live in the Czech Republic but work in a neighbouring country, or vice versa.</p> \n  <p>In a further development, the deputy health minister, Roman Prymula, announced that mandatory face mask-wearing \u2013 credited by officials with containing the virus\u2019s spread \u2013 would stay until at least the end of June. Restrictions are also being lifted on movement within the country, with groups of up to 10 people now permitted to gather. Previous rules limited outdoor gatherings to two.</p> \n  <p>The move follows growing public pressure for an easing of emergency measures. But there was criticism that the announcement sowed confusion, with no immediate announcement on when foreign visitors would be allowed to re-enter, which would help Prague\u2019s beleaguered tourist economy.</p> \n  <p>The announcement came hours after the government had accelerated its timetable for reopening the economy following pressure from Czech trading lobbies. Restaurants and pubs will be allowed to fully reopen on 25 May, two weeks earlier than initially planned in a five-phase restart plan announced last week. Zoos will be allowed to reopen from Monday, a month earlier than planned.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>The relaxations came after Prague\u2019s municipal court on Thursday ruled the government\u2019s restrictions unlawful.</p> \n  <p>Officials have hailed better-than-expected results from the anti-coronavirus clampdown.

Currently there are typically more than 2,000 new infections every day.</p> \n  <p>According to the RKI, Germany has 150,383 confirmed cases, a rise of 2,337 from Thursday, and 5,321 people have died from the virus. </p> \n  <p>But due to a delay in the central collation of figures, the real number of cases is said by reliable health watchers gathering statistics on the L\u00e4nder level, to be more than 3,000 higher, and the number of deaths just under 300 more than the RKI\u2019s figures.</p> \n  <p>The current reproduction rate in Germany is 0.9 - which means every person with the infection is passing it on to one other person. This is up from 0.7 a week ago, but virologists consider one and under to be good.</p> \n  <p>Schaade said keeping the restrictions was necessary because in order to be able to keep the disease under control, health authorities around the country have to be in a position to be able to identify each case and trace their contacts, to place them in immediate isolation. If the number of new infections grows too quickly, the tracking and tracing process becomes too unwieldy a task, and the situation could quickly get out of control, he said.</p> \n  <p>He said unlike in Italy, France and Spain, there was so far no evidence of excess mortality in Germany - that is, a death rate higher than the usual average death rate for this time of year. This was, he said, due to the fact that Germany was able to tackle the illness early on, largely through testing, and dampen its spread, and therefore treated many coronavirus cases effectively, without lessening hospitals\u2019 ability to treat other illnesses.</p> \n  <p>Referring to the pressure being placed on authorities to relax measures, which he advised against strongly, Schaade said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is a paradox, that due to the success of the measures that have been taken ... these very measures are now being called into question.</p> \n   <p>That Germany has come through this epidemic comparatively well so far, is thanks to the measures we have taken. The number of cases has stayed at a level with which the health system has been able to cope, and it must stay that way. We cannot afford to become lax. With respect to the first relaxation of measures, this must not be allowed to lead to a landslide of other subsequent easing that could have serious consequences.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He said quite simply, that more contact would automatically lead to more infections \u201cand when there are more infections a dynamic will develop again very quickly with rising infection rates which in the worst case, could bring us to a point where the epidemic is no longer manageable.</p> \n  <p>In short, Schaade said, his \u201cemphatic plea\u201d was for people to stick to the recommendations: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Stay at home, stay away from others, keep the 1.5 metre - or even better 2 metre distance, keep to the coughing and sneezing rules, and on public transport or shops, wear mouth-nose cover to protect others.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He recognised, he said, that \u201cmany people are running out of strength, and many are suffering from existential angst. Believe me, I\u2019d like nothing more than to tell you it\u2019s over...but unfortunately it\u2019s not over.\u201d<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea2da8a8f08e05690dc3da5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T12:34:50.853Z\">1.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>While social distancing and national lockdowns have been credited with slowing the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, governments and experts have said the only permanent way out is through a <strong tabindex=\"-1\">vaccine</strong>. </p> \n  <p>Vaccine development usually takes years, meaning that teams around the world are considering a range of risks and shortcuts to bring one to market in a much shorter time. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Hannah Devlin</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s science correspondent, has looked at four different approaches being taken by research teams around the world, ranging from classic weakened viruses, to genetically modified forms, to revolutionary approaches using DNA and RNA. </p> \n  <p>But, as she writes, there is a chance none of them will work, or that they may have serious unintended side-effects. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/the-hunt-for-a-coronavirus-vaccine-a-perilous-and-uncertain-path\">The hunt for a coronavirus vaccine \u2013 a perilous and uncertain path</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T12:40:12.444Z\">at 1.40pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea2d58b8f08fa2bdcb1aaf1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T12:05:57.027Z\">1.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Italy \"to ease lockdown\", local media reports</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Newspapers in Italy are reporting that the country\u2019s coronavirus lockdown, the longest and toughest in Europe, is to be eased over the next four weeks.

It has asked its citizens to avoid non-essential travel, work from home and stay indoors if they are over 70 or are feeling ill - but there has been no enforced lockdown.</p> \n  <p>The country has seen a higher death rate than its neighbours. Yesterday, the Public Health Agency of Sweden said it had recorded 16,755 confirmed cases, and 2,021 deaths with the coronavirus. And there has been anger in the country that older people have borne the brunt of the strategy, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/anger-in-sweden-as-elderly-pay-price-for-coronavirus-strategy\">as reported by my colleague Richard Orange</a>. </p> \n  <p>Lena Einhorn, a virologist who has been one of the leading domestic critics of Sweden\u2019s coronavirus policy, told the Observer<em>. </em></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>They have to admit that it\u2019s a huge failure, since they have said the whole time that their main aim has been to protect the elderly. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But Tegnall today said Sweden\u2019s strategy put it in a better place to deal with a second wave of coronavirus as the country\u2019s scientists estimated there was now around 15-20% immunity in the population \u2013 not enough for herd immunity, but enough to slow and control the spread of the disease. </p> \n  <p>Asked if the policy had worked, Tegnall said the aim had been to slow the progression of the disease so its healthcare system did not become overwhelmed. </p> \n  <p>It has worked in some aspects. The health service has been able to cope \u2013 20% of ICU beds have been empty and able to take coronavirus patients at all times. </p> \n  <p>In terms of death toll, Sweden had seen \u201cabout the same results as other countries\u201d, he said. </p> \n  <p>Asked about the fact that there are more deaths in Sweden than in other Scandinavian countries, he said that as many as 50% of deaths had come in care homes for the elderly \u2013 which have banned visitors. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how a lockdown would have stopped that,\u201d he said. Asked if the strategy had resulted in more deaths, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s a difficult question and I don\u2019t think we have the answer and I don\u2019t know if we will ever get the answer. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Sweden estimates it passed the peak of the disease last week, and hopes it will be better placed to deal with any further outbreaks</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We hope this will make it easier for us in the long run.

As an introvert, I am really looking forward to spending this month focusing inwards, without the burden of social responsibility.</p> \n   <p>Ramadan in 2020 means no communal gatherings in mosques for \u201ctarawih\u201d night prayers, no large \u201ciftar\u201d dinners with family and friends at sunset to break the day\u2019s fast,and, sadly, restrictions on celebrating Eid, the biggest social holiday for Muslims signalling the end of Ramadan.</p> \n   <p>In this time of physical distancing, as Muslims we will be forced to reconnect to our God and the Qur\u2019an on a deeply intimate level. Interestingly enough, this is the authentic practice of Prophet Muhammad. He would isolate himself for days in a cave at the top of a mountain to introspect, reflect, worship and connect with God. During each of the 10 days of Ramadan, he was known to self-isolate in a spiritual seclusion practice known as \u201citik\u0101f\u201d.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/ramadan-during-coronavirus-may-seem-disheartening-but-its-the-ideal-time-for-reflection\">Ramadan during coronavirus may seem disheartening but it's the ideal time for reflection | Heba Shaheed</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T03:55:57.153Z\">at 4.55am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea25a498f082ab274335cfd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T03:22:39.222Z\">4.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e659c15540987049599987a1811d4086f6c9e57\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e659c15540987049599987a1811d4086f6c9e57/0_108_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"About 90 people onboard the cruise ship Costa Atlantica have tested positive for the coronavirus.
