One ride even made Moyes some money on the side. \u201cI think it was \u00a316.80, one box of fruit and veg.

The suspension of the season means he has more free time than usual.</p> <p>\u201cMy wife was away so it was me who had to do the cooking. If the wife had been here, she would have told me I was doing it wrong. Trial and error.</p> <p>\u201cMy wife is in the background now, giving me all sorts of signs.

Conscious of the need to help vulnerable people, he recently cheered up an 85-year-old woman who has recovered from coronavirus by giving her a call.</p> <p>\u201cIris was an older lady who lives on her own. She was great. She has one or two other problems to deal with regarding her other medications but she was really good, telling me about the support she has been getting from other people at West Ham. They have been phoning her, sending her letters. We have said that when the football starts up again we\u2019ll pick her up in a taxi, bring her to a game and take her back as well.\u201d</p> <p>Moyes is in touch with reality. He has been preparing for football\u2019s eventual return by analysing old games and watching clips of transfer targets, but he is worried about the fate of Football League clubs and the game\u2019s parlous financial state. \u201cWe hope football will have a little reset. I hope we\u2019ll all look back and think: \u2018Maybe we were indulging too much.\u2019 The people who run football clubs have got to say: \u2018Have we always been doing the right things? If anything like this happened again in the future, would we be able to get through it?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cMaybe we have to look at the prices paid for players. We might need to look at the wages. We might need to look at what\u2019s been paid to agents. We might need to look at all different aspects of the industry. We\u2019ve still got a long way to go to make sure we get out of this situation we\u2019re in. How we come out of it, I\u2019m not sure.

  "<p>A federal appeals court has allowed Arkansas to enforce a ban on most surgical abortions, as part of a state directive aimed at postponing medical procedures not deemed urgent during the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>The ruling from the eighth US circuit court of appeals in St Louis, Missouri, lifted a federal judge\u2019s order which had allowed abortions to continue.

And they show for the first time that areas with high ethnic minority populations in England and Wales tend to have higher mortality rates. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2020-04-22T13:36:25/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Ethnic minorities Covid-19 deaths\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2020-04-22T13:36:25/embed.html\">Ethnic minorities Covid-19 deaths</a> \n</figure> \n<p>While it is is not yet clear why communities with proportionally higher number of BAME inhabitants appear to be dying at higher rates, one expert on public and ethnic health said that social deprivation was the strongest indicator for mortality due to an increased underlying burden of disease.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere have been health inequalities that have existed in the [BAME] population but what is being reflected in this pandemic is that those inequalities are actually coming out,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.bmihealthcare.co.uk/consultants/wasim-hanif#gdpr-out\">Wasim Hanif</a>, professor of diabetes and endocrinology at University Hospital Birmingham.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cDeaths happen in relation to complications related to diabetes all the time, as with cardiovascular diseases and cancers, but they have never hit the headlines and that\u2019s the effect we\u2019re seeing now.\u201d</p> \n<p>The findings, which run alongside separate concerns about the death rate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/10/uk-coronavirus-deaths-bame-doctors-bma\">among BAME healthcare workers</a>, are based on two data sets and two batches of analysis. One was from the NHS and covered deaths in English hospitals up to 19 April.</p> \n<p>The findings are based on new figures from the Office or National Statistics breaking down deaths by local authority up to 3 April, enabling the matching of deaths to data on pollution, age, deprivation, population density and BAME populations in England and Wales for the first time.</p> \n<p>A high proportion of BAME residents was found to be the strongest predictor of a high Covid-19 death rate.</p> \n<p>The analysis shows that for every 10% increase in ethnic minority residents there were 2.9 more Covid-19 deaths per 100,000 people.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/04/covid-inequality/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Guardian took into account the influence of other factors including population density and age, which explained only part of the correlation between ethnicity and death rates.</p> \n<p>Dr Zubaida Haque, deputy director of the Runnymede Trust, said: \u201cThe Guardian\u2019s analysis confirm our worst fears. We\u2019re already aware that people of colour are much more likely to be critically ill with Covid-19 than their white counterparts, but we now know that BAME people are also much more at risk of mortality with Covid-19. Covid-19 is throwing into sharp relief existing racial inequalities.\u201d</p> \n<p>She added that the government had to recognise that race and racial inequalities were a risk factor in Covid-19 and that it should address the disproportionate rates of poverty, insecure and low-paid labour, which was often also undertaken by keyworkers, plus poorer conditions and overcrowded housing \u2013 all of which were putting ethnic minorities much more at risk of Covid-19 infection.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no question any more about whether BAME people are bearing the brunt of Covid-19; they clearly are. The question is whether the government view these racial inequalities as a serious enough problem to do something about it.\u201d</p> \n<p>The stark picture painted by the research comes as health authorities come under increasing pressure to publish the data held on the deaths of BAME patients from Covid-19, amid warnings that a failure to do so could be putting lives at risk.</p> \n<p>After a public outcry the government is beginning to release official statistics on ethnicity. On Monday NHS England released a breakdown of coronavirus deaths by ethnic minorities for the first time.</p> \n<p>Based on that and the information provided for local authorities, it emerged that the London boroughs of Harrow and Brent had had the highest death rates, of about 37 and 32 deaths per 100,000 residents respectively.</p> \n<p>In Harrow 58% of residents are from ethnic minority backgrounds , while in Brent the figure is 64%. South Lakeland, in Cumbria, had the next highest mortality rate, with 29 deaths per 100,000. It is a largely white, rural area and is something of an outlier.</p> \n<p>Dawn Butler, the Labour MP for Brent Central, described the Guardian\u2019s findings as deeply concerning, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a particularly emotional time because every every day we are speaking to families who have lost loved ones or who have loved ones in hospital and cannot go to see them.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s taking a serious toll in a community where you also have also have inter generational living with groups of families \u2013 grandchildren, parents and children \u2013 all living the one household.\u201d</p> \n<p>Apart from South Lakeland and Hertsmere \u2013 which is just outside London and borders Harrow and Barnet \u2013 the 10 areas with the highest mortality rates were all urban, and seven had higher than average BAME populations.</p> \n<p>Because deaths by ethnicity are not compared to the local population, further research is required to identify to what degree minority deaths are over-represented. London and the West Midlands accounted for 46% of deaths in the dataset. In London two in five people are from an ethnic minority background, while in the West Midlands that proportion is one fifth.</p> \n<p>The analysis is based on the first 5,186 Covid-19 deaths recorded on death certificates up until 3 April and reflects fatalities in hospitals and in the community. As the data is continually updated some areas in the data have low deaths counts and the findings may change as more deaths are registered.</p> \n<p>The lack of any further detail about what shaped the government\u2019s review was attacked by the shadow equalities minister, Marsha de Cordova, who called for an independent investigation into the impact of Covid-19 on BAME communities, to address health, economic and social inequalities.</p> \n<p>She said: \u201cIt is disappointing the government has yet to commit to this and has failed to share details of its work to date. This lack of transparency and action is risking lives. NHS and Public Health England must urgently publish the data they hold, and the government must start tackling the underlying socio-economic inequalities so they are not exacerbated over the next few months.\u201d</p> \n<p>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cAny death from this disease is a tragedy and we are working incredibly hard, day and night, to protect the nation\u2019s public health.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting: Ben Quinn</em></p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 23 April 2020 to remove a term which does not comply with our style guide.</p>",

It would therefore be \u201cwholly unrealistic\u201d to think that restrictions would be relaxed any time soon and some \u201cvery socially disruptive\u201d measures would almost certainly have to remain in force for the rest of the year, he said. Whitty added that coronavirus was not going to be eradicated, so we must accept we will be working with it globally for the foreseeable future.</li> \n   <li><strong>We are at the peak of the outbreak, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, told the Commons. </strong>But this was put into further perspective by Chris Whitty at the press briefing, who highlighted that the peak was an \u201cartificial peak\u201d as it was the result of the lockdown. The first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, also reiterated that the biggest risk was a second spike. This all reinforces that an \u201cexit strategy\u201d from physical distancing measures is proving more and more difficult to devise.</li> \n   <li><strong>A contact-tracing system will be in place \u201cin a matter of weeks\u201d, Hancock also said.</strong> He said the effectiveness of \u201ctest, track and trace\u201d every new case as a method rested on the incidence of transmission in the community.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK\u2019s hospital death toll surpassed 18,000, as a further 759 deaths took the total to 18,100.</strong> The ONS said there had also been 1,043 coronavirus-related deaths in care homes in England and Wales by 10 April. In a joint statement with the CQC, the government conceded that the true number \u201ccould be double\u201d. Chris Whitty also said he thought the ONS figures were \u201can underestimate\u201d. And analysis from the Financial Times suggested the real UK death toll could be as high as 41,000.</li> \n   <li><strong>The EU denied the UK government\u2019s claim that a mix-up was to blame for its non-involvement in its coronavirus procurement scheme.</strong> The European commission said the UK was well aware of the initiative when it decided not to participate, contradicting the government\u2019s claim that it didn\u2019t get involved because of a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d about eligibility. Facing questions from the Commons foreign affairs committee, Sir Simon McDonald, the head of the Foreign Office, said it was a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d, though he later issued a retraction and said non-involvement had been due to a \u201ccommunication problem\u201d. </li> \n   <li><strong>The Welsh government is to fund free \u201cschool meals\u201d for disadvantaged children during the summer holidays.</strong> It is the first UK nation to make such a pledge.</li> \n   <li><strong>And the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, urged the government to ban evictions over rent arrears built up as a result of the coronavirus crisis.</strong> He also called for an increase in housing benefits and that the government should cover, for the duration of the crisis, any shortfall in payments by private renters.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Thank you so much to everyone who got in touch throughout the day with news tips, suggestions, comments and advice.</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from us on the UK side, we\u2019ll be back tomorrow to bring you all the latest updates on the pandemic.

Officials, and to a lesser extent ministers, have been signalling it for a while, but Whitty was this afternoon more explicit than anyone else has been about this at these press conferences.</p> \n  <p>Here are his key quotes on this point.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Whitty said that some \u201cvery socially disruptive\u201d measures would almost certainly have to remain in force for the rest of the year.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have to be very realistic if people are hoping it\u2019s suddenly going to move from where we are in lockdown to where suddenly into everything is gone, that is a wholly unrealistic expectation</p> \n   <p>We are going to have to do a lot of things for really quite a long period of time, the question is what is the best package and this is what we\u2019re trying to work out.</p> \n   <p>If you release more on one area, you have to keep on board more of another area so there\u2019s a proper trade-off and this is what ministers are having to consider.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Later he was even more explicit.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In the long run, the exit from this is going to be one of two things, ideally. A vaccine, and there are a variety of ways they can be deployed ... or, and/or, highly effective drugs so that people stop dying of this disease even if they catch it, or which can prevent this disease in vulnerable people.</p> \n   <p>Until we have those, and the probability of having those any time in the next calendar year are incredibly small and I think we should be realistic about that.</p> \n   <p>We\u2019re going to have to rely on other social measures, which of course are very socially disruptive as everyone is finding at the moment.</p> \n   <p>But until that point, that is what we will have to do but it will be the best combination that maximises the outlooks but it\u2019s going to take a long time and I think we need to be aware of that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>I will post a full summary from the press conference soon.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f88d2fb32c06b5eb0043adc2e47cee9bc308bb66\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f88d2fb32c06b5eb0043adc2e47cee9bc308bb66/0_4_3317_1991/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prof Chris Whitty at the press conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prof Chris Whitty at the press conference.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Parsons/10 Downing Street/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T17:25:23.532Z\">at 6.25pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea07a8b8f084784dca58159\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jamie-grierson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T17:11:36.024Z\">6.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The increase in confirmed cases of Covid-19 in prisons in England and Wales appears to have slowed, daily figures have shown.</p> \n  <p>There were 294 confirmed cases of the coronavirus among prisoners in 66 prisons, a 2% rise in 24 hours, the lowest increase in cases since the <strong>Ministry of Justice </strong>started releasing the figures.

But the government did not implement that for another three and a half weeks, he said. He said that showed the government was not following scientific advice - a claim <strong>Dominic Raab,</strong> the foreign secretary and first secretary of state rejected.</p> \n  <p>Gardiner was referring to <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/873723/03-potential-effect-of-non-pharmaceutical-interventions-npis-on-a-Covid-19-epidemic-in-the-UK.pdf\">this paper (pdf)</a>, one of several Sage papers published <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/scientific-advisory-group-for-emergencies-sage-coronavirus-covid-19-response\">in a batch</a> when the government was under pressure to reveal the scientific advice it was getting.</p> \n  <p>The document does indeed show that the government has failed to follow the scientific advice (or at least the advice set out by Sage in that 26 February). However, it shows the scientists arguing <em>against</em> the hard lockdown measures subsequently announced by Boris Johnson on 23 March.</p> \n  <p>Here is the key extract. (I\u2019ve added the bold type, to highlight the key passage.)</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In the event of a pandemic, without action, the NHS will be unable to meet all demands placed on it. Demand on beds is likely to overtake supply well before the peak is reached. Any interventions that could delay the peak, and/or reduce the size of the peak, whilst increasing the duration of the pandemic, are likely to be helpful, provided the pandemic is not extended into the late autumn/winter.</p> \n   <p>Any of the measures listed below could potentially flatten the peak of the epidemic and extend it to some extent. A combination of measures would be expected to have a greater impact, but the impacts are not strictly additive. SPI-M-O [the scientific pandemic influenza group on modelling] believes that combining all four measures, as a long-term policy, might have a similar impact to that seen in Hong Kong or mainland China - reducing the reproduction number to around 1. <strong>However, this would result in a large second epidemic once measures were lifted. Implementing a subset of measures (eg, the first three) would be expected to have a more moderate impact - still substantially reducing peak incidence, while making a second wave of infection in autumn less likely. This might be the preferred outcome for the NHS.</strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The four interventions were, in order: school closures; home isolation for people with symptoms; voluntary household quarantine when someone in a family has symptoms, and \u201csocial distancing\u201d (described as people reducing contacts outside the home and workplace by 75%).</p> \n  <p>The document does not call for any of these measures to be introduced immediately.

Snap verdict</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>That was Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s first outing as Labour leader at PMQs, but just as importantly this marked the debut for a whole new way of running this question session: a \u201chybrid\u201d system, with most MPs participating by Zoom. Both probably amount to a distinct improvement on what came before.</p> \n  <p>First, the process. On a technical level it mostly worked well. One MP did not manage to dial in in time, and another got cut off early. But overall it went smoothly.</p> \n  <p>More importantly, PMQs without 400-odd MPs in the chamber makes everything quieter, calmer, more intelligible and more grown-up. For once the proceedings sounded like the question time sessions that take place in the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly. Without the jeering and the aggro, it lacked gladiatorial edge, and frankly it was probably a bit more boring than the old PMQs. But boring is a much underrated virtue in governance. It will be be very interesting to see whether the Commons ever reverts to how it operated before when (or more probably if) this is all over.</p> \n  <p>In the old PMQs, MPs worked on the assumption that there was always a \u201cwinner\u201d. (Journalists like me wrote it up in those terms too, because that was how the participants viewed the proceedings.) Under Zoom PMQs it is much harder to imagine anyone \u201cwinning\u201d old-style, but if Labour had to choose someone well-suited to parliament in serious/boring mode, it is hard to imagine anyone better than Starmer, and he will chalk today\u2019s outing up, not as a triumph, but certainly as a success. His questions were clear, forensic and focused, he avoided bland or trite sloganising and he adopted a measured tone consistent with responsible, constructive opposition. Quite what the public will make of this when the alternative is Boris Johnson remains to be seen, but high-grade seriousness is what Starmer offered in the Labour leadership contest and it is what he delivered today.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T13:11:18.364Z\">at 2.11pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea02e288f0898fe360d5f5e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T11:46:25.468Z\">12.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Deaths in Scotland rise by 77 to 1,062</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A total of 1,062 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for Covid-19, up by 77 from 985 on Tuesday, the first minister, <strong>Nicola Sturgeon,</strong> said.</p> \n  <p>The figures are lower than the 1,616 deaths given earlier by the National Records of Scotland <em>(see 12.22pm)</em> as they do not include suspected and probable coronavirus infections.</p> \n  <p>Sturgeon said 9,038 people had now tested positive for the virus in Scotland, up by 366 from 8,672 the day before.</p> \n  <p>There were 155 people in intensive care with coronavirus or coronavirus symptoms, a decrease of 11 from Tuesday, she added.</p> \n  <p>There were 1,776 people in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, down from 1,866 yesterday.</p> \n  <p>And since 5 March, 1,813 patients who tested positive have been discharged from hospital.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T12:06:53.856Z\">at 1.06pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea02c0d8f084784dca57d77\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T11:36:44.820Z\">12.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>James Sunderland,</strong> a Conservative, asks Raab what are the ingredients that will take the country through this.</p> \n  <p>Raab says the critical ingredient is for the country to come together.

Since then she and colleagues have made 1,500 phone calls to vulnerable families and 58 home visits.</p> <p>\u201cThe majority said they did not want to come in to school. Some of them said they felt they could look after [their children] better at home. They said it was too dangerous for them to come in to school and their children were too worried.\u201d</p> <p>With 10 or fewer vulnerable pupils in school, staff are making regular phone calls home. The highest-risk families are called daily, those that are of concern but are lower risk are called three times a week, while others are contacted once a week.</p> <p>Where concerns are raised, staff pay a home visit. \u201cUltimately you have to go out and find them. So far we\u2019ve made contact with every single student,\u201d said Finley, who said there had been an increase in domestic violence and mental health problems in families.</p> <p>Stuart Lock, the head of Advantage Schools trust in Bedford, which runs a primary and secondary school, said the key issue was the safety of pupils, whether they were staying at home or coming to school.</p> <p>\u201cWe know for a small minority of pupils, they find their home circumstances difficult. When we set work online, we get pupils to check in with an online form every day by 9.30am. This invites them to tell us whether they and everyone in their family are safe and well and we can chase up if they say they are not.</p> <p>\u201cWe also have a very small number of pupils who we have in school because it supports their families and they are particularly struggling \u2013 but this doesn\u2019t apply to the majority of pupils who we might consider vulnerable.

We wanted to get those pupils into school once things settled and we had a strong steer from the local authority to get them back in.</p> <p>\u201cI do think the numbers in school are only one piece of the puzzle - we are speaking to our vulnerable pupils and their families daily. We are also distributing 2,000 meals weekly, and we are checking in with those families and others very regularly.\u201d</p> <p>Addressing MPs\u2019 concerns, Ford said: \u201cPeople are very concerned that they don\u2019t want to get coronavirus and I can absolutely understand that.</p> <p>\u201cWe make it very clear that children who have a social worker are expected to attend school. And if they are not, their schools are working with their social workers to make sure we have eyes on them, that they get visits \u2013 whether or not that\u2019s a physical visit, a doorstep visit, a house visit, or a digital visit \u2013 depending on the risk to that child.</p> <p>\u201cJust because the attendance at school may be low that doesn\u2019t mean that those children are not being safeguarded in other ways.\u201d</p>",

It is worth recalling that record now because Mr Raab has temporarily risen to the highest office, which is higher than his capabilities should allow.</p> <p>Acting as prime minister during Boris Johnson\u2019s illness is an unenviable task. The stand-in did not take decisions he must now defend, and has no executive authority to fix mistakes. Mr Johnson\u2019s absence can be felt as drift and incoherence, expressed most potently in confusion over coronavirus testing and supplies of vital medical equipment.</p> <p>Keir Starmer raised both subjects in his Commons debut as Labour leader on Wednesday. On both fronts he exposed the void where Mr Raab must have wished he had answers. The foreign secretary floundered most under questioning on testing, where the rate lags far behind what would be necessary to hit the target of 100,000 per day by the end of this month. He attempted a sleight of hand, defending the government\u2019s record in terms of elevated testing capacity, an easier metric and not what had initially been pledged. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/22/an-impressive-debut-readers-on-keir-starmers-first-pmqs\" title=\"\">Mr Starmer\u2019s efficiency in identifying</a> and dismissing that trick bodes well for when it is Mr Johnson at the despatch box and not his understudy.</p> <p>On equipment supplies, Mr Raab\u2019s defence was propped up by two flimsy planks: first, that no country is managing without difficulty; second, that every decision has been taken in accordance with the best available scientific advice. If there was ever merit in those claims it has worn thin from overuse by ministers evading responsibility for the lethal consequences of their actions \u2013 and inaction. It is disingenuous and improbable to suggest that ministers have followed a technocratic template, impeded only by logistical challenges beyond their control. Political prejudice infiltrates most decisions in government and Mr Johnson\u2019s Downing Street is one of the most ideologically driven, politically cynical administrations in British history. It is likely that medical expertise was heeded, given that no one in the cabinet had relevant qualifications, but the equivalent skills deficit in other areas has never stopped the prime minister from having a strong opinion and acting on it before. Brexit is a case in point, where decisions of national importance were routinely taken in disregard of advice from people with professional expertise in the relevant fields.</p> <p>It is plausible that the scale of the coronavirus threat forced ministers to set ideology aside. The Treasury response demonstrates that much in its swift abandonment of orthodox Conservative fiscal policy. But it is also feasible that Mr Johnson and his team took longer than necessary to climb out of some ideological trenches because they had dug themselves in so deep. That lag might help clear up confusion surrounding an EU procurement scheme for medical equipment, which Britain either joined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/uk-missed-three-chances-to-join-eu-scheme-to-bulk-buy-ppe\" title=\"\">or did not join</a> for reasons that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/no-10-boris-johnson-accused-of-putting-brexit-over-breathing-in-covid-19-ventilator-row\" title=\"\">mysteriously vary</a> depending on whether it is a civil servant, a minister or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/eu-turns-up-pressure-on-matt-hancock-over-covid-19-ppe-scheme\" title=\"\">Brussels accounting for events</a>.</p> <p>On Tuesday, a senior foreign office official told a parliamentary committee that the decision not to participate had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/21/uk-coronavirus-live-parliament-returns-government-lockdown-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9f0e288f0826d9592b5e7e#block-5e9f0e288f0826d9592b5e7e\" title=\"\">been political</a>. Hours later he \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52369916\" title=\"\">clarified</a>\u201d to the contrary, but his written retraction contained no clarification of facts. The truth will surely emerge one day, probably in front of a public inquiry.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the episode reinforces the impression of a government that was ill prepared for a crisis that demanded competence more than rhetorical bluster, and is failing now to get sufficient grip and undo damage done. Partly that is a symptom of over-centralisation and reliance on the individual authority of the prime minister, whose focus is necessarily elsewhere. But capable ministers and a resilient administration would be compensating better for Mr Johnson\u2019s absence. That they are not, that the whole system seems obviously adrift, running on bluster and improvisation, testifies to flaws. Mr Raab is obviously out of his depth. Sadly, it seems his painfully shrunken stature is an accurate measure of the government he currently leads.</p>",

But this was a global emergency, and the struggle swiftly developed into one of getting us home, not assuring our stay.</p> <p>The School for International Training (SIT) cancelled our program on a Monday and the one flight per week connecting Samoa and Hawaii leaves every Friday. Under the assumption we\u2019d be leaving at that time, we took full advantage of the four open days to say goodbye \u2014 an evening of song with our host families, one last night swim off the sea wall and a trip to the island Savai\u2019i. Our last afternoon on Savai\u2019i, my friend Lily received a call at the boardwalk. It was her mom, stuck in the Netherlands, calling to tell her nearly her entire family across three US states had contracted coronavirus.

  "<p>As Australian football continues to navigate the financial crisis that is the coronavirus, there are fears the W-League may be one of the first competitions to be curtailed in order to keep the more lucrative A-League afloat.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/our-principles-can-t-shift-union-fears-w-league-may-be-lost-to-crisis-20200411-p54j0s.html\">recent report</a> suggested Australia\u2019s top-tier women\u2019s league \u201clooms as the competition most likely to be scaled back if the game\u2019s already precarious finances are left in tatters by Fox Sports\u2019 potential departure\u201d.

Danny Townsend, CEO of Sydney FC, took to Twitter to refute various claims made in the W-League report, including the idea that the women\u2019s game would be \u201ceasy\u201d to cut due to it having \u201clittle return\u201d on the investment clubs put in.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just materially incorrect,\u201d Townsend told Guardian Australia. \u201cIf you actually lined up some of the football activity we do, the W-League is actually a quite reasonable financial proposition compared to some of the other things we invest in.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a simple thing to cut and given the importance of the Matildas in the Australian sporting landscape and the W-League being one of the oldest semi-professional competitions in this country \u2013 it\u2019s been around for 12 years now \u2013 the investments we\u2019ve all made in building such a viable competition would be crazy to consider [cutting].\u201d</p> <p>According to the original report, the game\u2019s small financial margins are the reason the W-League could not become a full home-and-away fixture in the 2019-20 season. But, Townsend said, these decisions come down to player, club and league priorities.</p> <p>\u201cIf you get an extra million dollars, you can look at spending it in many different ways,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat happens when we assess the future of all our leagues that we control is: where is that money best spent right now to get the best return and invest for the future?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/03/overcoming-current-challenges-in-womens-sport-will-pave-way-for-future-nostalgia\">Overcoming current challenges in women\u2019s sport will pave way for future nostalgia | Megan Maurice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHaving every [W-League] match available on broadcast was a bigger priority than home-and-away, which was a bigger priority than expansion. That was a set of options that were decided upon by the players themselves through the PFA, which has an active role in the Professional Women\u2019s Football Committee.</p> <p>\u201cWe can say we could expand another four teams in the W-League, but if that means we don\u2019t get home-and-away as a priority, then that\u2019s not in keeping with what the players themselves want.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68b0fd30823239291070dcf71578d70251f302ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68b0fd30823239291070dcf71578d70251f302ba/0_123_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caitlin Foord\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The pathway the W-League affords to players like Caitlin Foord can inspire others, according to Townsend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gavin Ellis/TGS Photo/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the impact of Covid-19 will force football to reshuffle these priorities. Indeed, it\u2019s easy for Sydney FC \u2013 one of Australia\u2019s richest football clubs \u2013 to prioritise their women\u2019s side, but what of clubs in less secure financial positions? Newcastle Jets, for example, were the only club to not sign an international player last W-League season due to off-field financial issues, and yet still filled all five international spots for their A-League side; a clear illustration of their priorities.</p> <p>Townsend believes such strategies are short-sighted. \u201cA club could spend $4.5m on players in the A-League because they see that as the most important competition their club is playing in, and they can skimp on their W-League and pay the floor of the cap; that\u2019s their choice. To me, that\u2019s a fairly myopic decision to make.</p> <p>\u201cThe beauty of the female game is the cost base is even lower, so instead of spending $4.6m on [male] players, you might go and spend $4.3 million \u2013 and still have just as good a team, just recruit better \u2013 and have the best team in the W-League.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even big clubs. Small clubs as well. You could redirect ten per cent of your A-League playing budget to the W-League and field a team that has a chance of winning.\u201d</p> <p>Townsend said the idea of redistributing funds from one competition to another would \u201cabsolutely\u201d be a conversation worth having in coming months. \u201cOur commitment at the start of this process was to remain intact as an organisation and competitions on the other side \u2026 and if that means redirecting out of your A-League set-up into your W-League set-up, then they\u2019re the decisions we need to make because we don\u2019t want to leave anybody behind.\u201d</p> <p>More importantly, however, the W-League has value to the Australian football landscape beyond the balance sheet. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen, over the last ten years, the proliferation of young females playing football. We\u2019ve seen the rise of the Matildas having a viable pathway is critical to that continuing to grow.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I go back fifteen years when I was playing, there was no real female football. If I was a club back then, I was essentially marketing to one gender. My memberships were hugely skewed towards the male gender. Nowadays I have the opportunity to speak meaningfully to both genders about competitions they can both relate to. So if I\u2019m trying to chart a financial course of growth for my club, I see the W-League as a really important part of that.</p> <p>\u201cNotwithstanding sponsorships \u2026 we get a lot of value out of our community programs now that have huge participation rates of females largely aspiring to play in the W-League. They come to our camps because they want to be the next Chloe Logarzo or Caitlin Foord.</p> <p>\u201c[This] is an important competitive advantage for our code. If you look at all the other codes, they\u2019re out there trying to do it from a standing start. The AFLW, rugby league, rugby union \u2013 all of a sudden, female competitions are the flavour of the month. We\u2019ve had one for twelve years. And now I think we\u2019re close to overtaking netball as the number one participation sport for females. So that\u2019s hugely important and valuable for our code and if we don\u2019t harness that then we\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>As I sit on a garden chair with my laptop perched on an outdoor table in a last-ditch effort to stop my dog digging the lawn, it\u2019s timely that I\u2019ve been asked to write about setting up a home workstation that doesn\u2019t ruin your back, for people self-isolating during the coronavirus crisis (come to think of it, my back is aching a little).</p> \n<p>So, how can I fix it?</p> \n<h2><strong>It\u2019s not just about the chair</strong></h2> \n<p>The first step to working from home safely is figuring out how you\u2019re going to approach work, says an ergonomics expert, <a href=\"https://scholars.latrobe.edu.au/display/joakman\">Jodi Oakman</a>, an associate professor at La Trobe University, Melbourne. She stresses the importance of a holistic approach to organising the work environment before tackling the workspace.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhere are we going to do it and how am I going to do it? What hours am I going to do? Can I do all of my job?\u201d</p> \n<p>Careful planning, for instance, getting up earlier to get through tasks before the rest of the household stirs, can reduce the likelihood of injury and improve productivity Oakman suggests. \u201cBack pain is caused by work-related stress as well as work-related physical factors,\u201d she explains.</p> \n<p>That includes setting boundaries to create some distinction between home and work. For some, this could mean getting dressed in work gear or communicating \u201cI\u2019m at work\u201d by putting on a headset in a shared environment, or setting clear working hours and sharing them with managers and colleagues.</p> \n<p>A rehabilitation consultant, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-davis-119843157/?originalSubdomain=au\">William Davis</a>, emphasises the importance of a strict routine to avoid stress-related injury. \u201cIn this isolation environment when everyone\u2019s working from home, it\u2019s very easy to fall into the habit of doing an extra two or three hours a day. And I would advise against it from a stress-wellbeing point of view.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some people might have to acknowledge they can\u2019t juggle everything from home and adjust their working hours accordingly. \u201cMany people are moving into home schooling,\u201d says an occupational health physiotherapist, <a href=\"https://phwgroup.com.au/phw-group-team/\">David Hall</a>. \u201cSome of us with kids and trying to work from home. It\u2019s like being squeezed like a lemon \u2026</p> \n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t try and be a hero. Just be gentle on yourself and don\u2019t \u2026 feel like you\u2019ve got to be like the best home schooler and the best worker; just set realistic expectations about what all that means.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>OK, let\u2019s get to the chair \u2026</strong></h2> \n<p>All the experts agree that, ideally, a chair should have a height adjustment, to avoid unnecessary muscle strain that causes aching necks and backs. If you can\u2019t afford to buy a proper office chair, Hall says there\u2019s often a spare one somewhere that\u2019s not being used by a friend or neighbour, so ask around.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s important that the chair facilitates good posture \u2013 many chairs that aren\u2019t ergonomically designed go out at too far an angle, Davis explains. He recommends asking someone in the house to take a photo of you sitting, so you can check whether your torso and head are in a straight line.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e2cb80db01dd889814a8f48b725b8308ca23f647\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2cb80db01dd889814a8f48b725b8308ca23f647/0_119_5760_4310/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The right posture for working at a computer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"748\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When sitting, \u2018ideally you would have the shoulder almost directly above the hips\u2019.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phanie/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The chair should support your lower back, so the spine is in its natural S-shape. If not, Davis recommends adding a cushion or rolled-up towel. This lumbar support is not designed to take all your weight, just to act as a reminder to sit in an upright, S-shaped position.</p> \n<p>The chair should also allow the knees and elbows to be at right angles, to minimise unnecessary muscle strain.</p> \n<p>If the chair is too high and your feet aren\u2019t supported, Davis recommends using a stable surface to prop them up, like a box or ream of paper. The desk should support the elbows \u2013 if that\u2019s too high and you can\u2019t lift the chair, try sitting on a pillow or a cushion.</p> \n<h2>Keep your eyes up</h2> \n<p>Your keyboard and mouse should be about 8cm to 10cm from the edge of your desk, and the top of the monitor should be about one arm\u2019s length away, at eye level to avoid leaning forward or back.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0109a84348296f63ff5db3a7500751e1f2f7a399\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0109a84348296f63ff5db3a7500751e1f2f7a399/265_169_2714_2855/951.jpg\" alt=\"If you must use a laptop at home, experts suggest raising it to eye level using a shoe box or books, and using an external keyboard and mouse\" width=\"951\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If you must use a laptop at home, experts suggest raising it to eye level using a shoe box or books, and using an external keyboard and mouse.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alyx Gorman</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This can pose problems for users of laptops, which are best suited to occasional work and checking emails while travelling. People who don\u2019t have other options should source an external keyboard and mouse so they can raise the laptop to eye level using something like a shoebox, to prevent hunching over. Similarly, any reference documents that make you look down should be raised \u2013 Davis uses his mother\u2019s old recipe book holder for this.</p> \n<h2><strong>Movement is your friend</strong></h2> \n<p>If there really are limited options for achieving the ideal work position, Oakman says you should do your best to change positions and move between sitting and standing frequently.</p> \n<p>As an exercise physiologist, Davis says regular rest breaks are critical, making sure to get out of the chair every 30 to 45 minutes \u2013 if only briefly, to move around, stretch and change position. This will shift the strain between intervertebral discs, the spine\u2019s shock absorbers.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe most common time you see injuries, even for healthy workers in a sedentary office job or home setup, is with prolonged sitting,\u201d he says. A common example is when someone\u2019s focused on typing for two or three hours, \u201cloading their postures\u201d. Then, when they bend down to pick something up, their back cracks.</p> \n<p>Other ways to facilitate more movement include taking phone calls standing up, or walking around wherever possible.</p> \n<h2><strong>What about a standing workstation?</strong></h2> \n<p>Standup desks are great, Davis says, mostly for facilitating frequent postural change without having to move away from the desk. But they tend to be expensive, so he wouldn\u2019t recommend running out to buy one. If you have a bench or ledge at an appropriate height to set up a monitor or laptop, he suggests you could use it to work standing up for 15 or 20 minutes every hour or two \u2013 the maximum he recommends standing is for 20% to 30% of the working day.</p> \n<p>As far as fit balls go, Davis has no problem with using them for their intended purpose \u2013 which is exercise. But they\u2019re not designed to be used as a chair and cause similar problems to sitting and standing, if you end up in a static posture for prolonged periods.

The federal government is also subsidising airlines to operate a skeleton schedule of flights overseas to bring Australians home.</p> <p>The recovery will depend not just on the Australian government\u2019s timetable to relax restrictions on travel but also on how the rest of the world tackles the pandemic. International travel could be stalled for two years or more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/virgin-australia-what-does-voluntary-administration-mean-and-how-will-it-affect-you\">Virgin Australia: what does voluntary administration mean and how will it affect you?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This raises questions about whether either Virgin Mark 2 or Qantas could withstand a prolonged downturn in the industry without government support, despite the federal government so far ruling out a bailout for Virgin.</p> <p>The major risk for Virgin Mark 2 would be Qantas flooding the market with cheap fares the moment restrictions on travel were eased, experts said.</p> <p>The chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Rod Sims, said the regulator would work with the government on the competition arrangements for the airline industry as issues around Virgin become clearer.</p> <p>He pointed out the ACCC now had greater powers to deal with abuses of market power that either have the purpose or effect of limiting competition.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s silly to say we can\u2019t have two airlines,\u201d Sims said. \u201cSydney and Melbourne are both big cities by world standards and you have to fly between them, so I don\u2019t buy the argument that we can only support one airline.\u201d</p> <p>The former ACCC chairman Allan Fels, who oversaw deregulation of Australia\u2019s domestic airline market, said the government might find itself forced to intervene.</p> <p>The first pressures may come if Virgin Mark 2 and Qantas decided to wind back regional and rural services and flights to major tourist destinations such as Cairns, leaving towns with little or no service.</p> <p>Significant political pressure will come from MPs in these areas, mostly Nationals.</p> <p>Fels also warned about the potential for Qantas to want to cut fares and drive up its yields once domestic air travel resumed.</p> <p>\u201cIf Qantas finds itself really struggling will they be tempted to grab the whole market during the slowdown?\u201d Fels asked.</p> <p>But Fels noted that Qantas had accepted competition in the wake of Ansett\u2019s collapse rather than the alternative of being regulated as a monopoly.</p> <p>\u201cQantas was somewhat fearful after Ansett collapsed that it would regulated as a monopoly. I doubt they will be trying to drive Virgin out of the market,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But he said Virgin would clearly have to change its business model to avoid running up the losses of recent years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/virgin-australia-expected-to-go-into-voluntary-administration-as-government-rules-out-saving-airline\">Virgin Australia plans bare bones flight service as administrators look for buyers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Virgin would need to decide whether it wanted to be a full service airline and chase lucrative business customers, which was high-risk but high-reward, or whether it wanted to be a budget airline, Fels said.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s chequered history on fostering competition in the domestic airline industry also points to the importance of trying to recapitalise Virgin without it being dismantled and sold off in pieces.</p> <p>Dismantling the airline, even if someone bought assets to start a new one, would likely lead to long delays, as the company negotiated for terminal access and applied for a new air operators certificate. The certification cannot be transferred and is granted only once the Civil Aviation Safety Authority is satisfied that the key personnel in the new airline have sufficient experience.</p>",
  "<p>In early 2013, when the Philippines <a href=\"https://pca-cpa.org/en/cases/7/\">brought an international case</a> against China for violations of its rights under the law of the sea, a five-member arbitral tribunal was selected, with Thomas Mensah appointed as president. With China making extensive claims to resources falling within a \u201cnine-dash line\u201d (the undefined, vaguely located demarcation line used by China but disputed by other countries) across vast swathes of the South China Seas, the case was politically explosive for the whole region and beyond. </p> <p>Mensah\u2019s appointment reflected the esteem with which he was held, a deep knowledge of the law coupled with a recognition of his pragmatism and principle, and his fearless independent spirit. Three years later, under his guidance, the tribunal rendered a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/jul/12/south-china-sea-dispute-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-hague-court-ruling\">unanimous and far-reaching award</a>, decisively rejecting China\u2019s claim. The decision offered a rare example of judgment free from fear of \u201cgreat power\u201d retribution.</p> <p>Mensah, who has died at the age of 87, was the world\u2019s leading judge and arbitrator on the settlement of international maritime disputes. In 1996, when the new <a href=\"https://www.itlos.org/\">international tribunal for the law of the sea</a> (ITLOS) began to function in Hamburg, he was elected as one of its 21 judges, and then chosen by colleagues to serve as the tribunal\u2019s first president. In that role he oversaw the adoption of the rules and procedures that formed the character of the tribunal, and have stood it in good stead ever since.</p> <p>He spent 19 years at ITLOS, also serving as an arbitrator and, later, as an ad hoc judge at ITLOS and at the international court of justice. The cases he decided were varied. In 2001, when Ireland and Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2001/oct/27/energy.nuclearindustry\">disagreed</a> over a proposed new nuclear facility at Sellafield, in Cumbria, Mensah served as president of the tribunal. In a dispute on the delimitation of the Bay of Bengal, as judge ad hoc appointed by Bangladesh, he collaborated with his counterpart, appointed by Myanmar, and produced a joint opinion \u2013 a rare act in inter-state litigation by two \u201copposing\u201d judges. In a dispute between Argentina and Ghana, he confirmed his spirit of independence by joining in a unanimous decision against his own country.</p> <p>His final case, between Ghana and Ivory Coast, brought particular satisfaction, ending a long-running maritime boundary dispute. These and other decisions reflected his conviction that international courts and tribunals contributed to the public good by ensuring that \u201cinternational disputes are resolved peacefully, for the benefit of the parties and the international community as a whole\u201d.</p> <p>Mensah was born in Kumasi, the capital of the Asante kingdom, at a time when it had already become incorporated into Britain\u2019s Gold Coast colony. He attended Achimota school in Accra, at a time of growing nationalist consciousness, and then went to the University of Ghana as the country approached its independence, a formative period in his early life.</p> <p>In 1959 he obtained a first-class degree in law at the University of London, then headed to Yale Law School in the US, where in 1964 he obtained a doctorate. His thesis, on the right of self-determination for colonies, focused on the role of international institutions, including courts, to achieve this objective. The subject was one of enduring personal interest, one to which he remained committed throughout his life.</p> <p>From Yale he returned to Accra, to lecture in law at the University of Ghana, serving briefly as dean of the faculty of law. He might have enjoyed a successful academic career but opted instead for public service of a more practical form, in the international domain. In 1968 he returned to London to join the secretariat of the <a href=\"http://www.imo.org/en/Pages/Default.aspx\">International Maritime Organization</a> (IMO), the UN agency then based in Piccadilly, later on the Albert Embankment. He rose to the position of director of legal affairs and external relations, and assistant secretary general, in 1981. His time there coincided with growing environmental concerns, and he played a formative role in giving birth to a new subject area, the protection of the marine environment, with standards for ships and rules on liability for damage by oil pollution and other sources.</p> <p>Retirement from the IMO in 1990 opened the door to a new life, based at the family home in London. He lectured and wrote, and in 1995 was appointed Ghana\u2019s first high commissioner to South Africa. Presenting credentials to President Nelson Mandela was a significant moment. The following year he became a judge at the international tribunal for the law of the sea, subsequently being elected as its first president. This was the start of global renown as an international adjudicator.</p> <p>Anyone who came across Tom sensed his special qualities, the dignity, intelligence and biting humour coupled with a gentle humanity, an interest in the person. With a superbly mischievous twinkle in his eyes, he had no interest in baubles and honours. Much more fun to sneak off to an Arsenal game, or eat with family and friends, or just talk about the state of the world.</p> <p>Those who appeared before him as counsel appreciated the practical efficacy and intellectual acuity. Those who sat with him recognised his unique ability to forge agreement among disparate colleagues. One of his closest friends, his judicial colleague Judge Rudiger Wolfrum, explained what made it special to judge with him, particularly on the most contentious issues, such as the South China Seas: \u201cTom could listen, understand, show sympathy,\u201d he told me. \u201cHe had his own views, but he never insisted upon them to the exclusion of the views of others.\u201d</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Akosua, children, grandchildren and a great-grandson.</p> <p>\u2022 Thomas Aboagye Mensah, international lawyer, born 12 May 1932; died 7 April 2020</p>",

Hundreds of armed police thwarted an attempt to <a href=\"https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/watch-heavy-police-presence-on-r300-after-attempted-looting-of-watergate-mall-20200422\">loot a shopping mall</a> near Cape Town on Wednesday.</p> <p>Earlier in the week hundreds of people in the Mitchell Plains township fought running battles with the police, hurling rocks and setting up street barricades with burning tyres, over undelivered food parcels.</p> <p>South Africa is one of the most unequal societies in the world and has a tradition of street protests against authorities\u2019 failures to provide basic services.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very dangerous situation,\u201d said Scott Drimie, of the thinktank Southern Africa Food Lab. \u201cWhen you add hunger to that, now there\u2019s deprivation \u2026 and then you add the enforcement with the army and police, that needs to be handled very carefully.\u201d</p> <p>The Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies said that if people could not get food, \u201cthere is every likelihood of violent conflict, including widespread looting.\u201d</p> <p>The latest government figures show 118,000 people have been charged with breaking the lockdown restrictions.</p> <p>The defence minister, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, confirmed the decision to mobilise the army on Wednesday. \u201cIf you look at the numbers and the rate at which the infection has gone up, you will realise that at some point we may actually need the kind of human deployment which has never been seen before,\u201d she told local radio.</p> <p>Some serious crimes have fallen dramatically during the lockdown, according to figures released on Wednesday. Murders are down by 72% in the last month compared with the same period last year, assaults have fallen by 85% and violent robbery by 70%.</p> <p>The police minister, Bheki Cele, said more than 190 roadblocks had been put in place daily countrywide and more than 680 vehicle checkpoints. \u201cRaids have been conducted which have seen illegal liquor outlets shut down and non-essential services such as mines, factories and other companies busted,\u201d Cele said on Wednesday.</p> <p>Figures also show a sharp fall in recorded gender-based violence, though experts and activists said this was probably due to the difficulties women faced in reaching police or others to report attacks.</p> <p>Tina Thiart, a trustee of 1,000 Women One Voice, an NGO that works through grassroots initiatives to tackle violence against women and children, said women were locked up with abusers and reports to the NGO of gender-based violence had \u201creally spiked\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe stats we get from everywhere \u2026 we believe it is much higher. It comes in waves but this time it feels a lot worse. There\u2019s a real problem in the camps that have been set up for homeless. We are getting calls from affluent households too,\u201d Thiart said.</p> <p>Experts said a rise in reports of abuse of children also suggested an increase in gender-based violence.</p> <p>Last week <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/presidency.gov.za/president-desk-mon13apr20\">Ramaphosa said</a> he had ordered that family protection police units be reinforced because \u201cwomen and girls are being terrorised inside their own homes, forcing them to make desperate calls for help.\u201d</p> <p>South Africa\u2019s efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19 have been widely praised. The country has drawn on long experience of fighting infectious diseases to launch an ambitious screening and testing campaign involving tens of thousands of medical personnel seeking out hotspots of infection.</p> <p>However, with winter approaching there are fears of a rapid rise in cases if the lockdown is lifted too soon. </p>",
  "<p>Finally. Finally we have a fully functioning opposition: one united behind a leader in whom they \u2013 almost \u2013 all believe. Keir Starmer might not have imagined a near-empty and silent chamber for his first outing at prime minister\u2019s questions, but in a way it played to his strengths. For 45 minutes the usual Commons bear pit was transformed into a quiet courtroom drama, with a top QC up against the government\u2019s junior barrister. A no contest, master versus pupil.</p> <p>Starmer is never going to set the world alight with grand gestures or the passion of his oratory. But what he does bring to the job is intelligence and a forensic attention to detail. He doesn\u2019t just read his six prepared questions, he listens to the answers and adapts his follow-ups accordingly. Neither does he raise his voice or get rattled: rather he adapts his tone to the occasion. And he was near enough note perfect.</p> <p>After a brief reassurance that he would be seeking to support the government wherever possible during the coronavirus emergency, Starmer got to the heart of most of the country\u2019s concerns. The health secretary had promised 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month and as of yesterday had managed just 18,000. How on earth did the government imagine it was going to reach its own target?</p> <p>Filling in for the absent Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab made the mistake of imagining he could go toe-to-toe with Starmer. Unfortunately the beta blockers he had taken to make him appear even-tempered had rather dulled his mind. We have the capacity to do 40,000 tests, Dom replied, and in any case the UK was going to ramp up its testing regime exponentially in the next eight days. If true, that would be remarkable, as Raab would have committed the government to a target of more like 400,000 tests a day.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t need correcting,\u201d Starmer observed, nearly managing to keep the irritation out of his voice. Matt Hancock had promised 100,000 tests, not the capacity to do 100,000 tests. So the government was well behind its own targets. There was no point in setting up testing centres in places where NHS and care workers who suspected they were ill could not get to without travelling on public transport, risking infecting other people.</p> <p>Starmer then asked if Raab could give the exact number of NHS staff and care workers who had died in the pandemic so far. He couldn\u2019t. But then neither could Helen Whately, the social care minister who is actually paid to know these things, in yet another disastrous media round earlier in the morning. Quite why No 10 insists on repeatedly sending out ministers whose only discernible ability is to know nothing about anything is one of the least investigated side-effects of the pandemic. \u201cI\u2019m putting you on notice that I\u2019ll be asking the same question next week,\u201d said Starmer. \u201cHopefully you will be able to answer it by then.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t count on it.</p> <p>Instead, Raab wittered on about how brilliantly the government had been doing, given the circumstances. You\u2019d hate to think what the death rates would have been if the government hadn\u2019t been quite so brilliant, given we are on target to overtake the Italians and the Spanish. Starmer merely ended with a warning. The UK had been slow to react in almost every respect. He made it sound like the opening address for the prosecution in the judge-led public inquiry that will inevitably follow when the pandemic is over. Raab had good reason to look worried.</p> <p>Most of the rest of PMQs took place with MPs dialling in remotely. And given that it was only the first day, the technology worked more or less OK, with only David Mundell failing to connect. As for the others, the chamber was treated to eight large TV screens of Ian Blackford, Peter Bone and Barry Gardiner. Which felt like seven too many. One of most MPs is usually more than enough.</p> <p>Matt Hancock appeared rather more at ease with himself during the statement that followed than he had at the No 10 press briefing the day before. Maybe he\u2019s had time to reflect on the fact Dominic Cummings has lined him up as the government\u2019s fall guy and has concluded he\u2019s better off out of such a poisonous atmosphere. Que sera, sera.</p> <p>Even so, his statement wasn\u2019t without its oddities. Most notably when he said he was going to repeat his five pillars. Only to unexpectedly add a sixth. It wasn\u2019t clear if this sixth was to replace one of the others that had since crumbled, or whether it was genuinely a new addition. On the whole, ministers like to keep things in fives as they think that makes them look in control. Six of anything is a symptom of woolly thinking. Though maybe he was just building up to seven pillars of wisdom in time for Ramadan.</p> <p>The official advice is for those over 70 to continue to self-isolate at home, but nothing was going to stop Jeremy Corbyn from appearing in person. Even though he didn\u2019t have anything to add that couldn\u2019t have been said remotely. Still, good to know that Rebel, Rebel can still stick it to the Man.</p> <p>What we didn\u2019t find out though, was why the permanent secretary to the Foreign Office had suddenly remembered that the evidence he had given to the select committee the previous day about the UK\u2019s decision not to join an EU procurement scheme had actually been completely wrong. You could almost feel Classic Dom\u2019s gun in Sir Simon McDonald\u2019s back as he wrote that retraction. Still, come the inevitable reckoning, the one thing we can guarantee is there won\u2019t be a show trial. With Starmer as leader of the opposition, any trial will be the genuine article.</p>",

  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> was killing Americans in the US weeks before health officials, doctors or the government realized, it emerged early on Wednesday.</p> <p>Health officials now say two people died from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/coronavirus-what-scientists-learned-covid-19-so-far\">Covid-19</a> in California in early February before the first reported death from the disease in the United States.</p> <p>Santa Clara county officials, in northern California, said they now know a 57-year-old woman died in her home on 6 February and and a 69-year-old man died in his home on 17 February. The woman, Patricia Dowd, was a San Jose resident, according to public death records.</p> <p>The first official recorded death in the nation from the virus was reported on 29 February in Kirkland, in the state of Washington. Before the results from the three deaths, officials believed the first case of community-transmitted coronavirus in Santa Clara county had not occurred before 28 February.</p> <p>The medical examiner-coroner of Santa Clara county, received confirmation on Tuesday that tissue samples obtained during autopsies and sent to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tested positive for the virus, officials said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/apr/22/see-how-coronavirus-can-spread-through-a-population-and-how-countries-flatten-the-curve\">See how coronavirus can spread through a population, and how countries flatten the curve</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A third such death \u2013 a 70-year-old man \u2013 had occurred on 6 March.

She noted that since testing at the time was limited by the federal government\u2019s guidance on who should be tested, health officials were unable to act sooner.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we identified our first travel-associated cases in late January, we had a very narrow case definition,\u201d Cody said. \u201cWe were only looking among people who had traveled. We were wondering, how do we detect community transmission if we\u2019re not testing people who haven\u2019t traveled? I think this answers the question in that we didn\u2019t detect community transmission.\u201d</p> <p>None of the three early deaths had significant travel history, Cody said. She suspects that the region\u2019s \u201crobust influenza season\u201d this year may have included some cases of coronavirus.</p> <p>The announcement came after the California governor, Gavin Newsom, promised a \u201cdeep dive\u201d update on Wednesday of the state\u2019s ability to test for the coronavirus and to track and isolate people who have it, one of the six indicators he says is key to lifting a \u201cstay-at-home\u201d order that has slowed the spread of the disease while forcing millions of people to file for unemployment benefits.</p> <p>\u201cThis will go to the obvious questions and queries that all of us are asking: When? \u2026 When do you see a little bit of a release in the valve so that we can let out a little of this pressure,\u201d Newsom said.</p> <p>Newsom said the state was testing an average of 14,500 people a day, up from just 2,000 tests a day at the beginning of April.</p> <p>Still, in a state of nearly 40 million people, that\u2019s not enough for public health officials to know for sure the reach of the highly contagious virus that is still causing outbreaks across the state in nursing homes and homeless shelters.</p> <p>Newsom said he wants the state to test at least 25,000 people a day by the end of April.</p> <p>California has more than 35,600 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,300 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.</p> <p>California has been under a mandatory, statewide stay-at-home order for more than a month.</p> <p>Last week, Newsom said he will not consider loosening that order until hospitalizations, particularly those in intensive care units, flatten and start to decline for at least two weeks.

  "<p>On one level, the argument about what Sir Simon McDonald said to the foreign affairs select committee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/uk-refusal-of-eu-ventilator-offer-was-political-decision\">this week</a> can be dismissed as a storm in a Whitehall teacup. Hours after the head of the foreign office had called Britain\u2019s refusal to join the European Union\u2019s procurement efforts during the Covid-19 pandemic a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d, McDonald retracted his words. Whitehall-watchers are fascinated. The wider world has bigger things to worry about.</p> <p>But on another level, this week\u2019s row is political dynamite \u2013 and for two main reasons.</p> <p>First, and more immediately, the McDonald affair is another challenge, this time from the Whitehall high command itself, to the government\u2019s increasingly desperate attempts to show that ministers have successfully gripped the effort to secure life-saving medical equipment and protective kit for the fight against the virus. At its most serious, it comes down to an admission that ministers who previously said that the UK did not take part in the ventilator procurement programme because of \u201ccommunication\u201d errors were actually in a position, early on in the pandemic, to save more lives by joining the scheme, and yet deliberately chose not to.</p> <p>Second, Tuesday\u2019s furore shoots a beam of light into the dark and tangled argument at the heart of British politics about the longer term strategy and objectives of Boris Johnson\u2019s government. It is a reminder that, in this government, power still rests with those who believe the overriding objective of this administration, even now, is a hard Brexit. It implies that in Johnson\u2019s government the fight against Covid-19 is, of course, massively important \u2013 but only up to a point.</p> <p>McDonald\u2019s session with the foreign affairs committee was not, at the outset, about participation in the EU procurement programme at all. Most of the first hour was about efforts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/16/uk-flies-home-1000-britons-but-65000-left-in-limbo-by-covid-19\">repatriate UK nationals</a> from around the globe. But when, later on, the committee chair, Tom Tugendhat, asked whether Britain\u2019s failure to take part in the EU programme was a political decision, the head of the foreign office confirmed that it was.</p> <p>The hasty retraction letter on Tuesday evening was extraordinary. If nothing else, it confirms the incredible sensitivities in government at the moment about its handling of the pandemic. The letter also needs to be read carefully. The key sentence nevertheless appears to be this one: \u201cMinisters were not briefed by our mission in Brussels about the scheme and a political decision was not taken on whether or not to participate.\u201d</p> <p>The more you read the letter, the more questions it raises. The key point is that, in early February, while the UK\u2019s Brussels mission did not brief ministers \u2013 the denial in the letter \u2013 about the EU scheme, the Brussels mission clearly did brief departmental civil servants. In practice, that means that Brussels briefed the Foreign Office and the Department of Health and Social Care about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/coronavirus-what-is-eu-medical-equipment-scheme-why-did-uk-opt-out\">ventilator procurement scheme</a>, presumably at a senior level, in detail and as an issue requiring priority attention. Those civil servants will then have briefed their ministers, including the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, and the health secretary, Matt Hancock. So ministers were indeed briefed, only not by \u201cour mission in Brussels\u201d. In other words, the ministers knew about the scheme and knew they could take part in it.</p> <p>What exactly happened next depends in part on what is meant by a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d. That phrase has now been denied. But it is hard to take the retraction too seriously, other than as a means of removing ministerial fingerprints. It can mean what many people would assume, that the decision was political rather than practical or commercial. But in civil service-speak, a political decision can also mean a decision taken by ministers, who are political, rather than officials or expert specialists, who advise them about it.</p> <p>In this context, that would most probably mean the decision, even in the shape of a \u201cnon-decision\u201d to let the issue lie on the table, was taken by or on behalf of Boris Johnson in No 10, but it would be essentially political in both senses. That seems to fit with other evidence suggesting that the question was indeed discussed at Cobra meetings, which always report to the prime minister. It would also be valuable to clarify how and in what terms that initial decision in London was then communicated in a response to the EU in Brussels. If London chose to write itself out of the EU process in February, that may help explain why the UK claims not to have been informed about other joint schemes later.</p> <p>Even without the full details, there is no way of reading these events as anything except another, and early, example of the government\u2019s failure to take Covid-19 seriously enough soon enough. More than two months later, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/22/covid-19-starmer-grills-raab-over-care-home-deaths-in-first-virtual-pmqs\">Raab\u2019s words in the Commons</a> today, it is now the government\u2019s official policy to take \u201cthe right measures at the right time, guided by the science and the medical experts\u201d. But this was not true in February, when the science and the experts were ignored at Cobra. Instead, the decision not to join the EU efforts has contributed to the shortages and failings on which Keir Starmer began his parliamentary career as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/22/an-impressive-debut-readers-on-keir-starmers-first-pmqs\">Labour leader today</a>.</p> <p>But the importance of the decision goes further, and in a direction that Starmer chose not to follow, perhaps wisely on his debut. The political decision not to join the EU procurement process reflected what was uppermost in Johnson\u2019s and other minds in February. Britain, as McDonald stressed this week, had left the EU on 31 January. The Brexiters had done what they promised at the election. The national ship was being set on a course that turned its back on Europe. They weren\u2019t interested in new post-Brexit links with EU schemes any more than they were interested in establishing such links during the transition period.</p> <p>Any suggestion, at this of all moments, that the UK should opt into an EU scheme on anything will have been dismissed with contempt. It was in every way a political decision. A month or so later, things \u2013 including politics \u2013 were different. When Hancock was offered a renewed chance to join <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/21/government-misses-out-on-14m-facemasks-for-nhs-in-four-weeks\">another EU-wide scheme</a>, the offer was taken up. But by then Covid-19 was a far larger reality, the UK was facing lockdown, and ministers were playing catch-up, just as they still are today.</p> <p>McDonald\u2019s retraction on Tuesday shows that, even in the face of Covid-19, not as much has changed as some might assume. The retraction is not just a partisan correction of the record. It is a statement that the Johnson government will maintain its ideological opposition to anything except a hard Brexit. Those who say, as <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-ex-deputy-pm-david-lidington-calls-for-brexit-transition-period-extension-11976818\">David Lidington did this week</a>, that a Brexit extension is now inevitable because of Covid-19, may be deceiving themselves.</p> <p>In this government, especially as it struggles to control the coronavirus outbreak in the face of shortages and deaths, the pandemic remains an all-consuming but still essentially temporary concern. Johnson\u2019s essential project is not to save and rebuild the nation. It is Brexit. Always was. Still is.</p> <p>\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>Dave\u2019s Mercury prize-winning debut album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/19/best-albums-2019-no-2-dave-psychodrama\">Psychodrama</a>, was the biggest-selling British rap album in the UK in 2019, certified gold for selling more than 100,000 units. Those numbers wouldn\u2019t even have landed him in the top 10 biggest rap albums in France last year, where <a href=\"https://djbooth.net/features/2020-01-09-france-got-something-to-say-album-sales\">artists from greater Paris sell more rap albums than acts from any other city</a>. But, while Dave won album of the year at this year\u2019s Brit awards, and gave a nationally televised performance decrying the prime minister as racist, at last month\u2019s Victoires de la Musique \u2013 France\u2019s equivalent of the Brits \u2013 none of France\u2019s black or Arab rappers were nominated in an album, artist or song category.</p> <p>Days after the ceremony, French music industry body SNEP, which is responsible for collating the charts, distributing royalty payments and more, declared rap music an \u201coverexposed phenomenon\u201d in <a href=\"https://snepmusique.com/actualites-du-snep/marche-2019-de-la-musique-enregistree-decryptage-des-resultats/\">their 2019 market report</a>. It argued that \u201cfan support for urban music must not eclipse the performances of other musical genres\u201d \u2013 an explicit call for less promotion and celebration of the most successful French popular music movement of all time.</p> <p>This popularity, SNEP said, would be \u201ccorrected\u201d as older listeners \u2013 who are assumed to listen to other types of music \u2013 started paying for subscriptions to streaming services. Unlike in the UK and US, SNEP does not count ad-supported streams or YouTube views towards sales \u2013 an unfortunate decision for rap, given that it is the country\u2019s most streamed genre. These constraints notwithstanding, last year French rappers were responsible for 16 of the 19 No 1 singles in France, and topped the album chart for 31 weeks.</p> <p>Domestic rap has become the soundtrack to a national identity crisis, viewed by its detractors as a threat to the cultural landscape of a country marked by bitter racial divides. Yet, after three decades of attempts to delegitimise it, many artists have come to ambivalently accept the persistent discrimination. There was no outrage at their being overlooked at the Victoires. Most musicians and industry figures I approached for comment were not prepared to speak publicly about prejudice within the industry, even while acknowledging it as omnipresent. One artist manager said: \u201cIt\u2019s not shocking, it\u2019s always been here. We work on the fringes, organise ourselves, create our own businesses and move forward.\u201d</p> <p>French rap\u2019s ascent from peripheral subculture to mainstream staple began during the golden era of 90s US hip-hop. Inspired by the political rhymes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/dec/07/public-enemy-10-of-the-best\">Public Enemy</a>, <em>rap fran\u00e7ais</em> built its reputation on vociferous social criticism, opposing racism and police brutality.

France had been largely white until the 1950s. An increase in migrants from the country\u2019s North African former colonies throughout the 60s and 70s paralleled a period of immense economic change intensified by the oil crisis in the 70s. As successive governments failed to temper unemployment, a prominent far-right rhetoric emerged, scapegoating migrants for the economic malaise.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jean-marie-le-pen\">Jean-Marie Le Pen</a>\u2019s xenophobic Front National party stoked racial tensions in the 80s, proposing to change the law to favour French nationals for jobs, rap became another target. In 1995, the group <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjalUVgq32E\">Minist\u00e8re Amer</a> were<a href=\"https://www.liberation.fr/france-archive/1995/08/31/ministere-de-l-interieur-contre-ministere-amer-une-plainte-a-ete-deposee-contre-le-groupe-de-rap_140412\"> charged</a> for an anti-police song, casting the first stone in a decades-long conflict between the interior ministry and rap. The same year, Supr\u00eame NTM were arrested while performing their song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDlobk6WXI\">Police</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/16/news/2-french-rappers-get-jail-for-insults-to-police.html\">sentenced to six months in prison</a>.</p> <p>In the 2000s, rap found a new enemy in interior minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-sarkozy\">Nicolas Sarkozy</a>. The future president led a decade-long campaign against rap, bringing libel charges against <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/23/world/europe/23iht-rapper.4.16422288.html\">La Rumeur</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/11/arts.france\">Sniper</a>, and making it an imprisonable offence to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/feb/07/france.jonhenley\">offend the dignity of the republic</a>\u201d.

Before his campaign for re-election, his ally and interior minister Claude Gu\u00e9ant infamously declared that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20120205-france-minister-slammed-unequal-civilisations-politics-gueant\">all civilisations are not of equal value</a>\u201d.

The group\u2019s success renewed major label interest and coincided with the streaming revolution. With access and distribution democratised, a new generation of minority French youths could now break into the charts \u2013 and make money.</p> <p>SNEP integrated streams into sales in 2016, and the resulting tidal wave of domestic rap that entered the charts was typified by French-Algerian brothers <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PODnRarD78\">PNL</a>, who independently sold a million copies of their album, Dans la L\u00e9gende. Like France\u2019s World Cup-winning football players \u2013 who in 2016 were up against an attempt by the French Football Federation to introduce a quota system to restrict players of African origin \u2013 France\u2019s black and Arab rappers rose from ostracised communities to provide the country with its most notable 21st-century cultural achievements. As Le Pen\u2019s daughter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen\">Marine</a>, made historic gains from the anti-Islam mood in the wake of the Paris terror attack in 2015, Muslim rappers such as PNL and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/05/mhd-so-many-french-rappers-are-inspired-by-american-hip-hop-im-the-opposite\">MHD</a> emerged to front a domestic rap revolution from the throes of racial intolerance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b9f22bb6104bfcc0b8f5552c80c62854d84c7b89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9f22bb6104bfcc0b8f5552c80c62854d84c7b89/0_0_2048_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"PNL atop the Eiffel Tower.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Domestic rap revolution\u2019 ...

MHD, who is currently awaiting trial for a 2018 murder allegation, blended contemporary trap with the pop music of his Senegal and Guinea heritage, and, Sylla says, \u201ccreated space for a new generation of Afro-French artists such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqYxVsEaypk\">Ninho</a> and<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPGgnzc34tY\"> Aya Nakamura</a>, and even encouraged established rappers such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Stet_4bnclk\">Booba</a> to embrace their roots\u201d. As Le Pen\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/05/marine-le-pen-promises-liberation-from-the-eu-with-france-first-policies\">popularity</a> led to a run-off with Emmanuel Macron in the 2017 presidential election, France\u2019s widening schism was underscored by a record breaking year for rap: 11 No 1 albums, with SNEP handing out more than 200 gold, platinum and diamond singles sales plaques to French rappers.</p> <p>But four months into 2018, SNEP hastily<a href=\"https://www.lebureauexport.fr/en/news/2018/04/france-snep-will-no-longer-take-free-streaming-into-account/\"> reformed</a> its chart criteria, disqualifying all streams played without a paid subscription. The organisation \u2013 composed of members from all major labels in France \u2013 insisted that the change (aligning with Germany and Italy, but not the US or UK) was made to ensure a sales system more reflective of revenue. However, an A&amp;R director of a major French record label, who spoke to me on the condition of anonymity, maintains the sudden change was \u201cclearly a response to rap\u2019s unanticipated success\u201d.</p> <p>The amendments did little to impede rap\u2019s growth, which in 2018 led to nine No 1 albums and 14 No 1 singles (almost twice the number of rap hits to ever top the US Billboard 100 in a year). SNEP retorted in January of 2019, this time with another revision to album classifications that divided the number of streams of the most played song on an album in half. Still, rap\u2019s success continued. In 2019, PNL\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/05/pnl-deux-freres-review\">Deux Fr\u00e8res</a> was one of 10 No 1 French rap albums and one of five to be certified multi-platinum; former Sexion d\u2019Assaut frontman Gims <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5_KIs-wbY\">filled</a> the 81,000-capacity national stadium and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQK0f6wzww8\">Soprano</a> played two sold-out concerts to 100,000 fans in <a href=\"https://www.laprovence.com/actu/en-direct/5821137/2019-dans-le-retro-une-annee-marquee-par-le-double-de-soprano.html\">Marseille</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8b9bdd65e9c1485134a956bfb0770ccb8f2b0ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8b9bdd65e9c1485134a956bfb0770ccb8f2b0ce/0_0_2799_1867/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soprano performs at Victoires de la Musique in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soprano performs at Victoires de la Musique in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Samson/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And yet, at this year\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKZLOOr4wGU\"> Victoires de la Musique</a>, rap\u2019s landmark achievements were whitewashed in favour of purveyors of the French <em>chanson</em> style. Aside from PNL\u2019s cursory nomination for an audiovisual award, decided by a public vote, only two rappers, both white, were nominated. Both lost. For the first time in 20 years, there was no category for urban album, previously known by the bizarre racial catch-all \u201crap, reggae or groove\u201d award. Victoires\u2019 president, Romain Vivien, <a href=\"https://www.tplmusique.org/romain-vivien-representer-la-filiere-musique-dans-son-entier/\">refuted claims</a> of a lack of minority representation,<strong> </strong>saying that the nominations merely reflected its members\u2019 sympathies, though this itself is arguably a sign of institutional racism.</p> <p>The Victoires, created by the ministry of culture as part of its objective to promote and protect French cultural heritage, were not designed for hip-hop, according to Jonathyne Briggs, author of Sounds French: Globalisation, Cultural Communities and Pop Music. \u201cRap has always been seen as something external, imported to France, only exacerbated by its connection to the culture of \u00e9migr\u00e9s\u201d, he says. Briggs believes the continued focus on traditional pop forms will do little to hinder rap\u2019s popularity, though: \u201cPop music is about conformity. Rap\u2019s nonconformity is still able to amplify discourse outside of existing structures.\u201d</p> <p>The late funk musician Manu Dibango <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2020/01/31/au-fil-des-voix-militant-pour-la-diversite-culturelle_6027994_3246.html\">lamented</a> the homogeneity at this year\u2019s Victoires, claiming the list of nominees read like a \u201cvain search for diversity\u201d. According to Olivier Cachin, a journalist and presenter of rap TV shows for 30 years, what began as indignation 20 years ago is now an irreconcilable \u201cdivorce\u201d. From the humiliation of Celtic trio <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80hMEKlLVgQ\">Manau</a> infamously besting French rap royalty Supr\u00eame<em><strong> </strong></em>NTM, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_6KlvS992Q\">Arsenik</a> and MC Solaar to the first rap award in 1999 to the inexplicable exclusions in 2020, Cachin says the message to rap was always clear: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.francetvinfo.fr/culture/musique/victoires-de-la-musique/c-est-vu-comme-une-sous-categorie-pourquoi-les-victoires-de-la-musique-et-le-rap-n-arrivent-pas-a-accorder-leurs-violons_3822861.html\">You\u2019re not welcome</a>.\u201d Many believe it\u2019s time for rap to have its own award show, such as the Mobo or BET awards; a statement ceremony that, in France, would only serve to spotlight the gross racial divide within the industry.</p> <p>A spokesperson for SNEP suggested to me that rap\u2019s presence in France is merely cyclical, pointing to pop\u2019s success in 2019. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember the biggest selling album of the year was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy1xQSiLx8U\">Ang</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy1xQSiLx8U\">\u00e8le</a>\u2019s,\u201d they said, referring to the 24-year-old Belgian singer. \u201cWhile urban music comprises much of the top albums and singles, it doesn\u2019t reflect the interests of France as a whole, which are still largely pop, rock and <em>chanson fran\u00e7aise</em>\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f44e3503067b32fddc58bdd7ef189139393d9bd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f44e3503067b32fddc58bdd7ef189139393d9bd4/0_0_2953_4429/667.jpg\" alt=\"Aya Nakamura.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Demarcated down ethnic lines\u2019 ...

Malian-French <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDFupjRKwZY\">pop</a> star Aya Nakamura was inaccurately labelled \u201c<a href=\"https://snepmusique.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Global-Music-Report-2019-_Site.pdf\">the voice of French rap</a>\u201d by SNEP. When PNL submitted their album Dans la L\u00e9gende for the Victoires in 2017, they declared the project not to be urban, but <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEbJwZOkvDM\">chanson</a></em>. While they were not selected for the ceremony, their reasoning was later given as a reason for getting rid of the rap category.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lanskywalker\">Lansky</a>, journalist for French rap website <a href=\"https://yard.media/\">Yard</a>, doesn\u2019t see these industry machinations as obstacles for French rap in the long-term: \u201cThe reality is that rap is the new pop, and many current artists labelled as pop, such as Ang\u00e8le, Louane and Kendji Girac, are looking to rap and related genres for inspiration.\u201d</p> <p>In the French charts so far in 2020, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/the-weeknd\">the Weeknd</a>\u2019s Blinding Lights provided a one-week break in nearly four otherwise continuous months of No 1 singles by black or Arab French rappers: Gradur, Gambi, Naps and Ninho. This is against the backdrop of Le Pen, whose newly named National Rally defeated Macron\u2019s La R\u00e9publique En Marche <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/eu-vote-confirms-french-far-right-marine-le-pen-national-rally-as-emmanuel-macron-main-opposition\">to win France\u2019s European </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/eu-vote-confirms-french-far-right-marine-le-pen-national-rally-as-emmanuel-macron-main-opposition\">elections in 2019</a>, preparing to challenge the incumbent president once again in 2022.</p> <p>French rap was once on the periphery of acceptable taste, loudly reporting on the cracks in France\u2019s supposed universalism. The attempts to quell it show how powerful it has now become, with its successful black and Arab rappers challenging the very idea of what it is to be French. As the anonymous A&amp;R director asserts: \u201cA genre that has been established in a country for more than 30 years cannot be qualified as a phenomenon. Today, rap is as much a part of France\u2019s culture as its cuisine, wine or bad faith.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In recent weeks, giving to the NHS has gone through the roof. A grateful nation, watching the way doctors and nurses have put their lives on the line, feels inspired to give something back.

Perhaps the most famous is the children\u2019s charity associated with Great Ormond Street hospital, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/21/nothing-would-give-me-more-pleasure-captain-moore-to-visit-mclaren-hq\">dates back to 1852</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/21/photograph-hospital-icu-covid-19-nhs-coventry\">Our hospital, our NHS: what it was like to photograph an ICU in the Covid-19 crisis | Jonny Weeks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nowadays, NHS charities provide everything from capital funding for experimental technology to counselling and respite care for the hard-pressed health workers who are currently giving so much.</p> <p>But the NHS itself is not a charity. It shouldn\u2019t have to be relying on charitable money to provide essential services to the British people.</p> <p>Unfortunately there\u2019s a bad history of exactly that happening. Too often, in recent years as governments have cut back provision, donated money has had to go on providing essential services that are the role of the state. Charities \u2013 not just in the NHS, but in education, social care and many other domains \u2013 are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/19/two-thirds-charities-subsidising-public-sector-contracts-survive\">using their resources to fill in</a> around a system that can no longer quite cope.</p> <p>A 2018 poll of charity finance teams, for example, found that it was common for government bodies to ask charities to carry out services such as care and advice on their behalf, and that more than half of all charities <a href=\"https://www.civilsociety.co.uk/news/charities-paying-more-to-subsidise-public-service-contracts.html\">subsidised those public services</a> with donated money. </p> <p>This isn\u2019t right. There needs to be a clear division between what charities are for, and what the state is for.</p> <p>Charities are a vital force in the UK. In 2016-17 they spent <a href=\"https://data.ncvo.org.uk/sector-finances/spending/\">more than \u00a3</a><a href=\"https://data.ncvo.org.uk/sector-finances/spending/\">48bn</a> to help bring communities together, provide vital emergency aid, and lobby and campaign for a better world. They\u2019ve helped those who are struggling in ways that the monolithic institutions of the state are often simply not able to do.</p> <p>But charities are not there to replace universal state intervention. They are there to do what the state cannot. </p> <p>The argument over charitable funds is laid clear when it comes to personal protective equipment (PPE), which the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/delayed-plane-carrying-ppe-from-turkey-lands-in-uk-coronavirus\">NHS </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/delayed-plane-carrying-ppe-from-turkey-lands-in-uk-coronavirus\">has been desperately short of</a> during this pandemic.

It shouldn\u2019t be funded out of the chance generosity of ordinary people clubbing together. It should come out of a properly planned, properly resourced core budget.

The centrifugal force caused him to black out at regular intervals, which at least momentarily stopped the screaming. An unfortunate business, all told, especially as The Fiver now faces a workplace tribunal and possible police charges, but at least it got us two-thirds of the way through the top story on yet another quiet news day, so every cloud and all that.</p> <p>It does however mean that it\u2019s left to The Fiver to explain the latest development in this big Toon deal. And it\u2019s this: Qatar-based broadcaster and Richard Keys enablers beIN Sport have written to all the Premier League clubs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/22/bein-sports-asks-premier-league-to-block-saudi-newcastle-deal-over-piracy\">urging them to nix it</a>. That\u2019s because they hold the TV rights for the Middle East, and angrily claim that Saudi Arabia is allowing a pirate firm, the provocatively titled beoutQ, to illegally broadcast matches in the country. In other words, don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds. The Saudis vigorously deny the charge, leaving the Premier League to make an unenviable choice: annoy the people who put hundreds of millions into the game \u2026 or the people who are promising to put hundreds of millions into the game. Po\u2019 Premier League! It\u2019s tough when the buck stops with you, as The Fiver fears it will soon find out.

Back in the mid-90s, a few friends and I made the trip to see Wimbledon v Southampton at Selhurst Park. That evening, extremely refreshed from the day\u2019s pre- and post-match activities, we were stumbling home past an old, derelict house, which we immediately decided must be haunted and warranted further investigation. Walking through an unlocked door into a pitch-black room, myself and one other chap dropped suddenly into a gaping hole in the floor. My mate landed badly, catching his arm across a beam of wood, which required immediate medical attention (the arm, not the wood) and subsequent operation to fix a shattered elbow \u2013 pins, screws, the whole shooting match. To this day he cannot straighten that arm. Days after the event I noticed that a button on the shirt I had been wearing had broken in half and was barely attached to the garment. I was otherwise entirely unscathed. He remains understandably unhappy that he required emergency corrective surgery and subsequent physiotherapy as a result of that ill-advised excursion, while I required a trip to the haberdashery. I struggle with my own form of survivor\u2019s guilt, but I get by\u201d \u2013 Robert Young.</p> <p>\u201cRe: football songs in the 70s and 80s (Fiver letters passim).

  "<p>Children in Spain are to be allowed to take walks outside for the first time in nearly six weeks from Sunday after the government bowed to pressure to go further in its plans to ease lockdown measures.</p> \n<p>As EU leaders prepared for a summit to assess the damage Covid-19 has done to economies and agree a plan to revive them, the Spanish prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, told MPs on Wednesday that any relaxation of the rules would be \u201cslow and gradual\u201d.</p> \n<p>But the government performed a U-turn late on Tuesday night on allowing children on to the streets, after it was criticised for saying they could go out only to accompany a parent going to buy food or medicine or visit a bank.</p> \n<p>Following the backlash \u2013 including pot-banging protests on balconies \u2013 the government said children under 14 would be allowed out for walks from Sunday if accompanied by a parent. Older teenagers will be allowed out alone to buy food or medicine.</p> \n<p>Spain has recorded 21,717 deaths in the pandemic, the third highest number in the world after the US and Italy, and has already twice extended its state of emergency, originally declared on 14 March.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re living through a time of extraordinary sacrifices,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said as he asked MPs for a new extension until 9 May. \u201cWe can\u2019t let our guard down. We can start to think about a de-escalation scenario. But we must be prudent.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a further sign that the country is turning a corner, an emergency morgue set up at an ice rink in Madrid to help the city store its dead closed its doors on Wednesday. Over the course of almost a month it took in 1,146 bodies.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The UN\u2019s special rapporteur on human rights, Philip Alston, has said government responses to the pandemic are failing people in poverty.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe policies of many states reflect a social Darwinism philosophy that prioritises the economic interests of the wealthiest while doing little for those who are hard at work providing essential services or unable to support themselves,\u201d Alston said. \u201cThis is a crisis that disproportionately affects poor people.\u201d</p> \n<p>As some Europeans \u2013 from Danes to Austrians and German to Norwegians \u2013 took their first tentative steps out of confinement, EU leaders were expected to endorse urgent spending measures and debate a massive recovery plan at a virtual summit on Thursday.</p> \n<p>According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, about one million people in the EU have tested positive for coronavirus and more than 110,000 of them have died \u2013 more than half of the global death toll.</p> \n<p>The pandemic has put new strains on the unity of the 27-member bloc, exposing splits between the richer north and the poorer south. But S\u00e1nchez said he expected consensus at the summit \u201cbecause it is indispensable\u201d.</p> \n<p>Spain has proposed creating a fund of up to \u20ac1.5tn (\u00a31.3tn) financed by perpetual debt, but the EU\u2019s fiscally conservative northern nations, led by the Netherlands, Germany and Austria, remain keen to keep a tight rein on spending and have rejected calls from the south for joint debt \u2013 nicknamed coronabonds \u2013 to fund recovery.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis pandemic touches all of us in every member state and in every household,\u201d the president of the European council, Charles Michel, said in his invitation to the summit. \u201cIt knows no boundaries and calls for even more coordination and unity.

  "<p>Delhi police have been accused of slapping two Muslim student activists with \u201cbogus\u201d charges of conspiring to incite the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/india-delhi-after-hindu-mob-riot-religious-hatred-nationalists\">riots</a>, the worst religious violence in India\u2019s capital for decades, and in which the police were accused of being complicit.</p> <p>Meeran Haider and Safoora Zargar, students at Delhi\u2019s Muslim-majority Jamia Millia Islamia University, were charged under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, which is usually reserved for terrorist activity and means they can be held for six months.</p> <p>The charges related to an alleged \u201cpremeditated conspiracy\u201d to stir up communal hatred through a series of speeches, which police say led to the deadly religious riots in Delhi. The students, who were taken into custody on 1 April, have also been charged with sedition, murder, possession of arms, incitement of violence, attempt to murder, and promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion and rioting.</p> <p>Six others were arrested connected to the same charges in early April but were released on bail.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/india-delhi-after-hindu-mob-riot-religious-hatred-nationalists\">Inside Delhi: beaten, lynched and burnt alive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to the police report, officers collected firearms, petrol bombs, acid bottles and stones from the students\u2019 homes. Lawyers representing the men say they have seen no evidence or documentation.</p> <p>The riots, which raged through the streets of north-east Delhi in late February, resulted in homes burned and destroyed, thousands of people injured, and at least 52 deaths. Hindu and Muslim groups clashed in the capital but, primarily, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/how-can-i-go-back-delhi-fearful-muslims-mourn-riot-dead\">Muslims were </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/how-can-i-go-back-delhi-fearful-muslims-mourn-riot-dead\">the victims</a> of violent Hindu mobs. Thousands of Muslim families were left homeless and destitute and three-quarters of those killed were Muslim.</p> <p>The riots are widely acknowledged to have been sparked by incendiary comments made by Kapil Mishra, a leader from the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), about Muslims peacefully protesting against a controversial new citizenship law. Video evidence and witness accounts pointed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/delhis-muslims-despair-justice-police-implicated-hindu-riots\">police</a> allowing Hindu mobs to roam the streets freely to target the Muslim community.</p> <p>The police investigation into the causes of the violence has, however, focused on the Muslim and student activist community, particularly those who had been previously known to the police for involvement in mass student protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in December. Police entered the Jamia Millia University campus in December, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/16/india-protests-six-dead-as-demonstrators-vow-to-continue-to-fight-citizenship-changes\">beating activists and detaining students</a>.</p> <p>Akram Khan, the lawyer representing Haider, a PhD student at Jamia Millia University, said: \u201cThere is no evidence to substantiate these allegations or even to connect my client to these riots at all. He was not even present. He was participating in the peaceful protests against CAA at Jamia Milia University so he was known to the police, but that\u2019s all. But we still have not even been given the full charge sheet and I have seen no evidence.\u201d</p> <p>Umar Khalid, a former Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student leader, who was among those leading the anti-CAA protests in December, has also been named on the police report on the alleged conspiracy to cause riots, but has not been arrested.</p> <p>Shehla Rasheed, a former JNU student union leader, tweeted: \u201cYet another bogus case! It\u2019s shameful how the government of India is exploiting the lockdown (no protest) to target progressive activists, intellectuals, journalists. Stay strong.\u201d</p> <p>The Jamia Coordination Committee, a student and alumni group, also condemned the arrests. \u201cThe country is facing a massive health crisis. However, the state machinery is busy harassing and framing student activists in false cases to suppress voices of dissent,\u201d it said.</p> <p>The total number of arrests made in connection with the Delhi riots remains unclear, with official figures ranging wildly from around 50 to over 3,000.</p> <p>Delhi police said in a statement: \u201cAll the arrests made have been based on analysis of scientific and forensic evidence, including video footage, technical and other footprints.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Fortnite for Android is available through the Google Play store for the first time, almost 18 months after owners Epic Games tried to use the game\u2019s popularity to break the app store duopoly.</p> <p>The release is an embarrassing climbdown for Epic, which has sunk significant resources into building its own independent games service, and is sure to reignite accusations of anti-competitive behaviour on the parts of both Apple and Google.</p> <p>\u201cAfter 18 months of operating Fortnite on Android outside of the Google Play store, we\u2019ve come to a basic realisation,\u201d Epic said in a statement on Tuesday evening.</p> <p>\u201cGoogle puts software downloadable outside of Google Play at a disadvantage, through technical and business measures such as scary, repetitive security pop-ups for downloaded and updated software, restrictive manufacturer and carrier agreements and dealings, Google public relations characterising third-party software sources as malware, and new efforts such as Google Play Protect to outright block software obtained outside the Google Play store.\u201d</p> <p>Epic had taken advantage of a feature in Google\u2019s Android operating system which allows users to install apps from sources other than the official app store, to build its own mobile software marketplace. The hope was that it could use that independence firstly to bypass requirements to pay Google a 30% cut of its earnings, and secondly to expand further, offering independent games for sale to users who had already installed Fortnite.</p> <p>But, the company learned, the technical ability to install software from unauthorised sources is not the same as the ability to attain an easy or pleasant user experience, and, while Fortnite remains one of the most popular mobile games, the constraints imposed by Google have limited take-up of the Android version.</p> <p>\u201cWe hope that Google will revise its policies and business dealings in the near future, so that all developers are free to reach and engage in commerce with customers on Android and in the Play Store through open services, including payment services, that can compete on a level playing field,\u201d Epic\u2019s statement continued.</p> <p>Fortnite has been distributed through the iOS App Store since its launch on that platform, in part due to the significantly greater practical difficulty of running apps any other way on it, and partly, Epic argues, due to the smaller market share of iOS devices.</p> <p>On Android, Epic even tried to force through an exception to the 30% cut it would otherwise have to pay Google, arguing that the significant market share of Android meant that the requirement to use Google\u2019s payment tools was an illegal abuse of monopoly.</p> <p>\u201cWe have asked that Google not enforce its publicly stated expectation that products distributed through Google Play use Google\u2019s payment service for in-app purchase. We believe this form of tying of a mandatory payment service with a 30% fee is illegal in the case of a distribution platform with over 50% market share,\u201d Epic said in December. Google denied the request.</p> <p>Epic has increased its mobile success in other ways. In June 2019, the company bought video chat app Houseparty, at the time a popular service among college students in America. In the past few weeks, the app has become a global phenomenon, rivalling Zoom for the most popular app of lockdown, and shooting to the top of download charts worldwide.</p> <p>Without the pressure from Epic, the question of whether app store monopolies are legal looks likely to be settled only if and when regulators turn their attention to it. In 2018, the EU fined Google \u20ac4.3bn for requiring manufacturers to include Chrome on their phones if they wanted to feature the app store.</p>",
  "<p> The sister of a man with mental health issues who died after being Tasered three times by police has warned that more vulnerable people could die unless training for officers is overhauled after a coroner\u2019s report called for repeated Tasering to be reviewed.</p> <p>Marc Cole, 30, died after a police officer Tasered him for more than 40 seconds on a street in Falmouth, Cornwall, in 2017 after excessive cocaine use led him to behave in a paranoid and erratic manner. He was holding a knife and was said to have accidentally caused a minor superficial injury to a neighbour, and had self-harmed.</p> <p>In a preventing future deaths report <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Marc-Cole-2020-0087-Redacted.pdf\">published on Tuesday</a>, the assistant coroner for Cornwall, Geraint Williams, called on the Home Office and the College of Policing to institute \u201ca wholesale review of the effects of multiple Taser activations\u201d.</p> <p>He said this would allow for more comprehensive advice, guidance and training to be given to officers who carry Tasers.</p> <p>However, the crime and policing minister, Kit Malthouse, said <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-0087-Response-from-the-Home-Office.pdf\">he was satisfied</a> that current safeguards and training were adequate, while the College of Policing said medical evidence about the use of Tasers <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-0087-Response-from-the-College-of-Policing-Redacted.pdf\">was overlooked during the inquest</a>.</p> <p>Cole\u2019s sister, Lisa Cole, who has been campaigning for reform of the laws governing the use of Taser, said she feared inaction could lead to other people suffering mental health crises being Tasered to death by police.</p> <p>\u201cIt is our very real concern that more vulnerable people will die unless the training is overhauled and officers have new research-based guidelines around safe durations for Taser activations against those with mental ill-health,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cMarc died a completely unnecessary and preventable death because rank-and-file officers did not have adequate training around the effects of Taser electrocution on vulnerable people.</p> <p> \u201cI hoped they would listen but it seems our concerns are falling on deaf ears and not being taken seriously.\u201d</p> <p>An inquest jury earlier this year concluded the use of the Taser stun gun by police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/28/police-tasering-of-man-with-mental-health-issues-contributed-to-his-death\">played a part in the father-of-two\u2019s death</a> after cardiac arrest.

As business is screeching to a halt, garment workers where I\u2019m based in Los Angeles are facing unique circumstances. \u2063\u2063Many earn an average of $6 an hour and face food insecurity, as well as inability to pay their rent, utilities and other bills due to loss of income.\u2063\u2063 Yet the continued demand for PPE orders means that many factories remain open.</p> <p>Many workers are navigating the sweatshop conditions they would face on any other day \u2013 except now, the risks of poor ventilation, dirty conditions and no social-distancing practices are exacerbating the risk of disease.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the world, we are seeing major brands pull out of orders using the contractual terms of force majeure. But if you look at who some of these brands are \u2013 H&amp;M, Target, Zara, C&amp;A \u2013 they have huge bottom lines.</p> <p>My hope for a post-coronavirus future is one that values those in the supply chain. Garment workers are the heart of the fashion industry but are treated the worst and often come from the most marginalised communities.</p> <p>Am I hopeful? On the one hand, many of us have been saying the same thing for years. But there is a shifting tide. It is a unique moment because consumers are paying attention and reorienting our relationship with consumption. Governments and corporations are being called out and garment workers are continuing to resist, as they always have.</p> <p>Now is the time to reimagine new systems. I am challenging myself and others \u2013 beyond these systems that we are critiquing, let\u2019s propose alternatives.

Many brands have long put forth that the reason they contract to factories in places such as Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia is to lift workers out of poverty and bring jobs to those regions. Yet the majority of these brands have cancelled their orders and threatened to withhold payments even for finished clothing, even though they have the money. They are thus throwing these countries into economic meltdown.</p> <p>With the factory closed and workers furloughed, now is the time to be replacing old machines with new, state-of-the-art, cleaner and safer systems. I hope brands will streamline and I hope there will be some near-shoring and re-shoring and right-shoring, because we are going to keep having crises like this and supply chains are such delicately balanced systems; like dominoes, if one goes down, it all goes down.</p> <p>Brands need to not be so vulnerable by becoming more independent and, in a sense, more truly global. You have one third of your manufacturing in one part of the world, one third in another, another third in another; some of it\u2019s far, some of it\u2019s close. Bring some manufacturing home instead \u2013 there is such great advantage to localising. But more than that, companies should take on the responsibility of looking after workers and making sure everything is sourced cleanly and leftovers are disposed of correctly.</p> <h2>Rahemur Rahman, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rahemurrahman/?hl=en\">sustainable menswear designer</a>: \u2018Two collections a year is enough\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ebc290a2efaab9f1adb60b0259e60dbdb4543cf6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebc290a2efaab9f1adb60b0259e60dbdb4543cf6/2_0_635_794/400.jpg\" alt=\"Rahemur Rahman\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rahemur Rahman: \u2018I hope young and emerging designers might have more of a voice.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lily Vetch</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before coronavirus we were already discussing the need to stop and reevaluate. But nobody was voluntarily going to stop, because it\u2019s business. This has forced us to stop and even big conglomerates like LVMH are thinking: \u201cWhat does fashion actually mean now?\u201d This is going to make designers look introspectively and think: \u201cHow much am I going to make?\u201d</p> <p>I am hopeful that it is going to allow us to redefine the fashion schedule. I was talking to Patrick McDowell, Bethany Williams and other young designers in London about getting tired of all the stuff we had to produce. Two collections a year is enough, without all the pre-collections. The BFC could put out a statement, setting out all the reasons why it makes sense \u2013 but it would need to be an international effort.</p> <p>I hope that because of this young and emerging designers might have more of a voice in the room when big decisions are being made about the industry. Coronavirus is pushing everything online and online platforms are giving people who potentially wouldn\u2019t have had much of a say before, a massive say.

It feels like everything is opening up so it can be scrutinised and redesigned. We need to put the health of our ecosystems at the heart of our business systems. That means designing systems from a human, community-centred perspective rather than one that is profit-centred, like we have now with capitalism.</p> <p>Everyone can learn a lot from adopting a more resilient business model; for example, businesses already built around a slow fashion mentality and sustainable growth, such as Eileen Fisher, are not being affected tremendously by this storm. The systems that are thriving are those that were built around community, planet, kindness, and ecosystems.</p> <p>We need to design a production model that doesn\u2019t overproduce and over-manufacture because a system that yields over-consumption cannot last. I don\u2019t think the public or the employees will allow a return to business as usual. There are a lot of unions being formed, such as at Everlane, and there is growing solidarity among employees across companies. Right now we are seeing that collective action is not actually that difficult.

But I also hope that we pause and realise we don\u2019t necessarily need 12 pairs of jeans and God knows how many sweatpants.</p> <p>I hope it makes us value the concept of buying less, buying better and perhaps buying a little bit less cheap; finding ways to be able to afford things that are locally made and from brands that are so small as to have innovation and sustainability embedded from the start. It\u2019s a good opportunity to break the hegemony of the big guys, so that we won\u2019t need to double check that Zara and H&amp;M really are doing what they say they are doing. Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if the high street didn\u2019t return to the same-old same-old, but instead had mending services, smaller designers, tailors, rental places and swapping places.</p> <p>When we come out of this, it will be about capturing that joy of nothingness \u2013 the joy of having had less, of having been limited.

  "<p>America\u2019s addiction to mass incarceration could almost double its number of deaths from coronavirus, with jails acting as incubators of the disease and spreading a further 100,000 fatalities across the US.</p> <p>The startling warning comes from groundbreaking modeling by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and academic researchers, released on Wednesday.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/covidinjails\">The analysis</a> found that unless instant action is taken to reduce jail populations, a terrible price will be paid. Jails, which house men and women not yet convicted, will act as mass vectors of the contagion.</p> <p>As many as 99,000 more people could die in the US as a result of the virus being contracted behind jail walls, the study predicts. Of those, 23,000 are projected to succumb behind bars and 76,000 in surrounding communities as a result of inmates spreading the virus upon release.</p> <p>The projection would almost double last month\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefing-painful-us-deaths\">White House</a> modeling of Covid-19\u2019s grim legacy in terms of lives lost.</p> <p>\u201cWhen it comes to Covid-19 deaths, mass incarceration is our achilles heel,\u201d said Udi Ofer, director of the ACLU\u2019s justice division.</p> <p>The US is truly exceptional among countries grappling with the coronavirus in that no other nation incarcerates people on such a scale, which in turn has critical implications for the threat posed by such an outbreak. The US accounts for 4% of the world\u2019s population, but 21% of its incarcerated population.</p> <p>The ACLU modeling, developed with epidemiologists from Washington state and the Universities of Tennessee and Pennsylvania, focuses on the 740,000 people held in US jails. Conditions inside such institutions are often even worse than in the notorious prison system and amount to a Covid-19 perfect storm.</p> <p>Jails are so overcrowded there is virtually no possibility to place inmates 6ft apart, and sanitation is often rudimentary.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/covid-19-prison-new-york-rikers-island\">I'm in prison in New York.

On average inmates spend 25 days inside and many just a day or two, creating a revolving door between institutions and surrounding communities which the virus can exploit.</p> <p>Add to that churn the bald fact that there are almost 11m admissions into US jails each year \u2013 one every three seconds \u2013 and the potential for jails to act as vectors of disease is evident.</p> <p>Inmates, who come burdened with a relatively high incidence of underlying health conditions such as diabetes and asthma, are vulnerable to contracting the virus while incarcerated and can quickly carry it back to their communities.</p> <p>The ACLU study is understood to be the first to attempt to measure the potential harm inflicted by mass incarceration in terms of Covid-19. Its calculations are based on a detailed study of one typical jail, in Allegheny county, Pennsylvania, which was used to conduct tailored modeling of individual jurisdictions across 1,242 counties that account for about 90% of the US population.</p> <p>The projection that mass incarceration could cause an extra 99,000 deaths is almost certainly an undercount, as the researchers did not take into account either prisons or immigration detention centers. Those institutions have a more sedentary population but are still highly vulnerable to contagion.</p> <p>Just how easily coronavirus can spread behind bars is illustrated in Ohio, where more than <a href=\"https://www.dispatch.com/news/20200419/coronavirus-in-ohio-more-than-1800-inmates-at-marion-correctional-test-positive\">1,800 prisoners</a> at the Marion correctional institution have tested positive \u2013 73% of the total prison number. Across the state as a whole, one in five confirmed Covid-19 cases are among incarcerated inmates.</p> <p>In Cook county jail in Chicago, almost 400 inmates have tested positive and six have died. About 225 staff have also tested positive and <a href=\"https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/cook-county-jail-guard-dies-of-coronavirus/2259091/\">one correctional officer</a> has died.</p> <p>The ACLU argues that the lesson of its research is that mass incarceration has become a major health threat to all Americans, not just those locked up. The solution, the advocacy group contends, is to reduce the jail population as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Only 5% of more than 10m arrests in the US each year are for violent offences.

They should be doing that, and the work internally, because of the merits of what they are capable of.\u201d</p> <p>Nokes responded: \u201cSo they shouldn\u2019t be there just because they are a women, but you have a remit for elderly people, for the disabled, for those from a BAME background, for the LGBTQ community \u2013 a massive group of people who will be impacted by Covid-19 \u2013 and you think it would be tokenism to appear at one of those press conferences.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that at all,\u201d said Truss. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is the excessive focus on what gender somebody is rather than what they do does a disservice to women \u2026 I believe that women are equally as capable as men, that we need more women in politics \u2026 but I think we should be focusing on the right people to present at the press conference.</p> <p>\u201cThe major issue at the moment is health so I think it\u2019s right that the health secretary is doing a lot of the press conferences. I think excessive focus on who is appearing at a press conference is the wrong focus.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about the evidence that more men were dying from coronavirus than women, and that BAME people were also disproportionately affected, Truss said: \u201cAcross the board we are trying to find out more about Covid-19, but it\u2019s a relatively new disease and a lot more needs to be done \u2026 We\u2019re looking at getting data in a useable format at the moment.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>More than 100 nightclubs, pubs and bars are planning coordinated legal action against the insurer Hiscox over its non-payment of business interruption insurance claims.</p> \n<p>Hiscox sold policies before coronavirus hit the headlines, stating it would pay out when a business was forced to shut owing to a notifiable disease.</p> \n<p>Business owners have filed claims to Hiscox and other commercial insurers only to be told their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-exposed-britain-insurance-industry-businesses-cover\">business interruption </a>policies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/12/uk-insurers-face-legal-action-from-small-firms-over-covid-19-claims\">do</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/12/uk-insurers-face-legal-action-from-small-firms-over-covid-19-claims\"> not cover the pandemic</a>.</p> \n<p>Michael Kill, the chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), which is coordinating the action, said: \u201cBusinesses are being denied legitimate insurance claims, many claims are being disputed by insurers based on contrived arguments to avoid sharing the financial burden during the Covid-19 crisis.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/15/most-uk-firms-do-not-have-coronavirus-coverage-insurance-industry-told\">Most UK firms do not have coronavirus coverage, insurance industry told</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Paul Daly, the owner of Roadtrip &amp; The Workshop bars, housed in one building in Shoreditch, in London, and a member of the NTIA group, said he paid \u00a318,000 a year for his business interruption insurance policy with Hiscox, which he believed included cover for government-imposed shutdowns during a pandemic.</p> \n<p>Daly\u2019s takings plunged to zero when his venue closed on 17 March but his claim with Hiscox has been turned down. \u201cPeople\u2019s livelihoods are at stake here. I\u2019m worried. It shouldn\u2019t have to be into this when I\u2019ve spent tens of thousands of pounds on insurance. It\u2019s like someone came into my bar and bought a drink and then I don\u2019t give it to them.\u201d</p> \n<p>The group, which is being advised by the licensing industry barrister Philip Kolvin QC, is calling on more businesses to join its move against the insurer.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, Hiscox said it had about 10,000 companies which had purchased cover for business interruption and had been directly impacted by the government-imposed closures.</p> \n<p>It said its core small commercial package policies did not provide cover for business interruption as a result of the \u201cgeneral measures\u201d taken by the government in response to the pandemic.</p> \n<p>It said in a statement: \u201cA number of UK policyholders have disputed the application of their policy in relation to business interruption. Hiscox recognises these are extremely difficult times for businesses and is determined to help provide greater certainty for customers. As a priority it will therefore work with the UK insurance industry, its regulators and its customers to seek means of expediting resolution through the range of independent mechanisms available.\u201d</p> \n<p>The NTIA action comes as two separate Hiscox action groups, together involving about 200 more claimants, also consider legal action. The chef Raymond Blanc has also reportedly signed up lawyers after being denied a payout by Hiscox.</p> \n<p>One action group backed by the insurance brokers advisory firm CEC, representing more than 30 businesses including gyms, restaurants and golf professionals, said at least some of Hiscox\u2019s policies clearly state it would pay up where the interruption to the business was \u201cdue to restrictions imposed by a public authority during the period of insurance following an occurrence of a notifiable human disease\u201d.</p> \n<p>Roger Topping, of the action group, said some of the policies stated payouts would reflect how the business would have traded if the restrictions had not been imposed.</p> \n<p>Business interruption policies typically pay up to \u00a3100,000 to cover the cost of keeping a company going if it is forced to close for reasons beyond its control. These include flood, fire, or even when a murder prevents the site from opening.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9980d40c-07e2-4e5a-8ae3-5056907866ee\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Income subsidies</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Direct cash grants for self-employed people, worth 80% of average profits, up to \u00a32,500 a month.

  "<p>Survivors of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/manchester-arena-explosion\">Manchester Arena bombing</a> have been denied legal representation at the hearings after it was ruled they are not considered core participants.</p> <p>A group of 56 survivors had wanted to play a central part at the inquiry, which is due to examine the intelligence background and emergency response on the day.</p> <p>They include a father who was left in a wheelchair and another who was blinded in one eye.</p> <p>The inquiry was due to begin on 15 June but has been delayed until September because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Brenda Campbell QC told a video-link hearing this month that holding an inquiry without their participation would be an \u201caffront to the confidence of the public\u201d.</p> <p>She argued that those injured in the attack should be granted core participant status and be legally represented, including doctors, retired police officers and members of the public who \u201cplugged a gap\u201d in the emergency response as they waited hours for help to arrive.</p> <p>In total, 93 people were either seriously or very seriously injured in the suicide bombing in May 2017, along with the 22 fatalities.</p> <p>Some remained in hospital for months, many were discharged to round-the-clock care and others were \u201clearning to cope in a world they never previously conceived of\u201d, said Campbell.</p> <p>However, Sir John Saunders, the chairman of the public inquiry, has ruled they can participate as witnesses but cannot have legal representation.</p> <p>In making his ruling, he issued a separate statement justifying his decision.</p> <p>He accepted the attack had had a \u201cterrible and lasting impact\u201d on the survivors and added: \u201cThe injuries, trauma and personal tragedy that the survivors have suffered cannot be overstated.\u201d</p> <p>He said: \u201cI fully appreciate that this application is born of the desire of the survivors to ensure that the reasons for the attack are fully understood, the adequacy of the emergency response is examined, and that lessons are learned.\u201d</p> <p>But he went on to say: \u201cAfter a great deal of anxious thought, I have decided to refuse this application.\u201d</p> <p>The former high court judge said the survivors would still have a \u201cvoice in this inquiry\u201d, adding: \u201cI have concluded that they will be able to contribute to the inquiry without core participant status and I strongly encourage them to do so.\u201d</p> <p>He promised the survivors would be able to raise any concerns with the legal team running the inquiry and help \u201cidentify lines of inquiry that they would wish to have pursued\u201d.</p> <p>Some bereaved families agreed with Saunders\u2019 decision, saying he was correct to exclude survivors from core participation because they might \u201cdilute the focus\u201d.</p> <p>Following the ruling, Saoirse de Bont, a solicitor at Irwin Mitchell representing the survivors, said some of her clients had been \u201cclose to death\u201d and they believed the inquiry would now be \u201climited\u201d as a result of the ruling.</p> <p>She added: \u201cThe survivor victim families we represent are very disappointed with today\u2019s decision. They will not have the same rights and access to the inquiry as other core participants such as the police and government.</p> <p>\u201cThey will not be able to play a core participant role in the inquiry and they believe that the investigation to learn lessons will be limited as a result.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s botched handling of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19</a> crisis has left the US looking like a \u201cthird world\u201d country and on course for a second Great Depression, one of the world\u2019s leading economists has warned.</p> <p>In a withering attack on the president, Joseph Stiglitz said millions of people were turning to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/17/us-food-banks-over-budget-demand-coronavirus\">food banks</a>, turning up for work due to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/lack-paid-sick-leave-will-leave-millions-us-workers-vulnerable-coronavirus\">lack of sick pay</a> and dying because of health inequalities.</p> <p>The Nobel prize-winning economist said: \u201cThe numbers turning to food banks are just enormous and beyond the capacity of them to supply. It is like a third world country. The public social safety net is not working.\u201d</p> <p>Stiglitz, a long-term critic of Trump, said 14% of the population was dependent on food stamps and predicted the social infrastructure could not cope with an unemployment rate that could hit 30% in the coming months.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a safety net that is inadequate. The inequality in the US is so large. This disease has targeted those with the poorest health. In the advanced world, the US is one of the countries with the poorest health overall and the greatest health inequality.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/20/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">Coronavirus map of the US: latest cases state by state</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stiglitz said Republicans had opposed proposals to give those affected by coronavirus 10 days\u2019 sick leave, meaning many employees were going to work even while infected. \u201cThe Republicans said no because they said it would set a bad precedent. It is literally unbelievable.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe safety net is not adequate and is propagating the disease. There is very weak unemployment insurance and people don\u2019t think they can rely on it.\u201d</p> <p>During an interview with the Guardian to mark the paperback publication of his book People, Power, and Profits, Stiglitz was asked whether the US might be heading for a second <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/21/100-years-on-another-great-depression-coronavirus-fiscal-response\">Great Depression.</a></p> <p>\u201cYes is the answer in short,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you leave it to Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell [the Republican Senate majority leader] we will have a Great Depression. If we had the right policy structure in place we could avoid it easily.\u201d</p> <p>Stiglitz said that as a result of Trump\u2019s mismanagement, the White House office responsible for pandemics had been closed, funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had been cut, and the US had gone into the crisis without enough testing kits, masks and protective gear. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/17/trump-liberate-tweets-coronavirus-stay-at-home-orders\">Encouraged by Trump</a>, some parts of the US were determined to reopen in a way that would facilitate the transmission of the disease and lead to a fresh outbreak, he added.</p> <p>\u201cIn those circumstances it won\u2019t be the government enforcing the lockdown, it will be fear. The concern is that people are not going to be spending on anything other than food and that\u2019s the definition of a Great Depression.</p> <p>\u201cWe were unprepared but, even given the degree of unpreparedness, Trump\u2019s decision to make this about politics rather than about science has meant we have responded far more poorly.\u201d</p> <p>Stiglitz said that if Trump were defeated in the presidential contest in November and the Democrats took control of both houses of Congress there was a chance of the US moving in a more progressive direction, but he warned Republicans would fight dirty in order to cling on to power.</p> <p>\u201cThere is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/21/trump-adviser-republicans-voter-suppression\">voter suppression</a> and gerrymandering. The Republican party knows it\u2019s a minority party and there is a no-holds-barred struggle going on to make sure a minority party rules America.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stiglitz said the current crisis would force countries to make themselves less vulnerable, and this would lead to shorter supply chains and a greater emphasis on self-sufficiency in food and energy.</p> <p>He added that the complexity of modern production methods meant autarky was not feasible but added: \u201cFighting global pandemics and climate change require global cooperation. It\u2019s just that the president of the United States doesn\u2019t understand that.</p> <p>\u201cI hope we emerge from this with the perspective that multilateralism is even more important than we thought.

The league says teams will start training from 4 May. But there are lots of unanswered questions over the announcement.</p> \n  <p>In a press conference, <strong>Wayne Pearce</strong>, the Balmain legend tasked with heading up the league\u2019s grandly titled \u201cProject Apollo\u201d to get the season running again, said the NRL had achieved \u201ca lot more clarity around the medical process and what those protocols are\u201d and that \u201cgovernment authorities\u201d were \u201cvery supportive\u201d of their plans.</p> \n  <p>What he didn\u2019t say was what those protocols were, and which government authorities the league has been talking to. Basically, who in the government has given the league sign-off to begin playing again?</p> \n  <p>I\u2019ve been trying to find out this afternoon, with little joy.</p> \n  <p>We know that the NSW police commissioner, <strong>Mick Fuller</strong>, who is in charge of the state\u2019s response to Covid-19, previously wrote to the NRL chairman Peter V\u2019landys saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/17/nrl-forge-ahead-with-resumption-plan-despite-no-approval-from-nsw-government\">there was no legal obstacle for the NRL\u2019s plans to resume playing despite strict public health orders</a>. </p> \n  <p>That\u2019s because the league was given an exemption under the original PHOs issued last month, and stopped playing matches voluntarily. </p> \n  <p>However in the letter Fuller also said the league would have to develop protocols to demonstrate it could resume safely. The premier, <strong>Gladys Berejiklian</strong>, said something similar when she was asked about it last week. </p> \n  <p>So who has signed off on the protocols? NSW Health still hasn\u2019t responded to my queries, and the NSW police seems to think there\u2019s nothing to be signed off on. </p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s what a spokeswoman told me:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As far as we are aware, there is nothing to be \u2018signed-off\u2019. The commissioner has stated previously that the letter was advice in response to their inquiry. I don\u2019t have anything further to provide you.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Perhaps we\u2019ll hear more from the NSW government later tonight or tomorrow, but it seems odd that neither the NRL nor the state government has explained who is in charge of making this decision.</p> \n  <p>The NRL is also still awaiting clearance from the federal and New Zealand governments for the New Zealand Warriors to arrive in Australia on May 3, a day before the rest of the competition resumes training. </p> \n  <p>The Queensland premier, <strong>Annastacia Palaszczuk</strong>, has also previously said she would not look kindly on the three teams from her state travelling back and forth to NSW for matches.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T09:25:50.482Z\">at 10.25am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea005078f085a072d3bced8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T09:06:05.348Z\">10.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Need a distraction from Covid-19?

That includes private hospitals, but the state government paid private hospitals to provide capacity to the public system in the event it is needed as a result of coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>In any case, it sounds now like people on the public wait list for elective surgeries could get preferential treatment over people waiting for surgery in the private hospital system because the state government bought capacity in the private system.</p> \n  <p>It will depend on the surgery, however.

It\u2019s business investment that drives productivity which drives higher wages. So that\u2019s the problem, let\u2019s frame that up first. Look I think it is important for us to put it back on the table but along with other tax reform. It\u2019s not the only thing that needs to be done. It\u2019s important that we look at the state taxes, the productivity sapping stamp duty taxes, payroll tax. It is interesting how much payroll tax has been deferred. <br></p> \n   <p>The whole question of the right configuration of the state taxes. Whether or not we bring forward those other income tax cuts. So it\u2019s not just company taxes but it is important we have a competitive company tax rate. To the treasurer\u2019s point, we\u2019re not asking, in the Business Council, for us to have the lowest rate, we\u2019re simply asking for a competitive rate, so that we can be a magnet for investment in this country. <br></p> \n   <p>Because we already have so many advantages, but we have one disadvantage which is a tax rate that is so much higher than everywhere else in the world. As you and I have talked about many times, at the height of this debate, 63% of Australians supported lowering the corporate tax rate.

And who knows, there could be foreign crews flying over Australian air and sky, with foreign pay and conditions. <br></p> \n   <p>So at the end of the day, this is about keeping skilled jobs, this is about making investments where perhaps the taxpayer doesn\u2019t ultimately foot the entire bill. <br></p> \n   <p>So I think there\u2019s a deal to be done in voluntary administration, but I tell you what, for the regions, for our tourism, for low fares, and for the taxpayer not having to pay the massive costs if tens of thousands of people just lose their jobs, I think a deal should be done.

So there are exceptional circumstances where further restrictions might be placed on people living in residential aged care facilities in terms of access to visitors. <br></p> \n   <p>But those additional restrictions are the exception, they are not the rule, and we think it is a good thing for people to have those visits in accordance with those screening procedures and other things that are necessary to protect elderly residents in those situations. <br></p> \n   <p>It shouldn\u2019t be done out of the convenience of isolation in terms of how these facilities are run, it should always be done always only in the interests of the care of those who are living in those facilities. <br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T23:50:18.282Z\">at 12.50am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9f799b8f08b5c61713e4ef\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T22:54:59.712Z\">11.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Queensland reports no new infections</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Queensland has recorded no new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours.</p> \n  <p>Great news.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T23:59:07.627Z\">at 12.59am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9f772f8f087a826b68ac18\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T22:47:56.213Z\">11.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Australia has undertaken the suppression method in response this pandemic.

That\u2019s an honest view. If, in the process of suppressing, we get to the point of eradication, then that would be a magnificent outcome. But we must continue to build capacity and we must continue to contain the virus, and remember that we\u2019re not immune from it.

But only on weekdays and there is to be no chilling on the sand.</p> \n  <p>Council rangers will manage \u201csurf and go\u201d and \u201cswim and go\u201d entrances, and the council has vowed to close the beaches again if the rules aren\u2019t adhered to.</p> \n  <p>Still. It is something.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, the World Health Organization has once again had to announce that it has found no evidence coronavirus came from a lab, pointing to its origins as most likely starting from animals. It hasn\u2019t worked out how it came to be transmitted to humans as yet, but is pushing back, again, against the neverending speculation it was created.</p> \n  <p>Closer to home, and <strong>Josh Frydenberg</strong> has defended <strong>Peter Dutton</strong> against the Chinese embassy\u2019s criticisms.</p> \n  <p>Dutton returned to work after a month off, after he contracted Covid-19 in the States, by calling for greater transparency from China about the coronavirus. Beijing, through its embassy, claimed Dutton was receiving instructions from Washington.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Scott Morrison</strong> has since suggested a global inquiry needs to be held into the origins of coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>Speaking to the ABC this morning, Frydenberg said Australia would defend its national interest.<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think they\u2019re unwanted and unjustified comments. And what is clear is that we maintain a good relationship at the commercial level with China. They\u2019re our largest trading partner and we want that to continue.</p> \n   <p>We obviously have some differences from time to time on the political and strategic levels. But, like with many countries, we make those points clear. But ultimately Peter Dutton\u2019s role, the prime minister\u2019s role, my role, and all our colleagues\u2019 roles, is to defend the Australian national interest, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do, and we\u2019ll speak up about it as required.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>We\u2019ll have all of that and more as the day unfolds.

  "<p>When news of the pandemic broke in California and we were ordered to shelter at home, many of us rifled through our closets for our bulk packages of protective N95 masks that we\u2019d worn in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/28/california-wildfires-explained-climate-change\">last year\u2019s fire</a>, and the fires the year before that, and the fires the year before that, and wondered if we should donate them to the hospitals or keep them for ourselves.</p> <p>This time, wearing masks was about protecting the vulnerable and at-risk from ourselves. But we will need the masks to protect ourselves from the fires that will likely come back this summer and fall. Presumably, there won\u2019t be any N95 masks left by that time, when we\u2019ll need protection from the smoke if we\u2019re ordered to evacuate, as we had to last year, for more than a week, when the Kincade fire scorched 77,758 acres of our county of Sonoma.</p> <p>In 2018, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-had-nation-s-worst-fire-season-2018-n981431\">fires burned</a> nearly 2 million acres in California. And in 2017, fire charred through a significant portion of my hometown. When the university where I teach recently closed for the semester because of <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/what-does-shelter-in-place-mean.html\">shelter-at-home orders</a>, it was the fourth closure in three years (the other three due to fires or smoke from fires). You could hear the weary tone in the administrators\u2019 emails, thanking us for being attentive, yet again, to the needs of our traumatised students.</p> <p>During the first disorienting week of shelter at home, we whispered to our climate emergency friends: \u201cPsst! Isn\u2019t this what we\u2019ve been hoping for? The sudden reduction in air travel? The shrinkage in fossil fuel emissions? Did you hear greenhouse gases <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/coronavirus-china-co2-climate-crisis-greenhouse-gas-carbon-emissions-coal-a9351436.html\">dropped 25%</a> in China during February? And people are taking online classes in carbon sequestration gardening techniques? And that <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/04/15/keystone-xl-oil-pipeline-canada-nebraska-court/5142991002/\">judge finally cancelled</a> a key permit for the Dakota Access pipeline?\u201d</p> <p>It felt, at first, like some sort of divine intervention. I couldn\u2019t get the <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/anna-akhmatova\">Anna Akhmatova</a> poem out of my head: \u201cEverything is plundered, betrayed, and spent / the wings of black death have flown by / why, then, do we feel so radiant?\u201d In any case, this stay-at-home remedy for the pandemic was a far superior experience to what we go through during fires. We could breathe fresh air! At least, those of us who didn\u2019t have the virus.</p> <p>But as the reality of the economic toll set in, as well as the realisation that Donald Trump was using this opportunity to roll back more environmental restrictions, and realised that marginalised people were the ones dying in largest numbers, it became evident that there was no real silver lining. All around were the same symptoms of a system heading in the wrong direction. One student wrote to me: \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to things getting normal again.\u201d The only problem is that things weren\u2019t normal before.</p> <p>And when the winds pick up this October, electricity and gas provider PG&amp;E will, most likely, turn off the power for one, two or maybe more weeks to try to avoid another catastrophic conflagration due to a drought-diseased tree crashing onto a live power line and burning up the region. If we are still sheltering at home, no power means no internet, no Zoom, no Netflix. More importantly, when the fires come, where and how will we evacuate while physical distancing?</p> <p>After the fires, any illusions we had held that humanity could triumph over nature came apart. When Covid-19 erupted, it felt a little like a \u201cHold my beer. We\u2019ve got this!\u201d kind of moment, not because we had any control \u2013 quite the opposite \u2013 but because we\u2019d had an apprenticeship with our own powerlessness against the forces of nature. But that powerlessness realigns us to the patterns of a more profound reality than our own.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/us-bus-drivers-lack-life-saving-basic-protections-transit-worker-deaths-coronavirus\">Revealed: nearly 100 US transit workers have died of Covid-19 amid lack of basic protections</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m deeply heartened, even astonished by the unprecedented rising global solidarity, this <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communitas\">communitas</a>,</em> in response to the pandemic, and what it promises we are capable of.

  "<p><br>There are, as always, two kinds of people in the world: those who are wondering what to do with all their free time, and those who are wondering what happened to it. The split seems to be closely correlated with the number of children who live with you.</p> <p>If you are in the former group, you, like me, may have exhausted a significant quantity of procrastination cleaning. I have vacuumed under the sofa, changed the filter on my cooker hood, and even started painting the kitchen.</p> <p>So why not introduce a digital component to the great tidy-up? Your laptop\u2019s downloads folder might not literally collect dust, but whether physical or digital, the longer you leave things to fester, the harder they become to eventually deal with.</p> <h2><strong>Turn off your notifications</strong><br></h2> <p>We all do it: it\u2019s the honeymoon period with a new app, freshly downloaded, full of possibility. It asks for notification access and you grant it. Then nine months go by, and suddenly it is flashing up a push alert for a 10% off code for an annual subscription if you refer three friends. You dismiss the notification and get on with your day, but the app keeps showing up \u2013 never enough to prompt you to action, but frustrating all the same.</p> <p>So head to your notification settings, and search for the apps you actually want to hear from. A good rule of thumb is, only give notification access to apps that will send you real messages from real people. Oh, and maybe your favourite news app.</p> <h2><strong>Clear out your photos folder</strong><br></h2> <p>It\u2019s easier than ever to take photos, and have more of them than ever are stored on our devices. So it\u2019s harder than ever to find the pictures that we want to look at.</p> <p>AI helps a bit: Apple is moderately good at letting you search for pictures by who is in them, what they are of, or where they were taken; Google does the same job better, with a privacy trade-off. But if you want a photo library that serves a purpose beyond hoarding, you will have to delete some pictures.</p> <p>Screenshots are a good target, as is clearing out all but one of every image of which you took 15 versions. And why not trim your selfie folder to just the greatest thirst traps, chucking those sunsets that don\u2019t quite match the reality of being there.

  "<p><em>Between 1816 and 1923, there were six cholera pandemics, with increased trade, migration and pilgrimage all being credited with the disease\u2019s transmission. The fourth pandemic (1863-1875) began in the Ganges Delta, travelled with Muslim pilgrims to Mecca and then to Russia, Africa, North America and Europe. In 1866, the epidemic spread with the Austro-Prussian war, while a localised outbreak in the East End of London claimed over 5,000 lives with many other cases appearing across the UK. The following year, 113,000 lives were lost to it in Italy.</em></p> <h2>Hints on the cholera</h2> <p>7 August 1866</p> <p>The study of the course of the cholera wave in its advance upon this country is by no means a thing of merely scientific or historical interest. The evidence is complete that the disease is one which reaches us by importation; and, although it gathers and is intensified in unhealthy places, it moves along the lines of human intercommunication. On this occasion the infection of Europe was accomplished in May of last year by the return of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammedan\">Mahometan</a> pilgrims to Egypt from Mecca, where the disease was epidemic; thence it was carried along each of the lines of steam communication which connect Alexandria with the ports of the Levant and the south of Europe. From these ports it spread inland in each case. What is particularly remarkable in the present epidemic is the rapidity of its progress through Europe. <br><em><a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2020/04/22/7_august_1866.jpg\">Continue reading</a>.</em></p> <h2>The cholera</h2> <p>23 July 1866</p> <p>No new cases of cholera have occurred in the Liverpool workhouse since the 18th, but patients continue to be admitted from the town. Since the 10th instant, there have been 43 cases and 23 deaths. During the past week cholera is reported to have made great advances in Winsford, more persons having died than the aggregate number of deaths during the previous three weeks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2000/aug/03/technology\">Life in time of cholera</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em>The Lancet says</em>: Cholera has broken out seriously in several parts of the kingdom. A rapid succession of cases has occurred in Liverpool, Llanelly Southampton, and the east of London; and the special powers entrusted to the Privy Council for the mitigation of epidemic maladies by the Diseases Prevention Act of 1855 have been put in operation. By this act the Privy Council is empowered to issue directions and regulations for the speedy internment of the dead, for house to house visitation, for dispensing medicines, guarding against the spread of disease, and affording to persons afflicted by or threatened with the epidemic such medical aid and accommodation as may be required.</p> <h2>Editorial: checking the evil</h2> <p>20 July 1866</p> <p>At the present season, with a temperature so productive of disease, and the cholera already with its foot upon our threshold, and threatening a fatal descent, the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5523599/pdf/transepisoclond76086-0239.pdf\">annual report</a> of <a href=\"https://www.rcseng.ac.uk/library-and-publications/library/blog/sir-john-simon/\">Mr Simon</a>, the medical officer of the Privy Council, is more than usually interesting and instructive. In one sense it may be said that it tells nothing new. Most of us were aware already that the poorer class of population in our large towns was miserably overcrowded, that sanitary science was more a matter of theory than of practice, that the local authorities were called upon to act under legislation which armed them with ambiguous and imperfect powers, and that in too many cases the authorities themselves were eager to avail themselves of any confusion in the law to shirk the responsibility devolved upon them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbc9c36d1eab63ce039e1be114a86b5dabe72c05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbc9c36d1eab63ce039e1be114a86b5dabe72c05/0_304_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gustave Dore\u2019s engraving of the slums in Dudley Street, Seven Dials, central London, 1872.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gustave Dore\u2019s engraving of the slums in Dudley Street, Seven Dials, central London, 1872.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there are things which, however well known, cannot be too often repeated. The full force of these facts in connection with the spread of disease and the means which may be taken for its prevention are still but feebly appreciated. In a country like our own, with our habits of political independence and our tendency to resent arbitrary legislation, the Government can do little to enforce precautions for the preservation of the public health, except through the agency of public opinion; and, unfortunately, this is just one of those subjects upon which public opinion is dull and sluggish. People admit the facts, which, indeed, are too flagrant and notorious to be denied, but do not or will not see their way to the obvious conclusion. There are even well-educated persons who, when you talk to them of the poisonous influences of bad air and bad water, sneer at the over-refinement of the age.</p> <blockquote> <p>Our grandfathers knew nothing of these new-fangled sanitary notions, and were not frightened out of their wits at an unpleasant smell; yet they got on very well; and so might we, if we would only not think about these things so much.</p> </blockquote> <p>But population was very far from being so dense in our grandfathers\u2019 days; and the conditions of infection vary, of course, with the close contact of population subject to the same deficiencies of fresh air and water. And, even in former days, if less was said then about the fatal consequences of neglecting sanitary laws, it was because less was known. Looking back now, with our present experience, we can readily account for a large proportion of the mortality which seemed so mysterious at the time. The truths which Mr Simon preaches, threadbare and hackneyed as they seem, cannot, therefore, be too much impressed on the public mind, in order that an active and sound opinion may be created on the subject.</p> <p>Mr Simon, in the new report, states in a very clear concise manner the principles of contagion. It is a popular error, he says, to suppose that the medical profession is divided into two camps of \u201ccontagionists\u201d and \u201canti-contagionists.\u201d It is an elementary truth in medicine, about which no difference exists, that disease is spread by infection; only there are personal as well as local differences of susceptibility to contagion. Typhus and typhoid fevers, for instance, which, amid over-crowding, and non-ventilation, and refuse odours, and foul water supply, would develop into a pestilence, carrying its ravages far and wide, will, in a clear atmosphere, with a pure water supply, be so restricted in their contagious effects that typhoid fever will scarcely be recognised as infectious, nor even typhus extend beyond limits which admit of being narrowly defined. But, further, even where a certain number of families are subject to the same external conditions, some families will suffer worse then others, and one member of a family may survive what the others succumb to. Besides, apart from such influences as the above, it seems doubtful whether all contagious diseases are equally capable of pandemic extension; and Mr Simon cites the instances of scarlatina and typhus, neither of which has shown much disposition to spread in Asia or Africa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c9f1fb2adb647d08a1c416b09f50b272071c64e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c9f1fb2adb647d08a1c416b09f50b272071c64e/0_267_5395_3238/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Disinfecting mail bags from Naples during the cholera epidemic, Cancello station, Italy, 1884.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Disinfecting mail bags from Naples during the cholera epidemic, Cancello station, Italy, 1884.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ICAS94/De Agostini via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are many puzzles, no doubt, in the philosophy of contagion. Certain diseases spring up for a while, and then subside, to re-appear again after a lapse of years. But the general principle of infection is now, Mr Simon contends, sufficiently established, and must be recognised in all measures for the protection of the public health.</p> <p>There are two modes of dealing with contagious diseases. One is to bar them out by means of a rigid quarantine; the other is to establish such a degree of cleanliness and careful observance of sanitary laws as to reduce to a <em>minimum </em>any predisposition to disease. As to the first, Mr Simon confesses a theoretical preference for it, only he does not see how it can possibly be carried out. Not only as regards cholera, but generally as regards all contagious disease, it is now certain that contagions current on the continent of Europe must be deemed virtually current in England.</p> <p>On the other hand, a system of quarantine exists in England only in name; and if one is to be called into action it has first to be created. To extemporise a <em>cordon sanitaire</em> is utterly impossible; and a quarantine which is partial and ineffective is only a vexatious and irrational derangement of commerce. Mr Simon doubts whether England could submit to the isolation involved in a system of rigid and comprehensive quarantine. Not only the obviously sick, but the possibly sick, must be kept at a distance. Nobody could be admitted into the country, however excellent apparently in health, until he had passed a period of probation in perfectly non-infectious circumstances,</p> <p>Mr Simon sums up the case against quarantine in a way which seems to us unanswerable. Considering what inconvenience to persons, what interruption to commerce, such restrictions involve, on how vast a scale and for what indefinite duration of time they must be enforced,</p> <blockquote> <p>no one can expect, in regard to great trading communities, that governments, if they go so far as to enact, will have much success in enforcing, quarantine. Against the efficiency of it, when enacted, there operate some of the strongest of law-breaking influences \u2013 on the one hand, instincts of contempt for the narrow self-protectiveness which it represents and on the other, those eager commercial interests which now mainly govern the world.</p> </blockquote> <p>Absolute quarantine would be insufferable, partial quarantine would be inoperative, for let the restrictions be relaxed or evaded in only a single case, and the whole mischief might be done which an elaborate and costly machinery had been provided to prevent. So far we agree with Mr Simon; but at the same time we think there are exceptional cases where, in the face of grave and imminent danger, quarantine might be temporarily established \u2013 to the extent, for instance, of having a medical examination of passengers arriving direct from any place abroad where the cholera is known to he raging virulently, and of keeping them apart for a few days from the rest of the community. Such precautions might mitigate, though they certainly could not be trusted altogether to prevent, the spread of disease.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5747a7c5d3043a14cc4917f05bce9d606d2b357f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5747a7c5d3043a14cc4917f05bce9d606d2b357f/0_98_3792_2276/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passengers from Marseilles are fumigated with carbolic acid at Avignon railway station, in the hope of preventing the spread of cholera, 1884.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passengers from Marseilles are fumigated with carbolic acid at Avignon railway station, in the hope of preventing the spread of cholera, 1884.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rischgitz/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Putting quarantine aside, we have still another mode of coping with contagion from abroad; and that is to keep up the public health to such degree as to be able to resist its fatal influence. The overcrowding of population demands a serious attention; and Mr Simon\u2019s report to the Privy Council offers some valuable suggestions as to the best means of checking the evil. The law is at present very vague and imperfect; and among chief amendments required are the following:\u2013</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/mar/15/john-snow-cholera-map\">John Snow's data journalism: the cholera map that changed the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That over-crowding should be declared a nuisance, the sole test of its existence being the proportion borne by the number of occupants to the size and ventilation of a given space; that what are called the \u201ctenement houses\u201d of the poor should be dealt with in the same manner as common lodging houses; that cellar dwellings should be prohibited; and that the local authorities should be empowered to acquire premises, by compulsory sale, either in order to make needful openings and clearings where ground is too closely built upon, or for other improvements.</p> <p>There is another point of great importance to which Mr Simon alludes. At present any person suffering from a contagious disorder practically scatters his infection broadcast almost where he will. Subject to the conditions that proper hospital accommodation can be offered, the authorities ought, it is urged, to be able to require that anyone having a dangerous contagious disease should, in regard to residence and otherwise, so conduct himself as not unnecessarily to multiply the chances of extending infection to others. There are obviously difficulties in the way of enforcing this; but the principle is sound, and has hitherto been too much overlooked.</p>",
  "<p>Even when the lockdown is lifted, there is no guarantee that life will ever return to normal. To prevent a future outbreak of coronavirus, the UK will need to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/49f3b95a-167e-4784-b099-614486f0ff53\">roll out mass testing</a>, maintain some social distancing measures and closely monitor communities to curb future flare-ups.</p> <p>In pursuing that last aim, governments across the world are developing technology to track our movements. When lockdown ends, technology could be a valuable means of controlling future outbreaks, alerting people to cases of Covid-19 in their area and hopefully preventing future shutdowns.</p> <p>In the UK this technology seems likely to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/31/nhs-developing-app-to-trace-close-contacts-of-coronavirus-carriers\">come from the NHS</a>, in the form of an app that logs our proximity to others and notifies us if it\u2019s time to self-isolate. This software has rightly raised concerns from civil liberty advocates because the ideal app needs to achieve a number of things: it should protect users\u2019 privacy, be transparent about the data it collects and be designed in a way that is useful to both epidemiologists and the people using it. Achieving all three is easier said than done.</p> <p>Protecting privacy is a near-impossible task for an app of this nature. <a href=\"https://medium.com/@rachelcoldicutt/open-letter-contract-tracking-and-nhsx-e503325b2703\">Experts suggest that </a>a contact-tracking app will have the capability to trace and identify individuals who are exposed to someone with Covid-19. While <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/15/tech/google-apple-coronavirus-tracker/index.html\">Apple and Google</a> are developing foundations for an app that protects privacy, the NHS plans to take a difference approach, collecting data to enable more detailed tracing. Centralised systems with more detailed information can better track the impact of the virus, but they also risk bolstering the UK government\u2019s already extensive <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/uk-mass-surveillance-echr-ruling\">surveillance infrastructure</a>. And although these decisions are being made under emergency powers, ostensibly easy to discard after the pandemic, the introduction of those powers were <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/coronavirus-covid-19-law-parliament-emergency-powers\">passed with no debate</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/18/mass-surveillance-coronavirus-technology-expansion\">The expansion of mass surveillance to stop coronavirus should worry us all | Veena Dubal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An app with such risks \u2013 in a post-Cambridge Analytica world \u2013 is unlikely to be adopted by the public without pushback.

Singapore\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/tracetogether-behind-the-scenes-look-at-its-development-process\">TraceTogether app</a>, which sends short-distance Bluetooth signals to connect with other people using the app, thereby giving the government a database by which to track potential coronavirus carriers, is the oft-cited archetype for future applications. But while it needs 4 million users <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/about-one-million-people-have-downloaded-the-tracetogether-app-but-more-need-to-do-so-for\">to be truly effective</a>, only 1 million have downloaded it voluntarily. It\u2019s worth noting that in addition to its app, Singapore swiftly enforced a lockdown, placed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/how-did-britain-get-its-response-to-coronavirus-so-wrong\">strict controls</a> on arrivals from infected regions and prescribed the use of face masks.</p> <p>The UK would require <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/31/nhs-developing-app-to-trace-close-contacts-of-coronavirus-carriers\">approximately </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/31/nhs-developing-app-to-trace-close-contacts-of-coronavirus-carriers\">36 million people</a> to sign up and engage with the app in order for us to benefit. Moreover, an app based on Bluetooth may flag up anyone, regardless of whether they are actually at risk of catching coronavirus. This would generate false signals.</p> <p>The government<strong> </strong>may decide to push the app through anyway, and later ask for forgiveness rather than permission. It has fallen to journalists to break the news that the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/plan-phone-location-data-assist-uk-coronavirus-effort\">is </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/plan-phone-location-data-assist-uk-coronavirus-effort\">in talks with </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/plan-phone-location-data-assist-uk-coronavirus-effort\">EE </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/plan-phone-location-data-assist-uk-coronavirus-effort\">about using mobile phone data </a>in order to monitor whether people are following social distancing guidelines, and that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/uk-government-using-confidential-patient-data-in-coronavirus-response\">Covid-19 datastore</a> will collect (albeit anonymously) people\u2019s gender, postcode, symptoms, prescriptions and any calls they made to 111. Yet this should not be surprising. Long before the lockdown began, the roll-out of facial recognition in London was pushed through with little consent given by those being surveilled, despite <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-49586582\">scandals</a> over providing databases to private organisations.</p> <p>To some, an app like this may seem like a fair trade. The <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/we-need-big-brother-to-beat-this-virus-5b0njl68r\">argument has been made</a> that \u201cselling our digital souls\u201d to the state is preferable to the current lockdown. Some have praised Taiwan, where the authorities will visit households that turn off their phones, and South Korea, where health authorities pool credit card information and CCTV footage to monitor an infected person\u2019s movements. It seems unlikely that Conservative advocates of these solutions would offer the same praise to authoritarian China, or so keenly sacrifice their digital rights to a Labour government.</p> <p>Nevertheless, one must assume this app will still be released in spite of ideological and practical concerns, because <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19d90308-6858-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75\">when people are given a choice</a> between privacy and health, they will usually choose the latter. Once that has happened, it could be difficult to put the genie back into the bottle. Throughout history, during moments of crisis, rightwing governments have sought to consolidate their power by introducing measures without the threat of democratic opposition.</p> <p>As Naomi Klein has <a href=\"http://tsd.naomiklein.org/shock-doctrine/\">documented</a>, the disorder created by the Falklands war helped Margaret Thatcher launch a frenzy of privatisation. The Chinese government used the Tiananmen Square massacre to shock its citizens into accepting a system where free markets could be combined with authoritarian political control. The coronavirus pandemic is not a war, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/self-pitying-woke-generation-needed-war-coronavirus-got-one/\">despite the rhetoric</a>, but supporters of the government are keen to paint Boris Johnson as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/04/02/boris-johnson-needs-unleash-inner-churchill-war-against-coronavirus/\">Churchillian</a>\u201d leader, and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/04/boris-johnson-released-hospital-coronavirus-covid19/609886/\">provide him with the opportunity</a> to remake the country (as <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/23/hungarys-orban-uses-pandemic-seize-unlimited-power\">other leaders</a> are <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-18/israel-coronavirus-netanyahu\">currently doing</a>).</p> <p>Recent history provides a clear warning about the close relationship between our government and Big Tech. When Google partnered with the NHS to develop an app that monitored kidney injury, critics said the search giant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/14/google-betrays-patient-trust-deepmind-healthcare-move\">broke its pledge</a> to never connect the data with its accounts of services. When Amazon partnered with the NHS to allow its Alexa voice-assisted speakers to read out health information, the retail giant <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/amazon-ready-to-cash-in-on-free-access-to-nhs-data-bbzp52n5m\">secretly received vast amounts of NHS data</a> so it could develop future products. And although Apple and Google have said that their contact-tracing apps would limit applications that tried to create a centralised database of contacts, the government has beaten down <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/29/android-brexit-app-for-eu-citizens-to-work-on-iphones-says-sajid-javid\">Apple on its security principles before</a>. </p> <p>In developing this software, the government needs to be clear about its priorities and the capabilities of the app, and transparent with the public about both.

  "<p>Alison Young lived in lockdown long before Covid-19. For most of her eight-year marriage, her controlling husband only allowed her to leave the house for \u201cauthorised trips\u201d. \u201cThat was invariably food shopping and, when I got back, he always checked the receipts, the mileage and searched the car for crumbs in case I\u2019d eaten when I was out, which I wasn\u2019t allowed to do,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cIf you bent the rules or argued back, you didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d react. Sometimes, he\u2019d let me laugh it off, other times, he\u2019d have a knife at my throat \u2013 so the fear never left. It was either just under the surface or spilling out of every pore.\u201d</p> <p>In the first four weeks of lockdown in the UK, 13 women and four children are believed to have been killed by men, most while shut inside their homes \u2013 that\u2019s double the (already mind-bending) average of two women a week. At the same time, women\u2019s frontline services are reporting record-breaking cries for help. Calls to domestic violence helplines have increased by 120% while traffic to their websites is tripling. There\u2019s an unprecedented demand for refuge places. Children, too, are more vulnerable than they have ever been. Some social services <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52228772\">have reported</a> that before the Easter holidays, the number of \u201cat-risk children\u201d who have been allocated a school place actually turning up to school had dropped to below 10%. In certain schools, it had fallen to zero.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been reading the reports, about these \u2018lockdown murders\u2019 and women desperately needing help, and it\u2019s always depicted as people living under pressure in extraordinary times and losing the plot,\u201d says Young, who now runs an unofficial support network for women like her. \u201cWhen you\u2019re living it, it\u2019s not like that at all. It\u2019s about how abusive partners behave when there\u2019s no public scrutiny, when everyone\u2019s looking the other way. It\u2019s about someone using every change in circumstance for leverage, and adapting to every new way of living by massively tightening control.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/14/the-schools-open-during-lockdown-for-some-kids-its-the-only-safe-place\">The schools open during lockdown: 'for some kids, it's the only safe place'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dr Jane Monckton-Smith, a former police officer and forensic criminologist at the University of Gloucester, spent years studying hundreds of intimate partner homicides, interviewing families and public protection professionals, in order to plot the slow creep from \u201cfirst meet\u201d to \u201cmurder\u201d. Last year, she published the <a href=\"https://www.glos.ac.uk/news/pages/the-homicide-timeline.aspx\">Homicide Timeline</a>, which identified eight stages that killers pass through. The first is a pre-relationship history of stalking, domestic violence or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/31/intimate-terrorism-domestic-abuse-coercive-control-farieissia-martin\">coercive control</a>. The second is declaring love and moving the relationship forward very quickly. Third is a tightening of control \u2013 this could be rules about a partner\u2019s spending habits, the friends she sees, the clothes she wears. \u201cBefore lockdown, most controlling people were at stage three,\u201d says Monkton-Smith.</p> <p>Stage four on her scale is a \u201ctrigger event\u201d, something that threatens the killer\u2019s sense of power and control. \u201cOften, it\u2019s their partner leaving the relationship, but it could be so many other things \u2013 retirement or unemployment, illness, a new baby.\u201d Or lockdown. \u201cAll our abusers are now in stage four,\u201d says Monckton-Smith. \u201cWhoever you are, Covid-19 has taken your control away. You\u2019ve lost control of where you can go, what you can do, you might have lost control of your finances. If you\u2019re with children 24 hours a day, and they\u2019re too noisy, too messy, if your victim gets ill or isn\u2019t able to keep the children and the house the way you want it,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that everyone at this stage will move to homicide, but every abuser is now more volatile and higher risk, and if that person is impulsive, or comfortable with violence, it can pass through the next stages \u2013 escalation, a change in thinking, planning and homicide \u2013 very quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Young recognises this pattern all too well \u2013 for her, the trigger event was losing her job. \u201cIt was through no fault of my own, there was a restructuring and my job didn\u2019t exist any more,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember sitting on the train home after I had been told, so frightened I could barely see. It was terrifying \u2013 I knew I had to tell him and I knew I was in for it.</p> <p>\u201cI had a well-paid job and he didn\u2019t work, so he needed me to. He took my bank card, I wasn\u2019t allowed to go anywhere because, according to him, every time I left the house, it would cost money.\u201d Living together in their own personal lockdown, Young\u2019s partner became more violent and less predictable. \u201cIt escalated really quickly,\u201d she says. \u201cHe threatened me with knives \u2026 and I\u2019ve been raped many times.\u201d It was after her partner pulled her from her bed as she slept to drag her around the room \u201clike a rag doll\u201d that Young turned to a friend who helped her escape.</p> <p>For Laura Camm, the trigger event was the birth of their daughter. \u201cWhen she arrived, he wasn\u2019t the most important person any more,\u201d Camm says. \u201cHe could see I was weak and tired and overweight. He bought a running machine, put it in the middle of the living room and had a go at me when I wasn\u2019t on it. The abuse escalated really quickly. He started strangling me whenever we had an argument.

A few days before lockdown, my parents put a doorbell with a camera on it on to my front door and the first person we saw on it \u2013 that day, while I was at work \u2013 was him.

The Home Office\u2019s recent pledge of \u00a32m for domestic abuse services will help \u2013 although it has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/14/fiona-dwyer-2m-for-coronavirus-domestic-abuse-victims-its-pitiful\">heavily criticised</a> as nowhere near enough. The MP Jess Phillips, alongside campaigning groups such as Southall Black Sisters, have enlisted hotels to open their doors to women urgently needing to flee abuse \u2013 the next stage is for the government to underwrite the cost. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women should know: if you call 999 and can\u2019t talk, press 5 twice and the police will act on it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, Suzanne Jacob, the CEO of the UK charity SafeLives, believes the priority should be removing the perpetrators. \u201cThe victim shouldn\u2019t have to leave the home, especially now in a pandemic,\u201d she says. \u201cOne thing police are asking for is a relaxation in rules around domestic violence protection orders \u2013 which allow them to remove perpetrators for a very limited period \u2013 and also a relaxation in rules about how long people can be kept in custody. This has already happened in other countries, including Italy.\u201d (The Women\u2019s Equality party has also called for special police powers to evict perpetrators of domestic violence in lockdown.)

  "<p>\u201cOn Friday, another resident of my unit returned from hospital having recovered from coronavirus symptoms. Since his return I have discovered two residents of my unit have died in the care home, but I don\u2019t know the cause,\u201d writes David (not his real name). \u201cThere are two other residents in our unit who have been hospitalised with a high temperature and a cough but they have not been tested.\u201d</p> <p>For the past week, David has emailed me from inside one of Britain\u2019s coronavirus-struck care homes. As the government is accused of treating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/16/social-care-an-afterthought-in-uk-coronavirus-response-says-leaked-letter\">social care</a> as an \u201cafterthought\u201d and one prominent member of the media talks of care home \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/peston/status/1246860610626871296?s=21\">inmates</a>\u201d, you won\u2019t hear much from people like David \u2013 but he is one of the thousands of disabled and older care home residents across the country who are locked inside a national crisis.</p> <p>David is not your stereotypical care home user. He\u2019s only in his 40s, but progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) means he\u2019s been in residential care for the past three years. The left side of his body and his right leg don\u2019t move as he instructs them to, but as he puts it, \u201cmy eyes, ears and brain\u201d work fine.</p> <p>There are around 150 residents in the home. Nowadays, only staff go in and out. Residents have been told they must stay in their rooms and not interact with one another. David hasn\u2019t seen his wife or two children in four weeks; Facebook and Zoom are now his only windows to the outside.</p> <p>In recent weeks, as the pandemic has spread through council and privately run care homes, David has watched the crisis unfold from his wheelchair. It is estimated that deaths in care homes in England and Wales have more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/coronavirus-deaths-in-care-homes-in-england-and-wales-more-than-quadruple-in-a-week?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">quadrupled in a week</a>.</p> <p>David\u2019s disability means he can barely talk but he wants to speak out. He types to me painstakingly with one finger, emailing a national newspaper in the hope that someone will hear him. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying,\u201d he writes. \u201cI can see things happening but I can\u2019t change it.\u201d</p> <p>He says that he has been sending email after email to the care home management asking for information on possible Covid-19 cases in the residence but gets no reply. Meanwhile, low-paid care staff are trying their best as they work around the clock, but mistakes are made daily. \u201cA carer came in my room to get me my toothbrush,\u201d David tells me. \u201cHe gloved up then realised that there were no towels so he left the room, got a towel and returned with the same gloves \u2026 it\u2019s not easy to explain infection control with a glare.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/16/social-care-an-afterthought-in-uk-coronavirus-response-says-leaked-letter?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">leaked letter</a> from the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass) told of a catalogue of national safety errors: from \u201cshambolic\u201d delivery of protective equipment to care homes, to insufficient testing of care staff and residents. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has since <a href=\"https://www.communitycare.co.uk/2020/04/15/hancock-social-care-staff-care-home-residents-covid-19-symptoms-get-tested/\">announced</a> a new social care strategy including making testing available for all care staff and residents, but there is no deadline. David worries it\u2019s too little too late. \u201cI fear that the damage was done weeks ago and a lot of us are unknowingly incubating the coronavirus.\u201d</p> <p>The UK\u2019s pandemic response in care homes is comparable to fighting blindfolded: there is no way of combating the virus if we don\u2019t know how widespread and severe it is. People who die of suspected coronavirus outside hospital are not immediately included in official death toll lists; there is a two-week delay in collecting data from care homes. Meanwhile the national lack of testing makes it impossible to know which homes and residents are carrying the virus. Without an accurate picture of how coronavirus is affecting care homes, ministers are less able to make robust plans to tackle it: from the right PPE for staff to proper funding for safe levels of care.</p> <p>In the coming days, it would be easy to forget about David. Disabled and older people in care homes are on the edge of society, literally shut away out of sight and too often dismissed in times of pandemics as already \u201csick\u201d or \u201cold\u201d. But in a public health crisis, it is those who are farthest from the public eye who require the most attention. The very people who are most vulnerable are being overlooked.</p> <p>\u2022 Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s almost inconceivable now to think that this week\u2019s NFL draft was supposed to take place amid the glitz of Las Vegas. Parties galore. Drafted players hugging the commissioner with the Bellagio fountains dancing in the background. A cacophony of cheers and boos from a packed crowd.</p> <p>Then came Covid-19. Now, aside from the dates (23-25 April), everything about the three-day spectacle has changed. It will instead take place in a virtual format with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell\u2019s basement serving as the new stage.</p> <h2><strong>How will the telecast work?</strong></h2> <p>In a normal year, viewers in the US would have their choice of three different broadcasts, from ESPN, NFL Network and ABC (an option introduced last year and geared toward casual fans).</p> <p>Given the new, post-lockdown landscape, NFL Network and ESPN decided to merge their resources into one unified broadcast from ESPN HQ in Bristol, Connecticut. A barren studio will be graced solely by Trey Wingo. Suzy Kolber will conduct player interviews (by video) while an array of reporters and analysts will participate from home. Talent from the two networks will be mixed and matched. This means that ESPN\u2019s Mel Kiper and NFL Network\u2019s Daniel Jeremiah, typically competitors in the draft space, will likely appear on air together. \u201cThe idea is to use the people and their expertise regardless of which network we work for,\u201d says NFL Network executive Mark Quenzel. \u201cThis is the best thing for NFL fans.\u201d</p> <p>ABC\u2019s show will also be produced by ESPN. Last year it featured a litany of human interest stories, had an audience of 46% women and drew in a big audience.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/20/isaiah-simmons-nfl-draft-football-clemson\">Is the positionless Isaiah Simmons a glimpse of the NFL's future?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since media is deemed an essential business, there will be producers running both the ESPN and ABC telecasts from a control room in Bristol. But the number will be half of a typical crew and, as mandated by the state of Connecticut, they must maintain social distance and wear face coverings. Communicating in real time through a mask to an army of feeds projected to be somewhere between 170 and 180 will pose quite the challenge.</p> <h2><strong>How will NFL prospects appear on camera?</strong></h2> <p>The 58 prospects invited to attend the virtual draft will double as cameramen. The NFL is counting on each player to set up two cameras. One for up-close reaction shots, the other a wide shot of the room. NFL agent Nicole Lynn, who represents tackle Jedrick Wills and quarterback Jalen Hurts, says her clients were told the wide-shot camera will capture them simulating the traditional \u201cwalk to the stage\u201d. At that point they will have some type of congratulatory virtual interaction with Goodell.</p> <h2><strong>What could go wrong?</strong></h2> <p>Well, everything. During the first of several trial runs, <a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2887574-report-2020-nfl-draft-mock-test-suffered-technical-glitch-on-bengals-1st-pick\">there were reportedly</a> multiple issues from general managers not muting themselves during a conference call to problems with bandwidth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/diannaESPN/status/1252330177981485060\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I was on the phone with a head coach talking about the mock draft today and he was losing his mind because his Internet went down...apparently his young children were all on their iPads using up the band width. \u201c everybody get off the Internet\u201d-in loud dad voice. <br>I hung up.</p>&mdash; Dianna Russini (@diannaESPN) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/diannaESPN/status/1252330177981485060?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 20, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The league\u2019s tech wizards will be working overtime to minimize the issues but technology and uncharted waters don\u2019t often mix well.</p> <p>Then there are the prospects themselves. A player could mistakenly curse on camera \u2013 an understandable reaction if you\u2019ve just been drafted by the New York Jets. He could also, God forbid, drink a brand of soda that isn\u2019t an official NFL sponsor. He could break lockdown restrictions by sneaking some buddies in to celebrate. Most likely, we\u2019ll see a litany of minor technical bumps. Last Friday\u2019s WNBA virtual draft featured everything from glitchy screens to newly drafted Chennedy Carter putting her commissioner interview on speaker phone, causing a severe echo.</p> <h2><strong>How will the league cover Covid-19?</strong></h2> <p><br>\u201cClearly we\u2019re there to draft players but more clearly we\u2019re setting the tone that we understand there\u2019s something much larger going on in the world,\u201d says Quenzel of NFL Network. To that end, the NFL is turning its three-day event into a Draft-a-Thon where viewers can donate to help with Covid-19 relief efforts. The charity drive will feature a collection of celebrities and athletes such as Deion Sanders and Kevin Hart. Quenzel says the broadcast will place an equal emphasis on soliciting donations and saying a \u201cproper thank you\u201d to first responders, grocery store workers and other professionals risking their lives to keep society running.</p> <h2><strong>Why didn\u2019t the NFL just postpone?</strong></h2> <p>Back in March, multiple general managers, including the Saints\u2019 Mickey Loomis, pushed to have the draft postponed. But that was never a serious consideration for the 32 NFL team owners, who voted unanimously to proceed as scheduled.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to have normalcy,\u201d Goodell told NFL Network\u2019s Rich Eisen last week. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this in a way that demonstrates that you can continue to do what you need to do in this country and do it safely at home.\u201d</p> <p>The league\u2019s show-must-go-on mentality extends to the regular season. Goodell has given no indication the new season will be delayed, despite red flags such as California governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s assertion last week that gatherings \u201cin the hundreds\u201d are \u201cnot on the cards\u201d any time soon.</p> <p>If the regular season were to begin in September as usual, delaying the draft would impede a rookie\u2019s ability to acclimate to his team\u2019s playbook, engage in team offseason programs, and get a contract signed.</p> <h2><strong>Could the virtual draft actually be an improvement?</strong></h2> <p><br>Absolutely. Between an oversaturated NFL calendar, a commissioner who\u2019s not exactly a dynamo, and a rulebook thicker than a Dostoevsky novel, the NFL can often feel a tad soulless and manufactured.</p> <p>Of course there will be elements of too much polish in this draft as it\u2019s an official NFL event. But the increased probability of error during the broadcast, may add a refreshing layer of vulnerability and imperfection that we can all relate to these days.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>The warehouse appears unremarkable, except for its size. Just off a motorway on an industrial estate in Merseyside sits a 35,000 sq m (377,000 sq ft) purpose-built warehouse with 20 loading docks to enable the storage and rapid distribution of hundreds of millions of face masks, aprons, gowns, gloves and body bags.</p> <p>For security reasons, the Guardian has been asked not to disclose the precise location of the UK\u2019s stockpile of personal protective equipment (PPE) for use in a pandemic. It is being stored on a site where builders moved the equivalent of more than 90 Olympic\u2013size swimming pools of earth to make way for a vast, climate-controlled warehouse.</p> <p>However, the Guardian can reveal that the management and the distribution of the stockpile has been outsourced to a private company, Movianto, which was sold two weeks ago for $133m (\u00a3107m) by its owner, a large US healthcare group.</p> <p>The fact that Movianto was being sold in the midst of a global pandemic, months after being instructed by the UK government to start mobilising the PPE supply, would be remarkable enough. But the sale is only the latest development in a turbulent 18 months for Movianto, which has included legal disputes with a property developer who built the enormous warehouse in Merseyside.</p> <p>The disputes culminated in Movianto securing a high court injunction in March last year, to thwart threats by the developer, Oliver Morley, to \u201clock the gates\u201d and prevent Movianto employees from accessing the warehoused stock.</p> <p>Morley\u2019s company has since gone into administration and its legal claims against Movianto have been discontinued, but Morley maintains his legal battles with Movianto were not over. He called for an investigation into the firm, alleging there was \u201ca much bigger story that needs to be told\u201d about his former tenant, but declined to provide specific details.</p> <p>For its part, Movianto firmly dismisses all of Morley\u2019s allegations, pointing out that his property firm was defeated last year in court. The company insists the legal disputes and the sale have had no impact on its storage or distribution of PPE in recent months.</p> <p>\u201cMovianto firmly believes that it has and continues to perform to all contractual obligations,\u201d the firm said.</p> <p>But the saga is likely to put a spotlight on the UK government\u2019s decision to outsource the management of the emergency stockpile. In three years, the stockpile appears to have been stored in three different warehouses. Meanwhile, management of the stock has been passed from a German\u2013owned multinational to an American one.</p> <p>In the coming months the custody of the UK\u2019s emergency stockpile of PPE will be passed on to a family-run business based in suburban Paris.</p> <p>A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said: \u201cThe pandemic influenza stockpile held under this contract has remained safely and securely stored at all times and has supported our Covid-19 response through the distribution of vital personal protective equipment and essential supplies to the NHS and social care sector.\u201d</p> <h2>PPE provision</h2> <p>Widespread shortages of PPE have dominated complaints over the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic in recent weeks, including from NHS workers who say their lives are being endangered by the lack of adequate protection. This week an RAF plane was dispatched to Turkey to secure more supplies.</p> <p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, insists the government is rising to the challenge, and has repeatedly said the PPE challenge has been \u201cone of distribution rather than one of supply\u201d. In addition to procuring new supplies from China, the DHSC has been drawing on the emergency stockpile, which it has stored since 2006 under its pandemic influenza preparedness programme.</p> <p>That stockpile is made up of around 52,000 pallets of equipment worth an estimated \u00a3500m. While it contains antiviral medicines and flu vaccines which are of limited use against Covid-19, the bulk of stocks are said to be PPE and hygiene products. Much of the stock needs to be frequently monitored, updated and stored in temperature\u2013controlled conditions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc5a97820aa522ff0d6d7e268bbbb7ee2eb3fc26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc5a97820aa522ff0d6d7e268bbbb7ee2eb3fc26/0_165_2769_1662/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The warehouse where 52,000 pallets of PPE and other flu pandemic supplies are stored.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The warehouse where 52,000 pallets of PPE and other flu pandemic supplies are stored.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Waugh/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The government owns the stock, but outsources its management to private firms. Previously, the contract was held by DHL. Movianto, a subsidiary of the US health company Owens &amp; Minor, won the \u00a355m deal in the summer of 2018.</p> <p>As part of Movianto\u2019s plans, the company entered into business with Morley to build the vast warehouse in Merseyside. In the meantime, the pandemic stockpile was to be temporarily housed in another warehouse, also owned by Morley, in Knowsley.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It got to the point where I said I\u2019m going to lock the gates and refuse you entry to the site.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Movianto\u2019s plans were approved by the Cabinet Office, documents suggest. The company says its decision to enter into business with Morley was \u201cmade by executives no longer associated with Movianto\u201d.</p> <p>A notice for the new NHS contract stipulated that the contractor would be required to maintain \u201ca ready state for deployment in the event of a pandemic event\u201d.</p> <p>In early 2019, Movianto became mired in disputes with Morley\u2019s company, which accused the firm of not paying rent for the warehouse in Knowsley. According to Morley, his tenants became \u201cuncooperative\u201d. \u201cThis went on for weeks,\u201d he said. Movianto strongly rejects the allegation, saying it paid rent \u201cin accordance with the terms of the lease\u201d.</p> <p>Another grievance related to the payment of electricity bills to power the generators to ensure the stock, including medicines, was stored at the right temperature. Morley claims he ended up having to pay for electricity to power the generators, which \u201ckept going on the blink\u201d resulting, he alleges, in \u201ctemperature spikes\u201d.</p> <p>A Movianto source said Morley\u2019s account was inaccurate.

It said Morley\u2019s allegations over rent and generators were undermined by \u201cvarious court proceedings\u201d that ruled in Movianto\u2019s favour. In July 2019, under the control of administrators, Morley\u2019s property company Industrial North West LLP discontinued its legal claims against Movianto.</p> <h2>More challenges ahead</h2> <p>Morley insists he will continue to seek legal action against Movianto \u2013 and he is used to high-profile disputes. In January, he lost a prominent lawsuit against RBS in which he claimed the bank\u2019s controversial restructuring group placed him under duress by seizing his assets after struggling to repay a \u00a375m loan. A high court judge noted Morley used the \u201cborrowed personal wealth\u201d to spend on \u201cSouth African mining investments, property, cars, a yacht and a jet\u201d.</p> <p>Morley told the Guardian his lifestyle was the result of hard work and \u201chad nothing to do with being a good landlord\u201d. He insists previous business disputes are irrelevant to his grievances against Movianto, which came to a head in May 2019.</p> <p>As works were completed at the Merseyside warehouse and Movianto prepared to transfer the stockpile from Knowsley, Industrial North West was forced into administration. Documents state the firm \u201cfailed to comply\u201d with the conditions of a \u00a361m loan facility.</p> <p>Morley lost control of his warehouses and administrators stepped in. According to the administrator\u2019s report, the legal dispute \u201ccaused delays to the construction works\u201d at the new warehouse, which were finally completed in July 2019. Movianto said the legal disputes \u201chave had no impact on Movianto\u2019s work in response to Covid-19\u201d.</p> <p>According to a government source, the transfer of the UK\u2019s emergency PPE supplies to the new warehouse was completed by the end of August 2019, four months before the first cases of Covid-19 emerged in China.</p> <p>The warehouse is now owned by Warrington council, which bought the property for \u00a345m in October. During a change of shifts on Tuesday afternoon, warehouse workers were seen having their car boots searched as they left.</p> <p>In the coming months, their employer will switch from Owens &amp; Minor to the French company EHDH Holding Group, under a deal agreed on 6 April. The sale is expected to be completed before the end of June, with demand for supplies in the UK\u2019s pandemic stockpile expected to continue for many months.</p> <p>The distribution of that stockpile\u2019s PPE, it seems, may no longer solely be the responsibility of Movianto. Eleven days ago, the DHSC announced a new \u201c24/7 military operation\u201d to oversee the supply of PPE to health and care workers. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to create a whole new logistics network, essentially from scratch,\u201d Hancock said.</p> <p>A government source said the coronavirus outbreak presented different requirements to a flu pandemic \u2013 the basis of Movianto\u2019s original contract. Movianto was now \u201csupporting\u201d the government\u2019s PPE plan through its contractual obligations, the source said. Movianto said the terms of its NHS contracts were \u201cconfidential\u201d.</p> <p>Jeff Jochims, the chief operating officer of Owens &amp; Minor, said: \u201cWe look forward to closing the sale of Movianto business to EHDH, but in the meantime will continue our ceaseless work to support the global response to this pandemic.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>UK guidance urging the over-70s to take particular care to observe social distancing and avoid contact with people outside the home is leaving people aged 60 to 69 at increased risk from coronavirus, say scientists.</p> <p>Prof Azeem Majeed and colleagues at Imperial College London (ICL) noted that other countries had different policies and the World Health Organization said the highest risk was in over-60s.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/\">paper published by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine</a> at Oxford University, the death rate among people in their 70s is 8%, and the rate among those in their 60s is 3.6%, which the ICL scientists said was \u201cstill substantial\u201d.</p> <p>They recommend that the 7.3 million people in their 60s in the UK should be more careful about physical distancing and personal hygiene. </p> <p>\u201cIn the absence of government guidance, people in this group (60-69) can make their own informed decisions on how to minimise their risks of Covid-19 infection. This can include isolating themselves in a similar manner to that recommended by the UK government for people aged 70 years and over,\u201d they said in a paper <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0141076820921107\">published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the severity of the disease increases from the age of 40 years, those above the age of 60 years and those with underlying medical conditions including, but not limited to, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases and cancers are at the highest risk.\u201d</p> <p>They cited international evidence that over-60s are at higher risk. \u201cThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 80% of Covid-19-related deaths are in those aged 65 years and over,\u201d they said. In China, 80% of deaths were in the over-60s.</p> <p>Switzerland and France were among the countries that advised over-65s to take greater precautions against infection, they added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Other scientists agree there is a cause for concern about the 60-69 age group. Dr Tom Wingfield from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: \u201cIt would be helpful to see what evidence was used to inform the UK government\u2019s decision to define people over 70 years old as a high-risk group rather than using a lower age threshold such as 60 or 65 years old. This is a really important issue for the general public when we consider that more than 7 million people in the UK are aged between 60 and 69 years old.</p> <p>\u201cIn addition to the general public, it is also vital that carers and key workers who are aged over 60, including those returning from retirement to work in the NHS and other social care settings, are provided with accurate information to be able to make informed decisions about minimising their own risk from Covid-19.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 23 April 2020 to clarify the UK lockdown measures for people over 70.</p>",

As the Fire Brigade Union (FBU) health and safety officer for the region, he was keen to assess the risks involved for the UK firefighters volunteering in huge numbers to perform vital new roles in the pandemic.</p> <p>While some of their usual duties have been scaled back or suspended, firefighters and support staff are stepping in to provide additional resources for hard-pressed public services, such as ambulance services, which are receiving a record number of calls.

  "<h2>The album to start with</h2> <p><strong>Reign in Blood (1986)<br></strong>In 1986, thrash truly emerged from its classic, generally British, heavy metal influences, with the \u201cbig four\u201d \u2013 LA\u2019s Metallica, Megadeth, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/slayer\">Slayer</a> and NYC\u2019s Anthrax \u2013 all finding their sound. Metallica emphasised a paranoid grind, Anthrax a tongue-in-cheek, streetwise hardcore bounciness, and Megadeth a remnant of old-school, hard-rock boogie; Slayer, however, distilled and concentrated the essence of pure metal: the crystal meth to Iron Maiden and Judas Priest\u2019s medical Dexedrine. Every blastbeat and guitar widdle is faster, every scream higher, every grunt lower, every mood either assault or preparation for assault, and the subject matter is boiled down to Satan, slaughter and pain. All of metal\u2019s preposterous theatre and grandiosity is here, but at only 28 minutes from the first everyone-hitting-everything stab of Angel of Death to the final trickle of Raining Blood, it\u2019s perfectly nasty, brutish and short.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbyswHABG3Q\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cbyswHABG3Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Those two tracks are the classics that never left Slayer sets. Yes, Angel of Death is about Nazi surgeon Josef Mengele; no, Slayer are not Nazis, any more than they are Wahabbists for writing Jihad from the point of view of a 9/11 hijacker in 2006. In fact, their politics seem to lean to the oafish side of libertarianism. Like the rest of the album, Angel of Death is a schlock slasher movie, to the bone. Raining Blood, meanwhile, is utterly thrilling: even the squeamish or metal-averse can get caught up by the sharp-toothed earworm riffs. The twin-lead intro emerging from thunder and rain is probably the ultimate metal moment for main songwriters and guitarists, Kerry King and the late Jeff Hanemann.</p> <p>But there\u2019s not a weak link on the album. Necrophobic is under two minutes and rivals the UK grindcore acts emerging at the time for speed. Altar of Sacrifice is three minutes of perfect momentum, not a second to take a breath, just a constant rockfall of noise, perfectly controlled then grinding to a halt in the final seconds. It also features singer Tom Araya at his shoutiest, part of an undercurrent of hardcore and anarcho-crust-punk rage that always simmers beneath the metallic surfaces in Slayer. Epidemic is the closest to classic Brit metal, but it\u2019s done with such confidence that they\u2019re owning the sound rather than paying homage to Maiden. And on it goes. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rick-rubin\">Rick Rubin</a>\u2019s production and the band\u2019s incredible ear for structure means that, aside from all the theatre, lyrical dumb-assery and athletic virtuosity, it can \u2013 even now \u2013 be appreciated on an immediate, unconscious level as a pure sonic rush.</p> <h2>The three to check out next</h2> <p><strong>Seasons in the Abyss (1990)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqnC54vbUbU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jqnC54vbUbU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Slayer were not the heaviest, the fastest nor the most revolting extreme metal band. They were quickly outflanked in the gruesomeness race by Death, Carcass and Cannibal Corpse, and in speed terms by Napalm Death, Electro Hippies and Extreme Noise Terror. But nobody else hit that sweet spot between metal histrionics and pure grunting bestial racket as precisely as Slayer. While they tried to diversify and even mellow on South of Heaven, Seasons in the Abyss is the sound of them realising that they\u2019re at their swaggering best going all-out. There is still some subdued grind here, but it\u2019s the proper rippers, such as War Ensemble and Hollowed Point, that make it. It\u2019s also got some of Slayer\u2019s most fun sonics: the way lead guitar notes leap out of the surge of churning riff like spurts of lava from a boiling hellscape demonstrates their key skill of making extreme musicianship come off as audacity rather than onanism.</p> <p><strong>God Hates Us All (2001)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfKUWvVCwvE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WfKUWvVCwvE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Appropriately for a band who take metal to the nth degree, Slayer\u2019s career has been turbulent \u2013 from Lombardo\u2019s multiple splits from the band to Hanneman\u2019s troubles with arthritis, necrotising fasciitis, and the alcoholism that eventually killed him. But, despite all this, their output has been remarkably consistent. Their only real fallow patch was the second half of the 90s, when they released only the decent enough punk covers album, Undisputed Attitude, and the sadly nu-metal-influenced Diabolus in Musica. But with God Hates Us All they returned to form spectacularly. Apart from religious psychosis replacing the slasher imagery, it\u2019s vintage Slayer. Lombardo\u2019s stand-in, Paul Bostaph, is especially keen to prove his worth. The sheer inhuman barrage of blastbeats on Disciple is one of the most adrenalising sounds in their catalogue, and even a slow track such as Seven Faces takes a terrifying pummelling. From here on, they kept delivering, with 2009\u2019s World Painted Blood \u2013 reconstituting the original lineup \u2013 an especially tight collection. Even their 2015 swansong, Repentless, though derided by metal critics as unadventurous at the time, still stands up as a top-drawer thrash record.</p> <p><strong>Live Undead (1984)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtIv9nz-ZjM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TtIv9nz-ZjM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>If ever there was a record that delivered the stink and bruises of the moshpit, this is it. Though the debut album Show No Mercy, and Hell Awaits which followed in 1985 both show Slayer pushing at the boundaries of what metal could achieve, it\u2019s clear that their live shows was where they truly cut loose: this is the lightning that they would finally successfully bottle on Reign in Blood. The total meshing of guitar maelstrom, Lombardo\u2019s machine-like kickdrum rolls, and Araya\u2019s Rob Halford scream at the climax of Antichrist must have been staggering to experience in the flesh, and it\u2019s no wonder the roar of the crowd, audible throughout, is so deranged.</p> <h2>One for the heads</h2> <p><strong>South of Heaven (1988)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03mS-ibqQxQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/03mS-ibqQxQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>While many bands insist that their latest album is their best, King has admitted, with an impressive lack of ego, that he was fine with the idea they might never top Reign in Blood. Nonetheless, it took them a while to get past its brilliance. With all eyes on them \u2013 thanks not only to Reign\u2019s success but to the meteoric rise of Rick Rubin and Def Jam \u2013 they chose not to replicate the previous glory but to slow things down. Oddly, it kind of sounds like Slayer making a Metallica album. It rarely takes flight like their best, but it is a fantastic record. It is more trad metal than Reign, but it still has the swaggering confidence to the playing \u2013 and it might even be a good point of introduction for the timid.</p> <h2>The primer playlist</h2> <p>For Spotify users, listen below or click on the Spotify icon in the top right of the playlist; for Apple Music users, <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/gb/playlist/listeners-digest-where-to-start-with-slayer/pl.u-WabZZGYUdlAjRqg\">click here</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/66UVLuNkhVv7DyQW2Y6rUs\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/66UVLuNkhVv7DyQW2Y6rUs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <h2>Further reading</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/magazine/tribute-complete-untold-story-slayers-jeff-hanneman\">In Tribute: The Complete, Untold Story of Slayer\u2019s Jeff Hanneman</a>, by Jeff Kitts (2015)<br></strong>This memorial piece, published in Guitar World a year after Hanneman\u2019s death, is a perfect intro to Slayer\u2019s dysfunctional world, and to Hanneman\u2019s sweetly domesticated off stage life as well as his tragic decline.

His more than a dozen books, invariably as apocalyptic as they are brilliant, include analyses of colonial-era <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jan/20/historybooks.famine\">famines</a> and of the global rise of slums, a history of car bombs, and a distressingly prescient account of the pandemic threat of avian flu. Again and again, though, Davis\u2019s work returns to Los Angeles. His latest, <em>Set the Night on Fire: LA in the Sixties</em>, co-authored with the journalist and historian Jon Wiener, focuses on a single decade, a transformative one for the city and for its authors, who as young men were active in the civil rights and anti-war movements.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1bbc5eff4f2ddde113d52d4d13b157be4cd8ce7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1bbc5eff4f2ddde113d52d4d13b157be4cd8ce7/0_0_3008_1805/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A street in LA in 1965 during the riots.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A street in LA in 1965 during the riots.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bill Ray/The LIFE Picture Collection via</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In their introduction they classify <em>Set the Night on Fire</em> as a \u201cmovement history\u201d \u2013 an attempt to gain ground in the battle for LA\u2019s soul by rescuing the city\u2019s past from the strategic amnesia and propagandistic whitewashing that the great LA poet Sesshu Foster calls the \u201cpoison alzheimer\u2019s of the <a href=\"https://verse.press/poem/the-apartheid-imagination-2326036143330194035\">apartheid imagination</a>\u201d. The 1960s, after all, have been subjected to the same sort of censorial mythmaking as the city itself, facing, in the authors\u2019 words, a \u201crelentless campaign\u201d to \u201crewrite history from the standpoint of wealthy white men\u201d, cutting out the black, brown and working-class men and women \u2013 and often boys and girls \u2013 who are the heroes of this book, along with the feminist, gay and white radical activists who fought alongside them in parallel and often intersecting struggles.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The flower children who dominate mythic perceptions of the 60s show up here only peripherally, as minor roles in a larger drama</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The 60s depicted here depart from the \u201cstandard narrative\u201d of the decade that has emerged even on the left, in which university students, predominantly white and middle class, were \u201cthe principal social actors\u201d, and protest radiated out from a few large and storied campuses. In LA, by contrast, the major battles occurred in high schools and even junior high schools in the city\u2019s ghettoised black and Mexican neighbourhoods. The flower children who dominate mythic perceptions of the 60s show up here only peripherally, as minor roles in a larger drama, worthy of notice only when they throw their shoulders into the fight.</p> <p>To their credit, Davis and Wiener do not attempt to squeeze those tumultuous years into a single frame. Their approach is encyclopedic rather than narrative. And at nearly 800 pages, <em>Set the Night on Fire </em>is frankly monumental. It covers, in roughly chronological order, such diverse topics as early desegregation battles, the city\u2019s pioneering gay rights movement, its role in the birth of the Black Power movement, the rise of alternative media, draft resisters, activist nuns and the massive high school \u201cblowouts\u201d that rocked the Chicano east side in the spring of 1968. In this telling, the decade lasted until 1973, when the defeat at the polls of the city\u2019s aggressively racist mayor Sam Yorty (his Washington Post<em> </em>obituary described him as \u201ccolourfully cantankerous\u201d) by an African American city councilman named Tom Bradley brought the era of protest and revolt to an end, if not a resolution.</p> <p>This broad sweep nonetheless circles back to one \u201cissue of issues\u201d: \u201cthe dynamic tectonics of racial segregation\u201d. The thousands of African Americans who migrated to Los Angeles from the Jim Crow south had found similar cruel realities awaiting them. Federal housing policies and local white supremacists \u2013 elsewhere known as \u201crealtors\u201d \u2013 combined to close much of the city to non-whites. The central north-south spine of Alameda Street formed a \u201ccotton curtain\u201d that black people could not safely cross, a divide brutally enforced by vigilante white gangs as well as by the city\u2019s police. Racial segregation in the public schools was, and in many cases remains, almost absolute. In 1964, James Baldwin would write: \u201cThere is not one step, one inch, no distance, morally or actually, between Birmingham [Alabama] and Los Angeles.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a6c797b33b95353583325d8c23cc902683cf459\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a6c797b33b95353583325d8c23cc902683cf459/0_503_4210_2525/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A National Guardsman after the Watts riots, August 1965.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A National Guardsman after the Watts riots, August 1965.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much of this book, then, is devoted to the struggle for racial justice, from the campaigns for housing equality at the beginning of the decade to the mass student strikes in black and Chicano neighbourhoods at the end. The Watts rebellion of 1965, which left 34 dead \u2013 most of them shot by police and National Guardsmen \u2013 more than 1,000 injured, and a commercial district in flames receives close and careful treatment. It is characterised, refreshingly, not as a blind outburst of rage, but as a rational and even strategic response to a homicidal status quo. Davis and Wiener devote a full chapter to the Watts renaissance, the artistic awakening that emerged from the ashes of the uprising and that included the assemblage art movement that came out of Noah Purifoy\u2019s leadership of the Watts Towers Arts Center, the influential Watts Writers Workshop and the extraordinary jazz collective the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/oct/02/jazz-album-covers\">Pan African People\u2019s Arkestra.</a></p> <p>If it lacks a single hero, <em>Set the Night on Fire </em>features one recurring villain: the Los Angeles Police Department. LA\u2019s police make dramatic appearances in almost every chapter, clubbing peaceful protesters, brutalising activists and killing so many black men, and with such absolute impunity, that Davis and Wiener\u2019s claim that \u201cthe Manson gang were bit players compared to the forces of law and order\u201d ends up feeling more than fair. In the authors\u2019 telling, the wanton violence of the police acted as a consistent if unwitting catalyst to historical change: it was the chaos that followed a ferocious LAPD assault on anti-war protesters that added to Lyndon Johnson\u2019s decision not to run for re-election in 1968, and the LAPD\u2019s murder of a black Muslim named Ronald Stokes \u2013 seven other Muslims were shot in the same incident \u2013 that pushed Malcolm X towards a broader vision of black liberation. The shared experience of LAPD violence, Davis and Wiener write, forged a \u201ccommon culture of resistance\u201d among black and Chicano youth, white hipsters and anti-war activists, and the city\u2019s gay community.</p> <p>Los Angeles is in many ways a different place from the on it was in the 1960s. A once majority white region is now largely Latino and Asian. The city has become immensely rich, and at the same time, and often on the same streets, shockingly poor. Economic resources \u2013 and access to decent housing and education \u2013 are still distributed, to a shameful extent, according to race. Police still kill black and brown residents with appalling regularity. For new generations growing up in a city whose very history is rarely acknowledged to exist, <em>Set </em><em>the Night on Fire</em> is a vital primer in resistance, a gift to the future from the past.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Ben Ehrenreich\u2019s Desert Notebooks: A Roadmap for the End of Time will be published in July by Counterpoint Press.

  "<p><strong>A friend\u2019s daughter is a first-year student at Bath Spa University. She lives in a hall of residence allocated by the university but run by IQ Student Accommodation. Like most students, she returned home when lectures ceased because of coronavirus. Then lockdown began. She has been emailed by IQ saying she could cancel her contract without penalty, but she would have to collect her belongings \u2013 a round trip of 200 miles. Otherwise she would have to pay rental for the summer term. So she faces the choice of paying \u00a32,000 for a room she can\u2019t use, or break the law by doing a non-essential journey.</strong></p> <p><em><strong>SH, London</strong></em></p> <p>IQ, which owns 66 halls of residence across the country, says it sent a further email assuring students they could cancel their contract without removing their belongings and reminding them to avoid non-essential travel. It says it has since updated all its communications to clarify the issue.</p> <p>Your friend is lucky. Some halls of residence providers have refused to waive rent for unused rooms during the lockdown, arguing that students are still receiving maintenance and tuition loans. Hundreds of students have joined a rent strike with the support of Portsmouth South MP Stephen Morgan who is lobbying providers to release students from their contracts.</p> <h2><strong>I had to self isolate but Airbnb host refused to extend our stay</strong></h2> <p><strong>My family I live and work in Ghana and we returned to the UK just before lockdown. We checked into an Airbnb in Edinburgh to self-isolate for 14 days before going to look after my elderly in-laws. During our stay, my daughter developed coronavirus symptoms meaning my wife and I had to self isolate for a further 14 days. Our Airbnb host refused to let us extend our stay, despite the fact that we had to abide by government guidelines and there were no ensuing bookings on the website.</strong></p> <p><strong>Airbnb told us a guest had been booked in on our departure date and that we would have to find alternative accommodation. We do not have a car so would have to rely on taxis or public transport to do this.</strong></p> <p><strong>No one seems to address the fact we are being asked to commit a criminal offence.</strong></p> <p><strong>ME, Accra, Ghana</strong></p> <p>This is worrying on several counts. Quite apart from the fact that your family could have transmitted the infection if forced to seek new accommodation, the host had no business marketing the property after lockdown was imposed. Moreover, it may have been contaminated if you are infected.</p> <p>Airbnb finally blocked rentals on its website to all bar key workers on 9 April after hosts were found to be advertising properties in tourist hotspots as coronavirus retreats, despite a ban on non-essential travel.</p> <p>Airbnb told me that the pending guest had not been arranged through its platform and that once it learned of the problem it offered to fund alternative accommodation and pay for the host\u2019s cleaning expenses. To no avail.</p> <p>You ended up being turfed out two days before your quarantine ended. Luckily for you, you found a taxi firm willing to drive you the hour to another family home, and Airbnb paid the fare. Since your contract is with the host, not Airbnb, the host can legally, if not morally, hold you to the agreed check-out date, even if it means breaching quarantine.</p> <p>Technically you\u2019re not committing a criminal offence since the self-isolation guidelines are not enshrined in law and essential travel includes moving house \u201cwhere reasonably necessary\u201d.</p> <p>Airbnb says: \u201cWe were concerned to learn about this situation, and provided the guests with our support throughout. The health of the public and our communities is our priority, and we have introduced measures and guidance for hosts and guests that are regularly updated and in line with the latest government advice.\u201d</p> <h2><br>I have to stay in, so how do I get a chequebook?</h2> <p><strong>I am 81 and last week I used my last cheque.

They are at greater risk of further isolation due to social-distancing measures. While many people will use phone and video calls to stay in contact with friends and families and work colleagues, people with hearing loss, especially those who lip-read or use British Sign Language, will be excluded from these interactions.\u201d</p> <p>Lip-reading requires an individual to concentrate intently on both the movement of the lips and the sound they can hear to piece together what is being said, Geaney explains. This is tiring and many people only get most of what is being said \u2013 with contextual clues being used to fill the gaps.</p> <p>\u201cIt is therefore helpful to consider using text boxes or visual presentations alongside video conferences, particularly if communicating numbers or complex jargon,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In the <a href=\"https://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/about-us/our-research-and-evidence/facts-and-figures/\">UK, 12 million people </a><a href=\"https://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/about-us/our-research-and-evidence/facts-and-figures/\">have hearing loss</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hearinglink.org/your-hearing/about-hearing/facts-about-deafness-hearing-loss/\">65% of working-age deaf people are employed</a>, compared with 79% of the general population. An estimated 24,000 people use BSL as their main language. The <a href=\"https://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/live-well/your-rights/the-equality-act-2010/\">Equality Act 2010</a> obliges employers to make adjustments (like a BSL interpreter or a speech to text reporter) and the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/live-well/benefits-and-grants/access-to-work/\">Access to Work</a> scheme provides grants for specialist equipment.</p> <p>\u201cTo make the workplace more accessible, face someone when speaking to them, speak one at a time in meetings, and don\u2019t give people a desk facing a wall but allow them to face into the office, so they can communicate,\u201d says Geaney.</p> <p>\u201cThe key thing for home working is that managers should feel able to talk to members of staff about their hearing loss and the adjustments that they need,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>But the charity\u2019s focus groups revealed a reluctance among employees to disclose hearing loss at work because of embarrassment, stress or fear that it might affect job prospects. One said: \u201cYou want to do a good job at work, you do not want anyone to see hearing loss as a weakness.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a hidden condition and many staff who have concealed their hearing loss and coped without any support might now need support to find adjustments that work for them,\u201d says Geaney. Similarly, those who had adjustments set up in their place of work might now need new adjustments put in place, such as an amplified telephone or handsets that can be linked to an individual\u2019s hearing aid. </p> <p>Behaviour changes that hearing colleagues could make include speaking one at a time, muting themselves when not speaking to reduce background noise, having a clear agenda to provide structure and contextual clues to what is being said. For video conferencing it is helpful if the camera is square-on and everyone is well lit from the front. If the source of light is behind the individual then faces might be in shadow.</p> <p>Action on Hearing Loss research suggests the biggest reason people are without support is that they feel colleagues lack the knowledge to help. Almost half of respondents surveyed said deaf awareness (\u201cinformation on educating your colleagues or managers\u201d) would help them fulfil their potential, and more than a third said support to manage the anxiety of hearing loss at work would help.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.citylit.ac.uk/\">City Lit</a> adult education college in central London holds an annual Deaf Day to raise awareness (although this year\u2019s has been postponed due to coronavirus). Founded in 1919, the college began running lip-reading classes for soldiers deafened in the first world war. Courses specifically for deaf people include BSL, English, maths and digital skills. There are 12 deaf tutors and six who are hearing (but teach in BSL) plus a network of BSL interpreters who offer support in meetings or job interviews. It also provides employment advice to its students in partnership with the <a href=\"https://royaldeaf.org.uk/rads-information-advice-guidance-service-city-lit-college-returns/\">Royal Association for Deaf people</a>. A bursary helps low-income deaf students pay course fees and travel.</p> <p>Mark Hopkinson, head of City Lit\u2019s Centre for Deaf Education, says solutions to better integrating deaf people at work rest on attitudes: \u201cSupport in the workplace depends on the organisation and ethos. Are hearing colleagues prepared to help with deaf colleagues?\u201d BSL, in particular, is vital, he says. \u201cSupposing you weren\u2019t allowed to speak for a number of years, [forced] to remain silent, how would you feel?\u201d</p> <p>English is often a second language for deaf people after sign language. But for Ilyaas Cader, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FshWxk2_43w&amp;feature=youtu.be\">a refugee from Sri Lanka</a>, his first language is Tamil Sign, his second BSL and his third English. \u201cI learned sign language first \u2013 that helped me learn the English.

There are also communication barriers for deaf people receiving mental health support. BSL interpreters are <a href=\"https://signhealth.org.uk/for-professionals/psychological-therapy/\">third parties in counselling sessions</a> designed to be one-to-one.

  "<p>As Sars-CoV-2 has spread across the world, some countries have reacted with alarm and thorough preparations, given their previous experiences with Mers or Sars. In these countries, such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Vietnam, containment of the novel coronavirus became the imperative, regardless of cost. However, other countries chose to treat it like a bad flu strain that would be unstoppable and spread across the population until some kind of immunity was reached.</p> \n<p>Much of the difference in countries\u2019 initial responses can be attributed to whether they \u201coverreacted\u201d, given prior experience with two other more deadly coronaviruses, or whether they perceived the novel coronavirus from the start as just posing a moderate to low risk to their populations and eventually becoming endemic.</p> \n<p>In the UK, the assumption until quite recently had seemed to be the latter. The containment phase ended on 12 March. At this point, testing ended for all those with minor symptoms (including frontline health staff), contact tracing stopped, airports remained open without checks on incoming flights or passengers, and physical distancing measures were ruled out. Large events involving tens of thousands of people went ahead a few days later, and non-essential travel continued. After considerable public pressure, lockdown measures were introduced on 23 March with the goal of keeping the coronavirus-related burden on health services within NHS capacity.</p> \n<p>Where are we now? According to official figures, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public\">16,509 people with Covid-19 have so far died</a> in British hospitals. There are no official statistics for deaths in the community, but ONS data <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52361519\">released today</a> shows that of 6,200 Covid-19-related deaths in the week to 10 April, one in six of them happened outside hospital. We are on track for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/health-52321600/coronavirus-we-could-see-40000-deaths-in-this-wave\">40,000 deaths</a> by just the end of the first wave of this outbreak, while also having to cope with the astronomical economic costs and heart-rending social implications of being in lockdown for weeks on end.</p> \n<p>In a significant number of confirmed Covid cases, the health outcomes are severe, the disease can result in multiple organ failure and long-term lung damage, and the clinical need of patients for oxygen, ICU care and ventilators is much higher. Early clinical management of symptoms, to which Boris Johnson had access, means that outcomes are generally better, but that requires testing at an early stage of the disease.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"28f9c4c8-d8b6-4f17-bdd6-1264330215a7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/akiXEfWW-V0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>New Zealand is in the enviable position of having fewer than 20 deaths, while Australia has managed to stay under 100. With early physical distancing measures and border control, and aggressive testing, tracing and isolating procedures in place, these countries are in a better position to ease lockdown earlier and get their economy and society going again, while keeping Covid-19-related deaths low. That\u2019s as close to a win-win situation as a government can have right now.</p> \n<p>However, when these international comparisons are made, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-adrwale_c\">some in government</a> say that it is still too early to say how countries are performing, and others say that all countries will be in the same place, and any variation will depend on their healthcare capacity. It is worth thinking through the long-term scenarios for the future of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>The first scenario: if we have an effective, safe and available vaccine or antiviral in the next 18 months, the countries that minimised loss of life with the least harsh economic restrictions will be in the best position. Australia, New Zealand and numerous east Asian countries have the outbreak under control and can in the short term manage the trickle of cases while waiting for the scientific solution.</p> \n<p>The second scenario: in the absence of a vaccine or antiviral, some kind of population immunity will be built up so that the virus is not actively transmitting at a high level. This assumes that having the coronavirus leads to immunity for at least two or three years and that subsequent reinfection is mild. Even in this situation, the countries with low numbers of cases can wait for ongoing research on better identification of who is exactly \u201cvulnerable\u201d to developing severe symptoms, and shield these individuals so the burden on ICU care and loss of life are kept to a minimum. While we have some basic idea at population level about who is vulnerable, based on age and pre-existing conditions, scientists do not understand the individual genetic or immunological factors yet.</p> \n<p>The third (worst-case) scenario: research might find that there is no lasting immunity to the virus, or in fact immune enhancement, which means subsequent reinfections would be more severe (similar to dengue). This creates a real case for countries with the capacity to eliminate the virus and keep in place border controls . Obviously the fewer cases present, the easier it is to eliminate a virus, and in this situation a precautionary approach to letting it spread through the population would have been well warranted.</p> \n<p>In short, there are huge gaps in what we know about this virus, including about immunity, about the possibility and timeline for a vaccine or antiviral therapy, about who exactly is vulnerable, and about long-term health implications. For example, Italian scientists have warned that some patients are developing Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (temporary paralysis) as a side effect of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>In this uncertainty, countries that are actively working to contain this virus and keep numbers as low as possible are buying time to build a more informed policy response while also protecting their economies and societies. Others, by letting the virus spread slowly through their populations (only flattening the curve instead of completely stopping the spread), are just gambling with people\u2019s lives, and will be caught in cycles of lockdown/release that will destroy the economy and cause social unrest, as well as increased Covid-19- and non-Covid-19-related deaths.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh</p> \n<p><br><br></p>",

  "<p>In the name of freedom, we have been exposed, to a greater extent than any other European nation, to a deadly pandemic. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/feb/03/brexit-news-boris--johnson-speech-barnier-cabinet-ministers-claims-uk-does-not-need-trade-deal-with-eu-ahead-of-pms-speech-live-news?page=with:block-5e382b6f8f0811db2faf0775#block-5e382b6f8f0811db2faf0775\">his speech in Greenwich</a> on 3 February, Boris Johnson lambasted governments that had \u201cpanicked\u201d about the coronavirus, inflicting \u201cunnecessary economic damage\u201d. His government, by contrast, would champion our right to \u201cbuy and sell freely among each other\u201d.</p> <p>But as always, the professed love of freedom among those who represent the interests of the rich in politics is highly selective. If the government valued freedom as much as it says it does, it would do everything in its power to maximise the liberties we can safely exercise, while protecting us from harm.</p> <p>In other words, it would take up the call to open London\u2019s golf courses to public access. As the author and land campaigner Guy Shrubsole has discovered, there are <a href=\"https://whoownsengland.org/2020/04/14/who-owns-londons-golf-courses/\">131 golf courses in Greater London</a>, covering 11,000 acres. But they are open only to those who pay fees to play and to members, while millions of people swelter in tiny flats or edge round each other in minuscule parks, desperate for a sense of space and freedom. The government would also take up the call for private schools to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/private-schools-land-targeted-for-families-without-gardens\">open their playing fields</a> and extensive grounds. And it would open London\u2019s locked green squares, and designate other tracts of private land in and around our cities for public access.</p> <p>But a core purpose of conservatism is to defend private property from public use, and to extend private ownership and exclusive rights into realms previously enjoyed by all. And no form of wealth is more fiercely contested than land.</p> <p>Throughout the history of these isles, exclusion from the land has been a major source of social conflict. It remains so today. Last month, Johnson extolled the \u201c<a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-britain-pubs/ancient-british-rights-to-a-drink-in-the-pub-have-to-be-suspended-johnson-idUKKBN21732B\">ancient, inalienable right</a> of free-born people of the United Kingdom\u201d. But before the pandemic began, his government proposed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/15/tresspass-trap-law-land-travelling-people-rights\">criminalise trespass</a> in England and Wales. This is the opposite policy to Scotland\u2019s, where there is now a comprehensive right to roam.</p> <p>In November last year, Johnson announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/nov/19/johnson-reveals-plans-to-extend-police-stop-and-search-powers\">an expansion of police powers</a> to stop and search people without grounds for suspicion. These powers have long been perceived by people of colour as a form of collective harassment in public places, impinging on their free movement. Black, Asian and minority ethnic people are on average <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/oct/13/racial-bias-police-stop-and-search-policy-black-people-report\">eight times more likely</a> to be stopped and searched by the police than white people.</p> <p>Some young black men have the sense of living in a permanent state of partial lockdown. The government\u2019s <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/839765/Section_60_Equality_Impact_Assessment_July_2019.pdf\">own assessment shows</a> that an expansion of stop and search powers has \u201cat best, only minimal effects on violent crime\u201d. In fact, as a primary cause of both the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2246331.stm\">1981</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/31/police-stop-and-search-riots-2011-london\">2011 riots</a>, the policy is likely to exacerbate it.</p> <p>Until 1984, police stop and search powers were exercised under the remarkably brutal <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo4/5/83/contents/enacted\">1824 Vagrancy Act</a>. Beggars, hawkers, sex workers, Gypsies and Travellers, rough sleepers and anyone \u201cnot giving a good account of himself or herself\u201d could be arrested and summarily sentenced to three months\u2019 hard labour. Astonishingly, large sections of this barbaric law <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo4/5/83/section/3\">remain in force</a> , and it is still sometimes used by the police against <a href=\"https://www.crisis.org.uk/get-involved/campaign/scrap-the-vagrancy-act/\">homeless people</a>.</p> <p>Police powers to move people on are necessary during this pandemic. But well into the first half of the 20th century, they were used as a form of social control, securing public space for \u201cthe right sort\u201d, while excluding \u201cundesirables\u201d. They were a source of great resentment in Victorian England, and commemorated in several <a href=\"http://ballads.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/static/images/sheets/20000/18834.gif\">satirical ballads</a>, various of which had the title Move on There. One song complains that \u201cswells\u201d (rich and extravagant young men) could get away with anything, while those without the means to bribe the police were \u201ccollared\u201d.</p> <p>Today, much of what looks like public space in our cities is in fact privately owned. Many of these pseudo-public spaces are patrolled by security guards, enforcing opaque rules. As a homeless man interviewed by the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jul/24/revealed-pseudo-public-space-pops-london-investigation-map\">observed</a>, most people wouldn\u2019t notice the difference between a publicly and privately owned open space. But \u201cto me, the difference is everything, because I\u2019m not the sort of person they want over there\u201d. Typically, in these places, homeless people are moved on, no music or photography is allowed, and political gatherings are banned. In some of them, the only acceptable activity appears to be spending money.</p> <p>There\u2019s an interesting parallel with urban parks in the 19th century, many of which were also then privately owned. As the historian <a href=\"http://historyofpublicspace.uk/\">Katrina Navickas documents</a>, the owners typically banned music and political meetings. The Salvation Army, then an extreme temperance movement, waged its wars against people enjoying themselves in any public places, sparking confrontations that sometimes turned violent.</p> <p>Last year, the Guardian revealed that some London housing estates were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/mar/25/too-poor-to-play-children-in-social-housing-blocked-from-communal-playground\">excluding children</a> in social housing from playgrounds used by richer residents. The developers of one estate had been granted planning permission on the grounds that its playground would be available to all, after which it replaced a gate with an impenetrable hedge to shut out the poorest residents.</p> <p>We might look for freedom in the countryside, but for centuries it has been the scene of extreme exclusion and injustice. Here, <a href=\"https://www.thelandmagazine.org.uk/articles/short-history-enclosure-britain\">enclosure</a> (the seizure of land from commoners) violently deprived many people of their liberties. The labouring poor were forbidden to live in \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bahs.org.uk/AGHR/ARTICLES/20n2a3.pdf\">close parishes</a>\u201d, where their homes were ripped down by the lords of the manor, to avoid liability for poverty relief. As a result, until the late 19th century in some places, people were crowded into filthy, dilapidated cottages sometimes an hour\u2019s walk from the fields in which they worked, for which they were charged astounding rents.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/21/coronavirus-crisis-ends-bad-for-conservatism\">No matter how this coronavirus crisis ends, it will be bad for conservatism | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Today, we have <a href=\"https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1219211665151025152.html\">no right of access to 92% of England</a>.

And so his lack of empathy is directly linked to his kind of rush to reopen the economy, which in another president\u2019s hands might seem very different.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike most national disasters, the coronavirus emergency is not a discrete event that concludes abruptly with a price tag attached for total damages, or a summary death toll.</p> <p>The coronavirus crisis is malleable, analysts said, and can be made bigger or smaller, longer or shorter, by how the White House responds, and by how the president encourages tens of millions of people to act. Epidemiological models portray how reopening the country too soon would lead to additional waves of infections, and many more deaths.</p> <p>But the message Trump delivers each day in press briefings seems to be motivated more by his quest for re-election than any fellow feeling for beleaguered Americans, said Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist.</p> <p>\u201cThe Trump people feel, and they may be right, that his re-election prospects are dependent on a thriving economy,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s imperative for his re-election that the economy open again.\u201d</p> <p>Trump often makes reference in his daily press briefings to the death toll in the US, which at about 45,000 represents about one-quarter of coronavirus deaths worldwide. But apart from some narrowly scripted remarks delivered in an uninterested monotone, Trump fails, day after day, to deliver expressions of sympathy for the loss of life, which remains on a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1250902556718649350\">grim trajectory</a>.

Instead, it involved the testing of a \u201cwell-known drug for a new purpose\u201d.</p> \n<p>The trial would involve civilian and ADF healthcare workers. It would also be entirely voluntary and require a \u201cdeliberate action\u201d by potential volunteers wanting to take part.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis requires taking action to access and read all online information, watch a video explaining the trial and to make an appointment to attend in-person for evaluation,\u201d Defence said. \u201cThey are then carefully screened against a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria.\u201d</p> \n<p>Participants would be required to fill out daily questionnaires detailing the state of their health and wellbeing, Defence said. Close monitoring would take place and participants could quit at any time.</p> \n<p>\u201cWell conducted clinical trials are needed in the global fight against Covid-19,\u201d Defence said.</p> \n<p>The US Centres for Disease Control <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/resources/pdf/fsp/drugs/chloroquine.pdf\">has described chloroquine</a> as \u201ca relatively well-tolerated medicine\u201d, which has some side-effects, including most commonly stomach pain, nausea, vomiting and headaches.</p> \n<p>Australia\u2019s drug regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, <a href=\"https://www.tga.gov.au/alert/new-restrictions-prescribing-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19\">also says the side-effects of chloroquine</a> can include headaches, skin eruptions, gastrointestinal disturbance, psoriarsis and, in rare cases, psychotic episodes, anxiety, personality change, seizures and blood disorders.</p> \n<p>The actor and singer Rita Wilson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/15/rita-wilson-tells-of-extreme-side-effects-of-experimental-covid-19-drug-chloroquine\">was given chloroquine</a> when she and her husband, Tom Hanks, tested positive for Covid-19 this year in Australia. Wilson claimed to have suffered side-effects including nausea and vertigo.</p> \n<p>Research out of the US tested the similar compound of hydroxychloroquine in veterans\u2019 hospitals. The <a href=\"https://apnews.com/a5077c7227b8eb8b0dc23423c0bbe2b2\">Associated Press reported that the study</a> \u2013 which was not rigorous or peer-reviewed \u2013 showed no benefit for Covid-19 patients. More deaths were recorded for those given hydroxychloroquine compared to those who received standard care, the study said.</p> \n<p>Assoc Prof Jane Quinn, a pharmaceuticals researcher at Charles Sturt University\u2019s school of veterinary sciences, has worked with veterans to study neuropsychiatric conditions arising from quinolone anti-malarials like mefloquine.</p> \n<p>Quinn said she was concerned that Defence\u2019s \u201cmanagement of past trials of these sorts of drugs\u201d was problematic. She said the military had traditionally been poor at obtaining informed consent for clinical trials. The drug itself, she said, was completely unproven.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s an unsubstantiated use at the present in that there has been no suggestion that you can prevent somebody from contracting Covid-19 by giving them hydroxychloroquine,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cThere\u2019s been no proof of that at all.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cSo why we would be saying that we will undertake a first trial to look into that with Defence members, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right population to even be trying to attempt that.\u201d</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Foreign_Affairs_Defence_and_Trade/Mefloquine/Report/b03\">Senate inquiry into the mefloquine and tafenoquine trials</a> said serious side-effects were rare and noted that the Defence inspector general had found some were \u201cconducted ethically and lawfully\u201d.</p> \n<p>Defence, acting on the recommendations of that inquiry, appointed an advocate for trial participants. The advocate role is designed to give ADF personnel a confidential mechanism to seek advice and support about clinical trials.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/21/elective-surgery-restart-will-allow-government-to-wind-back-support-for-private-hospitals\">Elective surgery restart will allow government to wind back support for private hospitals</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This latest trial is being conducted through the ADF\u2019s malaria and infectious diseases institute, in conjunction with the national medical countermeasures initiative at DMTC Ltd.

So often, clinical trials give preliminary results that look promising but in doing the proper larger studies you realise not only that it doesn\u2019t work, but it does more harm than good.\u201d</p>",

He said it would apply only to those seeking green cards and not temporary workers, but he did not explain how those whose applications are currently being processed would be affected.</p> \n<p>\u201cBy pausing immigration, we will help put unemployed Americans first in line for jobs as America reopens \u2013 so important,\u201d Trump told reporters at Tuesday\u2019s coronavirus taskforce briefing. \u201cIt would be wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced with new immigrant labour flown in from abroad. We must first take care of the American worker.\u201d</p> \n<p>The \u201cpause\u201d would be in effect for 60 days, he added, after which the need for an extension or alternation would be reviewed \u201cbased on economic conditions at the time\u201d. Under questioning, he confirmed that he might then decide to add a further 30 days or more.</p> \n<p>Trump said: \u201cThis order will only apply to individuals seeking a permanent residency. In other words, those receiving green cards. Big factor. It will not apply to those entering on a temporary basis ... We want to protect our US workers and I think, as we move forward, we will become more and more protective of them.\u201d</p> \n<p>The president, who has long campaigned against illegal immigration and again touted his US-Mexico border wall at Tuesday\u2019s briefing, added that the move would help conserve medical resources for US citizens.</p> \n<p>About a million people were granted green cards last year. The biggest share are family-based immigration sponsorships for permanent residency of foreign nationals by their American spouses.

In a policy white paper in June 2014, China asserted that it had \u201ccomprehensive jurisdiction\u201d over Hong Kong and in August that year, ruled that it would allow \u201cuniversal suffrage\u201d so long as it can first vet the leadership candidates. In the communique of a key Communist party meeting in November 2019, the fourth plenum, Beijing told the city to \u201cperfect\u201d its legal system to safeguard national security.</p> <p>\u201cBeijing\u2019s consistent attitude is to speed up the legislation of article 23 to bring Hong Kong under its national security network and to complete its control over Hong Kong,\u201d said Wu Qiang, a political scientist formerly with Beijing\u2019s prestigious Tsinghua University. \u201cIt is determined that Hong Kong will not become a \u2018loophole\u2019 in the nation\u2019s security.\u201d</p> <p>While the world is battling the Covid-19 pandemic, Beijing took the opportunity to crack down on Hong Kong\u2019s most respected pro-democracy leaders, analysts say.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79216f0ae030555da0c37e11be7f12591e76cd13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79216f0ae030555da0c37e11be7f12591e76cd13/180_574_5009_3005/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: China News Service/China News Service via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhile China was brought to its knees by Covid-19, [president] Xi Jinping held back from implementing the hardline on Hong Kong, but now that China has come out of it while the western democracies are on their knees and dependent on China for personal protective equipment, what better time than now to take the offensive?\u201d said Prof Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.</p> <p>\u201cBolster authoritarian control amid the pandemic \u2013 this is Beijing\u2019s thinking,\u201d said Wu.</p> <p>Analysts warn that China\u2019s repression of Hong Kong will only intensify in the near future, particularly in the run-up to the September legislature election. Some also believe China wants to pass the article 23 legislation before the election, which might see the democrats claiming a majority amid widespread discontent aimed at the government.</p> <p>\u201cAfter the immediate \u2018shock and awe\u2019 effect, Beijing will turn to the legislative council and the September election,\u201d said Kenneth Chan, political scientist at the Hong Kong Baptist University. Draconian anti-subversion laws passed under article 23 \u201cwould give the authorities new powers to persecute and purge the pro-democracy leaders and activists before the legislative council election in September,\u201d he said.</p> <p>To ensure that the outcomes of the election are controlled, Chan expected that Beijing may seek to disqualify some democrats, or cancel the election altogether and appoint a \u201cprovisional Legislative Council\u201d filled with pro-establishment figures.</p> <p>With Beijing\u2019s recent manoeuvre, it might be puzzling why China does not seem to care about throttling \u201cthe goose that lays the golden eggs\u201d. But Tsang said even though China is still dependent on Hong Kong for trade and business, its dependency has lessened markedly over the past three decades, with Hong Kong\u2019s GDP sliding from about a third the size of China\u2019s in the 1980s to less than 3% in 2019.</p> <p>\u201cThe loss of 3% of GDP would be painful but not intolerable,\u201d Tsang said of Chinese leaders\u2019 mentality. \u201cSo it is not unreasonable for Beijing to feel that \u2026 it would be a price China can pay. So, why not take a hard line now?\u201d</p> <p>London-based Hong Kong Watch points out that the Asian financial hub\u2019s value should however not be understated as it remains a gateway for western capital to reach mainland markets - it is the home to the largest number of initial public offerings by Chinese firms and the largest offshore centre for bond sales by Chinese companies.</p> <p>But as resilient as China may seem, analysts and activists warn that this is not the end of the game. Beijing-based political commentator Zhang Lifan said China\u2019s \u201cMao-era struggle mentality that wants to win at all cost\u201d may ultimately backfire.</p> <p>Joshua Wong, the 23-year-old political activist, does not believe China will succeed in intimidating Hongkongers but would instead \u201cprompt them to resist\u201d.</p> <p>If the anti-subversion law goes ahead, hundreds of thousands are expected to be up in arms again, reigniting the anti-government movement which has largely paused amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cDriving the opposition into the political wilderness serves Beijing\u2019s short-term interest, but it will embolden the opposition in civil society and attract more, not less, international attention,\u201d Chan said.</p> <p>Martin Lee, a drafter of the Basic Law, said he felt \u201cproud to walk the road of democracy with the outstanding youths in Hong Kong\u201d and his experience has only strengthened his will.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll not give up,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p>",
