  "<p>Some UK wedding venues may be breaking the law by using unfair small print to get out of refunding couples for ceremonies cancelled due to the coronavirus crisis, according to an investigation by consumer body Which?</p> <p>With the UK\u2019s wedding season normally in full swing at this time of the year, some couples who have been unable to get married because of the lockdown potentially face being left thousands of pounds out of pocket.</p> <p>Which? said couples had effectively been \u201cjilted at the altar\u201d by venues which had cancelled their big day and then pocketed their cash. One company has allegedly been imposing a cancellation fee of 80% of the total cost of the event.</p> <p>The UK competition watchdog is already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/uk-competition-watchdog-investigating-holiday-firms-refusing-refunds-airlines-complaints-covid-19\">probing the wedding sector</a> over alleged breaches of the law linked to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Now, Which? has said it believes the complaints it had also received might be \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg,\u201d and that there may be a \u201cserious, industry-wide issue with wedding venues ducking their legal responsibilities on refunds and cancellations\u201d.</p> <p>Which? said many frustrated couples had contacted it to say they were struggling to get refunds - often worth tens of thousands of pounds \u2013 from venues for nuptials that had either been cancelled or postponed in line with the government\u2019s 23 March ban on weddings.</p> <p>As well as affecting thousands of couples who were due to tie the knot during the past few weeks, the ban has also left many with a summer or autumn 2020 wedding coming up unsure about whether their event will happen as planned \u2013 or at all.</p> <p>Of the 25 couples Which? said it had spoken to, 20 said their wedding venue had refused to offer a refund, or made the process for obtaining a refund difficult. A similar number said they had not been offered like-for-like dates or offered a refund if the price for the postponed date was cheaper.</p> <p>Meanwhile, 17 couples said their venue had charged a fee to rebook or cancel their wedding, while 15 couples said their venue had introduced new terms and conditions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Which? said it was reporting 12 wedding venues and organisers to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which in late April announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/uk-watchdog-vows-to-get-tough-with-uk-firms-over-stalled-refunds\">a probe into three sectors</a> that it said were \u201cparticular areas of concern\u201d when it came to consumer rights, refunds and excessive price hikes. One of the three sectors was weddings.</p> <p>On 21 May, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/update-on-cma-covid-19-taskforce\">the CMA said</a> it had opened cases \u201cin respect of certain companies in these sectors\u201d, and that it \u201cwill not hesitate to take enforcement action\u201d if there was evidence that businesses had breached competition or consumer protection law.</p> <p>With weddings, the CMA was particularly concerned to hear that some venues were refusing to refund any money, and were telling people to claim on their insurance. </p> <p>Which? said the largest number of complaints it had received involved Bijou, a wedding venue company based in Maidenhead, Berkshire.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the couples that had booked with Bijou said the venue told them just before the government announced a ban \u2026 that not only had their weddings been cancelled, but that they were liable to pay a cancellation fee of 80% of the total cost of their weddings,\u201d said the consumer body.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/24/a-bride-a-groom-and-a-booking-but-no-big-day-yet-for-lovers-in-lockdown\">A  bride, a groom and a booking \u2026 but no big day for lovers in lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One customer, Claudia, had booked her wedding at Bijou\u2019s Botleys Mansion venue in Surrey, said Which?</p> <p>When the venue cancelled and asked for an 80% cancellation fee, it suggested she claim the money back from her insurer and use the money to rebook. But most insurers have refused to pay out for cancellations, so Claudia risked being left out of pocket and with no idea if or when she would be able to get her money back, it added.</p> <p>In a statement, Bijou said: \u201cWe understand the heartache and difficulties many couples are going through at this time. We have done, and continue to do, everything in our power to support them \u2013 offering a variety of postponement options for both later this year and for the same month next year as their original wedding, if possible.\u201d</p> <p>But it said that because of its various overheads, \u201cwe have no option other than to protect the business through our cancellation charge structure\u201d.</p> <p><br></p>",

For weeks, Downing Street had declined opportunities to substantively address questions about Cummings\u2019 adherence to lockdown instructions.</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/25/uk-coronavirus-live-boirs-johnson-dominic-cummings-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ecbe78b8f0864e579f176e5#block-5ecbe78b8f0864e579f176e5\">Cummings claimed to have driven 60 miles to test his eyesight.</a></strong> Seeking to explain his decision to drive his wife and young son to a local beauty spot from his parents\u2019 residence, where he had taken the family during the lockdown, Cummings said he was unsure his eyesight was up to the drive to London and wanted to test it out.

They are George Barnhill of the Waycross judicial district, who recommended no arrests, and Jackie Johnson of Glynn county, who has denied accusations she ordered police to make no arrests on the day the unarmed Arbery was shot.</p> <p>The Georgia chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Georgia_NAACP/status/1264613391693418496\">called on both Barnhill and Johnson to resign</a> and face charges of obstruction of justice.</p> <p>Merritt said the FBI was also looking into the actions of the Glynn county police department.</p> <p>The suspects Gregory McMichael, 64, and his son Travis, 34, were finally arrested by the Georgia bureau of investigation (GBI) and charged with Arbery\u2019s murder on 8 May, three days after the video received national publicity, and 74 days after the shooting.</p> <p>The case took a further step forward last Thursday, when the GBI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/21/ahmaud-arbery-william-bryan-killing-filmed-arrest\">arrested the man who recorded the video</a>, William Bryan Jr, and charged him with felony murder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a377e1670516c9e69e5289ae59e14ac18219c0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a377e1670516c9e69e5289ae59e14ac18219c0f/0_0_4060_2707/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On 16 May, Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s aunt Theawanza Brooks, center left, joins other family members and supporters in a march from the Glynn county courthouse to a police station.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On 16 May, Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s aunt Theawanza Brooks, center left, joins other family members and supporters in a march from the Glynn county courthouse to a police station.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen B Morton/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is a vast conspiracy at this point,\u201d Merritt said in a four-and-a-half-minute <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2020/05/25/ahmaud-arbery-family-lawyer-says-d-a-s-cops-criminally-investigated-by-fbi/\">video posted</a> on Monday on TMZ. \u201cThey\u2019re spreading the net here. They said the GBI doesn\u2019t anticipate making any additional arrests, but the FBI very well may.\u201d</p> <p>Merritt has been highly critical of the pace of the investigation into the shooting. He said he was told a further part of the FBI probe was whether the actions of anybody involved in the case breached Arbery\u2019s rights of equal protection under the US constitution and civil rights law.</p> <p>\u201cAll citizens are entitled to the same protection under the law,\u201d he said. \u201cThis case makes it clear that all black citizens in south Georgia aren\u2019t getting the same protection because if you shoot anybody in the street in broad daylight, just in general you expect at least an arrest. There were no arrests made.\u201d</p> <p>Neither the Department of Justice nor the US attorney\u2019s office for the southern district of Georgia responded to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment on Monday, a federal holiday.</p> <p>But in an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KerriKupecDOJ/status/1259873661995094017\">11 May statement</a>, a DOJ representative, Kerri Kupec, confirmed investigators were assessing evidence \u201cto determine if federal hate crime charges are appropriate\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/ahmaud-arbery-merritt-criminalization-of-blackness\">'Criminalization of blackness': Arbery lawyer weighs in on 2017 Taser incident</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gregory McMichael, a former law enforcement officer, told detectives he suspected Arbery of burglary, and that Arbery had attacked his son before being shot. Police initially treated the shooting as a case of self-defense and allowed the McMichaels to go free, despite the video of the shooting suggesting a different story.</p> <p> \u2022 This article was amended on 26 May 2020 because an earlier version misnamed Lee Merritt as Lee Martin.

  "<p>Dominic Cummings\u2019 usual place at Downing Street press conferences is lurking at the back in a scruffy T-shirt, glaring. So seeing him \u2013 the \u00e9minence grise, the backroom guy \u2013 in clean-looking shirt sleeves in the sunny No 10 garden, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/i-think-i-behaved-reasonably-dominic-cummings-defends-actions-in-lockdown-row\">addressing the cameras</a>, with his boss the prime minister nowhere to be seen, was an extraordinary inversion of the norm. And it didn\u2019t get any less strange.</p> \n<p>In his day job as Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Cummings prides himself on wrong-footing opponents by never making the obvious, straightforward next move. Monday\u2019s bank holiday press conference suggested he applies the same approach to family life.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-says-he-drove-to-barnard-castle-to-test-his-eyesight-video\">His justification</a> for driving the 250-odd miles to self-isolate in a cottage in the grounds of his parents\u2019 property was so complex it might have helped if he had had a whiteboard to sketch it out on.</p> \n<p>His wife was ill, and he too might well have contracted coronavirus, but at the same time he was indispensable to the fight against the virus and wanted to go back to Downing Street. He was concerned that his London home was a potential target, not that it stopped him driving the family back to it the moment he was given the green light to do so. And his 17- and 20-year-old nieces were clearly the best choice for emergency childcare, despite living halfway across the country.</p> \n<p>As for the half-hour jaunt to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/second-witness-asks-police-investigate-dominic-cummings\">local beauty spot Barnard Castle</a>, it was merely a way to check whether he was up to the journey back to the capital. \u201cWe just thought, let\u2019s whizz down the road and see how I feel.\u201d The woods he was spotted strolling in on another occasion belonged to his parents.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fea0e7f5-409c-4cc2-82aa-6ebdb41aed88\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UD-TwHQDDgo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In some aspects at least, the statement was a demonstration of Cummings\u2019 mastery of communications. His demeanour was subdued and respectful, which must have taken a considerable effort since his contempt for \u201cWestminster bubble\u201d journalists, several of whom were eyeballing him, is legendary.</p> \n<p>He and his No 10 colleagues will have been hoping the public would watch him laying out the events of those undoubtedly difficult days \u2013 during which his son was hospitalised and Cummings himself suffered a severe bout of the virus \u2013 and feel sympathy and understanding for his plight.</p> \n<p>They will also have been counting on the public\u2019s dislike and suspicion of journalists.</p> \n<p>Lobby hacks have been beamed into press conferences from their book-lined spare bedrooms since the onset of the crisis: but on Monday they were invited along to stand up as Cummings the devoted father delivered his statement not from a podium (of which No 10 has plenty), but seated at a modest folding table.</p> \n<p>The intention appeared to be to shift the power balance, making Cummings appear more humble and the journalists prurient and bossy.</p> \n<p>In order to sympathise, though, the public will have had to find Cummings\u2019 actions in that torrid period comprehensible.</p> \n<p>That might have been made easier if he had felt able to admit that his decision to hit the motorway was, with hindsight, a bit rash. But apparently he still thinks it was perfectly reasonable, as was the quixotic test-run to Barnard Castle at a time when the public were allowing their children a quick turn round the local park at best.</p> \n<p>Perhaps it might have helped, too, if he had admitted, when asked by Jason Groves of the Daily Mail if he had driven a coach and horses through the spirit of the coronavirus regulations, that he might have stretched them a bit.</p> \n<p>Instead, he leant on the get-out clause about those caring for children, saying: \u201cThe guidance doesn\u2019t say you\u2019ve just got to sit there\u201d. Many thousands of parents who came down with Covid-19 and thought \u201cstay home\u201d meant exactly that may feel they have been taken for mugs.</p> \n<p>It might also have been easier for viewers to walk in Cummings\u2019 shoes had the story not been peppered with reminders of his privilege. It\u2019s not his fault, of course, but few families will have had the option of a handy self-isolation cottage on their parents\u2019 estate, with woods on site for pleasant walks while convalescing (and many might have thought it was wrong to hare across the country to get there, even if they did).</p> \n<p>Johnson has already shown that he is determined to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/boris-johnsons-support-for-dominic-cummings-is-a-slap-in-the-face-for-us\">stick by his right-hand man</a>.

  "<p>The crisis that has engulfed the government over Dominic Cummings\u2019 conduct continued to rage unabated after an unprecedented press conference in which the prime minister\u2019s chief aide repeatedly refused to resign or apologise for breaking lockdown rules.</p> \n<p>After an outpouring of public anger rattled No 10, he attempted to explain why he drove 264 miles from London to his parents\u2019 estate in Durham despite suspecting that both he and his wife had coronavirus.</p> \n<p>No 10 had hoped the move would draw a line under fury about Cummings\u2019 behaviour after at least 20 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/fury-and-frustration-among-tory-mps-as-cummings-fights-on\">Tory MPs called for him to quit</a> and senior scientists accused him of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-durham-test-and-trace-coronavirus-self-isolate\">undermining public health advice</a>.</p> \n<p>But his appearance in the Rose Garden of No 10 raised yet more questions after Cummings admitted he had suspected both he and his wife had coronavirus when they made the decision to travel across the country with their son.</p> \n<p>During the lengthy press conference, Cummings claimed he drove to Durham because he needed possible back-up childcare from his teenage niece.

It is now beyond doubt Dominic Cummings broke multiple lockdown rules.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>If the British establishment has one signature ethos it is: \u201cOne rule for us and another for everybody else.\u201d It is this that caused national rage during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/may/11/mps-expenses-best-and-worst\">politicians\u2019 expenses scandal</a>, when millions saw MPs making absurd and frivolous claims \u2013 for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/may/23/mps-expenses-conservatives\">duck islands</a>, second homes, swimming pool boilers \u2013 at the taxpayers\u2019 expense, knowing that they, on far smaller salaries, would be sacked for gross misconduct for far less opulent claims at work. It is this, too, which fuels anger over tax avoidance, when the well-to-do defy the spirit rather than the letter of the law in ways that are impermissible except for the gilded few.</p> <p>Dominic Cummings has applied this same establishment mantra, but in the midst of a national emergency, which has killed tens of thousands and restricted the movements of millions more. Many have had to endure sacrifices greater than they have ever faced.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He needed to drive 30 minutes to a beauty spot to test his eyesight, which he coincidentally did on his wife\u2019s birthday</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Here is just one sacrifice. A woman from the north-east of England tells me of how she decided to stay locked down in London, missing the last two weeks of her father\u2019s life. When she attended her beloved dad\u2019s funeral just miles from where Cummings was staying \u2013 limited numbers, two metres\u2019 social distancing, no physical comforting \u2013 the family were told that police would be on standby at the crematorium \u201cand would act if we breached the guidelines\u201d. As she puts it: \u201cLet\u2019s not forget, most \u2018normal\u2019 people do not get a press conference. They get a fine.\u201d</p> <p>Cummings made his mark as the man who invented the now infamous \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d, and reportedly applied this same comms ingenuity to the government\u2019s initial clear and striking instruction: \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1264465860237889538?s=20\">Stay home</a>\u201d. Tonight, his media strategy struck a different path. First, blame the media for misleading the public. He repeatedly claimed that it was understandable for the public to be angry if they had relied on media reports: but these were outright wrong. Here was brazen crybullying from a man whose chief political enterprises \u2013 Vote Leave and the Conservative election campaign \u2013 relied on the zealous support of the rightwing press, which had no qualms in monstering his opponents. Second, bog down his critics in convoluted details to muddy the water and hope boredom sets in as each claim is dissected and contested.</p> <p>The claims themselves are indeed contradictory and full of bizarre logical leaps. <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/dominic-cummings-statement-speech-transcript-durham-full-text-read-lockdown-a9531856.html\">Cummings said</a> his wife was ill and showing signs of Covid-19 and his decision to seek childcare was motivated by the fact he might catch it, so it\u2019s not clear how driving across the country with a potentially infectious person fits with the rules.</p> <p>The fact his child was hospitalised in Durham during their stay underlines why the rules are there in the first place. Their son tested negative, but they did not know this when he was admitted. At the time, infections were much lower there than in London. If potentially infected people from the hotspot of the pandemic travel across the country, they risk seeding the virus in hospitals and allowing a deadly illness to spread to vulnerable patients.</p> <p>The rest of Cummings\u2019 contortions were a straightforward insult to sense, reason and public intelligence. He needed to drive about 30 minutes to a beauty spot to test his eyesight to make sure it was safe to drive back to London \u2013 which he coincidentally did on his wife\u2019s birthday, with both her and their little child in the car.</p> <p>The explanation why his wife <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/getting-coronavirus-does-not-bring-clarity\">wrote an article</a> for the Spectator detailing their life in lockdown (to which he said he contributed \u201cjust a few lines\u201d), while failing to mention details of their sojourn makes little sense. He claimed that revealing his whereabouts would risk his parents\u2019 safety as his Islington home in London was already being targeted due to media misinformation about his role in implementing lockdown. If he believed he had been placed at risk because of his public profile and because personal details are in the public domain, then why write such an article at all? And why, if all of this was above board, the refusal to answer questions posed by journalists about his whereabouts for weeks?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/i-think-i-behaved-reasonably-dominic-cummings-defends-actions-in-lockdown-row\">\u2018I think I behaved reasonably\u2019: Dominic Cummings defends actions in lockdown row</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This isn\u2019t about breaking the law and \u2013 except in some strikingly egregious examples \u2013 neither was the expenses scandal. It is that when millions of people are making unprecedented sacrifices, when many of their lives are already stressful and difficult as it is, they expect those rules to be followed by everybody. After all, they are enduring this pain for the common good.</p> <p>And above all else, they expect those in power, who are responsible for implementing and enforcing the necessarily punitive rules, to abide by them too. A parent being stricken with coronavirus with a child to care for is not exceptional in a pandemic \u2013 indeed, there are lone carers in that situation who have it far tougher. Many of those have stuck by the rules and undoubtedly struggled to care for their family as they did so. But they did it. All we have learned from Cummings\u2019 performance is he broke the rules and believes that his exceptional circumstances \u2013 particularly his important role in government \u2013 excuse this. One rule for him, one rule for everyone else.</p> <p>Cummings\u2019 defenders make ludicrous and self-discrediting claims that this is akin to a <a href=\"https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/18472301.dominic-cummings-coronavirus-lockdown-story-media-witch-hunt-says-liam-walker/\">witch-hunt</a>. Any attempt to preserve one of the most influential figures in the country from scrutiny by bestowing victimhood on him must be resisted. Cummings broke his own rules; everything else is noise, and a public health strategy that exists to preserve human life has been undermined.</p> <p>The reasons for the government\u2019s current panic are obvious. Boris Johnson does not believe he can survive without Cummings, not least as the collective sense of loyalty in a crisis wears off, and scrutiny intensifies over how a delayed lockdown and a failure of testing and lack of personal protective equipment led to Europe\u2019s worst death toll. But a government that stirred the pot of a populist culture war, claiming to be on the side of the little guy against an out-of-touch, contemptuous Islington elite now has to face facts: this elite now has a face, and it is that of Dominic Cummings.</p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p>",

  "<p>Classic Dom: Downing Street\u2019s very own Prince Andrew. Show how much respect you have for the public and the media by turning up 30 minutes late for your own gig. There again, start as you mean to go on.

How the rules applied differently to him than to the little people.</p> <p>On Sunday we had Boris Johnson, the understudy prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/no-dignity-no-future-boris-forsakes-leadership-to-protect-cummings\">try and fail to convince the country that there had been nothing untoward</a> about Cummings\u2019 trip to Durham. A midnight flit that had been so normal that Downing Street had spent the best part of six weeks trying to cover it up.</p> <p>Now we were to get the full story \u2013 or what approximated to it \u2013 from the person who is really running the country. And what we were treated to was an hour-long confused ramble that was disguised as the martyrdom of St Dom. A man who had only ever acted in the best interests of his family and the country. A man more sinned against than sinning.</p> <p>\u201cHi there,\u201d he said, when he eventually turned up after a half-hour row with his wife over whether he really needed to change out of his hoodie and put on a shirt. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late.\u201d</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t of course. Dom is never sorry about anything, but that was the closest we were going to get to any form of apology for having driven 260 miles to Durham to self-isolate on his parents\u2019 estate, when the rest of the country were obeying the letter of the law, that he had helped write, by staying at home.</p> <p>Much of what Dom had to say made little sense. His wife had initially been ill, but he had broken with his own health guidelines by going into work the following day. He had then decided to exploit a loophole involving young children that had never been intended to apply to families in his position and drive to Durham.</p> <p>And no, he hadn\u2019t bothered to get any medical advice or tell Boris what he was planning on doing. Because he was the Special One \u2013 the real prime minister \u2013 so there was no need. Indeed he might only have told Boris where he was a week later and by then they were both so ill that they conveniently forgot about the conversation until the Guardian and the Mirror rudely reminded them.</p> <p>That was just the start though. His car had had a full tank of petrol \u2013 nice touch \u2013 and his son who couldn\u2019t last a 30-minute drive to Barnard Castle without stopping for a pee had proved iron-bladdered for the entire six-hour journey north. Once in Durham, both Dom and his wife Mary had been ill with coronavirus. They had only broken lockdown once by nipping out to the local hospital because their son was unwell, and had self-isolated for the full 14 days.</p> <p>Then on the 15th day, St Dom had risen again. And although, he was still feeling shit he felt ready to go back to London to start running the country again. There was just one small problem. His vision was playing up. So the obvious way to see if he was safe to drive was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/second-witness-asks-police-investigate-dominic-cummings\">to pack his family into the car and take a 30-mile journey to Barnard Castle</a>.</p> <p>Not sure if that\u2019s quite in the DVLA guidelines. There they had stopped and sat by the river for a bit \u2013 their entire conversation had been focused on the state of his eyesight \u2013 before heading off back to Durham for a walk in his private bluebell wood.</p> <p>All this was said in a state of barely repressed anger. This statement was costing Dom dear. Classic Dom never explains and never apologises. And even though not a word of apology escaped his lips, you could sense that this whole exercise felt uncomfortably close to one. Just having to appear in front of journalists for whom he felt nothing but contempt and pretend to be Mr Polite Nice Guy was a humiliation he couldn\u2019t bear.</p> <p>Once the questions started, the mask began to crack. He was just doing what anyone else would have done in the same exceptional circumstances. Except they hadn\u2019t been doing that. People in far more testing situations without the comfort of a second home 260 miles away had obeyed the guidelines. Because they were mugs. The proles who weren\u2019t able to think for themselves. If he had a fault, it was that he was just too loving and law-abiding a father. Regrets, he had a few. But then again, too few to mention.</p> <p>Time and again he was asked to apologise and every time he refused. Anything but that. Everything was totally above board, which is why he and his wife had both written stories in the Spectator that they knew to be misleading. Perhaps he and Mary had both been so delirious, it had slipped their minds to point out they hadn\u2019t been in London.</p> <p>Then he went full-on Trump. Everything that had been written about him was completely Fake News. Apart from everything in the Guardian and the Mirror, which he had as good as corroborated.</p> <p>Had he thought of offering his resignation? A dismissive shrug. Who was he going to offer it to? Himself? There was no point in offering it to Boris because why would you ask your understudy? Just remember who worked for whom here.</p> <p>It ended in a standoff. If Dom had imagined this press conference would clear the air, then he had misjudged the mood of the nation just as he had by pleading for his own exceptionalism.</p> <p>There was also a deep irony that a man whose entire political reputation had been founded on the simplicity of his messaging was now pleading for his career on the basis that life was complicated. He even concluded by saying there was no point in answering some questions because the answers could be more confusing. So the journos could get lost.</p> <p>There was to be no redemption for Laughing Boy. His presser may have satisfied a few of the Boris faithful, but the majority of the country could only see a man who had chosen to break the rules and had \u2013 worse still \u2013 put the nation\u2019s health at risk by effectively telling everyone they could interpret the rules however they wanted.</p> <p>Not that Dom would have cared that much. What would have hurt the most was that he had been seen for who he really was. A man who can turn any hint of regret into a giant \u201cfuck you\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 May 2020.

  "<p>The mystery of why glass frogs have see-through skin has been solved, scientists say: the unusual feature is a type of camouflage.</p> <p>Glass frogs are found in tropical Central and South America, and get their name from their skin.</p> <p>However, the frogs are not truly transparent but translucent, with the skin on their backs typically a vivid green and their intestines and heart visible through their underbelly. This has led to a question that has kept scientists on the hop.</p> <p>\u201cIf predators cannot see straight though the frogs, why do glass frogs have transparent skin at all, and not the opaque camouflaged patterns of other tree frog species?\u201d said Dr James Barnett, a postdoctoral researcher at McMaster University, Canada, who co-authored the study.</p> <p>Barnett and colleagues say they have cracked the conundrum. \u201cThe frog is always green to generally match leaves, but leaves will differ in their brightness,\u201d said Barnett. The team say that while the colour of the frog\u2019s body changes little against dark or light foliage, the legs are more translucent and hence shift in brightness, helping the amphibians to blend in.</p> <p>\u201cBy having translucent legs and resting with the legs surrounding the body, the frog\u2019s edge is transformed into a softer, less contrasting gradient from the leaf to the legs, and again from the legs to the body,\u201d said Barnett, noting that this makes the frog\u2019s outline less recognisable to predators.</p> <p>Writing in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Barnett and colleagues report how they carried out three experiments.</p> <p>In the first, they photographed 55 glass frogs both on leaves and on a white background and then used computer models to compare the colour of the frog in each scenario. \u201cWe found that the colour of the frogs\u2019 bodies did not change much between backgrounds, but the legs did change significantly,\u201d said Barnett, adding that the change was down to a shift in brightness, not hue.</p> <p>The results were the same when they modelled how different species may see these frogs, including a snake, a bird and a human. \u201cThe camouflaging effect is interpreted in a similar manner between humans and the frogs\u2019 natural predators,\u201d said Barnett.</p> <p>The team then produced computer-generated images of glass frogs with different patterns of translucency against leafy backgrounds. Twenty people were each presented with 125 such images and asked to point out the frog as quickly as possible. The team found participants were quicker to spot the frog when it was fully opaque compared with frogs with a natural pattern of translucency.</p> <p>Finally, the team made 180 translucent and 180 opaque frogs out of gelatine and put them in vegetation in Ecuador, monitoring over the course of 72 hours whether the frogs were attacked by birds. Overall, 53 opaque and 24 translucent frogs were eaten during the experiment.</p> <p>\u201cOur study shows that being translucent does help glass frogs camouflage themselves from predators, but not necessarily in the way expected by comparison to fully transparent species,\u201d said Barnett.</p> <p>Prof Devi Stuart-Fox, an expert on animalcolour and behaviour at the University of Melbourne, who was not involved in the research, said: \u201cThis is a fascinating study because it shows yet another form of camouflage in animal \u2013 the sheer diversity of camouflage strategies in nature is truly remarkable.\u201d</p> <p>Stuart-Fox said all three of the experiments had limitations, but taken together the evidence was compelling that the frogs\u2019 translucency is a form of camouflage.</p> <p>\u201cInterestingly, the legs are more translucent than the body, making the edges of the body harder to distinguish,\u201d she said. \u201cPredators form a search image for the shape of their prey, so masking the body\u2019s outline is a very effective strategy to enhance camouflage.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><em>History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.</em></p> <p>Back in the early days of the Covid-19 lockdown there was a tendency to talk, hopefully, about the many opportunities for self-improvement confinement would provide. One suggestion was that people would start reading James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses, the most brilliant, and brilliantly difficult, novel of the 20th century.</p> <p>So how did that work out? Anyone get past \u201cfluttering his winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury\u2019s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries\u201d before collapsing into the sofa cushions, overcome by the urge to read Tintin in America?</p> <p>The big thing about Ulysses \u2013 other than being more difficult to engage with than, say, Friends \u2013 is that it\u2019s about everything. Joyce presents the entire human condition in a stream of consciousness, the streets of Dublin as a microcosm of the universe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/07/world-cup-questions-zinedine-zidane-head-butt-2006-berlin-france-italy-marco-materazzi\">World Cup questions: what did Zidane's head-butt in Berlin mean? | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Which is all very well, but after six weeks of brain freeze even glancing at its pages is likely to produce feelings similar to being stabbed through the eye with a knitting needle dipped in industrial glue.</p> <p>No matter, though. It turns out there are less punishing ways to see a world in a grain of sand. You don\u2019t need Ulysses to find a sense of deeper meaning in these sport-free times. Thankfully we also have the online Fifa World Cup archive, Saint\u2011\u00c9tienne 1998, and England versus Argentina.</p> <p>What a game this was. Watching it back without the brainswipe of empire-sad Angledribble flagwave (cod-Joyce translation: \u201cwithout watching it as a fan\u201d) two things are immediately clear.</p> <p>First, this is surely one of the great World Cup last-16 matches. And second, it feels as if it is something much bigger, an occasion that manages to tease an entire potted history of England-football-versus-the-world from a two-and-a-half-hour knockout game.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is a very good England team. It's a team packed with creativity; perhaps, as it turns out, recklessly so</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s all there in the details: from hope, to dashed hope, to celebrity obsession, to the tactical culture wars that circled English football through the 20th century. In its own way Saint\u2011\u00c9tienne is a kind of footballing Ulysses. Only a much easier one. With Michael Owen and Ariel Ortega in it. And with some really, really good goals.</p> <p>It is also an uplifting occasion. It is tempting at times to view the entire backstory of England football\u2019s engagements with the outside world as a place shrouded in pre-enlightenment gloom, inhabited by blockheads and blazered fools. But, of course, it wasn\u2019t always like this.</p> <p>Those years from Euro 96 to France 98 were a notably fun, frisky interlude, a time of progressive leadership under Terry Venables and Glenn Hoddle, staffed by a really fine crop of early Premiership players.</p> <p>Hoddle\u2019s squad for France 98 was drawn from 11 clubs. It contained 12 players with fewer than 20 caps, six aged 23 or under. His four strikers were Alan Shearer, Michael Owen, Teddy Sheringham and Les Ferdinand, which meant Hoddle could afford to omit two of the Premier League\u2019s joint top-scorers that season, Dion Dublin and Chris Sutton (Owen being the third).</p> <p>Also left out was Andy Cole, a hammer of the Champions League the following year. Robbie Fowler and Ian Wright were injured (Wright appears in the Fifa film wrapped in a flag in the stands). Matt Le Tissier and Stan Collymore had been tried and discarded.</p> <p>This is a story of talent \u2013 England had a glut of it \u2013 and the way those small sporting variables, from elements of chance to mistakes magnified by pressure, end up framing the way the tale is told.</p> <p>In the Fifa film Saint-\u00c9tienne looks beautiful as the teams walk out, a mix of lurid green and deep blue. England are in brilliant white. The hills in the background peep in over the lip of the stand. The equally beautiful David Beckham is also present, seen here in his pre-modern puppyish blond fop stage. The camera seems to swoon as it frames him in the centre circle, back-lit by the evening sun, a 23-year-old still at the start of his own extraordinary fast-forward trip through the popular culture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4288d502f9a40051208dbdc123c72ab90789a694\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4288d502f9a40051208dbdc123c72ab90789a694/0_3_2244_1347/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England fans wait for kick-off in Saint-\u00c9tienne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England fans wait for kick-off in Saint-\u00c9tienne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Doug Pensinger/Allsport/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We get a pan of the England bench as the game kicks off: teenage Rio Ferdinand, eager-looking Gareth Southgate, Paul Merson japing and laughing. Unless specifically stated otherwise, it is safe to assume that during the hours that follow Merson is always japing and laughing, that this is a continuous state of being.</p> <p>England lost to Romania in the group stage but progressed thanks to a 2-0 defeat of Colombia. Here they start in a 3-5-2 with Darren Anderton and Graeme Le Saux as wing-backs, and a central three of Paul Ince, Paul Scholes and Beckham. Sol Campbell, Tony Adams and Gary Neville is the back three. Shearer and Owen up front. This is a very good England team. It\u2019s also a team packed with creativity; perhaps, as it turns out, recklessly so.</p> <p>But then this was a World Cup stuffed full of brilliant footballers. The reward for victory in Saint-\u00c9tienne would be a quarter-final against the Netherlands (Bergkamp, Davids, Seedorf), who had beaten Yugoslavia (Mijatovic, Stojkovic, Savicevic) the night before in Toulouse.</p> <p>Argentina were without Fernando Redondo, discarded by Daniel Passarella partly under the \u201cno long hair\u201d rule (also banned: homosexuality and earrings). But they came to the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard having beaten Japan, Jamaica and Croatia without conceding a goal, with Gabriel Batistuta already on four for the tournament, and with Ortega, Juan Ver\u00f3n, Javier Zanetti and Hern\u00e1n Crespo to follow.</p> <p>Ortega starts the game at the tip of a midfield diamond, with Claudio L\u00f3pez close by as a roving No 10. From the early moments Argentina\u2019s game is all depth and layers and short vertical passes, looking to find space between England\u2019s more rigid lines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dd8164474bf07cdc1c1fe007b8bfd09ed6ff63f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd8164474bf07cdc1c1fe007b8bfd09ed6ff63f3/0_249_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Seaman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Seaman watches as Gabriel Batistuta\u2019s sixth-minute penalty goes into the net.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Doyle/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a hard, fast opening, Beckham and Scholes pressing manically to fill the holes. Ver\u00f3n and Zanetti are striding about the pitch like a pair of polo\u2011playing dukes. Campbell intercepts at full stretch and you remember what a magnificently assured, pure defender he was even in those early years.</p> <p>England should score two minutes in. Batistuta gives the ball to Owen, who turns and runs into space. The ball breaks. Le Saux drives in a low cross just too deep for Shearer\u2019s lunge. For a few seconds the way Owen moved in that moment just sort of hangs there, like a glitch or a fluke. Did that really happen?</p> <p>Then from nowhere Argentina have a penalty. David Seaman rushes out to intercept a diagonal pass. Diego Simeone nicks the ball away, waits for Seaman\u2019s lunge, then falls over him. Adams does his bespoke double-handed diving gesture, but he\u2019s wrong. This was just clever play. Seaman looks crestfallen.</p> <p>Shearer makes a token effort to walk across Batistuta\u2019s eyeline as he spots the kick, but the shot is low and hard enough to bounce in off Seaman\u2019s hand. Argentina are 1-0 up with five minutes gone.</p> <p>***</p> <p><em>Beware the horns of a bull, the heels of the horse, and the smile of an Englishman</em>.</p> <p>England react like an England team react, running about with great energy, Ince snapping into challenges, Beckham trying to force the game. Almost immediately they find a way back, made by a poor pass from Ver\u00f3n. The ball bounces awkwardly, Ver\u00f3n and Nelson Vivas run forward into the same space. Scholes spots the mistake and heads the ball cleverly in behind them.</p> <p>And there it is: Owen in open ground, apparently operating to an entirely separate set of physical rules. Roberto Ayala tries to intercept, arms behind him, but he looks terrified of this kid, this white-shirted blur. Owen goes down in the area. Penalty.</p> <p>On the bench Hoddle leaps up and punches the air, splendidly turned out in a bright red polo shirt and baggy blue trousers. Simeone annoys Ince, stamping across the area as Shearer waits to take the kick.</p> <p>Shearer doesn\u2019t flinch. He smashes the ball past Carlos Roa and into the top corner, a nerveless, brilliant penalty kick. It\u2019s 1-1 and for a moment the air looks too heavy to breathe. The England end is bouncing and tumbling, damp with sweat and evening dew.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"63d06aa94151fb19e5132a1ea87970919eda22b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63d06aa94151fb19e5132a1ea87970919eda22b0/33_0_1373_965/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Shearer snacks his penalty past Argentina keeper Carlos Roa. to level the scores.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Shearer snacks his penalty past Argentina keeper Carlos Roa. to level the scores.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ted Blackbrow/Daily Mail/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But nothing feels settled, and for a while Argentina just keep the ball, giving us a moment of familiar England tournament stasis, the white shirts chasing deep in their own half, unable to get anywhere near Ortega as he takes the ball on the half turn.</p> <p>Paradoxically it is this period of possession, the white shirts shrinking back, that creates the outstanding moment of England\u2019s World Cup. With 15 minutes gone Beckham takes the ball under pressure and plays an instant pass to Owen in the centre circle. He takes the ball with a bravura flick of the heel, already on the move. And he\u2019s off now, heading towards his own little vision of the sublime.</p> <p>Owen has at times seemed a remote figure in the years since. He has been accused of lacking a certain sense of wonder in his musings as a pundit. But imagine how it feels to have lived this sporting life. Owen has said he knew, or felt, or was told as a teenager that he was already the best player his age in the world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Owen runs with arms wide, grabbing the night into his chest. This is what he was born to do. Freeze that frame for ever</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It sounds an odd thing to say. But Owen is simply being honest. Aged 18 he saw the whole of the moon. At that moment, with Jos\u00e9 Chamot at his back and the World Cup bending to his will, Owen already knows what\u2019s about to happen next.</p> <p>He runs away from Chamot without breaking into a full sprint, keeping some gas for the next obstacle, which should be Ayala.

He doesn\u2019t have to hurdle Ayala, who never even gets close. Scholes has appeared in Owen\u2019s peripheral vision by now. He ignores him, takes three high-speed steps and spanks the ball past Roa\u2019s arm and into the far top corner of the net.</p> <p>It\u2019s a moment of jaw-drop, of dead air. Owen runs past the Argentina end, arms wide, grabbing the night into his chest, cresting the perfect high. This is what he was born to do. Freeze that frame for ever.</p> <p>***</p> <p><em>We walk through meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves.</em></p> <p>Cut to the England bench and Merson is standing up shouting: \u201cWhata farkin goal!\u201d The England players hug Owen tenderly, reverently, as though aware of their own status as guests in this moment.</p> <p>And once again we have an echo of The Whole Story, another of those Ulysses interludes. This isn\u2019t just Peak Owen. It is arguably the greatest moment English football generated through the 1990s.

Here is a teenage footballer of boundless possibilities, a snapshot in time ready to explode with wealth and promise. Zoom out and Owen in Saint-\u00c9tienne speaks to a domestic league in a state of voracious transformation, a nation entering its own plastic boom times, football poised to assail and overwhelm every other aspect of popular culture. Did it get any better than this?</p> <p>All of which raises the more instant question. England are 2-1 up. They have a weapon Argentina can\u2019t contain. They will end up playing 70 minutes with 10 men. But that should also be a stage for a player who is literally too fast, too direct to contain on the break. Why didn\u2019t they win this game? Why didn\u2019t they at least score another goal?</p> <p>The obvious answer is that Argentina play Owen well from here. They do something un-English. Players begin to adapt mid-game, to read the situation. The blue shirts follow Owen when he comes deep, making him play facing his own goal.</p> <p>When Owen does get the ball in space, around the half-hour, Chamot backs away just a little, keeping his body in line, forcing Owen to his left instead. From there the shot is scuffed wide. This is all information. We know your strength. Now we have a weaker side too.</p> <p>By contrast Ince, Beckham and Scholes never really get to grips with Ortega, who is also playing brilliantly, slipping into awkward spaces, dribbling like a blue-shirted ghost. With 23 minutes gone Ortega runs across the midfield from left to right. Adams comes out to intercept but just goes sailing by like a steamship as Ortega slips the ball between his legs. No hard tactical response is offered to this threat. Adams and Campbell will simply defend heroically for the rest of this game. But they will always be playing to their limits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efeb7f223fd556f2dfe3cf47fd8b89465bbeab99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efeb7f223fd556f2dfe3cf47fd8b89465bbeab99/0_0_1799_1563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ariel Ortega\" width=\"1000\" height=\"869\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ariel Ortega was a handful for England\u2019s midfield with his brilliant dribbling and awareness of space.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Probst/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another historic problem. For all their midfield talent England have nothing like Ver\u00f3n, a player happy to hold the ball, to rev or drop the throttle at any time. Instead England come at Argentina in square-drilled patterns and always at the same speed.</p> <p>An essay could be written here on the misuse of Scholes, with an accompanying response on the over-egging of the alleged misuse of Scholes, a balm for every other falling-short. But you can see it in Saint-\u00c9tienne.</p> <p>Scholes is trying to be three midfielders in one. He bombs forward, almost putting England 3-1 up, but screaming to himself as he watches his shot go wide. Scholes is also required to defend (there\u2019s one full-bodied collision with Simeone: both men just get up and play on). He also has the Ver\u00f3n-style capacity to pass and keep the ball too, which he does, but not enough.</p> <p>At times Scholes looks exhausted in that first half. Talent is being wasted in front of our eyes, overstretched by a confusion of roles.</p> <p>Ortega, meanwhile, is free to float and create, and England are holding on as we enter stoppage time. Argentina are awarded a free\u2011kick. Batistuta shapes to shoot as he has once already. The wall creeps forward, a little comically, but leaving space behind it, into which Zanetti wanders untracked.</p> <p>Ver\u00f3n\u2019s nudged free-kick is perfectly weighted. Zanetti shoots powerfully into the top corner, a wonderful piece of improvised execution. And almost immediately the players are off. The score is 2-2. Argentina have been the better team. England have the tools to win this game, but the flow of their attacks has been disrupted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Would a more ruthless, more experienced manager have replaced Beckham with David Batty at half\u2011time? England desperately need to shut down Ortega. Beckham is having a poor game. Ver\u00f3n is reading his angles, his habit of dropping off, spinning and playing diagonal passes.</p> <p>Ince and Batty is a stronger shield in exactly the place England are being hurt. Later Argentina will play with two No 10s as Marcelo Gallardo comes on. Batty will come on and shut that space down effectively. This is all hindsight. But it is also there in the pattern of the game. Hoddle will have seen it.</p> <p>Instead, we have The Event. Moments after the restart Beckham is off the field and Saint-\u00c9tienne is providing another big fat note, another wormhole into the complete Joycean history of modern-day England football.</p> <p>Simeone fouls Beckham, going through the back of him just over the halfway line. He decides to get full value for the imminent yellow card, pressing down with his hand as he levers himself up. Beckham almost lets it go. Instead he kicks out. Simeone falls backwards.</p> <p>Cue uproar from the blue shirts, and a moment of eerie calm as the Danish referee Kim Milton Nielsen walks around for a bit, then dolefully produces his red card. Beckham walks off without complaint.</p> <p>The decision is entirely correct. Beckham has simply been outsmarted by the 28-year-old captain of Argentina, a player who has been in Europe for six years at three different clubs, who is an absolute hard-nosed warrior of this kind of thing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"87aff63d05a803aa6097866d0d571d3932cbef78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87aff63d05a803aa6097866d0d571d3932cbef78/0_261_4177_2684/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Beckham is sent off by Kim Milton Nielsen after kicking out at Diego Simeone.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Beckham is sent off by Kim Milton Nielsen after kicking out at Diego Simeone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Leech/Offside/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The subsequent response was, of course, hysterical but also telling. This was never an act of national betrayal, nor a sign of outrageous arrogance. No fatal flaw was exposed. Beckham made a mistake, but he was also young, handsome and an irresistibly snippable tall poppy.</p> <p>The headlines, the effigy-hanging, the idea of some debt to the nation to discharge: this was in itself the problem, the cultural baggage, a shared confusion exposed by a moment of error.</p> <p>It was also another major step on Beckham\u2019s own journey into the cultural mainstream. No English footballer has ever leveraged his celebrity so effectively. But then, the world was still new in 1998, the stage still there to be grabbed, footballers still pop star-ish figures; or indeed still capable of finding this a worthwhile pursuit.</p> <p>With Beckham the paradox remains that he was a very good, consistent footballer, and above all a hardworking and diligent pro, albeit one whose celebrity would continually intrude from the sidelines.</p> <p>Can you feel it? We\u2019re almost out of space. We\u2019re only 50 minutes in here and the scale of the occasion is already expanding. There was still time for England to make what looks in retrospect like a tactical mistake, shifting to 4-4-1, with Owen, the obvious threat, shunted to the left wing.</p> <p>In keeping with barrack room hierarchies, Shearer would remain the spearhead. He was still a wonderful player. He defended brilliantly. But he would spend the next 70 minutes wrestling with Chamot and Ayala, playing in their most comfortable spaces. The real cost of losing Beckham was losing Owen too.</p> <p>The game is still frantic and breathless, but England have settled in for a heroically disciplined struggle to the line. Southgate comes on for the injured Le Saux, Merson for the exhausted Scholes. Owen finally gets the ball in a deep central area with 11 minutes left and is battered to the ground by Ayala.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18b1bf60cda046fc87053e228ef2d0d2b7f6bede\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18b1bf60cda046fc87053e228ef2d0d2b7f6bede/116_244_2871_1721/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sol Campbell (left) of England rises to head the ball into the back of the Argentina net, but the goal is disallowed for Alan Shearer\u2019s elbow on goalkeeper Carlos Roa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England\u2019s Sol Campbell (left) rises to head the ball into the back of the Argentina net, but the goal is disallowed for Alan Shearer\u2019s elbow on goalkeeper Carlos Roa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Doug Pensinger/Allsport/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is time for another weird interlude. Campbell heads Anderton\u2019s corner into the net and runs off celebrating, unaware that Argentina are breaking downfield behind him, the goal having been ruled out \u2013 correctly \u2013 for Shearer\u2019s foul on Roa. An underrated moment: the man making the tackle to block Crespo at the other end is Anderton himself, who has run back the length of the pitch, from corner-taker to last man.</p> <p>***</p> <p><em>Our national epic has yet to be written.</em></p> <p>It is a gruelling denouement. The Beckham sending-off feels as if it was another world altogether by now. Ince has a wonderful half-hour of extra time, still running and dribbling and tackling.</p> <p>Simeone comes off, injured and furious, but keeps popping back on in full kit during the breaks to scream at his teammates. Everyone is wide-eyed and glistening. Seaman\u2019s hair has become a single majestically sculpted and sodden mass, the kind of hair it takes three hours in the stylist\u2019s chair to attain.</p> <p>At the final whistle you can feel where the shootout is heading. Argentina are the more technically accomplished team, penalties are the most basic test of skills under pressure. Roa is also worrying. His whole look is unconventional. He could be off to the skateboard park, or on his way to a modern art happening. This kind of goalkeeper is to be feared in a shootout.</p> <p>Shearer spanks his kick hard down the middle, after Berti\u2019s opener. Seaman saves from Crespo. Then: disaster. Ince takes exactly the same kick and Roa also saves.</p> <p>Ver\u00f3n\u2019s kick is a work of art but Merson puts his away easily. Gallardo makes it 3-2 but Owen takes a sensational penalty, then wheels away grinning. Where, exactly, has he been? Ayala puts Argentina 4-3 up and Batty has to score. It\u2019s down the centre, straight on to Roa\u2019s uplifted palm. Cue the pile-on of blue shirts, and last lines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1f09c7f77c62f5be0ca0cdb08c6b2fc55c48aa52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f09c7f77c62f5be0ca0cdb08c6b2fc55c48aa52/0_113_1425_856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juan Ver\u00f3n, Marcelo Gallardo, Ariel Ortega and Sergio Berti are jubilant as David Batty\u2019s penalty is saved\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juan Ver\u00f3n, Marcelo Gallardo, Ariel Ortega and Sergio Berti are jubilant as David Batty\u2019s penalty is saved.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Garcia/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What to make of all this plenitude, this fecundity of themes and details?

  "<p>After more than seven weeks of refusing to give any detailed explanation about whether \u2013 and why - he had gone to Durham during lockdown, the prime minister\u2019s special adviser Dominic Cummings took centre stage in an unprecedented press conference in the Rose Garden of No 10.</p> \n<p>Here are the key exchanges with journalists:</p> \n<h2>Initial decision to travel to Durham</h2> \n<p>Cummings said that on 27 March 27 his wife, Mary Wakefield, phoned him when he was at work to say she was badly ill, that she was alone in the house with their son and concerned she could not look after the child. Cummings immediately went home, famously being captured on camera running down Downing Street.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/i-think-i-behaved-reasonably-dominic-cummings-defends-actions-in-lockdown-row\">\u2018I think I behaved reasonably\u2019: Dominic Cummings defends actions in lockdown row</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Cummings said Wakefield\u2019s health improved, but that the couple were concerned they could soon both be incapacitated and unable to take care of their son. They therefore took an offer of help from his sister\u2019s children, aged 17 and 20, to be available to help at Cummings parents\u2019 farm if things got worse. The property had a number of separate buildings in which he said it was possible for the different branches of the family to isolate separately. He, Wakefield and their son travelled by car to the property late the same day, Cummings said, making no stops along the way and arriving at midnight. He got became sick the next day. In the event, no childcare was needed.</p> \n<p>Cummings acknowledged that neither he nor his wife asked anyone in London for help, arguing that the family offer more than 250 miles away presented a lesser risk and to fewer people.</p> \n<p>He did not explain why two relations of Wakefield\u2019s who lived in the capital could not help. It was, he said, a \u201cvery complicated, very tricky situation\u201d.</p> \n<h2>Conversations with Boris Johnson</h2> \n<p>Cummings said he did not consult Johnson about his decision to travel, arguing that \u201cevery day I have to make decisions about what to speak to him about\u201d and that he did not deem his decision sufficiently important. He said he had a \u201cmillion things on his plate\u201d, but acknowledged that this could have been a mistake. He said that neither he nor Johnson had a detailed recollection of the conversation in which he told the PM that he was in Durham.</p> \n<h2>Trip to hospital</h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/the-guardian-view-on-dominic-cummings-time-to-go\">The Guardian view on Dominic Cummings: time to go | Editorial</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Cummings revealed a previously unknown journey to hospital a few miles from his parents\u2019 property. He said his son became ill and was taken there by ambulance, travelling along with his wife, and stayed overnight. The following day, when the boy\u2019s condition improved, Cummings left isolation to pick both up, claiming he had no other option because there were no taxis available. He said he had stayed in the vehicle at all times.</p> \n<p>Cummings said he was feeling better by this point \u2013 although the night before he had been \u201cbarely able to stand up\u201d. He acknowledged that the trip fell within his and Wakefield\u2019s isolation period.</p> \n<p>Shortly after the rose Garden press conference, Prof Colin Talbot, emeritus professor at the University of Manxhester, noted: \u201cThe Cummings/Wakefield family ended up in a hospital in Durham \u2013 260 miles from home. That is precisely the reason the lockdown told people to stay at home if they get sick. So as not to spread the virus around the country.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Walk in the woods</h2> \n<p>Cummings said as he began to recover, he tried a walk in the woods owned by his father, next to the house. He said he and his family saw some people there, but had no interaction. \u201cWe had not left the property,\u201d he added. \u201cWe were on private land.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Trip to Barnard Castle</h2> \n<p>In arguably the most unusual part of his explanation, Cummings admitted for the first time that he had driven 30 mile to the town of Barnard Castle on 12 April \u2013 Wakefield\u2019s birthday. He said this journey \u2013 with his wife and child on board \u2013 was essential as a means of testing his eyesight before embarking on the journey to London. He did not explain why such a drive would be safe if there were concerns over his ability to see, why he could not make a test journey shorter than the half hour he said it took him to get there, or why his wife and child were with him for the experiment.</p> \n<p>In Barnard Castle, he said, the family got out of the car and sat by a river for 15 minutes, where an elderly man recognised them \u2013 probably retired chemistry teacher Robin Lees, who has described seeing Cummings in the town. Wakefield wished the man a Happy Easter. But, Cummings insisted, at no point did the family break physical distancing rules.</p> \n<p>On the journey home, he stopped the car so that his son could go to the toilet at the side of the road. He said nobody was nearby at the time. On the face of it, the drive to Barnard Castle would appear to be another clear breach of the lockdown rules that were in place at the time.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fea0e7f5-409c-4cc2-82aa-6ebdb41aed88\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UD-TwHQDDgo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Return to London and stop for petrol</h2> \n<p>Cummings said that when the family left for Durham they had had a full tank of petrol, meaning there was no need to stop on the way up. He said he was \u201cpretty sure we called in and filled up with petrol on the way back\u201d but that he had been cleared to return to work and so was allowed to do so.</p> \n<p>But then he added that he was only \u201c95% sure\u201d of this account and that \u201cit might be wrong\u201d.</p> \n<h2>Claim of additional trip</h2> \n<p>Cummings firmly denied claims that he was seen in Houghall Woods \u2013 where two witnesses claim to have seen him, one saying that he remarked that the bluebells were lovely \u2013 on a subsequent occasion, after returning to London. \u201cPhotos and data on my phone prove this to be false,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cLocal CCTV, if it exists, would also prove that I\u2019m telling the truth that I was in London on that day. I was not in Durham.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Transparency</h2> \n<p>Cummings did not apologise for any of his actions, but expressed his regret that he had not provided a fuller account of events to the public earlier, saying: \u201cIn retrospect it would have been better to set this out earlier on.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked why Downing Street has resisted answering media questions he claimed: \u201cAnswering a lot of these things doesn\u2019t clear up confusion \u2013 it frequently has led to more confusion.\u201d And he made the surprising claim that the media had been told things were wrong but \u201creported them anyway\u201d.</p> \n<p>Since the Guardian first contacted Downing Street about the claims more than six weeks ago, the government has consistently refused to comment or give any background briefing.</p> \n<p>Cummings claimed articles by him and his wife in the Spectator about their experience of lockdown were justified in leaving out their location because he was concerned it would put his family in Durham at risk if they had mentioned it. He rejected the suggestion that the omission implied an understanding that it would be a controversial fact.</p> \n<h2>Judgment</h2> \n<p>Cummings returned to the question of his judgment repeatedly, saying: \u201cI do not regret what I did. But he acknowledged that \u201creasonable people may disagree\u201d. He suggested that while he understood public anger, such sentiments were largely the product of inaccurate press coverage. He declined to apologise, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think that what I did in these 14 days was a mistake. I\u2019ve certainly made a lot of other mistakes, I make mistakes every day.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The prime minister\u2019s chief adviser should be leaving Downing Street for good, not be giving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/i-think-i-behaved-reasonably-dominic-cummings-defends-actions-in-lockdown-row\" title=\"\">press conferences</a> from its rose garden. Unlike millions of Britons who stayed at home for the sake of collective safety of the country, Dominic Cummings broke the lockdown in March. While the rest of the UK was inconvenienced, suffered hardship and lost loved ones without saying goodbye, Mr Cummings drove 260 miles to his parents\u2019 farm in Durham after his wife fell sick.</p> <p>He had been forced to explain his actions after the Guardian and Mirror revealed his excursion last week. Yet Mr Cummings on Monday blamed the media for spreading inaccurate stories, while confirming the essence and detail of the reporting. His defence was laughable. He admitted driving 30 miles with his family to a beauty spot to \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrchrisaddison/status/1264961426352771079?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1264961426352771079%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2Flive%2F2020%2Fmay%2F25%2Fuk-coronavirus-live-boirs-johnson-dominic-cummings-covid-19-latest-updates\" title=\"\">test his eyesight</a>\u201d. This farrago of nonsense was made worse because Mr Cummings did not evince any substantial measure of regret. He sought to defend his actions saying what he did was not a mistake, but rather that they could be considered reasonable acts of a concerned father and husband.</p> <p>Mr Cummings and his wife had not been tested for coronavirus. Neither of them appear to have been seriously incapacitated at the same time. They had one small child who needed looking after. These were unfortunate circumstances, not exceptional ones. Many, many people dealt with far worse. What Mr Cummings cannot seem to fathom is that if everyone considers their circumstances to be unusual, and decides that they can move around the country in search of childcare, then the virus will spread across households, and across communities, and the pandemic will grow, and many lives will be lost as a result.</p> <p>The message in this health emergency to the public was clear: \u201cstay at home\u201d. For Mr Cummings the message appeared to be to \u201cread the small print\u201d and find a reasonable excuse not to. The lack of self-awareness is galling. The exemption that Mr Cummings rests his argument on was developed for people at risk of domestic abuse. Legal experts <a href=\"http://insights.doughtystreet.co.uk/post/102g80l/did-dominic-cummings-act-responsibly-and-legally\" title=\"\">suggest</a> that Mr Cummings\u2019 defence would not stand up in a court of law, let alone that of public opinion. It is a stretch to think that the lockdown would allow people with what appeared to be coronavirus symptoms to leave their home and drive to another part of the country. Or to allow them to end up in a hospital hundreds of miles away from their house.</p> <p>Mr Cummings\u2019 actions have the government in crisis. But the country is in the grip of a coronavirus pandemic. What has been asked of people is to make sacrifices for the collective wellbeing. This requires a high level of cooperation and trust. Most people understood that they had to stay inside during the lockdown and believed that others would do the same. They might not have done so if people like Mr Cummings had been given official backing to cheat these reciprocal arrangements.</p> <p>There is a long way to go. In the coming weeks the British public is likely be asked to endure more restrictions for the greater good. It is hoped that they will ignore Mr Cummings\u2019 example and not bend or stretch the rules but carry on obeying them both in letter and in spirit. Because this is about protecting the lives of one\u2019s family and one\u2019s community. The virus is being spread by people who think, like Mr Cummings, that the rules do not apply to them. This is why he ought not to remain at the heart of the government.</p>",
  "<p>Doing away with reset scrums and eliminating \u201cupright face-to-face\u201d tackles would significantly reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission, according to a new study by World Rugby.</p> <p>The governing body also advises making a change of jerseys and headgear at half-time compulsory, banning huddles on the pitch and outlawing spitting. Players washing their hands and face with soap for 20 seconds and frequently changing balls during matches have also been proposed. Eliminating reset scrums would be the most significant move, however, and one that would be welcomed by many given the delays they can cause.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/23/wasps-chief-steven-vaughan-premiership-rugby-union-new-normal\">'Every club makes a loss': Wasps chief on adapting to rugby's new normal | Paul Rees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The findings will be put to World Rugby\u2019s executive committee this week to consider any temporary law guidelines which would be adopted by the unions at their own discretion. At the very least the study \u2013 which examines transmission risk via saliva and sweat \u2013 is likely to lead to a clampdown by referees on the time it takes to reset scrums as well as upright tackles.</p> <p>The study states that eliminating reset scrums would lead to a 30% reduction in \u201chigh-transmission risk exposure time\u201d, having identified second-rows and props as the playing positions most at risk. Based on guidelines from the World Health Organization that define high-risk transition as players being within one metre for 15 cumulative minutes, World Rugby has found that the average exposure time for second-rows and props is 13.4 minutes and, significantly, reset scrums account for 3.6 minutes. In total, scrums are identified as making up 50% of high-risk exposure time during an 80-minute match.</p> <p>World Rugby has long since been attempting to rid the game of upright tackles, having identified them as a key contributor to head injuries. Tackles when the defender went into contact upright and with force were found to be the most dangerous in a study that led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/08/tackle-law-rugby-union\" title=\"\">World Rugby introducing its high tackle framework</a> before last year\u2019s World Cup.

Hopefully, the endangered <a href=\"https://www.environment.sa.gov.au/goodliving/posts/2020/03/ki-dunnart-recovery\">Kangaroo Island dunnart</a> was among them.</p> <p>The dunnart project is one of dozens hosted by the Australian research platform <a href=\"https://volunteer.ala.org.au/\">Digivol</a>.

Notebooks offer an insight into the complexities of field work. One short project involved transcribing a diary from an Australian geological expedition to Papua New Guinea in the 1970s. The daily entries recorded the difficulties of travelling between islands in speedboats and canoes, slogging 763 metres up a rainforest slope to peer at lava flows and making camp under \u201cpoison ivy\u201d. Remarkably, they were written without the pen tearing clean through the paper.</p> <p>Historical expeditions also appear on the list. The University of New South Wales has uploaded <a href=\"https://volunteer.ala.org.au/project/index/87083554\">bench books from the Magistrates\u2019 Courts of Port Macquarie (1828\u20131837)</a>.

And the game is not where it is today because it flowed with the current of the worldwide pandemic; it is where it is today largely, if not solely, due to one man \u2013 Peter V\u2019landys.</p> <p>Both feared and revered in equal parts, the ARLC chairman is a belligerent populist whose brand of working class fire-and-brimstone rhetoric and results-first ethos has positioned rugby league as the frontrunner through sheer force of will \u2013 and him as the most powerful man in Australian sport.</p> <p>For good or ill, V\u2019landys has bulldozed a path for the game\u2019s return and to label him one of the most omnipotent figures in Australia is not hyperbole. He has defied the prime minister and state premiers, taken the fight to broadcasters and unions, unilaterally changed the laws of the game and obliterated rivals along the way.</p> <p>V\u2019landys was twice chastised by Scott Morrison for declaring the Warriors would be given a travel exemption, yet they set up camp in Tamworth and will play on Saturday. It has been a high-risk gambit. Governments can and will shut the game down the moment there is a health breach. Failure to have the backing of health departments and public officials gives the game zero wiggle room if something goes wrong. A thirst for brinksmanship and risk has its downside and his making, of course, could yet be his breaking. </p> <p>V\u2019landys may be able to control the narrative through cozy media relationships but any single health failing could bring the game to its knees; the game will not go on if any player tests positive for Covid-19. To keep some stakeholders in line, some obvious safety measures like player hubs have been foregone. It is a dangerous ploy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d45ad8191ed28a2a8282a86a3e13affd8c14c91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d45ad8191ed28a2a8282a86a3e13affd8c14c91/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former NRL CEO Todd Greenberg and ARLC chair Peter V\u2019landys\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former NRL CEO Todd Greenberg (left) and Peter V\u2019landys.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt King/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rugby league has historically struggled to understand the machinations of power and politics. It has too often cowered when confronted or deferred, confused and bewildered by the intrigue and subtleties involved in money and influence. </p> <p>That has made the internal difficulties in the game look a complete mismatch. Former CEO Todd Greenberg was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/21/todd-greenbergs-cards-were-marked-once-peter-vlandys-landed-in-rugby-league\">not expected to last long</a> when V\u2019landys assumed the chairmanship of the ARLC. Covid-19 actually gave him a stay of execution but V\u2019landys does not suffer fools gladly. Greenberg is no fool, but when he made a mess of the player pay negotiations and was humiliated in the broadcast discussions, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/20/nrl-ceo-todd-greenberg-quits-amid-rugby-league-coronavirus-crisis\">the chairman was both decisive and brutal</a>.</p> <p>Neither of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/20/nrl-broadcast-deal-with-nine-and-fox\">NRL\u2019s two broadcast partners</a> made a critical payment on 1 April but Fox Sports has signed on to a long-term deal ensuring the immediate viability of the game while Nine, who were clearly angling to leave their deal, look set to extend.</p> <p>The players were always going to be the hardest stakeholders to both please and corral. V\u2019landys won the support of RLPA CEO Clint Newton, keeping any player discontent individualised and nothing more than a murmuring. Anti vaxxers were not publicly humiliated as they well could have been but it became clear that they would not be allowed to stop the game returning.

Despite a commitment to pay all full-time referees, the idea of industrial action was floated. V\u2019landys responded by claiming plans were already in place to cope without them and he conceded nothing before the officials committed to refereeing the full 2020 season. The rule and the refereeing change smacks of hubris and has the ability to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/14/nrls-aims-may-be-noble-but-rule-changes-leave-season-without-integrity\">completely undermine the legitimacy of the 2020 season</a>.</p> <p>Rugby league has beaten other sports back because at its helm is a pragmatist who cares little for principle.

It is an attitude which has seen the game plough on regardless of advice otherwise. </p> <p>But streaks do not last forever and messiahs do not exist. Fallibility is human and at some stage, V\u2019landys may pull the wrong rein. And if he does, the stakes are so high it could be devastating. For now though, rugby league is set to return, albeit a markedly different version to what we knew a few months back.</p>",

Stupid us, we thought by staying in and isolating completely that we were keeping others safe \u2013 especially our parents, who are all over 70.</p> <p>At one stage we were really worried if we could continue to care for them and thought about whether we may have to call the NHS or social care. Turns out we shouldn\u2019t have cared or worried about the health and safety of others and sought help as apparently a father would do.

  "<p>We must shield the vulnerable. This is what most of us have understood for the past 10 weeks. Most families have been split apart, often in dire circumstances. For adults and parents of children with compromised immune systems, this remains a frightening time. To be in touch with your own vulnerability is profoundly unsettling. Even on a sunny day, the mood you detect is one of anxiety. \u201cLet\u2019s have a socially distanced picnic and pretend it\u2019s all OK,\u201d is one reaction; another is refusing to edge out of lockdown without the kind of reassurance that can never be given.</p> <p>In this clammy emotional climate, it is unbelievable that Boris Johnson\u2019s interpretation of shielding the vulnerable meant shielding Dominic Cummings. Contempt for the public has been met with contempt from the public. The anger is real, and it will not dissipate. Cummings\u2019 situation is untenable and Johnson is fatally damaged, whatever happens next.</p> <p>Johnson always was a power-seeking void. His attraction to mythology bespoke a search for a narrative into which he could meaningfully insert himself. That and the endless women. All else was front. Since his own, hardly insignificant, brush with mortality, the void is apparent. The outer shell of his ego barely conceals the emptiness. No one comes out of intensive care without it having a huge mental and physical effect. Why pretend otherwise?</p> <p>Whatever the pact between him and Cummings is about, it is centred on a fundamentally flawed view of what strong leadership is. This view values, certainty and control above all else. It brooks no weakness or doubt. Cummings, remember, got Johnson to sack the rebels. This is leadership as monstrous bravado.</p> <p>This is leadership as the taunt of the flapping, faded T-shirt. How many ways can Cummings show us he just doesn\u2019t care? Let me count the ways. Let me consult my adolescent self.</p> <p>All actual vulnerabilities are transposed on to the wife and child who he was simply trying to protect. What a father! A lot of us have asked ourselves in the past months what being a good parent is or what being a good son or daughter consists of, and felt ourselves failing. The rules of lockdown do not correlate to the rules of the heart. Lockdown has asked us to negate what feels natural; to shut down the impulse to hold on to each other.</p> <p>Those writing to their MPs with stories of not seeing their dying parents for weeks are stories that will stay in the culture for years to come. We cannot focus on them too much<strong>.</strong> It is our duty to memorialise these families; to make visible the hidden, isolated funerals. We owe them this at least.</p> <p>While Johnson blustered, estimates of 60,000 excess deaths emerged, alongside more details of dithering over lockdown. Last week, the scientists began to break ranks. This week, bishops are speaking out.</p> <p>Grief hangs in the sunlight. Grief not just for those lost, but for the everyday losses. Grief for bands in sweaty basements, for great cafes, for packed theatres, for small children heaped up like puppies in soft-play areas. These things are gone for the foreseeable future. Loss sparks sadness, but also anger. Now that anger is tangible. If the virus made us feel powerless, then the minimum we expected from our leaders was a certain solidarity.</p> <p>To be vulnerable is not to be weak \u2013 it is to be human. This is the terrible mistake these men have made. Their model of leadership belongs to another era. These people are not mavericks but straightforward elitists using Trump\u2019s playbook: banning certain journalists from briefings, engaging only when they choose, refusing accountability. This they see as strength, but it cannot conceal the truth or their weakness.</p> <p>They failed to shield the nation with early lockdown and to set up a testing system. They failed to understand that most people would comply for the sake of the greater good as we are not all ego-driven chancers.</p> <p>The result of fronting it out against the virus is the highest death toll in Europe. It is hard to think of a worse result. Admitting vulnerability can be a strength, not in a \u201cletting it all hang out\u201d way or by simply trying to elicit sympathy. Vulnerability in leadership, as Bren\u00e9 Brown says, \u201cis having the courage to show up, fully engage and be seen when you can\u2019t control the outcome\u201d. The normal coping strategies when we feel out of control are to deny our own uncertainty or feel shame. We can see how other leaders have acknowledged their own self-doubt, from Emmanuel Macron to Jacinda Ardern.</p> <p>Here, the forbearance of ordinary people has been mistaken for servitude. That is wrong, and as lockdown ends with schools reopening, there is a volatility out there that does not have party loyalties. The issue is not whether Johnson forgives Cummings his rule-breaking. Only very special people get to display their vulnerability in Downing Street\u2019s rose garden.<strong> </strong>This is small beer, and they are both exposed as small men. The issue is whether we the people will forgive this government\u2019s fatal failure to keep us safe.</p> <p>The shallow defences are ever more flimsy, as one police chief tells us that <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/05/24/revealed-police-spoke-dominic-cummings-father-twice-260-mile/\">lockdown is now \u201cdead in the water</a>\u201d. As Cummings\u2019 favoured author, Dostoevsky, wrote: \u201cLying to ourselves is more deeply ingrained than lying to others.\u201d Indeed. It is quite something when the prime minister does not even look remotely convinced of his own statements. It is unforgivable.</p> <p>\u2022 Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist</p>",

  "<p>As general secretary and co-founder of the Campaign Against Racial Discrimination (Card) in the mid-1960s, Jocelyn Barrow, who has died aged 90, helped to pave the way for the 1965 Race Relations Act, which for the first time made racial discrimination illegal in Britain. Later she became the first black female governor of the BBC and an important black presence on a number of public bodies, including the Broadcasting Standards Council and the Parole Board.</p> <p>Jocelyn\u2019s involvement in the creation of Card was sparked by an inspirational meeting she had in London in 1964 with the American civil rights activist Martin Luther King, who was passing through the UK on his way to Norway to receive the Nobel peace prize. \u201cKing was warm and charming, and wanted to give us an idea of what we should be doing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt helped to crystallise our ideas and we went on to form Card.\u201d</p> <p>While there were other influential groups that had already been applying pressure for race relations legislation in Britain \u2013 and attempts to pass private members\u2019 bills had been going on for a number of years before 1965 \u2013 the creation of Card undoubtedly helped to galvanise Harold Wilson\u2019s Labour government into support for an officially sanctioned bill which it then steered through parliament.</p> <p>Three years later, during the successful nationwide campaign that led to a new, updated 1968 Race Relations Act, Jocelyn accepted my invitation (as Card\u2019s northern regional secretary) to lead a march against racism in Newcastle upon Tyne. The hostility towards it was phenomenal, the local press signalled the potential danger of busloads of National Front demonstrators arriving from Leeds, and the Northumbrian police tried to get the march banned altogether. Its leaders received threats to their personal safety, and Jocelyn was warned not to travel to Tyneside at all.</p> <p>Travel she did, however, and the march went ahead peacefully. Without a megaphone (her voice was commandingly loud), Jocelyn addressed a gathering of several hundred demonstrators, speaking of her upbringing and how it had shaped her fight against racial discrimination.</p> <p>Born in Port of Spain, Trinidad, Jocelyn was the daughter of Olive (nee Pierre) and her Barbadian husband, Charles Barrow, an engineer. After attending St Joseph\u2019s Convent school in Port of Spain she trained as a teacher at the city\u2019s governmental teacher training college, and arrived in the UK in 1959 to pursue an English degree at London University, followed by postgraduate studies at the Institute of Education. She remained in the UK for the rest of her life, and throughout the 1960s and 70s taught English at schools in Hackney, one of the most deprived areas of east London, later becoming a lecturer at Furzedown teacher training college in Tooting, south London.</p> <p>As an educationist who fervently believed in multiculturalism, she could not stomach the yawning gap between well-resourced schools for mainly middle-class white children and poorly resourced schools for mainly working-class black children. Her experiences in the classroom prompted her to set up a local project called Each One Teach One, designed to help black children and their families support each other educationally.</p> <p>However, although her teaching had its own significance, it was her more general work on race relations that garnered wider attention. She was general secretary and then vice chair of Card from 1964 to 1969, and immediately after the passage of the 1968 Race Relations Act, which made discrimination in housing and employment illegal, she was appointed a member of the Community Relations Commission, set up to co-ordinate national measures to encourage the \u201cgrowth of harmonious relations\u201d between different races. She served on that body until, after the 1976 Race Relations Act, it was amalgamated with the Race Relations Board to form the Commission for Racial Equality.</p> <p>Later, as a member of the Parole Board (1983\u201387), and particularly as the first black female governor of the BBC (1981 to 1988), she initiated programmes that encouraged young black and Asian people to fulfil their potential. She was also chair of the Equal Opportunities Commission on Training Barristers and was a patron, since its foundation in 1981, of the <a href=\"https://blackculturalarchives.org/\">Black Cultural Archives</a>.</p> <p>Much of Jocelyn\u2019s public work was not directly connected to race, however. From 1989 to 1995 she was deputy chair of the Broadcasting Standards Council, forerunner of Ofcom, and from 1993 to 1999 she was a non-executive director of the Whittington Hospital NHS Trust in London, where she pleaded for better employment conditions and promotion opportunities for non-trained auxiliary nurses and carers.</p> <p>She also became founder and president of the Hackney Community housing association (1978 until her death); national vice president of the Townswomen\u2019s Guild (1978\u201380); a member of the European commission\u2019s economic and social committee (1990\u201398); a trustee of the National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside (now National Museums Liverpool), and a governor of the British Film Institute (1991\u201397). These and many more largely community-based organisations benefited enormously from her spirited commitment \u2013 and also from her refusal to suffer fools gladly.</p> <p>Jocelyn, whose anger against injustice was carefully cloaked beneath an aura of dignified authority, liked to practise what she called \u201cpincher politics\u201d, which she once described to me as \u201ca bottom-up/top-down approach, with the purpose of pinching the establishment into action and reform\u201d. It was a method that was as psychological and cultural as it was political and educational \u2013 a little Machiavellian, perhaps, but always purposeful and often highly successful. </p> <p> </p> <p>What drove Jocelyn \u2013 or \u201cDJB\u201d as she was affectionately known after being made a dame in 1992 \u2013 was the belief that she was entitled to be part of a society more equal than the one she had known either in her colonial birthplace or in the Britain of the 60s into which she later emerged. </p> <p>In her last major intervention, in 2005, Jocelyn returned to education, the field that was closest to her heart, to head a nationwide consultation commissioned by the United Learning Trust into the role of underperforming would-be Academy schools. She found that the 20 schools that she studied were in various degrees discriminatory on the grounds of race, and concluded that a new and inclusive approach needed to be adopted. She retired in 2013. </p> <p>In 1970 Jocelyn married Henderson Downer, a barrister and later a Jamaican appeal court judge who retired in 2004. For most of their long marriage they lived between the UK and Jamaica, enjoying their independence, separation, and togetherness in equal measure; Henderson coming to London for Christmas, Easter and a month in the summer while Jocelyn went to Jamaica from January to March. She is survived by Henderson and by two nieces, Christine and Leslie Anne, whom she raised at her home in Bloomsbury, central London.</p> <p>\u2022 Jocelyn Anita Barrow, race relations campaigner and teacher, born 15 April 1929; died 9 April 2020</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>A leading scientist from the government\u2019s official advisory body has said there is a \u201cvacuum in the heart of government\u201d following Dominic Cummings\u2019 press conference on breaking lockdown, and that \u201cwe now have to recognise that central government probably cannot be trusted to provide leadership.\u201d</p> <p>Robert West, a professor of health psychology at University College London\u2019s Institute of Epidemiology and Health, who sits on the advisory group on behavioural science for Sage told the Guardian: \u201cFrom a public health perspective what we now have to recognise is that central government probably cannot be trusted to provide leadership, and other agencies, including local and regional government, are going to have to work together to make up for this. It will be difficult and maybe things will change but as things stand there is a leadership vacuum in the heart of government.\u201d</p> <p>In reference to Cummings\u2019 account of why he drove hundreds of miles to Durham during lockdown, West said: \u201cThere are so many holes in his narrative that only the most desperate people who want to believe him could do so. Not least is the idea that someone who is not an idiot would drive for 30 miles (coincidentally to a tourist attraction) with his wife and child in the car to check that he was safe to drive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt may sound odd but I really wanted him to find a credible and honourable way out of this mess,\u201d said West. \u201cBut the whole thing is playing out like a Greek tragedy with the protagonists trapped by their own proclivities to self-destruct - in his case by his hubris and inability to say sorry.\u201d</p> <p>West also said there had been growing unease among his advisory colleagues about a divergence between the scientific advice and the government\u2019s approach. \u201cThose of us on Spi-B have been increasingly concerned about the extent to which the government\u2019s approach to the behavioural sciences and the messaging, particularly, has been at 180 degrees from the kind of advice that we have been sending into the Cabinet Office,\u201d said West. </p> <p>Members of Spi-B, the advisory group on behavioural science, say their recommendations to set very clear and unequivocal messages for the public to follow have frequently been ignored by politicians. They fear Cummings\u2019 apparent disregard of the rules will be extremely damaging.</p> <p>He noted that ministers got a lot of flak for changing the advisory slogan from \u201cstay at home\u201d to \u201cstay alert\u201d as they began to talk of easing the lockdown. \u201cAnd rightly so, because it is exactly the kind of thing that you would have hoped they would have consulted with their scientific advisers on, in order to come up with something that would be meaningful at a really important stage of the process.\u201d</p> <p>West said Spi-B was never asked about the change of slogan. \u201cThe sense is that there\u2019s another parallel group of people who are effectively calling the shots here and have their own views on how things should go, but they are not necessarily experts in communication or behavioural science or all the things they would need to be.</p> <p>\u201cThey are treating the whole health crisis as though it were a political crisis. If it\u2019s a political crisis, what you do is try to manage your reputation. If it\u2019s a health crisis you focus on saving lives, at whatever cost to your political reputation.\u201d</p> <p>He said 40 people were involved in Spi-B, the Independent Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours, which feeds in to Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies.</p> <p>\u201cI know [concern] is widespread among the group but not everybody feels comfortable speaking out and I completely understand that. But there has been considerable and growing unease,\u201d West said. \u201cThe worry is that the government has said from the beginning it is following the science, and that was never true.\u201d</p> <p>The group did not expect to be calling the shots, he said, \u201cbut when the government forms policy or does something that goes against the advice, they need to explain why\u201d.</p> <p>He said the Cabinet Office asked the committee to provide guidance and write papers to answer questions posed by the government, sometimes at two hours\u2019 notice. The members were working extremely hard, he said. \u201cThen it seems to go into a black hole and we see communications that are at variance [with the advice].\u201d</p> <p>He expressed sympathy for Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance, the chief medical officer for England and the chief scientific officer, who he said were \u201cpotentially in such a difficult position\u201d attempting to champion the science with the government.</p>",

In expressing that view, did he seek advice from the AG?</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a conflict between her position constitutionally providing independent advice to the prime minister and her role as an MP tweeting political support.

Ms Braverman was unwise to back words over undisclosed records.</p> <p>\u201cThe uncertainty and anger generated will allow others, as a minimum, to be \u2018generous\u2019 with their own understanding of the rules.

It implies you are not supportive of the steps they took.</p> <p>\u201cMoreover, your tweet is supportive of a statement from No 10 which disputes the handling of the case by the police. The prime minister should not be lending his authority to attacks on the enforcement of the criminal law. He should certainly not be egged on in that by the attorney general.</p> <p>\u201cAs attorney general you have a special constitutional responsibility for the appropriate enforcement of the criminal law and are responsible for oversight of criminal prosecutions.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a rigid constitutional principle that the attorney general will discharge those functions free from political considerations or influence.

  "<p>Alan Ayckbourn\u2019s hefty oeuvre lingers on the faultlines in middle-class married life. \u201cWe all marry the wrong people,\u201d thundered a character in Family Circles, and Ayckbourn\u2019s latest drama proves little has changed for his woe-begotten husbands and wives. Almost everyone in Anno Domino seems to have married the wrong person, though the central concern is more the existential state of learning to live unhappily in marriage.</p> <p>A 25th-wedding anniversary dinner sparks a low-level earthquake in a middle-English household when the \u201ccelebrating\u201d couple, Sam and Milly, announce their separation. The dramatic focus is not on them but on Sam\u2019s elderly parents, Ella and Ben, whose own marriage is shaken by the news.</p> <p>Ayckbourn began this, his 84th play, as a stage drama but then adapted it as a lockdown audio play for the Stephen Joseph theatre in Scarborough. He not only recorded it himself but acted the various parts together with his wife, Heather Stoney, from the 70-something central couple to their teenage grandson. That is a feat in itself; they play eight characters, four apiece, adding tonal differences (sometimes with the help of technical wizardry) though the pitch of the youngest characters are the least convincing.</p> <p>The theatre\u2019s artistic director, Paul Robinson, calls it \u201cone of Alan\u2019s \u2018lighter\u2019 plays \u2026 perfect entertainment in these troubled times\u201d. It\u2019s perhaps too light\u201d: there are some satirical amusements set beside quietly held suffering, but it feels long drawn-out at almost two hours with not enough happening and plot points that feel flat.</p> <p>What raises it are the bigger background themes, besides marriage. While the drama is typically set in the domestic sphere, over cups of teas, in back gardens and cafes, and in its own seemingly timeless bubble, contemporary British politics are ingrained within including conflicts around Brexit.</p> <p>Ben and Ella are sent up for their jingoism, out-of-touch outlook and snobbery, and it seems as if Ayckbourn is satirising not only the postwar leave generation but slyly satirising a toxic version of Englishness, too. Ella speaks of \u201cforeigners everywhere you look\u201d and pettily compares the superior joys of the English climate to the Italian one. Even divorce is tied to the national character: \u201cStiff upper lip and all that,\u201d says Ben, and \u201csplitting up. It\u2019s just not English.\u201d</p> <p>The retrograde thinking extends beyond nationhood; some characters still haven\u2019t grasped the basic facts on climate change, and views on the sexes are prehistoric. New men are \u201cflaccid\u201d, according to Ella, and new women are to be avoided.</p> <p>Ben is her accomplice, but Ella is the villain of the piece. She speaks with chauvinism about women\u2019s place in marriage and treats her daughter, Martha, with contempt, while excusing her son\u2019s marital misdemeanours.

Cummings, along with his wife and four-year-old son, travelled from his London home to his parents\u2019 farm in Durham in late March despite lockdown rules advising people to stay at their primary residence. The couple have said they feared they may be incapacitated by coronavirus and thus struggle to look after their child.

  "<p>It wasn\u2019t me, but I can probably speak for most of the 400,000-odd civil servants when I say I wish it had been.

In an age of increasing command-and-control comms, this brave heretic has already become something of a civil service legend. Very well played.<br></p> <p>Consider. \u201c<em>Arrogant and offensive. Can you imagine working with these truth twisters?</em>\u201d wasn\u2019t a leaked document, a shocking secret or a devastating meme. It was a simple, excoriating judgment of the prime minister\u2019s incoherent defence of Dominic Cummings that not even Larry the Downing Street cat would disagree with. </p> <p>This was speaking truth to power. This was a shot across the bow. This was a tiny flare sent up from the government trenches, in solidarity with anyone who has ever felt like they\u2019ve been \u201csent over the top\u201d by an implacable ruling class for whom the rules themselves are increasingly a disposable commodity.</p> <p>Sure, that account might have been hacked, but to me its brevity and its polite lucidity reek of authenticity and suggests the act of a single brave individual.</p> <p>The Cabinet Office quickly announced that the tweet had been deleted, and that it was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cabinetofficeuk/status/1264613950790008835\">launching an investigation</a> into what happened. But I hope they never find its author. And if they do, I\u2019d argue that he or she should qualify for the protection that the government <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/whistleblowing\">by law has to provide</a> for whistleblowers, who, after all, are allowed to break government <em>omert\u00e0 </em>when there are miscarriages of justice, fraud, dangers to health and safety, or attempts to conceal any of the above.</p> <p>That kind of argument probably won\u2019t be enough to convince any future employment tribunal that this anonymous hero was justified in breaking the civil service code, but it\u2019s a hell of a lot stronger than the arguments deployed in defence of Cummings. If there\u2019s any justice, if my colleague is uncovered, he or she will face the same consequences as the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser did, which will be bugger all (although Durham police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/witness-complains-to-police-about-dominic-cummings-as-pressure-mounts\">might have other ideas</a>).</p> <p>What is sad and damaging about this particular lockdown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2018/dec/12/tory-mps-trigger-vote-of-no-confidence-in-may-amid-brexit-uncertainty-politics-live?page=with:block-5c113997e4b025637fe940cd\">clusterbourach</a> is not just the additional pressure now placed on public health messaging, but about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/the-weak-defence-of-dominic-cummings-further-erodes-trust-in-the-government\">deteriorating trust in government</a>, its conventions and its institutions.</p> <p>There is now no longer even the pretence that the British public are currently governed by the law of moral equivalence \u2013 the radical idea that whatever is wrong for you must also be wrong for me.</p> <p>Civil servants aren\u2019t naive \u2013 we know that no politician is above appealing to exceptionalism of one kind or another. But the sheer amounts of it that have been enthusiastically spaffed by the cabinet and the prime minister in defence of Cummings over the past couple of days have shocked, dismayed and enraged the public and civil servants alike.</p> <p>As ever, it\u2019s not the rule-breaking itself that hurts us, it\u2019s the lack of concern about the damage being done to cover it up. Only time and the public inquiry that is surely coming down the line will tell the true extent of this. It\u2019s entirely plausible that the undermining of the lockdown rules so carefully set out by public health officials may yet be counted in lives lost.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the sobering reality for the civil service twitterer is that the Cabinet Office praetorian guard will spend more energy trying to identify them than it ever will on investigating Cummings\u2019s lockdown misdeeds.

  "<p>It was a speech intended to define a new era. In a final, do-or-die attempt to block what appeared to be Israeli plans for a permanent land grab, the Palestinian president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/palestinian-leader-mahmoud-abbas-ends-security-agreement-with-israel-and-us\">announced</a> he would renege on decades of diplomacy.</p> <p>From the 1990s-era Oslo accords \u2013 the first steps of a peace process \u2013 to deep security coordination between the Palestinian leadership, Israel and US intelligence agencies, all were now void, Mahmoud Abbas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/palestinian-leader-mahmoud-abbas-ends-security-agreement-with-israel-and-us\">said in a late-night speech last week</a>. He said the Palestinian leadership was \u201cabsolved, as of today, of all the agreements and understandings with the American and Israeli governments\u201d.</p> <p>Almost a week later, it appears Abbas may have been bluffing. He has made similar threats multiple times before and, apart from sightings of Palestinian security forces retreating from some areas they patrol in coordination with Israeli forces, there was little sign on the ground that life had changed.</p> <p>\u201cObviously, the narrative out there, understandably, is that this is just a bluff,\u201d said Tareq Baconi, an Israel-Palestine analyst for the <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/\">International Crisis Group</a> thinktank.</p> <p>If Abbas had been serious, the ramifications would have been enormous and, probably, immediate. By nullifying those agreements, Abbas would destroy the structures that have held him in power for years, including his ruling Palestinian Authority (PA), itself a product of the Oslo accords.</p> <p>\u201cIf the agreements don\u2019t exist then the PA doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s unlikely that the leadership will dismantle itself,\u201d said Baconi.</p> <p>Israel and the PA work together so closely that often Palestinians are able to leave their towns for work or medical treatment only through close coordination. Even Abbas is unable to move around, both within the occupied territories or out of it, without Israeli permission.</p> <p>So tight is the PA\u2019s relationship with Israel that it has led to widespread accusations among Palestinians that the body has become proxy for the occupier, which in return props it up. \u201cIt\u2019s seen as a way of maintaining self-governance rather than building a state,\u201d said Baconi.</p> <p>The secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Saeb Erekat, however, suggested that security and intelligence sharing was ending. Despite public antagonism, Israel, the US and the PA have long maintained security coordination against their mutual enemy, Hamas.</p> <p>Although he would not divulge specific details of Abbas\u2019s plan, Erekat said the leadership had already suspended contacts with the CIA and Israeli intelligence agencies.</p> <p>\u201cSecurity cooperation with the United States is no more. Security coordination with Israel is no more,\u201d he said on a conference call with journalists. Cryptically, and suggesting the move was not comprehensive, he added: \u201cWe are going to maintain public order and the rule of law \u2026 We are not closing the door.\u201d</p> <p>A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some instructions had been given to PA security agencies not to coordinate with Israel. However, they said the full effects of the move would not be known until Eid festivities end on Wednesday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/palestinian-leader-mahmoud-abbas-ends-security-agreement-with-israel-and-us\">Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas ends security agreement with Israel and US</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Abbas\u2019s speech was a response to Israel\u2019s government officially contemplating annexing large areas of the West Bank, apparently with US backing.

Although Israel already maintains a half-century-old occupation in the territories, annexation is seen as a deathblow to any Palestinian state.</p> <p>The Middle East peace envoy Nickolay Mladenov told the UN security council last week that Abbas\u2019s speech may not have been a bonafide threat but instead a \u201cdesperate cry for help\u201d in the face of such a devastating blow.</p> <p>\u201cIf I may speak openly and very frankly on the issue, whatever our individual assessments of the Palestinian reaction to the Israeli threat of annexation may be, it is certainly one thing \u2013 it is a desperate cry for help,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a call for immediate action. It is a cry for help from a generation of a leadership that has invested its life in building institutions and preparing for statehood for over a quarter of a century.</p> <p>\u201cIt is doing so at a time in which a new, younger generation comes forward, with its own aspirations for the future.

  "<h2>David and Jerry Zucker, directors (with Jim Abrahams)</h2> <p>We used to seek out movies that were mind-numbingly serious and dub them with our own voices. Late one night, we caught Zero Hour! \u2013 a 1957 film about a former world war two pilot landing a stricken passenger flight \u2013 and thought: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we recreate this whole movie instead?\u201d</p> <p>We wrote Airplane! but couldn\u2019t get it financed. We were proposing a big broad comedy without comedians \u2013 a completely new concept. Nobody understood the idea of serious actors playing it straight, but for us that was everything. All the studios turned it down until we got to Paramount. Michael Eisner, then president, thought the script was funny. We wanted it to be shot in black and white, on a prop plane, because that was the tone we were making fun of. But Eisner wisely said it\u2019s got to be in colour and on a jet plane so people can identify with it.</p> <p>We realised that to get our jokes the way we wanted them, we\u2019d have to direct. Paramount paired us with a producer, Howard W Koch, who agreed \u2013 but only if he could fire us after two weeks if Paramount weren\u2019t happy. We thought: \u201cWe\u2019ll take that!\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07pPmCfKi3U\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/07pPmCfKi3U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the trailer: Airplane!</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The studio wanted Bill Murray or Chevy Chase, the reigning comic actors at the time. We loved them but they weren\u2019t right. Lines like \u201cI am serious \u2013 and don\u2019t call me Shirley\u201d would have been 50% less effective. Bruce [now Caitlyn] Jenner read for Ted Striker, the ex-pilot, three times but wasn\u2019t right. Sigourney Weaver and Shelley Long tried for Elaine, the air stewardess, and were both good, but Julie Hagerty was so strikingly different we knew she was the one.</p> <p>A bunch of actors turned down the doctor part, among them Vincent Price and Jack Webb. It eventually came down to this guy who wasn\u2019t a famous name but you\u2019d seen him in lots of things. And, of course, it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/29/leslie-nielsen-obituary\">Leslie Nielsen</a>.</p> <p>We told the actors to pretend that they didn\u2019t know they were in a comedy. Leslie loved goofy things and his timing was impeccable. He was born to do comedy but was trapped in serious roles for years. The other thing that\u2019s really important is we took the story seriously. We did all these ridiculous jokes, but always come back to grave danger. It makes the jokes more unexpected. On some moronic level, people do care whether the plane lands and whether Ted and Elaine get together.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWI3JZvvbI4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AWI3JZvvbI4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the trailer: Zero Hour!</figcaption> </figure>   <p>When we were auditioning for the \u201cjive talk\u201d sequence, the script just read: \u201cShi-mo-fo.\u201d We apologised to the actors saying that was the best three white Jewish guys from Milwaukee could do. Al White and Norm Gibbs auditioned together and said: \u201cDo you mind if we do our own thing?\u201d We didn\u2019t write any of that, it was all them. They also coached <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0j2dVuhr6s\">Barbara Billingsley</a>, the passenger who steps in to translate.</p> <p>The film is not about a particular time. It\u2019s a satire on a style of acting and that makes it timeless. Robert Stack, who played Captain Rex Kramer, used to say: \u201cI get it \u2013 we\u2019re the joke!\u201d</p> <p>We believed it\u2019d be a hit, so when it actually was we weren\u2019t surprised. What\u2019s surprising is how long it\u2019s lasted. Today\u2019s comedy artists \u2013 from the Farrelly brothers to Seth MacFarlane and Judd Apatow \u2013 all say how the film influenced them. As more and more fans of Some Like It Hot die off, Airplane! will probably become the No 1 funny movie of all time in polls.</p> <h2>Robert Hays, played Ted Striker</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac9f436117880f148ee15347846cb2c2e6dab634\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac9f436117880f148ee15347846cb2c2e6dab634/0_182_3054_1834/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018On some moronic level, people do care whether the plane lands and whether Ted and Elaine get together.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018On some moronic level, people do care whether the plane lands and whether Ted and Elaine get together.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Paramount</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I read the script on an aeroplane. There was something on every page that made me laugh out loud and the stewardess noticed. I gave it to her when I was done. She was very prim and proper, with her hair in a tight bun. I looked up the aisle and saw her sitting with the script on her lap. A little later, I saw her smiling. Then she started really chuckling. Soon her hair was coming undone and she was laughing uproariously. \u201cThat\u2019s a good sign,\u201d I thought.</p> <p>The film was low budget and we only had seven weeks to shoot it. People say there must\u2019ve been lots of ad-libbing but Jerry, David and Jim knew exactly what they wanted. Jim came to me and said: \u201cTomorrow we\u2019re shooting the scene where you\u2019re boring the Japanese general and we need more dialogue.\u201d I had a heart attack because I\u2019m not a writer. Jim said: \u201cCalm down, you just have to bore people to death.\u201d So I wrote all this stuff that went on and on and on.</p> <p>We laughed every day. I couldn\u2019t wait to get to the set. Leslie Nielsen had this little thing he called his machine. He\u2019d squeeze it and it would make a fart noise. He\u2019d wander over and casually lean against the wall as he was talking \u2013 and let rip. While filming, he\u2019d use it during his lines to me: \u201cMr Striker \u2013 PRRRRP \u2013 can you \u2013 PRRRRP \u2013 land this plane? PRRRRP\u201d Keeping a straight face was the hardest part of the whole film for me.</p> <p>We all thought it\u2019d be cool if it became a cult classic. A friend who had seen the trailer said: \u201cThose are <em>all</em> the jokes, right?\u201d I said, \u201cNo \u2013 just wait.\u201d It broke records in just about every cinema it played in. I was asked to be a presenter at the Academy Awards. It was like winning the film lottery.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>The album to start with</strong></h2> <p><strong>Daydream Nation (1988)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPytYrYqDbA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tPytYrYqDbA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Sonic Youth: Teen Age Riot \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>One of indie rock\u2019s truly sacred texts, Daydream Nation is both a gripping synthesis of the punk, college rock and modern composition that surrounded the young New York band, and a living mood board for so much of what would arrive in the decades to come. During 70 breathless minutes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/sonic-youth\">Sonic Youth</a> drift through refracted spoken-word and musique concr\u00e8te collage, churn through Swans-like rumblings and atonal barrages, and shimmer through a series of pop-rock gems lined with shards of dissonance and sheets of feedback. This is the record that would rightfully earn Sonic Youth a major-label deal and a spot in the United States\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/static/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/documents/daydream%20nation.pdf\">National Recording Registry.</a></p> <p>Sonic Youth sometimes get a reductive rap for just making a racket. Essentially from the start, though, three distinctive songwriters powered the band in tandem, creating records that felt like rollercoasters \u2013 perhaps none more so than Daydream Nation. During its first seven songs alone, Thurston Moore lets Silver Rocket, an explosive rock hit waiting in the wings, collapse in a conflagration of smoking amps. One track later, Kim Gordon\u2019s The Sprawl, inspired by the writing of William Gibson, lulls you with chanted vocals before the guitars split into bedlam, scoring a dystopian daydream. And Lee Ranaldo, the band\u2019s classic rock doyen, pulls Jimi Hendrix and Joni Mitchell into Hey Joni, a song balanced by bright harmonics and shrieking distortion and driven by a sense of trying to outrace the past. If you get from the perfect Teen Age Riot to the powerful Kissability without hearing Sonic Youth\u2019s fundamental songwriting prowess, start again.</p> <h2><strong>The three to check out next</strong></h2> <p><strong>Sister (1987)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r66hAbGi0ys\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r66hAbGi0ys?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Sonic Youth: Beauty Lies in the Eye \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Urgent but articulate, Sister captures Sonic Youth at a quintessential crossroads. In 1987, they were stepping away slowly from their early no-wave pastiche and their purely bracing tirades, and moving toward the art-rock intricacy and coded accessibility that would remain their hallmarks. What\u2019s more, Steve Shelley, a drummer with a preternatural sense for the way the messes Sonic Youth made would move, had settled into his role. Sister\u2019s 10 songs continually fuse melee with melody, danger with delight.</p> <p>If the Pacific Coast Highway evokes images of California\u2019s wondrous coastline, Gordon\u2019s song of the same name makes you fear for the hitchhiking kid on the side of the road, thumb out as the predator pulls up. Their prowling cover of Hot Wire My Heart is one of the more footloose moments in their catalogue, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLeslavEByQ\">Crime\u2019s punk anthem</a> barbed with plangent guitars and blown-out bass. In the late 80s, Moore talked about incorporating elements of pop into Sonic Youth, which became more obvious in the decade to come. Listen to Sister, and you hear those inchoate ideas emerging.</p> <p><strong>Murray Street (2002)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhvLh8bG6Hg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AhvLh8bG6Hg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Sonic Youth: The Empty Page \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Murray Street, recorded in autumn 2001 in their Manhattan studio, close to Ground Zero, might be Sonic Youth\u2019s most staggering guitar album, with Jim O\u2019Rourke helping them realise their angular jam-band dreams. Opener The Empty Page is one of Moore\u2019s most ready-made earworms, its riff versatile enough for an explosive solo and the crystalline bridge that follows. And his Radical Adults Lick Godhead Style, a paean to generations of New York kids surviving only on their own creative fuel, unspools around a tense, stabbing theme, as dark and dramatic as the best of what Interpol were offering. Ranaldo\u2019s Karen Revisited opens wide into a blistering din, gnarled feedback and static blossoming into a delicate ambient murmur. For the parting shot, Gordon\u2019s Sympathy for the Strawberry is a deceptively discordant jangle that frames her reflection on sexual liberation, like a Bildungsroman of desire and dreams. It\u2019s a lingering testament to Sonic Youth\u2019s perpetual ability to warp rock anthems into weird wonders.</p> <p><strong>SYR4: Goodbye 20th Century (1999)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5ro9A5vGcQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/a5ro9A5vGcQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>SYR4: Goodbye 20th Century \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Side projects, short-lived groups and stunts all litter the timeline of Sonic Youth, which has sometimes felt as much like a confederation of independent artists as a band. The SYR series \u2013 a sporadic source of live recordings, film scores and experimental ideas \u2013 served as an outlet for some of the band\u2019s more esoteric interests.</p> <p>On the splendid SYR4: Goodbye 20th Century, Sonic Youth and friends including Christians Wolff and Marclay, Jim O\u2019Rourke and Takehisa Kosugi offer a bracing farewell to the 1990s with a survey of some of the century\u2019s definitive new music. They linger in a miasma of scraped strings and whirring circuits during John Cage\u2019s Four<sup>6</sup> and grind their way through Pauline Oliveros\u2019 charged Six for New Time. Gordon and Moore\u2019s daughter, five-year-old Coco, even screams a Yoko Ono piece. Sonic Youth are modern art lovers who found their fame through music that reflects the Beats and the surrealists, the abstract expressionists and the dadaists. These recordings are every bit as essential to understanding Sonic Youth as Teen Age Riot.</p> <h2><strong>One for the Heads</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://sonicyouth.bandcamp.com/album/live-at-the-warfield-1993\">Live at the Warfield 1993</a></strong></p> <p>Sonic Youth haven\u2019t played since late 2011, when news broke that Gordon and Moore were splitting. In the years since, a smattering of live albums and videos have trickled out, while the quartet\u2019s members have remained busy. In March, <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/sonic-youth-continue-archival-dig-with-1993-live-album-blastic-scene-993478/\">drummer Steve Shelley began uploading Sonic Youth rarities to Bandcamp.</a> This one, captured in 1993 in San Francisco on the heels of their first two major-label LPs, pulls the production sheen from those songs. 100% sports a near-industrial wallop, while Swimsuit Issue is unapologetically frantic, guitars shrieking beneath Gordon\u2019s fusillade. The treat, though, is hearing Shelley hold the centre of a brief nod to fusion during Sugar Kane. As the band scatter slowly into a drone, he tap dances on his cymbals, letting the guitars float around him like the orbs inside a lava lamp. It\u2019s a beautiful, gentle moment \u2013 at least until the band storms in again, much to the applauding crowd\u2019s surprise.</p> <h2><strong>The primer playlist</strong></h2> <p>For Spotify users, listen below or click on the Spotify icon in the top right of the playlist; for Apple Music users, click <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/gb/playlist/listeners-digest-where-to-start-with-sonic-youth/pl.u-GgA55zzCZ1Y9xdW\">here</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Playlist\">  <iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/3Y4lCeLAk4egQp0gWz9j1E\" width=\"100%\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/dec/21/this-much-i-know-kim-gordon-sonic-youth-solo-album\">Kim Gordon: \u2018I'm not a badass, whatever that means\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Further </strong><strong>reading</strong></h2> <p><strong>Sonic Death, Nos. 1\u20137, by Sonic Youth (1991\u20131995)</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bernettpenka.com/pages/books/50399/sonic-death-official-sonic-youth-fan-club-zine-fanzine-no-1-n-d-1991-through-no-7-september-1995-all\">You could spend \u00a31,500 on the full run of Sonic Death</a>, the fanclub zine Sonic Youth sporadically released through the early 90s. <a href=\"http://sonicyouth.com/zines/index.html\">Or just download every irreverent, informative, and hilarious issue from their website.</a> Full of slapdash record reviews, thoughtful and riotous interviews with the likes of Charlemagne Palestine and Bikini Kill, jokes about Weezer and birth announcements, they\u2019re a delightful time capsule for the international rise of weirdo rock.</p> <p><strong>Confusion </strong><strong>Is Next: The Sonic Youth Story, by Alec Foege (1994)</strong></p> <p>This in situ chronicle of Sonic Youth\u2019s ascent to the fringes of the mainstream makes up for what it lacks in historical perspective with its enthusiasm for their importance to the mid-90s.

Gordon is often described as stoic or private, but here she\u2019s funny, disarming and insightful, whether talking about Larry Gagosian, her brother\u2019s mental illness or idyllic family camping trips.

  "<p>As reviews for Barnard Castle go, \u201cI drove 260 miles, broke a pandemic-enforced nationwide lockdown that I personally helped introduce, risked the health of my extended family, rocked the stability of my own career, and torpedoed the reputation of both myself and the actual prime minister of the United Kingdom just to go there and see the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/feb/02/mechanical-silver-swan-flies-nest-robots-exhibition-science-museum\">Silver Swan automaton</a>\u201d takes some beating. I have never wanted to see a small Teesdale market town so much in my squalid little life. I cannot imagine the precious selection of keychains the gift shops there must have. I would risk it all for Barnard Castle.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve somehow missed all this (imagine I am gesturing weakly at Dominic Cummings\u2019 house, where a crowd of agitated neighbours, un-socially distanced TV journalists and \u2013 obviously, always \u2013 some sort of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/led-by-donkeys\">Led By Donkeys</a> stunt van, are all assembled in waiting), then the headline news right now is: a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Daily Mirror found that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/explain-apologise-move-on-johnson-statement-dominic-cummings\"> Dominic Cummings</a>, that Gollum-but-if-he-dressed-from-the-assorted-bags-in-the-backroom-of-a-charity-shop one from the government, broke lockdown in the hardest way possible by driving from London to Durham when his wife had coronavirus. Then \u2013 after a perfunctory WhatsApp-coordinated round of Tory ministers tweeting their \u201cit wasn\u2019t that bad, really\u201d defences of the senior adviser \u2013 a further claim: once in Durham, as coronavirus infections crested nationwide, Cummings zigged out on a nice little day trip to the Castle, then back to London, then allegedly back again to Durham, where an eyewitness says they saw him among some woodlands calling the bluebells there \u201clovely\u201d. Ladies and gentlemen, we got him?</p> <p>For the record, Cummings denies the bluebells story. For some reason, though, it\u2019s this detail that really sells this story to me: I can taste these day trips, I can feel them in my bones. There is something uniquely, unquestionably British about the mediocre 30-minute drive to an underwhelming landmark. Your muscles ache from the cramped car journey. Your mouth tastes milky and chalky from the cheese sandwich you ate from a lunchbox left to warm on the backseat. The sun is in the sky, but it\u2019s threatening to rain in a way where you have to wear a jacket even though it\u2019s slightly too hot for a jacket. For some reason, the whole endeavour is psychically exhausting. And you make useless, observational small talk to the people around you. This is what you risked the United Kingdom\u2019s public health strategy for? An underwhelming, tedious British day trip?</p> <p>But the bigger story here is that people are furious at a Conservative government in a way that years of austerity and cronyism somehow wasn\u2019t enough to inspire: the tinderbox situation of people being stuck inside on a lockdown, still (still!), while at the height of the pandemic a senior government adviser flouted the regulations we all followed to, according to the prime minister on Sunday, resolve his childcare issues. Other people have childcare issues, but follow the rules. Other people desperately want to see their parents, but follow the rules. It\u2019s arguable that the Cummings incident is the first to truly politicise this pandemic (I know: it\u2019s always been political if you\u2019re already feeling political, but a lot of people have been more willing than usual to give Boris Johnson a bit of leeway because, \u201cOh come on, he\u2019s surely doing his best\u201d), because the picture painted is the clearest example yet of One Rule For Us, One For Them. Is Dominic Cummings allowed to leave his house and look at bluebells because, well, he\u2019s Dominic Cummings, and Dominic Cummings follows his instinct? You, however, in your position as \u201cnot Dominic Cummings\u201d, don\u2019t get to do that. You just get to watch your family\u2019s funerals from a distance.</p> <p>This has led, predictably, to Cummings\u2019 defenders being willing to jump on the sword for the infamous wildflower appreciator because he represents their politics, and their politics are sacrosanct, and so the law and logic go out of the window in place of defending the glorious name of the Conservative party. Mike Graham used his morning Talk Radio slot to ceremonially rip up dissenting newspapers. A Times editorial suggests Cummings had been cornered by politically motivated critics. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthancock/status/1264162359733555202\">Matt Hancock tweeted</a> it was \u201centirely right for Dom Cummings to find childcare for his toddler\u201d, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelgove/status/1264126108733186050\">Michael Gove adding</a> \u201ccaring for your wife and child is not a crime\u201d, as though anyone else pandemic-caring for their wife and child without driving close to 300 miles to do it somehow didn\u2019t want it enough. Boris Johnson used an entire coronavirus briefing to talk about his adviser\u2019s paternal instincts. Rightwing commentators have jumped on tame footage of Cummings\u2019 neighbours booing him in the street, attacking people enacting literally the most basic level of protest, as being mortally, illegally insulting and rude.</p> <p>And we are still in lockdown, so what can we do? There are talks of a digital protest, and an 8pm <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/booforboris?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag\">#booforboris</a> on Tuesday night. But there feels a dreadful inevitability to this: despite calls from MPs within his own party, despite public outcry and huge letter-writing campaigns, despite a negative (if you can imagine it!) Daily Mail front page, even if everyone in the country booed out of their window in a baleful howl, it still feels like Cummings will be, more or less, fine. Because his only friend is the most powerful man in the country with a huge parliamentary majority and no election on the horizon. </p> <p>\u2022 Joel Golby is the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant</p>",

  "<p>When the Guardian/Observer and Mirror published fresh claims on Saturday night about Dominic Cummings potentially breaching lockdown rules, Downing Street refused to respond in detail and instead dismissed the outlets as politically motivated \u201ccampaigning newspapers\u201d.</p> \n<p>It is less clear whether No 10 holds the same dismissive view about the Conservative-supporting Daily Mail, which on Monday used a front-page editorial to demand Cummings is sacked and ran the story across 10 pages of furious coverage.</p> \n<p>Under the headline \u201cWhat planet are they on?\u201d, the newspaper\u2019s editorial said Cummings \u201cviolated the spirit and letter of the lockdown ... giving every selfish person a licence to play fast and loose with public health\u201d.</p> \n<p>Just months after enthusiastically cheering Boris Johnson to victory in the general election, the Mail directly attacked the prime minister for sticking by his chief aide: \u201cNeither man has displayed a scintilla of contrition for this breach of trust. Do they think we are fools? For the good of the government and the nation, Mr Cummings must resign. Or the prime minister must sack him. No ifs, no buts.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the process the newspaper set up a test of its power in the face of a government that has repeatedly made clear its disdain for traditional media outlets. It also serves as a check on whether print newspaper front pages still hold sway in an era of declining circulations and whether the Mail has broken the old newspaper editor\u2019s mantra that you should never launch a campaign that you are likely to lose.</p> \n<p>Charlie Beckett, a professor of media and communications at the London School of Economics, <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/polis/2020/05/25/is-the-cummings-covid-scandal-showing-boris-johnson-as-the-british-trump/\">said </a><a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/polis/2020/05/25/is-the-cummings-covid-scandal-showing-boris-johnson-as-the-british-trump/\">while Johnson ha</a><a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/polis/2020/05/25/is-the-cummings-covid-scandal-showing-boris-johnson-as-the-british-trump/\">d not fully adopted the extreme attitudes towards the media</a> of the US president, Donald Trump, \u201che and his Downing Street team are certainly picking up on the details of the current White House approach\u201d of muddying the waters where possible.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor example, attacking the fact-based revelations in the Mirror and the Guardian as \u2018inaccurate\u2019 (in what way? tell us!) and as \u2018campaigning\u2019 journalism (implying it is partisan and discountable). It is similar to Trump\u2019s cry of \u2018fake news\u2019 about any hostile coverage. By attacking the motive of the accuser you avoid addressing the actual charge.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Daily Mail \u2013 which may now be the UK\u2019s biggest selling print newspaper after the Sun withdrew from official circulation figures last week \u2013 holds more political sway with the government. It is aided by directly setting the agenda among its largely Conservative-voted readership and also in terms of its perception among Tory MPs as an early warning system representing the views of Middle England.</p> \n<p>This attitude has led to recent Conservative governments repeatedly recruiting political journalists from the newspaper. James Slack, the prime minister\u2019s official civil service spokesperson, is a former Daily Mail political editor, while Johnson\u2019s recently hired political spokesperson is Jack Doyle, a former associate editor at the paper. The prime minister also employs as director of communications Lee Cain, a former reporter for the \u201ccampaigning newspaper\u201d Daily Mirror.</p> \n<p>Although the Times gave its backing to Cummings, other Tory-supporting papers also raised concerns.

  "<p>It is rare nowadays for a playwright to trigger public controversy and furore to the same extent as did the German writer Rolf Hochhuth in the 1960s, with stage dramas about the alleged indifference of the Catholic church, and specifically Pope Pius XII, to the Holocaust, and an implication that Winston Churchill was behind the 1943 air crash that killed the Polish military leader General W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski.</p> <p>Hochhuth, who has died aged 89, wrestled the shared guilt of his nation\u2019s commitment to nazism into the public arena and in so doing revealed an ability to dramatise both sides of an argument, while pillorying public figures who perpetrated, or appeared to condone, the death camps and the area bombing of civilian targets.</p> <p>Both these major plays, about the pope and Churchill, were premiered in Berlin and performed in London. Der Stellvertreter (The Representative), at the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1963, with the pope played first by Alan Webb, then by <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaryeric-porter-1619844.html\" title=\"\">Eric Porter</a>, had a design by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/dec/18/ralph-koltai-obituary\" title=\"\">Ralph Koltai</a> in which \u2013 as in the script \u2013 a Nazi gas chamber dissolved into the papal throne room in the Vatican.</p> <p>Soldaten (Soldiers), in the West End in early 1969, had been the source of a furious backstage row at the National Theatre between its chair, Lord (Oliver) Chandos, who had served in Churchill\u2019s war cabinet, and its artistic director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jul/11/laurence-olivier-25-years-anniversary-death\" title=\"\">Laurence Olivier</a>, who defended his right to present it, even though he was a Churchill loyalist.

Tynan saw Hochhuth\u2019s play as a means of emulating the RSC\u2019s radical strain of work, in their production not only of The Representative but also in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/peter-brook\" title=\"\">Peter Brook</a>\u2019s sensational stagings of Peter Weiss\u2019s Marat/Sade and of US, a multi-authored play denouncing the war in Vietnam, with the onstage burning of \u201clive\u201d butterflies.</p> <p>Against this background, Soldiers was deferred by Tynan and the producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/mar/09/michael-white-producer-obituary\" title=\"\">Michael White</a> until the inevitable demise of the lord chamberlain in 1968. But it ran for only three months at the New theatre (now the No\u00ebl Coward) and the producers suffered a heavy defeat in a libel case brought by the pilot of the plane on which Sikorski was travelling who had, unknown to them, survived the crash. Tynan and White recovered their losses by producing their Broadway nude revue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/jul/28/oh-calcutta-kenneth-tynan-review\" title=\"\">Oh, Calcutta! </a>at the Roundhouse in 1970.</p> <p>Hochhuth\u2019s plays \u2013 verbose and traditional in construction \u2013 are written in free verse, with flashes of theatrical fireworks amid swathes of detailed argument.

Piscator agreed to produce Der Stellvertreter if the author would cut it from nine hours to four. He did.</p> <p>The subject of the play had already been broached on stage by the French dramatist and screenwriter Armand Gatti, but Hochhuth drilled right down to the moral and ethical issues, as he did in all his writing. MacDonald, a friend and colleague of both Piscator and Hochhuth, denied that the latter ever falsified history, although he could, he admitted, be accused of selecting his facts to fit a thesis \u2013 \u201cbut so can every single historian since Gibbon\u201d.</p> <p>Among the Hochhuth plays MacDonald translated and directed in Glasgow were Judith, a 1984 world premiere, about the assassination of an American president, in the metaphorical context of a 1943 Nazi censorship of a play about the biblical heroine killing Holofernes; and a glittering conversation piece, Mozart\u2019s Nachtmusik (2002), in which the composer\u2019s death was not attributed to Salieri (as in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/06/sir-peter-shaffer-obituary\" title=\"\">Peter Shaffer</a>\u2019s Amadeus) but to a jealous court official whose wife was Mozart\u2019s last pupil and mistress.</p> <p>Also in 2002, Costa-Gavras made a powerful film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/jul/12/1\" title=\"\">Amen</a>, based on one strand of Der Stellvertreter, in which a fictional young Jesuit protests against the pope\u2019s silence by donning a yellow star and boarding a train for Auschwitz. </p> <p>Hochhuth was planning a production of a play about Coco Chanel \u2013 and her conduct and allegiances during the occupation of France \u2013 to be directed in Berlin by Klaus Maria Brandauer. He remained a controversialist, excoriating his government for bailing out what he called Greece\u2019s \u201csham\u201d bankruptcy and petitioning Angela Merkel to grant the whistleblower Edward Snowden asylum \u2013 it was a moral duty, he said, for Germans to do so \u201cin the light of our shameful past\u201d.</p> <p>He is survived by his fourth wife, Johanna Binger, whom he married in 2009; and by two sons, Martin and Fritz, from his marriage to Marianne, which ended in 1972 in divorce.

In the affair of the Durham runner, a wise political strategist would have given simple advice. Prime Minister, just say sorry. Go before the cameras and declare:</p> <p>\u201cMy fellow Britons, I owe you an apology. A valued member of my staff, Mr Cummings, at the early stage of lockdown, faced a family crisis, similar to that which has faced tens of thousands of other families. He and his wife realised they might both be infected with coronavirus and decided to isolate themselves in the north of England, near where they could find family help. Their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/24/uk-coronavirus-live-dominic-cummings-under-intense-pressure-over-lockdown-breaches\">predicament was understandable</a>, but the journey was against the rules. Those involved in formulating tough policy must be the first to obey it.</p> <p>\u201cI have spoken with Mr Cummings. The lockdown we initiated in March was strict, perhaps excessively so given its blanket nature. But the rules made no exception. Mr Cummings now acknowledges that he broke them, whether in letter or in spirit. He is very sorry. He has apologised to me and is issuing a wider statement to that effect. We are sorry to all who have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/did-dominic-cummings-break-the-law-on-lockdown-rules\">dutifully obeyed lockdown</a>, often at great inconvenience and personal misery, at this clear double standard. These are difficult times for us all. We must be sensible and stick together.</p> <p>\u201cGiven Mr Cummings\u2019s contrition I have accepted his apology, and hope he can rejoin our efforts to get through this period. He is not a minister and I may consider revising his duties at a later stage, but for the time being I see no advantage in losing a trusted aide and disrupting the Downing Street command at this critical juncture. We simply must get on with charting our way forward. We fully understand public feeling, but this is my decision.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, Johnson made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/boris-johnson-defence-dominic-cummings-anger-from-allies-and-opponents-alike\">no such statement</a> on Sunday.

  "<p>Ever since the Bundesliga\u2019s fixture list was released way back in July last year, the timing has looked delicious. For neutrals, the two fixtures that tend to leap out are the confrontations between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. Fans have practically been able to set their watch on the arrival of the return fixture, placed within the span of a week in early April for five of the last seven seasons.</p> \n<p>In 2019-20, the return had a twist. For the first time since 2016, the second match would be played in Dortmund, more significant than it sounds given BVB\u2019s woeful record in Munich in recent years \u2013 six successive Bundesliga losses, with three goals scored and 24 conceded. For Dortmund, another trip to their Allianz Arena field of screams in a potential title run-in would have been a major psychological obstacle.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/24/bundesliga-football-roundup-schalke-augsburg-bayern-dortmund-mainz-leipzig\">Bundesliga roundup: Werner treble fires Leipzig back to third, Schalke crash</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Even if circumstance dictates that the white-hot atmosphere of Westfalen \u2013 which in 2013 prompted the recently departed Mario G\u00f6tze to warm up in the tunnel on his return \u2013 Lucien Favre\u2019s side will be grateful for even adjusted home comforts. The scheduling always offered hope for competitive balance, as well as for Dortmund. For everyone else, there is hope of a contest.</p> \n<p>Now, with the Bundesliga the only elite European league back from hiatus, there will be more watching neutrals \u2013 or perhaps not-so-neutrals \u2013 watching on than ever before. Though a crowd-free German domestic game is not the platform its proponents would have dreamed of, the on-pitch balance is almost as enticing as any could have wished for. Four points separate Bayern, chasing an eighth successive title, from Dortmund. A home win would beckon the world further into the closing stages of the Bundesliga season, via a medium familiar to millions of world football fans.</p> \n<p>It was already neatly packaged \u2013 and had been for some time \u2013 as <em>Der Klassiker</em>, the German equivalent of Barcelona taking on Real Madrid. There is not quite the same historical resonance here: Bayern\u2019s decades-long dominance of the league has meant the epithet \u201cKlassiker\u201d has habitually been applied to a face-off between the <em>Rekordmeister</em> and their biggest threat, none of whom has been exactly eternal.</p> \n<p>That the moniker has stuck to Bayern v Dortmund is not just an expression of how successfully the Bundesliga markets itself on the international stage these days, but of how enduring this rivalry has been over the last decade. BVB\u2019s successive titles in 2011 and 2012, prefacing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/25/borussia-dortmund-bayern-munich-champions-league\">2013 Champions League final</a> between the two teams, are responsible not only for the genesis of this rivalry, but for Bayern\u2019s apparent impregnability of the moment.</p> \n<p>The gall of J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team in denying Bayern two years in a row, then humiliating them in the 2012 German Cup final in Berlin (which Dortmund won 5-2 with a Robert Lewandowski hat-trick) cajoled and provoked the Bavarians into becoming the most ruthless versions of themselves. The tension has continued to crackle in the meetings since, from the robust meeting between the pair at Signal Iduna Park in May 2013, 20 days before the Champions League final, through the defections of G\u00f6tze, Lewandowski and Mats Hummels.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83a9d208042ab9eb2d1df4cc681d46a12dd01b55\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83a9d208042ab9eb2d1df4cc681d46a12dd01b55/0_0_2084_1250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Lewandowski scores for Bayern against his former club earlier this season\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Lewandowski scores for Bayern against his former club earlier this season.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boris Streubel/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Dortmund would like to believe they are now past the stage where they can be picked off by the Bayern behemoth \u2013 and whatever the optics were to the international stage, they had control over Hummels\u2019 exit to a far greater extent than they did those of G\u00f6tze and Lewandowski. Though their budget is just over half that of the champions, a second straight season as genuine title contenders shows that much has changed since 2013, in expectation as much as image.</p> \n<p>So while Erling Haaland and Jadon Sancho are forging their reputation as world superstars in Dortmund, attracting established stars is also possible. Emre Can has arrived for big money from Juventus and Hummels made the return journey from Bayern in 2018 (the former replaced the latter, who has a sore achilles, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/23/bundesliga-roundup-jadon-sancho-cameo-keeps-dortmunds-hopes-alive\">Saturday\u2019s 2-0 win at Wolfsburg</a>).</p> \n<p>Bayern have evolved too since the rivalry took hold, albeit in a more subtle way. The appointment of Pep Guardiola in 2013 underlined their ambitions to become synonymous with a seductive brand of football rather than simply success. Reassuring constants remain \u2013 not least the outstanding form of Thomas M\u00fcller, again superb in Saturday\u2019s 5-2 defeat of Eintracht Frankfurt \u2013 but a desire to add a cosmopolitan streak to old cliches of German grit is clear. The \u20ac80m (\u00a371.6m) signing of the French defender Lucas Hern\u00e1ndez from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 2019 nearly doubled their previous record transfer fee paid \u2013 although the World Cup winner is only on the bench at present.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/10/premier-league-la-liga-bundesliga-serie-a-and-ligue-1-top-scorers-2019-20\">Bundesliga, Premier League, La Liga, Serie A and Ligue 1 top scorers 2019-20</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>With the world watching, this is Bayern\u2019s chance to shatter the myth outside Germany that their relentless winning football is not entertaining \u2013 and, refocused under Hansi Flick, they are as irresistible as they have been at any point since the end of Guardiola\u2019s reign. At 31, Lewandowski is looking better than ever, and has scored 16 times against his former club since leaving in 2014. At the other end Alphonso Davies, the teenage Canadian winger now established as a rampaging attacking left-back with Flick, adds another dimension.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will have to endure phases in which Bayern will dominate,\u201d said Dortmund\u2019s sporting director, Michael Zorc, on the eve of the game with some understatement. He is well aware that doesn\u2019t preclude his side \u2013 so able on the counterattack, as they have shown since returning to action \u2013 from winning. While the scale of the occasion may be reduced, the mere suggestion of jeopardy should be enough to beguile.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4b58e494-009b-4ad9-83d4-381992f1331c\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Results</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Friday:</b> Hertha 4-0 Union Berlin. <b>Saturday:</b> Freiburg 0-1 Werder Bremen; M\u00f6nchengladbach 1-3 Leverkusen; Paderborn 1-1 Hoffenheim; Wolfsburg 0-2 Dortmund; Bayern 5-2 Eintracht Frankfurt.<br><b>Sunday:</b> Cologne 2-2 Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf; Mainz 0-5 Leipzig; <br>Schalke 0-3 Augsburg.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Midweek fixtures</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Tuesday:</b> Dortmund v Bayern; Eintracht Frankfurt v Freiburg; Leverkusen v Wolfsburg; Werder Bremen v M\u00f6nchengladbach. <b>Wednesday: </b>Leipzig v Hertha; Augsburg v Paderborn; Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf v Schalke; Hoffenheim v Cologne; Union Berlin v Mainz</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 While Bayern and Dortmund <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/23/bundesliga-roundup-jadon-sancho-cameo-keeps-dortmunds-hopes-alive\">kept on track with their respective wins</a>, the big game of the weekend was at Borussia-Park, with <strong>Bayer Leverkusen</strong> taking the honours against <strong>M\u00f6nchengladbach</strong>, surging above Marco Rose\u2019s side into the Champions League places. Kai Havertz again struck twice but his second from the penalty spot, moments after Marcus Thuram\u2019s equaliser, earned the ire of Gladbach\u2019s sporting director, Max Eberl, who called the decision \u201cproblematic\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u2022 After their frustrating draw with Freiburg last week, <strong>Leipzig</strong> shot back into third by pummelling their favourite punchbag <strong>Mainz</strong> on Sunday, with the 5-0 victory making the aggregate 13-0 over the season\u2019s two games. Timo Werner, industrious but too far away from goal last week, made up for it by hitting a hat-trick.</p> \n<p>\u2022 How badly must things go wrong for the coach of a Europe-chasing side to be under pressure in the current environment? David Wagner might be about to find out after another miserable <strong>Schalke</strong> display, with <em>Die K\u00f6nigsblauen</em> crashing 3-0 at home to <strong>Augsburg</strong>.</p> \n<p>\u2022 <strong>Werder Bremen</strong> snatched only a third Bundesliga win since September at <strong>Freiburg</strong> to breathe new life into their campaign. The visiting coach, Florian Kohfeldt, rushed straight down the tunnel at full time to \u201cavoid breaching social distancing\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-table\"

He was readmitted to hospital for an MRI scan, which discovered a severely compressed sciatic nerve \u2013 the product, he concluded, of 50 years as a guitarist. \u201cThat\u2019s why I had this feeling that someone was putting a screwdriver in my back,\u201d he said.</p> <p>During the \u201cwhole saga of the painful backside\u201d, May said he experienced 40 minutes of chest pain and tightness that turned out to be a small heart attack. He was readmitted to hospital for an angiogram, which found three blocked arteries. May said he was pressured by some parties to have open-heart surgery, but took alternative advice to have three stents implanted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/CAmCpCjF26v/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

I found it very cheering to come across this millennial-fresh but strongly tradition-conscious voice.</p> <p>Rayaprol (1925\u201398) was born in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secunderabad\">Secunderabad</a> into a Brahmin heritage. After completing his studies at Banaras Hindu University, he emigrated to the US, where his postgraduate degree in civil engineering at Stanford seems to have absorbed him less than the literary scene. He returned to an earlier passion, writing poetry.</p> <p>Various poetic stars entered his orbit at Stanford - <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/yvor-winters\">Yvor Winters</a>, for example, whose austerities he resisted, and <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-carlos-williams\">William Carlos Williams</a>, with whom he struck up a friendship that became an unobtrusive mentoring. One particularly enjoyable essay among Angular Desire\u2019s selections of prose and poetry describes his first visit to the Williams household in 1950s New York: it\u2019s a warmly remembered account of the hearty welcome the venerable older poet gave him. Rayaprol and Williams were in touch until the latter\u2019s death,, and a selection of their correspondence, Why Should I Write a Poem Now?<strong>,</strong> was published in 2018. </p> <p>Godhuli Time comes from Rayaprol\u2019s 1995 Selected Poems. By then, he was back in India. He had returned to the newly independent democracy in the early 50s, and went on to establish a long, successful government career, without abandoning his literary interests. He established a literary journal <a href=\"http://www.srinivasrayaprol.in/east-and-west/\">East and West</a> and published the first of several collections, Bones and Distances, in 1968.</p> <p>Vidyan Ravinthiran says in his illuminating introduction to Angular Desire that Rayaprol \u201cengages unconventionally with Anglo-American modernism but his reading goes back still further: words and sounds \u2026 migrate \u2013 I can think of no better word, for doctors also use it to describe the transference of pain from one limb to another \u2013 out of Tennyson\u2019s verse and into his\u201d. Rayaprol is not the kind of poet who deferentially writes traditional verse to honour a semi-mythical western canon. But you can see in Godhuli Time how, within the clarity and focus of modernism, Rayaprol\u2019s imagination touches English pastoral \u2013 the dusk and the homing cattle might briefly evoke Gray\u2019s Elegy, the faintly comical but tenderly drawn lovers have a hint of Shakespearean comic burlesque about them. At the same time, they and the setting are entirely Indian, while the diction and rhythms are American modernist. The dry humour is what most reminds me of Williams, though.</p> <p>Godhuli Time is unusually sensuous for Rayaprol, but there\u2019s no impression of a west-directed exotic sales pitch. Almost-plain language \u2013 \u201ccow-dust\u201d, \u201csmoke\u201d and \u201cburnt milk\u201d \u2013 immediately sets us down with tingling noses into the new landscape. Though place is so intensely evoked, time dominates place \u2013 or place is indicated only via movement and disappearance. The lovers fly away, the train is fleeting. We and the speaker are never comfortably set down at a destination. Rayaprol\u2019s train and even his land are forms of passing time.</p> <p>There are moments in Rayaprol\u2019s work when the grammatical angle is unfamiliar. \u201cBesides\u201d (stanza two, line three) turns out to be more effective than the expected \u201cbeside\u201d: it implies that the two lovers are not only physically next to the haystacks but that they are present <em>as well as</em> the haystacks. This nudges them gently into their place. It also means that the hay stacks are as surprised as the couple by the speaker\u2019s intrusion. That effect is amusing and forlorn at the same time. Then there\u2019s the coinage \u201csweet everythings\u201d, a beautifully judged redemption of the old cliche (sweet nothings) that only faintly mockingly allows the lovers their radiant possession of the entire universe.</p> <p>The Hindupedia translates \u201cGodhuli\u201d as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Godhuli\">the auspicious time when the dust is raised by cows</a>\u201d. So it signifies dusk, when the cows trundle home from the fields. I don\u2019t know if compound words are typical of Sanskrit or Hindi, but it occurred to me that Rayaprol\u2019s fondness for compounds (never overdone, in my view) may originate from his bilingualism. At any rate, the inventiveness has nothing to do with Dylan Thomas, about whose poetry Williams declared a trenchant warning to the young Rayaprol: Thomas was Welsh and an American poet must avoid the influence.</p> <p>The advice was good, of course, but not to be taken too generally. Rayaprol, an Indian anglophone, learned from Williams, an American. Speech styles need not be stuck in national boundary fences; provided the writer has a good \u201cear\u201d, he can let the voices mingle and procreate. I feel sorry about the life-melancholy inherent in Rayaprol\u2019s concluding lines, in which the impossible \u201chome\u201d seems to allude to so much that can be lost in space and time, but the implications for the artist are more promising. In this and many other poems, Rayaprol shapes the voices and traditions in his head into a new nest of words \u2013 smooth, nourishing, timelessly spring-like.</p> <ul> <li><p>See the poet Dom Moraes for some <a href=\"http://www.srinivasrayaprol.in/dom-moraes-on-srinivas-rayaprol/\">interesting additional comments</a>.</p></li> </ul>",

He said on Monday that the country had managed to get the spread of the virus under control in under two months. Social distancing curbs were loosened for most of the country on 14 May as new infections fell, but the government has kept Tokyo and four other prefectures under watch.</p> <h2>Restrictions ease in Madrid and Barcelona</h2> <p>Major parks and cafe terraces reopened in Madrid for the first time in more than two months <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/25/coronavirus-live-news-us-bars-travel-from-brazil-as-british-pms-adviser-reported-to-police-over-lockdown-breach?page=with:block-5ecb8dd28f0886ce4f5d9d3a#block-5ecb8dd28f0886ce4f5d9d3a\">as the capital and the surrounding region moved into the second phase of the loosening of lockdown restriction</a>s. The Barcelona metropolitan area and parts of Castilla y Le\u00f3n also joined Madrid in the same phase, which allows groups of up to 10 people to meet as long as they maintain physical distancing. Small shops can also open without prior appointments and places of worship can reopen at 30% capacity.</p> <h2>Germany enters recession in first quarter</h2> <p>Falling consumer spending, capital investments and exports <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/25/coronavirus-live-news-us-bars-travel-from-brazil-as-british-pms-adviser-reported-to-police-over-lockdown-breach?page=with:block-5ecb69f58f0864e579f17296#block-5ecb69f58f0864e579f17296\">pushed the German economy into a recession</a> in the first three months of the year, the national statistics office said this morning, as the virus continued to hurt the major economies. Capital investments slumped by 6.9%, private consumption by 3.2% and exports by 3.1% between January and March compared with the last three months of 2019.</p> <h2><strong>Global cases pass 5.4m</strong></h2> <p>There are currently 5,424,718 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, according to the <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University tracker</a>. The death toll stands at 345,296. Both figures are likely to be higher, due to differing test rates, definitions and deliberate underreporting.</p> <h2><strong>China says virus pushing US ties to brink of \u2018Cold War\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has said that Washington seemed infected by a \u201cpolitical virus\u201d but that Beijing would nevertheless be open to an international effort to find the coronavirus source. \u201cSome political forces in the US are taking China-US relations hostage and pushing our two countries to the brink of a new Cold War,\u201d Wang said.

The UK prime minister backed his senior aide at a defiant press conference on Sunday, saying it had been within the rules for Cummings to drive his family 264 miles to his parents\u2019 estate in Durham while his wife was suffering coronavirus symptoms.</p> <h2><strong>Chile\u2019s healthcare system \u2018very close to the limit\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The Chilean president,Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, said on Sunday that the country\u2019s healthcare system is under strain and \u201cvery close to the limit\u201d, as the number of confirmed novel coronavirus infections approached 70,000, after a rapid increase in recent days. The Ministry of Health reported 3,709 new cases in the last day, bringing the total to 69,102. The death toll is at 718.</p> <h2><strong>South Africa announces further easing of lockdown</strong></h2> <p>South <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa\">Africa</a> will further relax coronavirus lockdown restrictions from 1 June, the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has announced, allowing large areas of the economy to fully reopen. \u201cCabinet has determined that the alert level for the whole country should be lowered from level four to level three,\u201d he said in an address broadcast on television, describing the move as a significant shift in approach to the pandemic.</p>",

The threat is real, people are dying, and even some early Covid-19 deniers have been brought around by witnessing sickness and death. But the messaging about what to do about it has been inconsistent and contradictory, with rules changing from city to city, state to state. To cut through the confusion, the simplest thing should be immediately required in every public setting: masks should be made mandatory.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The jerks and trolls will always be with us, but if everyone else is wearing a mask at least they\u2019ll be easier to spot</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I know that making a nationwide order to wear masks in public is not going to prevent all Waffle House shootings \u2013 no law yet created has been able to stop such an inevitability. But during times of uncertainty, we look to our leaders to tell us what we should do. And where are all of our agents of authority? Our president says to wear a mask, but he\u2019s not wearing a mask. He says we should keep our distance, then he shakes everyone\u2019s hand at the press conference. Mike Pence doesn\u2019t wear a mask during a visit to the Mayo Clinic, but later says he regrets it. Cops are walking the streets all the time without masks. The people we usually look to for guidance are either being deliberately confusing or at best cavalier and reckless.</p> <p>People are having to rethink every aspect of their lives right now. How do I make my six-year-old watch this video about math while also attending a Zoom call while also constantly refreshing Instacart to see if a delivery window has opened up for groceries? How do I navigate the unemployment benefits registration system when millions of others are all calling at the same time? How do I get from one place to another when even the thought of getting on a subway causes nervous collapse? We should help people out by establishing one certainty: when you go outside, you put on a mask.</p> <p>Please do not talk to me about science right now. I\u2019ve read the science. It is contradictory, and official announcements about the science are constantly changing. Plus, when you are outside on your one daily reminder that the sun still shines and flowers are in bloom and you are holding the hand of your child whose mask is always somehow sticky and slipping, and a jogger is coming at you and not getting off the sidewalk and sweating and puffing all over you as he passes without a shirt on, is that really the time to start Googling \u201ccoronavirus transmission risk from joggers\u201d, read five or six different sources, and determine what the chances are that maybe you just got infected? Joggers: you are freaking people out. Wear a mask.</p> <p>And I am tired of reading the science, I just want to take some things for granted, so I can use my brain for other things. Like wondering about whether or not my cat knows he is a cat. Or, how are his feet are so small. These are the important things of life.</p> <p>People are clearly anxious about reopening. And one of the easiest ways to ease that anxiety is to require everyone to wear a mask. (And pay everyone a monthly stimulus, and create Medicare for All to help everyone who just lost benefits when they were furloughed or laid off, and organize workplaces to reduce hours and provide adequate protective gear and avoid physical contact with people or potentially infected surfaces.)</p> <p>People love their \u201cfreedom\u201d in this country, by which of course I mean the freedom to freak people out by wearing a gun in public, or trolling people with death threats just for the giggles, and they will want to argue about the order to wear a mask. \u201cDebate me, bro,\u201d they\u2019ll all shout, as they trot out the one piece of \u201cscientific\u201d information they misread in passing on social media between a video of a parrot dancing to a Nicki Minaj song and a stranger\u2019s tearful and heartfelt defense of some multimillionaire celebrity whose feelings were recently hurt by mean comments.</p> <p>But no, actually, I don\u2019t want to debate you about whether masks protect you or the people around you, in the same way as I don\u2019t want to debate about whether the Earth is round or flat or whether vaccines cause autism. Can\u2019t you just feel smug about being right deep down in your heart? You can even talk about it, if you want, as long as the sound of your voice is being muffled by layers of fabric featuring your favorite Disney character. The jerks and trolls will always be with us, but if everyone else is wearing a mask at least they\u2019ll be easier to spot.</p> <p>Mandatory orders need to be enforced, and that creates its own issues in contemporary American society. As the cops tackling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/08/social-distancing-arrests-black-people-new-york-police\">mostly black men and women</a> in the name of \u201cenforcing social distancing\u201d and throwing people into crowded cells without soap or hand sanitizer shows, we cannot rely on our traditional means of maintaining order to make people wear those masks. We cannot rely on a president who freely tells the nation to drink bleach to establish moral authority. So we have to do it ourselves, even when grumbling, even with a \u201cWell, actually\u201d stuck in our throats. You are freaking people out.

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s disdain for the people, country and values his office is supposed to represent is unmatched in recent memory.

And he was reportedly being <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/17/politics/state-department-inspector-general-pompeo-errands/index.html\">scrutinized</a> for using department personnel to conduct personal business, such as getting dry cleaning and walking his dog.</p> <p>But these revelations merely reaffirm a pattern of activities by Pompeo unbecoming of the nation\u2019s top diplomat. When the House of Representatives was in the process of impeaching Trump over his attempt to extort Ukraine for personal political purposes \u2013 an act that Pompeo was aware of \u2013 Pompeo defended Trump while throwing under the bus career state department officials, like the ousted US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who spoke out. Pompeo has regularly ignored Congress, withholding documents from lawmakers \u2013 including during the Ukraine impeachment investigation \u2013 and refusing to appear for testimony. In 2019, the IG released a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000016c-9671-d6fb-a96e-d7ffe9da0000\">report</a> detailing political retaliation against career state department officials being perpetrated by Trump officials. And Pompeo has spent considerable time traveling to Kansas and conducting media interviews there, fueling speculation that he has been using his position to tee up a run for the Senate, a <a href=\"https://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/ranking/release/menendez-calls-for-hatch-act-review-into-pompeo-travel-to-kansas\">violation</a> of the Hatch Act.</p> <p>Pompeo is a natural Trumpist.

But the secretary of state is often the most senior US official that other countries and publics hear from on any number of issues. Even with Trump in the Oval Office, a secretary of state that was committed to the constitution - not Trump - would at least be able to fight for the values that US foreign policy should embody, and shield the department\u2019s day-to-day business from Trump\u2019s outbursts. The work that department professionals conduct around the world \u2013 helping American citizens abroad get home in the early days of the pandemic or coordinating assistance to other countries to cope with the coronavirus \u2013 is vital to American national security, and at the core of the image that America projects abroad.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump is undermining American leadership in incalculable ways, and Pompeo has weaponized the state department on his behalf</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The world today needs principled and active US leadership as much as ever. In a normal world, the US secretary of state would be working through international organizations like the WHO to lead the response to the coronavirus, not threatening to withdraw from the global body. The secretary would be pushing for robust foreign assistance to help other countries fight the pandemic, not <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/20/who-worries-trump-pulling-us-funds-may-hurt-emergency-program-meant-to-help-fragile-countries.html\">cutting</a> funding. They would be trying to find a path that balances working with China on responding to the pandemic with pushing back on the Chinese Communist party\u2019s disturbing behavior \u2013 like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/world/asia/hong-kong-china.html\">signaling</a> it may end Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy \u2013 instead of scapegoating China.</p> <p>But Trump is undermining American leadership in incalculable ways, and Pompeo has weaponized the state department on the president\u2019s behalf. Like Trump, Pompeo\u2019s behavior is sending signals to other countries that the US government is acting more like the autocratic and corrupt regimes that Pompeo so regularly calls out. As Trump hurls daily attacks on the media, Pompeo has taken to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/968bb9a73fde1ce0c083df55fafe72c1\">berating</a> journalists. These assaults by America\u2019s leaders on the free press are giving <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/blogs/on-media/2018/07/donald-trump-fake-news-rhetoric-crops-up-around-the-globe-media-social-media-foreign-affairs/\">cover</a> to dictators around the world to criticize their countries\u2019 media. Firing government watchdogs who are investigating top officials is exactly the kind of behavior that the United States would normally criticize in its annual human rights reports.</p> <p>The fish, they say, rots from the head. And Pompeo, like his boss, is actively undermining the values embodied by the state department, its professionals and the Americans they represent.</p>",

  "<p>While nobody knows anything for certain, all signs are pointing to the NBA at least attempting to resume its season \u2013 which was suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 possibly as soon as July.

It also doesn\u2019t hurt that the teams would be situated in Florida, which seems to be <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/21/860575502/florida-theme-parks-getting-ready-to-reopen-with-anti-coronavirus-measures\">determined to reopen</a> at a quicker pace than most other states in the US. (Whether or not this <a href=\"https://www.news4jax.com/news/florida/2020/05/21/coronavirus-florida-records-1204-new-cases-as-officials-press-on-with-reopening-plans/\">is especially wise</a> is another question altogether.)</p> <h2>How did the idea first come about?</h2> <p>It was first raised a few weeks ago by Yahoo Sports writer Keith Smith, who wrote <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/why-walt-disney-world-would-be-the-ideal-spot-for-the-nba-to-salvage-its-season-142557713.html\">an extended piece</a> (which bordered on an advertisement, at times) about how Disney World would be the perfect place for the NBA season to resume. It seemed, on paper, to be a ludicrous idea \u2013 and some noted Smith is a former Walt Disney World employee. But unconventional problems call for unconventional solutions, and Smith\u2019s idea promptly gained traction within the league itself.</p> <h2>How exactly would this work?</h2> <p>Let\u2019s make this clear: players won\u2019t be shooting hoops among the rollercoasters. In <a href=\"https://www.orlandopinstripedpost.com/2020/5/21/21266496/nba-disney-world-keith-smith-orlando-magic\">an interview with SB Nation</a>, Smith made a strong case that it wouldn\u2019t take much to convert pre-existing spaces into basketball courts. \u201c[The ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex] has three primary indoor facilities that would be the hub of this,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI assume two would be set up for games. The third is a giant, customization space. I think they lay out courts in there for practices and possibly shootarounds \u2026 if necessary, Disney could convert some of their own convention space into practice areas.\u201d</p> <h2>Would playing at Disney World cheapen the 2019-20 season?</h2> <p>For some, sure. For starters, it isn\u2019t yet known whether the league could make up all of the regular season games that have yet to be played. Even if all goes to plan, we could end up with a shortened season. In fact, the league could decide it would make more sense <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/05/23/this-nba-playoff-idea-could-leave-knicks-nets-in-trouble/\">to skip right to the postseason</a>.</p> <p>Also, having all the games take place in one location would render home-court advantage essentially meaningless. Even in the best-case scenario, a NBA champion crowned at Disney World would probably \u201cfeel\u201d different for many fans. One doubts that the NBA itself is too concerned that people won\u2019t take the remainder of this season seriously \u2013 it\u2019s not like the league has had any issues associating its brand with animated characters <a href=\"https://www.spacejam.com/\">in the past</a>.</p> <h2>What would be the biggest drawbacks?</h2> <p>They would be the same drawbacks as trying to continue the NBA season anywhere. Any plan will require frequent testing for Covid-19, not just of the players but of the other NBA and Disney World employees who would be in regular contact with them. Obviously, anyone testing positive would have to be immediately quarantined and, should the number of positive tests get out of hand, the league would probably be forced to shut down for a second time. If that happens, it could very well be the end of the season.</p> <p>Right now <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/5/20/21264742/nba-coronavirus-testing-covid-19\">the league is having discussions</a> with coronavirus testing providers. This leads us to another problem: NBA commissioner Adam Silver has made it clear that the season won\u2019t resume until there are <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29151422/some-nba-teams-allowed-test-asymptomatic-players-staff-coronavirus\">enough tests for the rest of the country</a>. Will we be there by July? That\u2019s impossible to say right now.</p> <p>Then, of course, there\u2019s the worst-case scenario: let\u2019s assume the season starts up again and, as a direct result, somebody gets infected and suffers life-altering health effects or dies. What if there are multiple coronavirus-related deaths because of the resumption? It\u2019s something that will weigh on the minds of those deciding whether to play in the middle of a pandemic. Is the NBA so eager to crown a champion for the that it is willing to risk a tragedy at the so-called Happiest Place on Earth? The answer is starting to look more and more like \u201cyes\u201d.</p>",

the two countries may be at risk over Victorian participation in China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative.<br><br>The ambassador, <strong>Arthur Culvahouse Jr</strong>, said in a statement issued late yesterday that he wanted to \u201cset the record straight\u201d after seeing the headlines that arose after the secretary of state\u2019s interview on Sunday morning.<br><br>Culvahouse said the US had \u201cabsolute confidence in the Australian government\u2019s ability to protect the security of its telecommunications networks and those of its Five Eyes partners\u201d and it commended Australia\u2019s leadership on the issue of 5G network security.<br>Insisting Pompeo had been answering questions about a hypothetical, the ambassador said the notion that Australia would pursue initiatives risking the integrity of networks was \u201ca very remote hypothetical\u201d.<br><br>The diplomatic clean-up stems from an interview Pompeo gave to Sky News Australia\u2019s self-styled Outsiders program early yesterday (notwithstanding the fact the US secretary of state would arguably fit the very definition of an insider).<br><br>When asked about the Victorian state government\u2019s participation in <strong>Xi Jinping</strong>\u2019s signature infrastructure scheme, Pompeo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/24/morrison-urged-to-confront-trump-over-concerns-us-china-trade-deal-is-hurting-australia\">urged the citizens of Australia to scrutinise any proposals \u201cincredibly closely\u201d</a>, saying while the US would continue to work with \u201cgreat partners like Australia\u201d, his country \u201cwill not take any risk to our telecommunications infrastructure, any risk to the national security elements of what we need to do with our Five Eyes partners\u201d:<br><br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I don\u2019t know the nature of those projects precisely, but to the extent they have an adverse impact on our ability to protect telecommunications from our private citizens, or security networks for our defence and intelligence communities, we will simply disconnect, we will simply separate. We\u2019re going to preserve trust in networks for important information. We hope our friends and partners and allies across the world, especially our Five Eyes partners like Australia, will do the same.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>(Unfortunately the interviewer, <strong>Rowan Dean</strong>, did not follow up with a question to check the likelihood of the US \u201csimply disconnecting\u201d with Australia as Dean had to move on to his next question, which began with: \u201cPresident Donald Trump \u2013 I love his tweets, they\u2019re brilliant, great sense of humour ... \u201d)<br><br>Pompeo\u2019s comments raised eyebrows in Canberra because the Australian government has already blocked the Chinese-owned Huawei and ZTE from Australia\u2019s 5G network in response to security advice \u2013 a decision, made in 2018 and backed by the US, that Beijing still cites as a source on ongoing diplomatic tension, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/17/china-accuses-australia-of-discriminating-against-huawei\">as Amy reported earlier this year</a>.<br><br>The comments also raised questions in Victoria, given the state government\u2019s agreement to explore areas of cooperation with China over infrastructure investment is in its early stages and no particular projects have been locked in. A Victorian government spokesperson said yesterday the state would not agree to telecommunications projects under the Belt and Road Initiative \u2013 and noted telecommunications regulation was a federal responsibility.<br><br>For his part, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> told reporters at a press conference yesterday the federal government had never supported Victoria\u2019s BRI decision, and it was \u201cthe usual practice for states to respect and recognise the role of the federal government in setting foreign policy\u201d.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-24T22:35:55.497Z\">at 11.35pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecae7c98f0864e579f17071\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-24T21:39:17.585Z\">10.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Josh Frydenberg</strong> turned up on ABC News Breakfast this morning.</p> \n  <p>He was asked if he would accept the Covid select Senate committee invitation, as requested by the non-government MPs, and appear for a special hearing into the $60bn jobkeeper screw-up.</p> \n  <p>Frydenberg doesn\u2019t look overly impressed. </p> \n  <p>\u201cYou know this is just a political stunt from the Labor party,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhen they were last in government, they accepted a convention which is House of Representative ministers do not appear in front of Senate committees ... <strong>Julia Gillard, Greg Combet, Peter Garrett and Kevin Rudd </strong>did not appear before Senate committees, so this is again, just a Labor stunt.\u201d</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BreakfastNews/status/1264663494835617792\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mjrowland68?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@mjrowland68</a>: Will you front this Senate committee inquiry to explain this [$60b JobKeeper mistake] in detail?<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoshFrydenberg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JoshFrydenberg</a>: You know this is just a political stunt from the Labor Party. <a href=\"https://t.co/8LlfnAiGz1\">pic.twitter.com/8LlfnAiGz1</a></p>\u2014 News Breakfast (@BreakfastNews) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BreakfastNews/status/1264663494835617792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 24, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Oh, and there will be no \u201cwholesales changes\u201d to the jobkeeper program, even though the \u201cline\u201d the government drew was under a different forecast model, which, thanks to the successful health campaign, has not proved to be reality. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-24T22:33:59.797Z\">at 11.33pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecadbd88f08a1782fa80d28\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-24T21:19:57.112Z\">10.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Good morning</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Public school students in several states and territories are returning to face-to-face teaching today.

It\u2019s crazy these days,\u201d said the driver.</p> <p>In theory, the towing industry is regulated at a municipal level in Ontario, but according to the Canadian Automobile Association, only 17 of Ontario\u2019s 444 municipalities have clear rules, meaning swaths of the province have become a free-for-all for drivers looking to circumvent or exploit exiting loopholes.</p> <p>Companies say they also want clear regulations for truck maintenance and safety \u2013 as well as better training standards for drivers.</p> <p>Henderson says a number of \u201cunscrupulous\u201d drivers are using modified trucks \u2013 not actual tow trucks. \u201cIf an unlicensed, unregulated guy picks up your vehicle, he\u2019s never going to see you again. He\u2019s going to charge you as much as he thinks you\u2019re going to pay.\u201d</p> <p>With the government preoccupied by the coronavirus pandemic, businesses worry that legislation that has been repeatedly proposed will once again be forgotten.</p> <p>But Henderson hopes the recent shooting will put lingering crisis back in the spotlight.</p> <p>\u201cBecause let\u2019s be clear: someone was killed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to fix this.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Victoria has come under fire from federal Coalition MPs over its agreement under China\u2019s belt and road initiative, but what does it mean for Victoria and Australia\u2019s foreign policy towards China?</p> <h2>What is the belt and road initiative?</h2> <p>It\u2019s the Chinese government\u2019s estimated $1.5tn foreign and economic policy, announced in 2013, to establish maritime trade routes across the globe and invest in infrastructure projects in dozens of countries. The projects include pipelines, ports, railways and other major infrastructure projects.</p> <p>Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/25/belt-and-road-forum-chinas-project-of-the-century-hits-tough-times\">Chinese media reported</a> 170 memoranda of understanding had been signed with 125 countries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/24/morrison-urged-to-confront-trump-over-concerns-us-china-trade-deal-is-hurting-australia\">Morrison urged to confront Trump over concerns US-China trade deal is hurting Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Why did Victoria sign an agreement with China?</h2> <p>In 2018, premier Daniel Andrews signed a <a href=\"https://www.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/2019-02/Belt-and-Road-Initiative-MOU.pdf\">memorandum of understanding</a> with China\u2019s national development and reform commission to work together on belt and road initiatives.</p> <p>At the time, Andrews said the agreement was aimed at his massive state infrastructure program.</p> <p>\u201cWith the biggest infrastructure program in our state\u2019s history under way, we have the design and delivery skills China is looking for, meaning more jobs and more trade and investment for Victorians,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIn four years we have more than tripled Victoria\u2019s share of Chinese investment in Australia and nearly doubled our exports to China. We said we\u2019d reboot our relationship with China and we\u2019re getting it done.\u201d</p> <p>This was followed by <a href=\"https://www.vic.gov.au/bri-framework\">a framework</a> that established a working group, with an aim to get a roadmap on the partnership opportunities between China and Victoria agreed upon by the middle of 2020. So far, no roadmap has been released.</p> <p>The framework reveals the partnership is looking to go beyond Chinese investment in infrastructure, including potential partnerships on biotechnology, agriculture, food, cosmetics, and a wide variety of industries.</p> <h2>What does the agreement force Victoria to do?</h2> <p>Nothing. It is not a legally-binding agreement, but so far the Victorian government is not backing away from it.</p> <p>Victoria\u2019s treasurer, Tim Pallas, told a parliamentary inquiry this month that the state would \u201cabsolutely not\u201d reconsider its belt and road agreement, and accused the federal government of \u201cvilifying\u201d China over its push for an international inquiry into the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>The federal government has not signed a similar agreement, instead stating that BRI projects will be assessed on <a href=\"https://www.watoday.com.au/politics/western-australia/why-wa-is-china-s-next-target-in-its-controversial-belt-and-road-scheme-20190611-p51wjg.html\">a case-by-case basis</a>, rather than signing an overarching MoU or agreeing to any roadmap like Victoria.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/23/daniel-andrews-victorias-dictator-or-just-a-wildly-popular-unstoppable-political-force\">Daniel Andrews: Victoria's dictator, or just a wildly popular, unstoppable political force? | Gay Alcorn</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Why are Coalition MPs so concerned about it?</h2> <p>Western countries, particularly the United States, have expressed scepticism about China\u2019s motives underlying the BRI.</p> <p>\u201cAn agenda is probably the best way to describe it,\u201d the then prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, <a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/turnbull-plays-down-belt-and-road-fears\">said when asked</a> why the federal government had delayed signing on in 2017.</p> <p>\u201cWe obviously welcome Chinese investment that meets our foreign investment guidelines but we\u2019d prefer to focus on specific projects and investments rather than engaging in generalities.\u201d</p> <p>The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, was one of several Coalition members, including senators James Paterson and Matt Canavan, who criticised Victoria for making the deal.</p> <p>Dutton described BRI as \u201ca propaganda initiative from China\u201d that brings an \u201cenormous amount of foreign interference\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cVictoria needs to explain why it is the only state in the country that has entered into this agreement,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Paterson accused Victoria of undermining the federal government\u2019s response to China in the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p>On Sunday the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Victoria was stepping into federal government policy territory.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t support that decision at the time they made [the agreement]. And national interest issues on foreign affairs are determined by the federal government, and I respect their jurisdiction when it comes to the issues they\u2019re responsible for and it\u2019s always been the usual practice for states to respect and recognise the role of the federal government in setting foreign policy.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s always been a good practice.\u201d</p> <p>The Liberal opposition in Victoria has questioned why the agreement was not able to protect Victorian farmers from the 80% tariff placed on Australian barley by the Chinese government this month.</p> <h2>Could it lead to Chinese telecommunications infrastructure in Australia?</h2> <p>No more than is already here in the 4G networks that use Huawei today.</p> <p>The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, told the Sky News Outsiders program on Sunday that communication channels could be severed if Victoria allowed China to fund telecommunications infrastructure in Australia.</p> <p>He said the US would \u201cnot take any risk to our telecommunications infrastructure, any risk to the national security elements of what we need to do with our Five Eyes partners\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to protect and preserve the security of those institutions, so I don\u2019t know the nature of those projects precisely, but to the extent they have an adverse impact on our ability to protect telecommunications from our private citizens, or security networks for our defence and intelligence communities, we will simply disconnect, we will simply separate,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The US ambassador to Australia, Arthur Culvahouse, had to backtrack on the comments on Sunday, after it was pointed out that telecommunications projects in Australia are the responsibility of the federal government.</p> <p>In addition to Victoria stating it has not and would not enter an agreement with China over a telecommunications project, federal legislation passed in 2018 giving the federal government veto power over telecommunications infrastructure partners effectively bans Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE from working on 5G and other similar projects in the future.</p>",
  "<p>To the outside eye, Gavanndra Hodge\u2019s childhood must have seemed impossibly glamorous. Her father, the celebrity hairdresser Gavin Hodge, was a man about town and spinner of near-mythic tales; her mother, Jan, a former model. They lived with their two children, Gavanndra and Candy, in a mansion flat in Battersea, not far from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/apr/17/books.guardianreview1\">Chelsea\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/apr/17/books.guardianreview1\">stylish Kings Road</a>.</p> <p>Yet appearances are all too often deceptive and Hodge\u2019s childhood, as this fine memoir makes clear, was an altogether more precarious affair.</p> <p>Sitting up late at night with her father, the seven-year-old Hodge would silently worry about fire and death as members of Chelsea\u2019s drug-addicted aristocracy paraded through, eager to buy the newest batch of \u201cAfghani\u201d from her father, who would join them in shooting up, nodding off and getting high.</p> <p>\u201cI could sense their anticipation. It was like electricity \u2026 they played with lighters, examined their hands, jiggled their feet. They tapped their cigarettes against the ashtrays, sometimes spilling and leaving molten crumbs \u2026. Sometimes I would spring up and stub one out with my toe.\u201d</p> <p>At the centre of <em>The Consequences of Love</em> is a tragedy: the shocking death of Hodge\u2019s younger sister, Candy, on a family holiday in Tunisia. Candy was nine when she died from a rare airborne virus and Hodge doesn\u2019t flinch from describing her horrifying final moments: \u201cYou were running, one way and then the next, as though you were being hunted and you didn\u2019t know the way to safety \u2026. A trickle of phlegmy blood dribbled down the side of your mouth, making a zigzagging trail of red spots on the carpet.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a09f94f99e9792043bdbdd4107946d4b7eae026\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a09f94f99e9792043bdbdd4107946d4b7eae026/483_154_1591_2497/637.jpg\" alt=\"Gavanndra Hodge and her father on her wedding day in Devon.\" width=\"637\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gavanndra Hodge and her father on her wedding day in Devon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gavanndra Hodge</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The tragedy destroys Hodge\u2019s family, sending her father back to the bottle and needle and leading her mother to find solace in religion. Eventually, after another act of betrayal, they divorce. Candy, meanwhile, is \u201clocked away\u201d in a series of boxes, one holding the clothes and toys she most loved and the other her ashes.</p> <p>Hodge herself goes on to build a successful career in journalism, becoming the deputy editor of <em>Tatler</em>. She achieves this by building a wall between past and present, so that \u201cwhen people meet me, they do not see the daughter of a philandering junkie, they do not see the girl who watched her sister die in a hotel room in Tunisia, they see an articulate, educated, confident woman. They see success, not skin-of-the-teeth survival.\u201d</p> <p>The cost of sealing off those memories lies at the heart of this story. Hodge marries, has two children and builds an outwardly perfect life. Yet, beneath that swanlike surface, her legs are paddling like mad, desperately trying to hold everything together and, more importantly, to keep that past from seeping through.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t always work. Hodge is honest about the drunken nights and hungover mornings when she hides from her children and husband, about the ways in which her history constantly threatens to ambush her and the \u201cstrange thoughts\u201d that she tells no one about because \u201cthey are horrible and ugly and I don\u2019t want other people to hear them. It might make them think that I am horrible and ugly, too\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"adad2e439f99139c8a2f65df3ed72ffb32435836\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adad2e439f99139c8a2f65df3ed72ffb32435836/0_0_1868_2684/696.jpg\" alt=\"One of the last photographs taken of Candy, Tunisia, April 1989\" width=\"696\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the last photographs taken of Candy, Tunisia, April 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gavanndra Hodge</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She is similarly acute at describing her lost teenage years, in which she and her friends hang out at her father\u2019s last remaining salon, snorting cocaine with him while he flirts indiscriminately. \u201cEveryone else took their turn, bending forwards over the table, each of them, one by one, in front of my father, their shirts falling open, while he watched and twinkled with great satisfaction.\u201d</p> <p>This would be almost unbearable to read were it not for the compassion with which Hodge tells her dark tale and the relationships at its core. For <em>The Consequences of Love</em> is not only the story of how Hodge came to let her memories of her younger sister back in, but also that of her relationship with another sister, Maranda, her father\u2019s daughter by an earlier liaison, and the forging of a friendship that isn\u2019t always easy but which becomes steadfast and true.</p> <p>Most of all, however, this memoir is an acknowledgment that love demands a price. As a child, Hodge loved her father with an intensity that not only ignored his flaws but also gilded them with a tarnished glamour. Now, as an adult, she admits, \u201che damaged people and that damage lives on even though he has gone\u201d.</p> <p>Yet, as this wise and moving memoir makes clear, if you are prepared to meet the price \u2013 to accept unflinchingly all the different parts that live within you, both beautiful and ugly, and to acknowledge that others see and love them, too \u2013 then the rewards are worth the heartache.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Consequences of Love</em> by Gavanndra Hodge is published by Michael Joseph (\u00a314.99).

  "<p>And so it is that we reach a watershed point in the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis, manifested in a tangle of stories all unified by vivid themes: power concentrated at the centre, a lack of meaningful checks and balances, and the exposure by incompetence and arrogance of the mess beneath. Primary schools are meant to partly reopen next Monday, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/government-rows-back-on-1-june-english-primary-schools-reopening-plan\">many are in no position to do so</a>; a test-and-tracing regime that should have materialised weeks ago is still frantically being assembled. And then along come the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/23/new-witnesses-cast-doubt-on-dominic-cummingss-lockdown-claims\">revelations</a> of Dominic Cummings\u2019s wanderings \u2013 ostensibly a tale of one man\u2019s self-importance, but really the story of an unelected courtier whose influence and reputation speak volumes about how broken our system of government now is.</p> <p>One recurrent spectacle has defined the last couple of months: ministers, presumably egged on by their advisers, grandly issuing their edicts, only for people to insist that they simply do not match the reality on the ground. The schools story is one example; another was the shambolic and arrogant way that Boris Johnson announced the shift from \u201cstay at home\u201d to \u201cstay alert\u201d, and his call for droves of people to return to work. Watching the leaders of Wales and Scotland insist they had no input into the government\u2019s change of message and then stick to their existing lockdowns was a stark reminder that the UK is continuing to fragment. In England, meanwhile, the council leaders and mayors who were suddenly faced with huge consequences for transport and public health had been caught on the hop. \u201cNo one in government thought it important to tell the cities who\u2019d have to cope,\u201d said the Greater Manchester mayor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/16/are-we-all-in-this-together-it-doesnt-look-like-it-from-the-regions\">Andy Burnham</a>. Nick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle city council, told me last week: \u201cThe first I knew about it was when I saw it on TV.\u201d</p> <p>For the opening phase of the crisis, Forbes explained, he had joined a weekly conference call of council leaders and chief executives, addressed by Robert Jenrick, the communities and local government secretary. He is not the only figure from local government who has told me that the calls are now handled by more junior ministers, and are no longer weekly. A few days ago, I spoke to another city leader who said that long-awaited government guidance on arrangements for social care and help for businesses had finally arrived last Friday, ahead of the bank holiday weekend. He also expressed huge frustration about the issue that arguably highlights the shortcomings of our top-down system most glaringly: the supposed arrival of a <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-world-beating-track-and-trace-system-ready-for-schools-to-reopen-pm-promises-11991606\">\u201cworld-beating\u201d testing and tracing system by next Monday</a>, and the ongoing saga of how it will work and who will run it.</p> <p>On testing, rather than following the kind of devolved, pluralistic model that has worked so well in Germany, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has so far stuck to the usual centralised script, something exemplified by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/28/concerns-over-delays-and-errors-at-uk-drive-in-coronavirus-test-centres\">drive-through testing centres</a> contracted at speed to such private companies as Deloitte, Sodexo and Boots, and often situated in inappropriate locations. On its hobbling progress towards a system of contact tracing, the government at first followed much the same logic, attempting a centralised system of call centres involving such private companies as the outsourcing giant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/20/serco-accidentally-shares-contact-tracers-email-addresses-covid-19\">Serco</a>, staffed by new recruits who had apparently been given the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/no-one-had-any-idea-contact-tracers-lack-knowledge-about-covid-19-job\">cursory training</a>.</p> <p>The councils who have the kind of forensic local knowledge and experience any tracing efforts will depend on were at first left in the dark. Then, less than three weeks before the system was meant to be in place, it was announced that the chief executive of Leeds city council had been made \u201c<a href=\"https://www.lgcplus.com/politics/coronavirus/boost-to-local-government-role-in-covid-tracing-as-riordan-named-national-lead-13-05-2020/\">national lead on tracing</a>\u201d, and that councils and their public health directors were to have a role after all. Throughout last week, senior people in city and local government were still telling me that though this sounded positive, they had no clear idea of what they were going to be asked to do. But on Friday afternoon, the government announced that councils would be working with Whitehall <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/300-million-additional-funding-for-local-authorities-to-support-new-test-and-trace-service\">\u201cto support test and trace services in their local communities</a>\u201d and \u201cdevelop tailored outbreak control plans\u201d.</p> <p>As one city leader told me, the announcement came at \u201cone minute to midnight\u201d. The \u00a3300m that was now allocated to English councils for the work was, he said, \u201ccompletely pitiful\u201d. The thinking at work was plain: seemingly in a fit of panic, the people who run cities, counties and boroughs had been belatedly tacked on to a plan that should have had them at its core all along. Perhaps the most painful thing was that this mistreatment was hardly a surprise: if councils are suddenly being praised by ministers, it hardly makes up for a decade of savage cuts to basic local services, an aspect of the Covid-19 crisis that is still overlooked.</p> <p>Which brings us to the subject too often obscured by the government\u2019s convulsions: money. Two weeks ago, the <a href=\"https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/politics/yorkshire-councils-could-declare-themselves-bankrupt-months-due-pandemic-2846622\">Yorkshire Post reported</a> on the prospect of \u201cmany of the 22 local authorities in the Yorkshire and the Humber region making a choreographed joint declaration that they have run out of money\u201d. In Newcastle, Forbes told me the city council now faced an in-year financial gap of \u00a345.5m. When ministers and their cheerleaders announce this or that funding boost and insist there will be no return to austerity, it is worth bearing in mind that austerity is still an ongoing reality for large chunks of the country.</p> <p>Just about every aspect of our current national impasse proves that the old centralised game is up, and that England needs a new constitutional settlement. This does not strike me as a left/right issue, unless you are the kind of Tory who thinks that the neglect and outright destruction of local government ought to be a necessary part of your politics.

  "<p>I have said it before and I\u2019ll say it again \u2013 finding good trash in the age of quality television is HARD. It has to sit firmly in the Goldilocks zone: not too good, not too bad, holding together but never threatening greatness. It\u2019s a small target to hit, and of course, every viewer\u2019s tolerance varies slightly.</p> <p>For the avoidance of doubt \u2013 I mean drama series trash, not daytime TV or fun evening ephemera such as Queer Eye. I mean something with a story that you can still follow while you\u2019re mostly staring at your phone, and characters just above cipher-level in whom you can become marginally invested while you put your phone down, eat your dinner and drink your wine.</p> <p>But good news! Cometh the Covid hour of comfort-watching need, cometh the trash \u2013 this time on a giant armoured train, 1,001 self-sustaining carriages long, unstoppably circling an Earth \u201cfrozen to the core\u201d by attempts to reverse global warming! I know. You\u2019re hooked already, right? And that\u2019s even before you know that this funicular ark was meant to carry only the elite, but was stormed by proles at the last minute before it began its endless journey, who live in dire conditions at the back, reluctantly fed on nutritional jelly slabs by guards and planning rebellion, while the billionaires, beauties and businessmen live upfront in sybaritic luxury. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen \u2013 let me just check your tickets \u2013 to Snowpiercer (Netflix). It should hit the spot for just about everybody.</p> <p>The TV series is based on the original series of graphic novels by Jacque Lob, Jean-Marc Rochette and Benjamin Legrand, and Bong Joon-ho\u2019s 2013 film, which took the novels and stripped them down into a rigorous yet somehow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/20/snowpiercer-first-look-review-edinburgh-2014\">absolutely demented fable about life under capitalism</a>. If you have not already had the pleasure, go and watch it now. We will Zoom-rave about Tilda Swinton\u2019s off-the-chain performance as the train\u2019s nutso overseer \u2013 Margaret Thatcher-as-Jane-Horrocks-by-way-of-Victoria-Wood-and-Maggie-Smith in furs and a set of buck-tooth prosthetics \u2013 when you get back.</p> <p>Snowpiercer the series manages, gloriously, to bypass all that is great and almost all that is good about both of its sources of material, and turn it instead into a police procedural that just happens to be set on the aforementioned giant armoured train. Think of it as steampunk Law &amp; Order. CSI: Wastelands. NYPD Brrr, It\u2019s Cold. Send me a postcard if you want more of these. I\u2019m self-isolating again. I got time.</p> <p>Andre Layton (Daveed Diggs) is one of the stowaways. They are called Tailers because they live in the far end of the train called the Tail and they do that because the budget went on creating the exterior shots of the train plunging through icy wastelands and not on the script, as is trash-right and proper. The Tailers are plotting revolution. Layton is urging caution when he is suddenly summoned Up Front by \u201cvoice of the train\u201d Melanie Cavill (Jennifer Connelly) who is in charge of executing the directives of the revered Mr Wilford \u2013 the godlike, unseen inventor of the train. Layton used to be a homicide cop, and there is a serial killer preying on third-class passengers and threatening the fragile, well, Law &amp; Order, you might say, of the train. Mr Wilford needs him to solve the crime.</p> <p>OK.</p> <p>Layton is the only former homicide cop on the train. The train that has a miniature ocean to supply fresh sea urchins to its paying passengers and full-sized hydroponic cherry trees in one of its 300 agricultural carriages did not install any kind of police presence.</p> <p>OK.</p> <p>Layton\u2019s ex, who chose to leave the Tail five years ago to work in the Night Car \u2013 OK \u2013 is one of the suspects.</p> <p>OK.</p> <p>Layton is now perfectly placed to case the entire train and plan a proper revolution while he solves the murder.</p> <p>OK?</p> <p>OK. I think that\u2019s all you need. There\u2019s a gory fight scene, a near-love interest, a sweet child, some half-hearted gesturing towards class loyalty, trust and treachery, and a twist at the end of the first episode that you probably saw coming before the opening credits. Exposition barrels along faster than the train itself (\u201cJust making a quick stop at Gun on the Mantelpiece Station!\u201d). In short, it\u2019s perfect. Sit back, relax and take in the trash. </p>",
  "<p><strong>This House is set in the </strong><strong>parliamentary whips\u2019 office of the 1970s. What level of access did you get to the world of whips?<br></strong>As a twenty-something, I knocked on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/nicholas-hytner\">Nicholas Hytner\u2019s</a> door and said: \u201cI know I\u2019m young but can I do this play?\u201d I hadn\u2019t done any research and I didn\u2019t know all the elements of the story at the point he said yes. I was aware that whips traditionally operate with a complete code of silence. The whips\u2019 office is a sealed-off world, which is why it was so exciting, but I also knew that if they didn\u2019t talk to me there would be no play.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/30/this-house-five-star-review-james-graham-national-theatre-garrick\">This House five-star review \u2013\u00a0James Graham's thrilling political play returns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I got access through a mix of luck and belligerence. I wrote to people who had left office and some were willing to talk to me. I found myself sitting in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/23/walter-harrison\">Walter Harrison\u2019s</a> front room in Wakefield \u2013 he was in his 90s then and known as being the greatest whip of modern times \u2013 and also on a train to Sheffield with a packed lunch to visit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/07/joe-ashton-obituary\">Joe Ashton</a>. He later invited me into the House of Commons and we were walking through the lobby when he passed his friend, [Baroness] Ann Taylor, who was someone I was desperate to talk to because she had been a young, working-class female whip from Bolton in the 70s. She unlocked the whole play for me, introducing me to other people and being such a force for good. By complete luck, my constituency MP in Ashfield was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/geoffhoon\">Geoff Hoon</a>, who had been chief whip. I wrote to him and we met at the whips\u2019 office. I took mental pictures of everything from the desks to the fireplace. I felt like a spy.</p> <p><strong>You have written other politics dramas since This House</strong><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>was first performed in 2012. What draws you to the subject?<br></strong>I come from a working-class family in a Nottinghamshire mining town. I can only assume my adult obsession with structures of power comes from an absolute sense of powerlessness in a community like that. Despite the human devastation of the economic policies of the 80s and 90s there was very little done to help my neighbours and my family. So it\u2019s no coincidence that I take an interest in the subject.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biWLqc84mgY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/biWLqc84mgY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>Do you think political theatre can be an engine for change?<br></strong>Without a doubt, but I also accept that a single play may not change a piece of legislation. It\u2019s one factor in a wider cultural movement. We need to take the pressure off theatre as a direct influence, but at the same time its influence is significant. Also, there\u2019s an imbalance in the cultural landscape, with so much of it in London, but this <em>does</em> mean that the political classes are going to the theatre a lot. It was quite surreal to see a range of politicians, from George Osborne to John Bercow, coming over from Westminster to watch This House. Other playwrights might resist cross-contamination between the arts and politics but I celebrate it for all the conversations it can start.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/20/gillian-anderson-interview-streetcar-named-desire-national-theatre-at-home\">Gillian Anderson on A Streetcar Named Desire: 'I was hanging on to reality by a thread'</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>The play ends with the \u2018</strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/23/general-strike-public-sector-trade-unions-1979\">winter of d</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/23/general-strike-public-sector-trade-unions-1979\">iscontent</a>\u2019 and the entry of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister. Would you be tempted to write a play about her reign?<br></strong>I\u2019m happy to tell you that I\u2019m writing a kind-of sequel. I\u2019ve joked that writing about the period of the 1970s when This House is set feels a bit like the Star Wars prequel: you know the Death Star is coming, and what\u2019s exciting is the journey. The nation\u2019s drama begins when this play\u2019s light\u2019s go down. I\u2019m unofficially doing the next one off my own steam along with Jeremy Herrin [director of This House]. I\u2019ve been working on it for over five years and I\u2019m hoping lockdown will force me to finish it. It\u2019s not a direct sequel but looking at government and whipping in the period between Thatcher and John Major. I delight in finding unlikely heroes and Major was an extraordinary character despite the perception of him at the time. I\u2019ve written about that part of the 1970s when parliament went crazy and this would be the second.

Did you want to draw parallels between the two?<br></strong>Yes, it was a conscious decision to go back to a hung government of the past. I wanted to channel the past as a parallel to illuminate what was going on. The power of theatre can exist in the terrain of metaphor and poetry. Going back to a past event can elevate a state-of-the-nation play in asking bigger questions about power, government and democracy.</p> <p><strong>A Tory whip in the play tells his Labour counterpart that \u2018We\u2019re not built for co</strong><strong>operation\u2019. Do you think </strong><strong>parliament is set up to be oppositional, not collaborative</strong><strong>? Is the system dysfunctional?<br></strong>I hope the play asks this question of the audience. We saw how the Liberal Democrats were punished for collaboration with the Conservatives. Instead of seeing partnership the way they do in Scandinavian social democracies, for example, all we saw was betrayal.</p> <p>Our entire model is built around opposition and the play\u2019s designer, Rae Smith, arranged the stage the way the House of Commons is designed around having an argument. The idea is that there is \u201cmy side\u201d and \u201cyour side\u201d, and we will never sit together. The Swedish parliament is built as an amphitheatre so everyone is in the round and they sit in the alphabetical order of their constituency. The randomised seating is designed to enforce collaboration between parties. In the House of Commons, the building itself will not allow for that.</p> <p><strong>As a panellist on </strong><strong>Question Time last week you said that theatres were not going to reopen any time soon. Do you think they will look and feel the same when they do</strong><strong>?<br></strong>It\u2019s hard to know but an important question to ask is whether they should look the same. I think we should celebrate the past few years, which, through the relentless campaigning of grassroots people and organisations as well as the backing of leaders, have opened up theatre to make it more diverse and get as many representative voices on stage. It isn\u2019t perfect but positive progress is being made. In the difficult climate that theatre is in now, we have to hold on to asking big questions: how do we reset? Who are we resetting for? How can we speed up access to theatre and the arts for everyone?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aed01f2a3338f0c6fba5cee70ed07073191994db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aed01f2a3338f0c6fba5cee70ed07073191994db/0_0_5649_3392/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phil Daniels in This House\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tick tock \u2026 Phil Daniels in This House by James Graham at the Garrick theatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Big Ben forms a striking backdrop to the set.

  "<p>Opposition politicians across Europe, from cautious centrists to firebrand populists, have had to walk a tricky political tightrope over the past two months, as coronavirus has taken over the political agenda.</p> \n<p>How to stay politically relevant while governments, even when making errors, are benefiting from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/democratic-leaders-win-surge-of-approval-during-covid-19-crisis\">\u2018rally round the flag\u2019 effect</a> and seeing approval ratings rise? And how to hold those governments responsible for their mistakes, without playing political games during a health crisis?</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very hard balance to strike, but there have been moments where we had no choice except to fight back,\u201d admitted the mayor of Budapest, Gergely Kar\u00e1csony, in a recent interview at his office.</p> \n<p>In <strong>Hungary</strong>, where the overall number of coronavirus infections has remained low, the government of the far-right prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has sought to portray the opposition as \u201cpro-virus\u201d, and has put the blame on Kar\u00e1csony for deaths in the capital\u2019s care homes.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was part of the government strategy for the pandemic to create and provoke direct confrontation with the opposition,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The mayor was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/17/gergely-karacsony-mayor-budapest-eu-hungary-liberal-viktor-orban\">elected last October</a> after standing against Orb\u00e1n\u2019s favoured candidate, and is seen as a potential challenger to the prime minister in nationwide elections two years from now. Perhaps with an eye on that vote, Orb\u00e1n has not sought consensus in the coronavirus response. He refused to put a time limit on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">special coronavirus legislation</a> that he pushed through parliament in late March, even though the opposition said it would support it if a sunset clause was introduced.</p> \n<p>In some countries, politicians suspended their traditional bickering at the peak of the crisis, and support for radical political alternatives dried up. In <strong>Britain</strong>, the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, initially offered words of support and cooperation but then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/21/a-timeline-of-the-pms-u-turn-on-the-nhs-surcharge-a-timeline-of-pms-u-turn-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">carefully picked certain battles</a> to highlight problematic government responses.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In <strong>Italy</strong>, the popularity of the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, soared during the crisis, with a small decline in support for the far-right Matteo Salvini. In <strong>Germany</strong>, where there is more of a tradition of consensus-based politics, most of the opposition has refrained from criticising the government up to now. In Germany, both the government and chancellor, Angela Merkel, are enjoying high popularity ratings, with 68% of Germans satisfied with Merkel, the highest of her time in office.</p> \n<p>The far-right populist AfD has struggled to be noticed since the coronavirus crisis began and has seen its popularity ratings fall considerably, while the rest of the opposition has been keen not to be seen to be rocking the boat at a difficult time, meaning it has struggled to make its presence felt.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe style of cooperative opposition is more popular in Germany than that of fundamental opposition. Germans are not only believers in the state but they love decisions made at a round table,\u201d said the political scientist Karl-Rudolf Korte in a recent interview with the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung.</p> \n<p>However, when the economic consequences of coronavirus really begin to hit, the \u201crally round the flag\u201d effect will slowly dissolve, and opposition parties could have a chance to strike.</p> \n<p>Already, there are signs that Conte\u2019s popularity levels are dropping, and with the end of lockdown in Germany, the opposition parties have declared a return to politics as usual as well. \u201cUnanimity over the question of crisis management is over,\u201d Christian Lindner, leader of the pro-business FDP, said recently.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, there was never a period of unanimity in the first place, and political battles have only intensified. In <strong>Poland</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/poland-holds-ghost-election-with-0-turnout\">the government sought to plough ahead with a presidential election on 10 May</a>, in conditions where it would be almost impossible for the opposition to run a proper campaign, at a time when energy was devoted to fighting the virus. At the last minute the vote was cancelled, with a new vote tentatively planned for next month.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe pandemic crisis certainly helped the Polish government to tilt the playing field so opposition candidates do not have equal opportunities during the campaign,\u201d said Edit Zgut, a visiting lecturer at the University of Warsaw. \u201cWhenever the election is scheduled, it will be far from fair.\u201d</p> \n<p>In Hungary, as recriminations between the government and the mayor of Budapest over the handling of the pandemic have increased, the discourse has got personal in rather strange ways. In a recent interview, Orb\u00e1n said Kar\u00e1csony was the sort of person who couldn\u2019t put Ikea furniture together without help. \u201cOr to put what I\u2019m talking about into a rural context, when there\u2019s a traditional pig slaughter this is someone who only turns up right at the end for dinner,\u201d said Orb\u00e1n.</p> \n<p>Kar\u00e1csony said the personal attacks prove the government is rattled by the opposition, and part of a strategy to shift the blame.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe social and economic fallout will be very severe, and they want to tackle that by starting this blame game and making the opposition look like they didn\u2019t want consensus,\u201d he said.</p>",

The auditorium house lights stay up; each exposed seat as raw and red as a ripped-out tooth.

Certainly, it\u2019s a creative flourish that places the footage firmly in pandemic-era Australia.</p> <p>The curtain behind the band stays up, exposing the mechanics of live performance that audiences rarely see.

While the recording and broadcasting studio was catapulted into indispensability, not so for other production staff. Tonight\u2019s gig is knocked together by a team of around 20, Buchanan says.</p> <p>Twenty solicitous techs are still more than Low Life has been lavished with before.

  "<p>For more than a decade, Australia has faced a seemingly impossible choice: whether to strengthen ties with its closest ally, the United States, or with its largest trading partner, China.</p> <p>But the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 which has highlighted the dangers posed by both Donald Trump\u2019s nativism and Xi Jinping\u2019s authoritarianism \u2013 is forcing Australia to confront a new option: choose neither.</p> <p>Trump is not interested in leading the world out of this crisis. Unlike his predecessors, he does not try to exercise global influence by asserting control over international agencies; instead, convinced that such bodies undermine the US\u2019s authority, he tries to ruin them.</p> <p>This approach was on display last week, when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/global-report-trump-threatens-to-pull-out-of-who-over-failed-response-to-pandemic\">threatened to stop funding the World Health Organization </a>within 30 days if it does not agree to unspecified reforms.</p> <p>But the pandemic has also demonstrated the threat to global order posed by Xi\u2019s China, the world\u2019s other great power.</p> <p>The cover-up of the initial outbreak in Wuhan and the unreliability of information released by Beijing have demonstrated that it is not just China\u2019s residents \u2013 particularly its ethnic minorities \u2013 who will suffer the consequences of Xi\u2019s increasingly repressive, secretive rule.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/27/in-a-testy-post-covid-19-world-chinese-sanctions-of-australian-goods-may-be-closer-than-ever\">In a testy post-Covid-19 world, Chinese sanctions of Australian goods may be closer than ever | Richard McGregor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This leaves Australia in uncomfortable and unfamiliar territory. It has committed troops to each of the US\u2019s major conflicts since the second world war to prove its worth as a security ally, but Washington is adding to the instability that the alliance was designed to prevent.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Australia\u2019s economy has become one of the most dependent on China in the developed world. Today, relying on these two great powers as sources of security and prosperity seems increasingly risky. Australia will frequently need to find new partners, or act alone.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the recent response by prime minister Scott Morrison and foreign minister Marise Payne to this predicament \u2013 their push for an inquiry into the origins of Covid-19 \u2013 was a mishandled mess.</p> <p>It not only raises concerns about whether Canberra can competently deal with its emerging diplomatic challenge but \u2013 as Australia now faces a trade backlash from China \u2013 it also shows the potential costs of failure.</p> <p>The call for the inquiry was announced by Payne last month in an interview on ABC\u2019s Insiders in which she appeared to blame China and the World Health Organization \u2013 a position that seemed to echo the White House\u2019s increasingly strident rhetoric. But it quickly emerged that Canberra had not tried to rally support for the proposal.</p> <p>This left Australia as a lone voice on the international stage \u2013 a situation that unnecessarily exposed it to Beijing\u2019s fury.</p> <p>Australia, in the past three years, has prided itself on being the first country in the world to introduce comprehensive laws aimed at curbing Chinese foreign interference and was the first country to completely ban Huawei from participating in its 5G network. But this made it harder for Canberra to try to persuade China that it was not the target of an inquiry, and more likely that Beijing would react with venom.</p> <p>To gather backing for the inquiry, Morrison called Trump, who showed support, and European leaders, who were reluctant to proceed while they were in the grip of domestic Covid-19 outbreaks. Morrison and Payne made no apparent attempt to discuss the proposed inquiry with Beijing, but insisted that China must cooperate.</p> <p>Chinese officials and state media reacted furiously, and with typically churlish aggression. China\u2019s ambassador to Australia warned that Chinese consumers may boycott Australian wine and beef \u2013 and, several weeks later, China cut imports from four Australian abattoirs. It has since imposed 80% tariffs on Australian barley, and has reportedly moved to restrict imports of Australian coal.</p> <p>China did not link these moves to the inquiry. It said the beef ban was due to health and safety concerns, the coal restrictions were to support domestic suppliers, and the barley tariffs followed an investigation launched in November 2018 into claims Australia has been deliberately selling the barley cheaply. As is often the case with China, the exact reason for its decisions remain unclear.</p> <p>In the end, Australia dropped its proposal for an inquiry which would be conducted outside the WHO. Instead, it did what it should have done all along \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/australia-wins-international-support-for-independent-coronavirus-inquiry\">worked alongside like-minded nations to win broad support for an inquiry</a>.</p> <p>It backed a European Union resolution for an independent inquiry that will be conducted by the WHO\u2019s oversight committee, which is chaired by Dr Felicity Harvey, a visiting professor at Imperial College London. Unlike Australia, the EU was not subject to Chinese retribution.</p> <p>China eventually became a co-sponsor of the proposal, which was passed unanimously by the WHO\u2019s 194-member governing body. Notably, Xi, unlike Trump, accepted an invitation to appear before the body.</p> <p>Morrison and the cabinet were right to push for an inquiry. Of course, the world needs to understand this pandemic. And countries such as Australia \u2013 which has the world\u2019s 13th-largest economy - should be willing to lead the push for international action.</p> <p>But, in this new global environment of mistrust and disorder, Australia will need to change the way it operates. It will increasingly need to act without counting on US support, particularly as some of Trump\u2019s stances \u2013 especially his tilt towards protectionism \u2013 gain traction in Washington.</p> <p>It will need to take a more active role in bodies such as the WHO, especially as the US turns it back on such agencies and China tries to assume the mantle of leader. But Australia should allow China an opportunity to act in good faith, rather than provide Beijing with a justification for belligerence. And it will need to consult with other partners, which may be wary of moves that goad China.</p> <p>This is not beyond Australia\u2019s leaders or diplomats. But it will require the government to avoid taking positions that unnecessarily stoke US-China tensions or damage ties with Beijing.</p> <p>Nor should its messages be designed to suit domestic audiences, or dropped without warning in a Sunday morning interview.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jonathan Pearlman is editor of <a href=\"https://www.australianforeignaffairs.com/\">Australian Foreign Affairs</a><em> </em>and world editor of The Saturday Paper</p></li> </ul>",

In the meantime, here\u2019s a few details on today\u2019s round from the Associated Press:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s the second edition of a match between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, the dominant players of their generation and rivals by name, but not necessarily by record. Woods has 82 career victories to 44 for Mickelson, leads 15-5 in major championships and 11-0 in winning PGA Tour player of the year.</p> <p>Mickelson won their first made-for-TV match over Thanksgiving weekend in 2018, a pay-per-view event that ran into technical problems and was free for all. Lefty won in a playoff under the lights for $9m in a winner-take-all match. He also has a 5-3-1 advantage over Woods in the nine times they have played in the final round on the PGA Tour, most recently in the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am in 2012 when Mickelson shot 64 to a 75 for Woods.</p> <p>He also stopped two streaks. Woods was going for his seventh straight PGA Tour victory when Mickelson beat him at Torrey Pines in 2000. Later that year, Woods had won 19 consecutive times on the PGA Tour when he had at least a share of the 54-hole lead until Mickelson beat him at the Tour Championship.</p> <p>Woods, however, captured the streak that mattered, holding off Mickelson in the final group at the Masters in 2001 to hold all four professional majors at the same time.</p> <p>The banter was lacking in Las Vegas, and perhaps having NFL stars Peyton Manning and Tom Brady will change the dynamics. The broadcast includes Charles Barkley providing commentary and Justin Thomas, whom Woods has embraced, on the course as a reporter in his television debut.</p> <p>After this exhibition, golf has two weeks before the PGA Tour is set to return at Colonial in Fort Worth, Texas. Mickelson plans to play. Woods has not said when he will return.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div>"
