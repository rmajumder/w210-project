study as a key tool in the fight against the coronavirus</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Spanish government has hailed a large-scale antibody study as a key tool in the fight against the coronavirus, but warned that any premature or irresponsible relaxation of restrictions could have \u201cenormous consequences\u201d given that only 5% of Spaniards have had the disease.<br></p> \n  <p>The country\u2019s Socialist-led coalition government is under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/spain-path-out-of-covid-lockdown-complicated-by-polarised-politics\">growing pressure from political opponents to end the two-month state of emergency</a> that underpins one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe.</p> \n  <p>On Friday, the health ministry was due to decide whether the Madrid region would be granted permission to follow other areas into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/global-report-spain-and-italy-grapple-with-how-to-end-covid-19-lockdown\">next stage of the de-escalation</a>, which allows up to 10 people to meet and permits the reopening of cafe and restaurant terraces at 50% capacity.</p> \n  <p>Pedro Duque, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/06/new-spanish-pm-appoints-astronaut-pedro-duque-science-minister\">former astronaut who serves as Spain\u2019s science minister</a>, told the Guardian that the preliminary results of a nationwide serological study published earlier this week would be crucial to the government\u2019s response.</p> \n  <p>The <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-05-14/antibody-study-shows-just-5-of-spaniards-have-contracted-the-coronavirus.html\">study, which involved more than 60,000 people</a>, revealed that around 5% of the population \u2013 about 2 million people \u2013 had had the coronavirus. It also showed that 33% of those who had caught the virus had not shown any symptoms.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe think that the seroprevalence test we\u2019ve carried out is the best that\u2019s been done anywhere in the world so far. The most important conclusion we\u2019ve reached is that it is vital to keep acting very prudently when it comes to this illness \u2013 there are still a lot of people who haven\u2019t been exposed to the virus,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Duque said the pronounced geographical variations underscored the need for a region-by-region loosening of restrictions: while Murcia, Melilla, Asturias and the Canary islands showed an infection rate of less than 2%, the proportion rose to more than 10% in the regions of Madrid and Castilla-La Mancha.</p> \n  <p>\u201cRight now, the only way to act is by making small changes when it comes to relaxing the conditions, by maintaining the distances between people, and by keeping up with the infection precautions,\u201d he added.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe consequences of acting irresponsibly could be enormous given that we know that only 5% of the population has some degree of immunity against the virus. That means that 95% don\u2019t.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Duque also dismissed talk of so-called \u201cimmunity passports\u201d to allow more freedom of movement to those who had recovered from the disease.

Details on the precise implementation of the rules is to follow, but the western state of North Rhine Westphalia already applied them on the stroke of midnight on Friday.</p> \n  <p>Germans are closely watching the gradual easing of travel restrictions wanting to know to what extent they can hope to go on a foreign holiday this year. From May, 25 flights between Germany and Greece will resume. But officially the advice remains that Germans should not travel anywhere abroad, until at least 14 June.</p> \n  <p>On Monday Heiko Maas, the foreign minister, will hold a video conference with his counterparts from European countries where Germans typically go on holiday, including Spain, Italy, Austria, Greece, Croatia, Portugal, Malta, Slovenia, Cyprus and Bulgaria. The aim is to facilitate a coordinated reopening of borders including mutual agreements on being able to swiftly close them again in case of a rise in cases.</p> \n  <p>On Wednesday, the interior minister, Horst Seehofer, announced that an opening of the borders with France, Switzerland and Austria was on the cards from 15 June. On Wednesday, border traffic between Germany and Luxembourg is due to normalise again. Discussions with Denmark are still ongoing.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T13:31:26.329Z\">at 2.31pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe895b8f0849a584fe11e4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T12:30:58.134Z\">1.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d449499bdbd6a41bba2045349f8c1b558c21f8a9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d449499bdbd6a41bba2045349f8c1b558c21f8a9/0_44_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Health workers in the Take Care of Care movement protest in Liege against the Belgian authorities\u2019 management of coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Health workers in the Take Care of Care movement protest in Liege against the Belgian authorities\u2019 management of coronavirus.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T13:32:36.324Z\">at 2.32pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe88bf8f08898ae689136b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T12:20:07.127Z\">1.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Denmark reports zero coronavirus-related deaths for the first time since March</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Denmark has reported zero coronavirus-related deaths in the last 24 hours for the first time since 13 March, Reuters reports.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T13:33:01.701Z\">at 2.33pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe87d98f08898ae6891364\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/david-agren\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T12:15:50.238Z\">1.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More than 100 Mexicans have died from drinking adulterated alcohol over the past month in a string of mass poisonings which followed a ban on the sale of liquor during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> \n  <p>Deaths from unsafe alcohol have been reported in at least four states.

Whether there is a maximum number of people allowed for each household has not been specified. For those from a single household the distancing rules do not apply. </p> \n  <p>Waiting staff are required to wear face coverings.

If restaurants submit applications specific to the streets they would like to occupy, officials will move to close the roads to traffic on Fridays and at weekends, between 11am and 10pm.</p> \n  <p>Some concerns have been expressed that that arrangement may put the safety of diners under threat \u2013 with some sceptics making reference to the Berlin Christmas market attack of 2016 when an Islamist terrorist drove a lorry into the crowd, killing 12.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T11:13:13.631Z\">at 12.13pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe70258f08898ae689124f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T10:36:25.650Z\">11.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin, taking over the liveblog from my colleague Matt. </p> \n  <p>If you want to get in touch, you can email me (aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com) or reach me on Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/aamnamohdin\">@aamnamohdin</a>).</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe6bb88f08898ae689122b\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T10:33:52.799Z\">11.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s a roundup of the key developments so far on Friday: </p> \n  <p><strong>China marks one month with no new coronavirus deaths announced</strong><br></p> \n  <p>China has gone a month without announcing any new deaths from the coronavirus. The National Health Commission reported four new cases of the virus on Friday, all local cross-infections in the north-eastern province of Jilin where a cluster of uncertain origin has been detected in recent days. The last time the commission reported a death was on 14 April.</p> \n  <p><strong>Virus pushes Germany into recession</strong><br></p> \n  <p>German output shrank by 2.2% in the first quarter of 2020, according to new official data. The quarter-on-quarter contraction is \u201cthe worst since the financial crisis\u201d in 2009, the federal statistics office Destatis said. The agency also revised its gross domestic product (GDP) figure for the final quarter of 2019 from zero growth to a contraction of 0.1%, meaning Germany has now experienced two consecutive quarters of contraction \u2013 the technical definition of a recession.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Slovenia proclaims end to the outbreak</strong></p> \n  <p>Slovenia has become the first European country to proclaim an end to the coronavirus epidemic at home. It said on Friday that the spread of Covid-19 was under control and there was no longer a need for extraordinary health measures.</p> \n  <p><strong>Spain announces lowest daily death toll since Monday</strong></p> \n  <p>Spain\u2019s death toll from coronavirus registered its lowest increase since Monday with 138 new fatalities announced by the health ministry. The overall coronavirus death toll, in Europe\u2019s fourth worst hit country, rose to 27,459 on Friday, while the number of diagnosed cases rose to 230,183 cases from 229,540.</p> \n  <p><strong>Italy and Germany to ease more restrictions</strong></p> \n  <p>Italy is set to allow free travel across the country from 3 June, according to a draft decree seen by Reuters. The draft, which could still be modified before it is approved, also said all travel within separate Italian regions would be allowed from 18 May. Germany will loosen quarantine rules for travellers arriving from the European Union and the UK, according to the interior ministry. </p> \n  <p><strong>China responds diplomatically to Trump threat of cutting off ties</strong></p> \n  <p>China\u2019s foreign ministry has responded diplomatically to Donald Trump\u2019s threat of cutting ties with Beijing over the virus. The US president said the pandemic had cast a pall over his January trade deal with Beijing and that he had no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping at the moment. China\u2019s foreign ministry said on Friday that steady Sino-US bilateral relations served the interests of both countries.</p> \n  <p><strong>Baltic states restore free movement </strong></p> \n  <p>The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have opened their borders to each other to create a mini-Schengen area. Free movement of people will be restored to all 6 million permanent residents of the Baltic states, but arrivals from outside the three countries will have to undergo a two-week quarantine period.</p> \n  <p><strong>Mexico sees record one-day increase in cases</strong></p> \n  <p> Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday confirmed 257 additional coronavirus deaths and 2,409 new infections, the biggest one-day rise in cases since the pandemic began.The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 42,595 and 4,477 deaths in total, according to the official tally.</p> \n  <p><strong>Brazil confirmed cases pass 200,000</strong></p> \n  <p>The number of cases in Brazil passed 200,000 on Thursday. The country now has 202,918 confirmed cases, with 13,944 added in the last 24 hours, according to health ministry.The tally means it is the sixth-worst-affected country worldwide in terms of cases, according to Johns Hopkins data. 844 new deaths were reported in last 24 hours, bringing the total to 13,993.</p> \n  <p><strong>South Korea, China and Japan\u2019s health ministers to hold video conference</strong></p> \n  <p>The health ministers of South Korea, China and Japan will get together by video conference on Friday to discuss ways to work together in the global campaign against the coronavirus, South Korean officials said. The meeting is the first between top health officials of the east Asian neighbours since the outbreak emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.</p> \n  <p><strong>Covid-19 reaches refugee camps in Bangladesh</strong></p> \n  <p>Aid groups have warned of a looming humanitarian disaster after coronavirus was detected for the first time in the sprawling camps that host about 1 million Rohingya refugees.

This is a \u201creciprocal\u201d measure after Spain imposed 14 days\u2019 quarantine for anyone arriving from the EU/Schengen area.</p> \n  <p> The French border is currently closed to any visitors other than essential travellers who have a \u201ccompelling\u201d professional or personal reason to enter the country and are carrying a sworn declaration to that effect. June 15 has been set for a possible reopening of French borders to European visitors.</p> \n  <p>Deaths on French roads dropped by just under 56% during April compared with the same month last year. This is hardly surprising as everyone was locked down, but police records suggested those who were on the empty roads drove faster.

According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, at least 302,452 people have now died as a result of the outbreak. The institution says it has counted 4,443,597 confirmed cases worldwide. It\u2019s important to point out that the actual death toll is believed to be far higher than the tally compiled from government figures.</li> \n   <li><strong>China marks one month with no new coronavirus deaths announced. </strong>China has gone a month without announcing any new deaths from the coronavirus. The National Health Commission reported four new cases of the virus on Friday, all local cross-infections in the northeastern province of Jilin where a cluster of uncertain origin has been detected in recent days. The last time the commission reported a death was on 14 April.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump threatens to cut China ties. </strong>US President Donald Trump signalled a further deterioration of his relationship with China over coronavirus, saying he has no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping at the moment and going so far as to suggest he could cut ties with the world\u2019s second largest economy. Chinese state media has responded saying his comments are \u201clunacy\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump visits a mask distribution centre without wearing a mask himself. </strong>Donald Trump toured a mask distribution centre in the political swing state of Pennsylvania on Thursday but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/donald-trump-mask-medical-equipment-facility-pennsylvania\">without wearing a mask himself</a>. Trump, who is running for re-election in November, has resisted wearing a mask in public despite his administration\u2019s guidance to Americans to wear them and new White House rules requiring staff to wear them at work.</li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico sees record one-day increase in cases. </strong>Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday confirmed 257 additional coronavirus deaths and 2,409 new infections, the biggest one-day rise in cases since the pandemic began.The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 42,595 and 4,477 deaths in total, according to the official tally.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil confirmed cases pass 200,000. </strong>The number of cases in Brazil passed 200,000 on Thursday.The country now has 202,918 confirmed cases, with 13,944 added in last 24 hours, according to health ministry.The tally means it is the sixth-worst-affected country worldwide in terms of cases, according to Johns Hopkins data. 844 new deaths were reported in last 24 hours, bringing the total to 13,993.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Korea, China and Japan health ministers to hold video conference. </strong>The health ministers of South Korea, China and Japan will get together by video conference on Friday to discuss ways to work together in the global campaign against the novel coronavirus, South Korean officials said. The meeting is the first between top health officials of the East Asian neighbours since the outbreak emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.</li> \n   <li><strong>Doctors in Italy and France report spike in rare inflammatory syndrome linked to coronavirus. </strong>Doctors in northern Italy,<strong> </strong>one of the areas hardest hit by coronavirus, and in France have reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">spikes in cases of a rare inflammatory</a> syndrome in young children that appears similar to one reported in the US, Britain and Spain, according to a report in the Lancet.The condition shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease including fever, rashes, swollen glands and, in severe cases, heart inflammation.</li> \n   <li><strong>Covid-19 reaches refugee camps in Bangladesh. </strong>A Rohingya man has become the first person to test positive for Covid-19 in the vast refugee camps in Bangladesh that is home to almost one million people. Local health coordinator Abu Toha Bhuiyan initially said two refugees had been put into isolation. The World Health Organization later said one case was of a Rohingya man, and the other was of a local man who lived near the camp and was being treated at a clinic inside the area.</li> \n   <li><strong>36 million Americans are now unemployed. </strong>Another 3 million Americans filed for benefits, bringing the country\u2019s total unemployed to 36 million. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show the rate of claims is slowing but the record-breaking pace of layoffs has already pushed unemployment to levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance\">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T07:05:58.460Z\">at 8.05am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe2d908f08d99d46a174b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T05:50:18.490Z\">6.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Get in touch on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">Twitter @helenrsullivan</a>. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe2c038f08d99d46a174a3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/alison-rourke\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T05:45:17.107Z\">6.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Global report: Trump threat to cut trade ties over Covid-19 branded \u2018lunacy\u2019 by Chinese media</h2> \n  <p>An escalation of rhetoric between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> and China over the coronavirus pandemic has sparked concerns that a trade deal between the nations is in peril, as Chinese state media dismissed as \u201clunacy\u201d a suggestion by the US president that he could \u201ccut off relations with Beijing.</p> \n  <p>The US president said he was very disappointed with China\u2019s failure to contain Covid-19 in an interview with Fox Business news.

According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, at least 302,452 people have now died as a result of the outbreak.The institution says it has counted 4,443,597 confirmed cases worldwide. It\u2019s important to point out that the actual death toll is believed to be far higher than the tally compiled from government figures.</li> \n   <li><strong>China marks one month with no new coronavirus deaths announced. </strong>China has gone a month without announcing any new deaths from the coronavirus. The National Health Commission reported four new cases of the virus Friday, all local cross-infections in the northeastern province of Jilin where a cluster of uncertain origin has been detected in recent days. The last time the commission reported a death was on 14 April.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump says he could cut China ties. </strong>US President Donald Trump signalled a further deterioration of his relationship with China over the novel coronavirus, saying he has no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping right now and going so far as to suggest he could even cut ties with the world\u2019s second largest economy. </li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/donald-trump-mask-medical-equipment-facility-pennsylvania\">Donald Trump visits a mask distribution centre without wearing a mask himself</a>. </strong>Donald Trump toured a mask distribution centre in the political swing state of Pennsylvania on Thursday but without wearing a mask himself.Trump, who is running for re-election in November, has resisted wearing a mask in public despite his administration\u2019s guidance to Americans to wear them and new White House rules requiring staff to wear them at work.</li> \n   <li><strong>The health ministers of South Korea, China and Japan will gather by video conference </strong>to discuss ways to work together in the global campaign against the novel coronavirus, South Korean officials said. The meeting is the first between top health officials of the East Asian neighbours since the outbreak emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico sees record one-day increase in cases. </strong>Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday confirmed 257 additional coronavirus deaths and 2,409 new infections, the biggest one-day rise in cases since the pandemic began.The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 42,595 and 4,477 deaths in total, according to the official tally.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil confirmed cases pass 200,000. </strong>The number of cases in Brazil passed 200,000 on Thursday.The country now has 202,918 confirmed cases, with 13,944 added in last 24 hours, according to health ministry.The tally means it is the sixth-worst-affected country worldwide in terms of cases, according to Johns Hopkins data. 844 new deaths were reported in last 24 hours, bringing the total to 13,993.</li> \n   <li><strong>Doctors in Italy and France report spike in rare inflammatory syndrome linked to coronavirus. </strong>Doctors in northern Italy,<strong> </strong>one of the areas hardest hit by coronavirus, and in France have reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">spikes in cases of a rare inflammatory</a> syndrome in young children that appears similar to one reported in the US, Britain and Spain, according to a report in the Lancet.The condition shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease including fever, rashes, swollen glands and, in severe cases, heart inflammation.</li> \n   <li><strong>A vaccine for coronavirus must be available to all countries, the EU has insisted</strong>, after the British chief executive of French drugs company Sanofi said it was reserving the first shipments of its vaccine for the US. \u201cThe vaccine against Covid-19 should be a global public good and its access needs to be equitable and universal,\u201d said the European commission spokesman, Stefan de Keersmaecker.</li> \n   <li><strong>36 million Americans are now unemployed as another 3 million filed for benefits</strong>. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show the rate of claims is slowing but the record-breaking pace of layoffs has already pushed unemployment to levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</li> \n   <li><strong>The European commission has suspended the delivery of 10 million face masks from China</strong> after two countries complained about the poor quality of the batches they received, the Associated Press reports. As part of its efforts to tackle the Covid-19 crisis, this month the commission started dispatching the masks to healthcare workers in its 27 member states and the UK.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T07:07:10.737Z\">at 8.07am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe1d1b8f080c727453b50c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T04:41:08.002Z\">5.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Get in touch on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">Twitter @helenrsullivan</a>. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe1c578f080c727453b508\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T04:37:51.856Z\">5.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kjalee/status/1260918708458991616\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Oh my god, this is amazing.

The true number is likely to be higher. </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Global death toll passes 300,000. </strong>The global toll from Covid-19 has just passed 300,000, with nearly 4.5 million people infected.According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, at least 301,370 people have now died as a result of the outbreak.The institution says it has counted 4,426,937 confirmed cases worldwide. It\u2019s important to point out that the actual death toll is believed to be far higher than the tally compiled from government figures.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Nearly 600,000 Australians have lost their jobs during the pandemic. </strong>Almost 600,000 Australians lost their jobs between March and April, unemployment rose to 6.2%, the underemployment rate increased by 4.9 points to 13.7% and the underutilisation rate increased by 5.9 points to 19.9%.The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the figures were \u201cterribly shocking, although not totally unexpected\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Doctors in Italy and France report spike in rare inflammatory syndrome linked to coronavirus. </strong>Doctors in northern Italy,<strong> </strong>one of the areas hardest hit by coronavirus, and in France have reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">spikes in cases of a rare inflammatory</a> syndrome in young children that appears similar to one reported in the US, Britain and Spain, according to a report in the Lancet.The condition shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease including fever, rashes, swollen glands and, in severe cases, heart inflammation.</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/donald-trump-mask-medical-equipment-facility-pennsylvania\">Donald Trump visits a mask distribution centre without wearing a mask himself</a>. </strong>Donald Trump toured a mask distribution centre in the political swing state of Pennsylvania on Thursday but without wearing a mask himself.Trump, who is running for re-election in November, has resisted wearing a mask in public despite his administration\u2019s guidance to Americans to wear them and new White House rules requiring staff to wear them at work.</li> \n   <li><strong>A vaccine for coronavirus must be available to all countries, the EU has insisted</strong>, after the British chief executive of French drugs company Sanofi said it was reserving the first shipments of its vaccine for the US. \u201cThe vaccine against Covid-19 should be a global public good and its access needs to be equitable and universal,\u201d said the European commission spokesman, Stefan de Keersmaecker.</li> \n   <li><strong>36 million Americans are now unemployed as another 3 million filed for benefits</strong>. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show the rate of claims is slowing but the record-breaking pace of layoffs has already pushed unemployment to levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</li> \n   <li><strong>The European commission has suspended the delivery of 10 million face masks from China</strong> after two countries complained about the poor quality of the batches they received, the Associated Press reports. As part of its efforts to tackle the Covid-19 crisis, this month the commission started dispatching the masks to healthcare workers in its 27 member states and the UK.</li> \n   <li><strong>Officials in Bangladesh have announced the first confirmed case of coronavirus in the country\u2019s Rohingya refugee camps</strong>. Health experts and NGOs have issued warnings that the virus could race through the camps that house almost a million people forced to flee a military offensive in Myanmar almost two years ago.</li> \n   <li><strong>Greece will open 515 organised beaches to the public this weekend</strong>, but alcohol and music will be banned, along with sports and games.

  "<p>Dogs are to be trained to try to sniff out the coronavirus before symptoms appear in humans, under trials launched with \u00a3500,000 of government funding.</p> <p>Dogs have already been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/04/five-diseases-that-dogs-can-detect\">successfully trained</a> to detect the odour of certain cancers, malaria and Parkinson\u2019s disease, and a new study will look at whether labradors and cocker spaniels can be trained to detect Covid-19 in people.</p> <p>Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine will carry out the first phase of a trial in collaboration with Durham University and the charity Medical Detection Dogs.</p> <p>The initial stage of the research will see odour samples collected from coronavirus patients in London hospitals. Six specialist dogs will then undergo training to identify the virus from the samples.</p> <p>Lord Bethell, the minister for innovation, said the government believed the dogs \u201cmight provide speedy results as part of our wider testing strategy\u201d.</p> <p>The project\u2019s lead researcher, Prof James Logan, head of the department of disease control at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \u201cOur previous work has shown that malaria has a distinctive odour, and, with Medical Detection Dogs, we successfully trained dogs to accurately detect malaria.</p> <p>\u201cThis, combined with the knowledge that respiratory disease can change body odour, makes us hopeful that the dogs can also detect Covid-19. If successful, this approach could revolutionise how we detect the virus, with the potential to screen high numbers of people.\u201d</p> <p>Research gathered by Medical Detection Dogs has suggested that the dogs could each screen up to 250 people an hour, and can be trained to detect the odour of disease at the equivalent dilution of one teaspoon of sugar in two Olympic-sized swimming pools of water.</p> <p>The charity and the universities submitted a proposal for the clinical trial to the government, and it was accepted earlier this week and awarded \u00a3500,000 of funding.</p> <p>Claire Guest, the co-founder and CEO of Medical Detection Dogs, said: \u201cWe are delighted that the government has given us the opportunity to demonstrate that dogs can play a role in the fight against Covid-19. They have the potential to help by quickly screening people, which could be vital in the future.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cWe are sure our dogs will be able to find the odour of Covid-19 and we will then move into a second phase to test them in live situations, following which we hope to work with other agencies to train more dogs for deployment. We are incredibly proud that a dog\u2019s nose could once again save many lives.\u201d</p> <p>Diabetic people already use dogs to detect when their blood sugar levels are dangerously high or low. The charity Hypo Hounds trains dogs to smell telltale changes on their owner\u2019s breath or in their sweat. The pets can detect a problem earlier than a glucose monitor.</p> <p>In 2015, Italian researchers announced that they had trained two German shepherds to detect chemicals linked to prostate cancer in urine samples. The dogs were correct in 90% of cases.</p> <p>In 2018, researchers presented evidence that dogs could tell from sniffing someone\u2019s socks whether they had malaria. After several months of training, a labrador and a labrador-retriever could tell whether a child had the disease even if they were not showing symptoms.</p>",
  "<p>The start of Pete Evans\u2019 long goodbye from the mainstream first became apparent in 2012. After two seasons as a judge on the successful Channel 7 cooking show My Kitchen Rules, co-owner of the glamorous Sydney hotspot Hugos (in its heyday voted best pizza in the world) and a guest on cooking shows such as MasterChef, Sunday Life magazine approached him to take part in their weekly column, My Day on a Plate.</p> <p>The column \u2013 a chance to perve on celebrities\u2019 sometimes bizarre food habits \u2013 often provokes mockery, yet <a href=\"https://kitchen.nine.com.au/healthy/the-pete-evans-diet-decoder/0fcf035f-84f5-4238-a3e3-b4d047128fc0\">Evans topped them all</a>. His morning began with \u201ca smoothie of blended alkalised water, organic spirulina, activated almonds, maca, blueberries, stevia, coconut kefir and two organic, free-range eggs.\u201d The howls of derision could be heard all over the internet and in homes around Australia. Just what the hell were activated almonds?</p> <p>While activated almonds (nuts soaked for 24 hours in water, then dried out again over a low heat) have crossed over to the mainstream and can now be found on supermarket shelves, over the last eight years Evans has been walking a tightrope between two worlds. In one world he\u2019s a prime time television personality and author whose cookbooks, with their wide availability and low price point, have brought him into millions of homes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/chef-pete-evans-criticised-for-trying-to-sell-15000-light-device-to-fight-coronavirus\">Chef Pete Evans criticised for trying to sell $15,000 light device to fight coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the other world he\u2019s a promoter of alternative medicines and health claims that have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/14/doctors-warns-pete-evans-to-stick-to-cooking-after-sharing-anti-vaxx-podcast\">slammed by medical authorities</a>, caused his books to be pulled from shelves and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/chef-pete-evans-criticised-for-trying-to-sell-15000-light-device-to-fight-coronavirus\">most recently attracted penalties</a> from the Therapeutic Goods Administration for promoting a $15,000 light device that could be used in relation to \u201cWuhan Coronavirus\u201d. The TGA said the claim had no apparent foundation.</p> <p>Evans, 47, finally severed ties with the mainstream last week, when the contract for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/08/pete-evans-mkr-celebrity-chef-leaving-exit-seven-my-kitchen-rules-ratings-slump\">long-running judging gig at MKR was not renewed</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s unknown whether the decision is a cost-cutting measure by Channel 7, which has been hit hard by the Covid-19 advertising downturn, or a response to the latest controversy.</p> <p>But since then, Evans has been let off the leash \u2013 a freedom he appears to be relishing.</p> <p>Consuming his hugely popular social media channels \u2013 he has 1.4 million followers on Facebook and 234,000 on Instagram \u2013 has been a wild ride.</p> <p>He posted an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/australian-celebrity-chef-pete-evans-under-fire-for-sharing-views-of-uk-conspiracy-theorist-david-icke\">interview with the Holocaust denier David Icke</a>, who was spouting <a href=\"https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/2020/05/01/coronaviurs-5g-theory/\">5G conspiracies</a> and claiming Covid-19 was fake and shared stories about the link between Bill Gates and Covid-19.</p> <p>On Mother\u2019s Day, Evans posted a photo of his elderly mum with her grandchildren and revealed that he is disregarding social distancing guidelines and embracing her every time he sees her.</p> <p>And in a since deleted post, he warned followers that high-profile figures <a href=\"https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2020/05/12/pete-evans-coronavirus-conspiracy/\">were being executed</a> under the guise of having Covid-19. He recently took part in the surge of disinformation around Covid-19 and anti-vaxx theories when he posted on Facebook a link to the discredited conspiracy theory film Plandemic before it was removed.</p> <p>A theme that recurs in his social media feed is mistrust of authorities, the mainstream media and a belief that the real truth is being hidden from the people.</p> <p>After leaving MKR, on Instagram under a picture of Donald Trump and hashtagged with #obamagate he wrote: \u201cThis may be a great time to take off the mainstream media lens, if that is what you have been viewing the world through, and perhaps look through a different lens....or not.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CABro77jvXC/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

  "<p>Almost a year ago, as I walked to the Sydney office of Guardian Australia from my temporary digs in Surry Hills to kick off our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2019/may/18/australian-federal-election-2019-bill-shorten-scott-morrison-bob-hawke-polls-polling-vote-labor-coalition-liberals-australia-candidates-seats-odds-results-politics-live?page=with:block-5ce016718f08ea3978d89227\">election night coverage</a>, I made a couple of calls to government people to check how they were travelling. Would there be an upset victory for the Coalition?</p> <p>Yes, that election night \u2013 Scott Morrison\u2019s \u201cmiracle\u201d win, was a year ago on Monday. Incredible really, time flying and all that. For the record, neither of my informants thought the Coalition would win, although one of the two told me Morrison was confident they would hold on. When I asked whether they were equally confident, the response was a chuckle. No, in other words.</p> <p>Normally I\u2019m ambivalent about anniversary journalism, because it can feel like going through the motions. But in this instance, there\u2019s value. It\u2019s worth using the peg of the election anniversary to capture some of what I\u2019ve learned about Morrison over the past 12 months. Normally I would dive into the insights without much preamble, but the coronavirus crisis continues to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/after-the-coronavirus-australia-and-the-world-can-never-be-the-same-again\">mess with our shared sense of time</a>.

Given victory was a shock, the opening chapter of the Morrison government was, \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d There was activity, but no clear direction. Quixotically, given that absence of direction, one of the first things Morrison did was deliver some sharp commentary to public servants about the importance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/26/morrisons-still-waiting-for-a-policy-spark-but-some-colleagues-have-plenty-of-ideas\">delivering an agenda that hadn\u2019t yet been articulated</a>.</p> <p>Morrison did make an early priority of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/02/australians-are-yelling-in-grief-and-frustration-but-will-scott-morrison-act\">mental health and suicide prevention</a> \u2013 commendable in my book. But there were two obvious vacuums through the second half of 2019: economic management and climate change.</p> <p>The economy was grinding, not thriving. The Reserve Bank suggested stimulus. The government said talk to the hand. Liberal states also front-ran the climate and energy debate, pushing for the national energy guarantee \u2013 the policy that had been dumped in the frenzy of Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s ousting \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/21/liberal-states-in-talks-to-revive-turnbulls-dumped-energy-policy\">to be reinstated</a>, a sortie that caused the energy minister Angus Taylor all kinds of angst, until that angst was replaced by the angst of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/07/clover-moore-demands-pm-explain-angus-taylors-use-of-false-document-to-attack-her\">the self-inflicted Clover Moore controversy</a>.</p> <p>The sense of really important things sliding, drifting, sputtering, then collided with the absolute disaster of the summer. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/10/australia-is-burning-like-a-tinderbox-and-the-coalition-wont-acknowledge-voters-rising-fears\">Morrison flailed when the country most needed reassurance</a>, failing to rise to the occasion of the most catastrophic bushfires in a century. The failure of leadership was so profound that by the middle of January, Morrison\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/14/essential-poll-more-voters-disapprove-of-scott-morrison-and-see-him-as-arrogant\">disapproval in the Guardian Essential poll</a> had spiked by nine points, and Anthony Albanese pulled ahead as preferred prime minister.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9bc04b2bc141eace1a1c5fce40f1514b50c0511\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9bc04b2bc141eace1a1c5fce40f1514b50c0511/80_0_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Morrison tries to shake hands with unwilling woman in Cobargo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott Morrison\u2019s disastrous performance during the bushfire crisis was symbolised in the image of a Cobargo, NSW resident refusing to shake his hand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters Tv/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The prime minister then ricocheted into the red-hot \u201csports rorts\u201d controversy, which triggered an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/04/michael-mccormack-barnaby-joyce-national-party-leadership-spill\">implosion inside the National party</a> and also generated a bunch of significant questions that have not been satisfactorily answered to this day, not the least of which is: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/01/while-bridget-mckenzie-hovers-in-no-mans-land-were-left-waiting-for-a-clear-explanation\">did the government act lawfully?</a> It is infuriating that a question of such significance can linger, unanswered, for months, despite our best efforts to keep asking it.</p> <p>Then Covid-19 arrived \u2013 a crisis huge enough to hurl everything wildly into the air.</p> <p>It is valid to quibble about various specifics. Would Morrison have moved fast enough on the lockdown of non-essential services without <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/04/the-two-meetings-that-changed-the-trajectory-of-australias-coronavirus-response\">forceful intervention by Gladys Berejiklian and Daniel Andrews</a> during March? Should the government have produced the jobkeeper wage subsidy a week earlier? Would that have saved jobs?</p> <p>It was chaotic for weeks on end, the stress and anxiety off the charts, but what was clear from the outset was the prime minister\u2019s focus.</p> <p>Morrison was determined to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/29/morrisons-urgent-manoeuvring-on-coronavirus-is-atonement-for-summers-bushfire-shambles\">learn from his own deficiencies during the summer crisis</a>. He wanted to do a better job with coronavirus than he had done with the bushfires, and this was a high bar to set, because the nine governments of Australia could have easily been overwhelmed by the pandemic, as other governments were.</p> <p>What this shows us is Morrison can learn. Not all political leaders can, because learning requires self-knowledge. One of the primary motives for the studious learning may well have been self-preservation. But learning does require self-awareness and a measure of humility \u2013 and humility and Morrison aren\u2019t that obvious a pairing.</p> <p>So lesson number one of this past 12 months, for me: our prime minister can learn.</p> <p>Related to learning is adaptation. Morrison adapts. He\u2019s tribal \u2013 fealty matters, intrinsically he\u2019s an \u201care you with me or against me\u201d personality \u2013 but not ideological. He\u2019s a sponge, capable of absorbing and utilising the potential around him.</p> <p>What this means is Morrison\u2019s prime ministership could go anywhere. The trajectory isn\u2019t predictable. We aren\u2019t looking at a leader with fixed preoccupations. We aren\u2019t looking at John Howard, who came to public life to pursue tax and industrial relations reform. We are looking at a prime minister who likes to operate in the moment, provided he\u2019s got a firm grip on it.</p> <p>Morrison is so protean, we are looking at a prime minister who is yet to determine what sort of prime minister he will be.</p> <p>He could choose to do some good. A pragmatist, and that\u2019s what Morrison is, could dial down the partisanship that has poisoned our politics for more than a decade, choking hope and destroying trust.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d10aed142cfcbd1f320cbbfb56a1c9aefa2c267\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d10aed142cfcbd1f320cbbfb56a1c9aefa2c267/0_171_5136_3082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Morrison in the national cabinet meeting of March 22\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott Morrison in the national cabinet meeting of 22 March, a key milestone in Australia\u2019s coronavirus response.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He could choose to build something rather than tearing things down.

The conflict merchants are starved of material. Someone always has to be punching on, otherwise nothing is happening. Never mind if healing is happening. Healing in the polity is counterproductive to the king tide of outrage that fuels the sideshow of unhinged opinion.</p> <p>Morrison has to govern in this environment, same as all his predecessors since Kevin Rudd. It\u2019s not clear to me whether Morrison will have the will to persist in the mode of leadership he\u2019s developed during the current crisis, whether he\u2019s got the bottle, and more pertinently, the patience, for persistent collaboration in the national interest \u2013 or whether constraints will start to accumulate, limiting his agency.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/11/scott-morrison-reverts-to-politics-as-usual-over-sports-rorts\">Scott Morrison reverts to \u2018politics as usual\u2019 over sports rorts | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s worth noting at this juncture the prime minister really doesn\u2019t like constraints. If he encounters them, the Morrison instinct is always to decouple. If there are questions he doesn\u2019t want to answer, the first resort is ignore them. If pain persists, he sledges the questioner. If that doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s back to shutdown.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the management of the colleagues. If pesky ideologues inside his own ranks start sounding off unhelpfully, in recent examples <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/10/george-christensen-revives-diplomatic-spat-with-threat-to-summons-chinese-ambassador\">cartoonishly about China</a>, or to query whether a Liberal government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/12/labor-and-the-greens-push-to-extend-eligibility-for-jobkeeper-scheme\">should be paying people not to work</a>, Morrison says isn\u2019t free speech wonderful. He presents like a proud parent at a school speech night: sure, George is terrible at clarinet, but how great are kids, warbling away, expressing themselves.</p> <p>At one level Morrison has to indulge what he can\u2019t control. At another level, this is a frictionless rebuke. If you listen closely there are always adults and kids in the prime minister\u2019s \u201chow great\u201d parables. There is always a responsible adult, Morrison, who is in charge, and getting on with things, and then there are others enjoying their hobbies. It\u2019s a frictionless rebuke that nimbly asserts a hierarchy.</p> <p>The frictionless rebuke is different from Tony Abbott deploying Peta Credlin to keep the show on a tight leash, and the various, ultimately fruitless accommodations Malcolm Turnbull tried to make with the right to prevent a repeat of 2009.</p> <p>It is too soon to say whether the Morrison management technique will be any more successful than the strategies of his predecessors. All we can say right now, 12 months on from the miracle, is it is quantifiably different.</p>",

  "<p>The British Medical Association has thrown its weight behind teaching unions opposing the government\u2019s push to reopen schools in England, as the debate over millions of pupils returning to classrooms grew increasingly acrimonious.</p> <p>The country\u2019s children\u2019s commissioner, Anne Longfield, also weighed in, calling for ministers and teachers to \u201cstop squabbling\u201d and return to the classroom to help disadvantaged children. No 10 reinforced its drive to reopen primary schools for those in reception, year 1 and year 6 in two weeks\u2019 time, warning that prolonged closures risked damaging children\u2019s education.</p> <p>But the BMA \u2013 the UK\u2019s largest doctors\u2019 union \u2013 said in a letter to the National Education Union on Friday that the number of coronavirus infections remained too high to allow them to run safely. Teaching unions had been \u201cabsolutely right\u201d to urge caution and prioritise testing before reopening schools on 1 June.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot risk a second spike or take actions which would increase the spread of this virus, particularly as we see sustained rates of infection across the UK,\u201d the BMA council\u2019s chair, Chaand Nagpaul, said in the letter to his NEU counterpart, Kevin Courtney.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/reopening-schools-is-a-dangerous-move\">Reopening schools is a dangerous move | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The BMA said there was conflicting evidence from scientific studies on the effect of reopening schools, citing the \u201crelatively small amount of research available and the uncharted territory we find ourselves in\u201d. Nagpaul concluded: \u201cUntil we have got case numbers much lower, we should not consider reopening schools.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Liverpool became the first local authority to rule out reopening its schools until at least 15 June, in a significant blow to the government.</p> <p>Liverpool\u2019s move may encourage other local authorities to follow suit. With most state primary schools still maintained by councils, that could mean many schools missing the government\u2019s 1 June target. Liverpool city council maintains 109 primary schools.</p> <p>Some academy chains have said they will go ahead on 1 June, however. Steve Chalke, founder of the Oasis multi-academy trust, which runs more than 30 primary schools, called the opposition to reopening \u201crather middle-class\u201d and accused teachers\u2019 unions of failing to recognise the harm being done to disadvantaged children.</p> <p>Longfield \u2013 appointed by parliament as an independent commissioner \u2013 weighed in, criticising \u201csquabbling\u201d and calling for a return to the classroom alongside \u201crigorous testing of teachers, children and families\u201d for the Covid-19 virus.</p> <p>\u201cI am disappointed that the debate about when some primary school kids can return has descended into a squabble between government and the teaching unions. All sides need to show a greater will to work together in the interests of children,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe know there are thousands of vulnerable children who need to be in school. We know that the longer schools are closed the greater the impact will be on social mobility and that many children are really struggling without seeing their friends and the structure that school brings.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot afford to wait for a vaccine, which may never arrive, before children are back in school. It\u2019s time to stop squabbling and agree a staggered, safe return that is accompanied by rigorous testing of teachers, children and families.\u201d</p> <p>Longfield said reopening schools in England to some primary pupils was \u201csensible\u201d and called for other year groups to return as soon as possible, alongside summer schools and other support during the holidays.</p> <p>In the face of scepticism from teachers and school leaders, the government has increasingly raised the stakes in recent days. The education secretary for England, Gavin Williamson, wrote in the Daily Mail that teachers should be ready to \u201cdo their duty\u201d and cooperate with the government\u2019s efforts.</p> <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cSafety comes first, but we must also be aware of the potential damage to a child\u2019s education from not getting them back in the classroom.\u201d</p> <p>Part of the government\u2019s effort to win over the sector saw it hold a large virtual meeting on Friday between education leaders from colleges, schools and nurseries and top medical and scientific advisers, including Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, and Patrick Vallance, the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser.</p> <p>But union leaders said they were \u201cleft with more questions than answers\u201d after the meeting, which some participants said was at times confusing and chaotic, with around 50 people and organisations taking part. Some complained that their questions were not answered.</p> <p>Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, said the evidence presented to the meeting was \u201cflimsy at best\u201d but that there was room for further discussion.</p> <p>\u201cThis was never in our minds a make-or-break meeting, that was never its purpose. It\u2019s for the government to demonstrate that the scientific advice is there, and then it\u2019s for schools and government to demonstrate that schools will be safe for reopening, from whatever date,\u201d Roach said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s vitally important that the government and employers are behaving reasonably. It\u2019s disappointing that many of the questions that we put to the scientific advisers this afternoon haven\u2019t yet been answered. We hope that they will be answered \u2013 our members are hoping they will be answered.</p> <p>\u201cThe government has got to win the confidence of the profession, and it\u2019s got to win public confidence as well, if parents are going to entrust their children into schools where there is a risk of greater transmission of the virus.\u201d</p> <p>The NEU\u2019s Courtney welcomed Vallance\u2019s pledge to publish the papers presented to the Sage group of government advisers relating to education. But he also said the scientific advice presented to the meeting appeared mixed, and he was surprised to learn of instances in Australia where children had carried coronavirus cases into their households as \u201cindex cases\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe things that they told us didn\u2019t give me confidence that we should be going ahead without the social distancing and measures that schools in other countries have. It\u2019s really not clear what the government\u2019s test is to reopen schools,\u201d Courtney said.</p> <p>The governments in Wales and Scotland remain unmoved by Westminster\u2019s decision to reopen schools. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, said: \u201cThere will be no cavalier approach to any aspect of this on the part of the Scottish government.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not going to be the case that schools are back to normal in any way, shape or form this side of the summer holidays. We are of course discussing if it is possible for any pupils to be back in that timescale. But if it is, it is likely to be on a very limited basis.\u201d</p> <p>Kirsty Williams, the Welsh education minister, also said no date had been set for schools there to reopen. But she announced the publication of a working document to stimulate discussion over how to reopen.</p> <p>\u201cSetting a date before we have more evidence, more confidence and more control over the virus would be the wrong thing to do,\u201d Williams said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said at Friday\u2019s Downing Street press conference: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t support a proposal to start to reopen schools unless it was safe to do so, and it is safe to do so.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIn the same way that it\u2019s terrible news that this virus impacts on the elderly so much, the good news is that it seems to spare children in almost every case. And so the the risk to children is much, much lower than to any other age group \u2013 certainly if you don\u2019t have underlying health conditions.\u201d</p> <p>The deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, said the falling number of cases across the community would reduce the risks further in coming weeks. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anxiety I think around this, but people need to think through, in an average infant school of maybe 100 children, the likelihood of anybody having this disease is very small, and diminishing with time, so we just need to keep that in perspective.\u201d</p> <p>Williamson said: \u201cGetting children back to school is vital for their educational development and many schools are already taking steps to welcome back their pupils. I am grateful for their support.\u201d</p>",

Three defeats in seven days \u2013 against Crystal Palace, Wolves and Leicester \u2013 then a draw with Brighton cost them a Champions League place; that loss in Azerbaijan denied them the Europa League. Now the analysis began, preparations for the next stage.</p> <p>Every player came, except Mesut \u00d6zil. Emery told them his plans and heard theirs: \u00a3130m was spent on signings, eight players in, 10 out, excitement building. But mistakes were made, he admits \u2013 from recruitment to the departure of all four potential captains \u2013 and within six months he was gone. Something had broken, the situation \u201cunsustainable\u201d, and he was sacked. He had overseen the best start in Arsenal\u2019s history and their worst run in 30 years. As it disintegrated, he knew those games he watched alone and exposed on the touchline, toxicity all around, would be his last.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/nov/30/unai-emery-small-part-of-arsenal-problems\">Unai Emery\u2019s broken kaleidoscope was a small part of Arsenal\u2019s problem | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/nov/29/arsenal-manager-unai-emery-freddie-ljungberg-live-weekend-football-countdown\" title=\"\">On 29 November it was official</a>, his departure as unlamented as it was inevitable. Emery, under lockdown in Valencia, would almost rather leave it there. As he recalls his origins at little Lorca and discusses his desire to work again, there is a glimpse of the old enthusiasm, absent in the autumn. And he keeps returning to the \u201cpositives\u201d at Arsenal. But that goes with an inescapable sense of injustice at how he has been portrayed, dismissed as a disaster, a figure of fun. And it is hard not to linger on what went wrong.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/29/chelsea-arsenal-europa-league-final-match-report-eden-hazard\" title=\"\">Starting with Baku</a>. Below the surface were problems, but Emery believes things might have been different had they won and made the Champions League; had they reacted right. That final, those conversations and plans, should have been a start but listening to Emery it feels more like the end. In October 2018, fans had chanted: \u201cWe\u2019ve got our Arsenal back.\u201d By November 2019, they had changed their tune, to: \u201cWe want Emery out!\u201d And: \u201cYou\u2019re getting sacked in the morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe first season we did a lot well,\u201d Emery says. \u201cI thought: \u2018This is my team.\u2019 People said: \u2018Unai, we can see your personality in this side.\u2019 There was spirit, games with intensity, energy \u2013 Tottenham, Manchester United, Chelsea \u2013 and we reached Arsenal\u2019s first [European] final in 13 years, playing very well against Napoli and Valencia. Finishing third was in reach but we lost four decisive points against Crystal Palace and Brighton.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a72753ac1f1193db538f31bfed9265dc86c0143a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a72753ac1f1193db538f31bfed9265dc86c0143a/0_226_5015_3009/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unai Emery, Europa League final\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unai Emery walks away from the Europa League trophy after Arsenal\u2019s defeat by Chelsea in the final in Baku last season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Grimm/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Emery calls those results \u201cincomprehensible\u201d but tries to make sense of them. A recurring theme emerges. \u201c[At first] things went magnificently; there was a good spirit in the dressing room,\u201d he begins. \u201c[Aaron] Ramsey\u2019s injury, when he was at his best, had a big influence: he conveyed positivity, so much energy. And playing a lot of important games in April without him, we needed 100% <em>implicaci\u00f3n</em> from every player.\u201d</p> <p><em>Implicaci\u00f3n</em>. If there is a word repeated often over the hour\u2019s conversation, it is that. In English it is commitment and it was missing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mistakes were made, and as coach I take responsibility for mine</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn Baku Chelsea were better, I accept that. In the second half Eden Hazard made the difference. Preparations were good and everyone <em>was</em> committed. But some players had a mentality that says one day \u2018yes\u2019, one day \u2018no\u2019, when in football it has to be \u2018yes\u2019, \u2018yes\u2019, \u2018yes\u2019 every day. We lacked that little extra to get through a lot of games in those final weeks. If your application and commitment falls below 100%, you can lose, and that\u2019s what happened.</p> <p>\u201cPeople were happy but something was missing,\u201d he says, a shortfall in commitment, character and leadership he wanted to address. \u201cI told the people running the club. And then there were decisions that didn\u2019t go well. Mistakes were made, and as coach I take responsibility for mine. For example, all four captains left. Ramsey had decided he was going. It would have been better for the team if he had continued, and for me. Petr Cech was retiring; fine. But I wanted Laurent Koscielny to stay, Nacho Monreal to stay. All those leaders went, which makes the dressing room something else.</p> <p>\u201cWe signed [Nicolas] P\u00e9p\u00e9. He\u2019s a good player but we didn\u2019t know his character and he needs time, patience. I favoured someone who knew the league and wouldn\u2019t need to adapt. [Wilfried] Zaha won games on his own: Tottenham, Manchester City, us. Incredible performances. I told them: \u2018This is the player I know and want.\u2019 I met Zaha and he wanted to come. The club decided P\u00e9p\u00e9 was one for the future. I said: \u2018Yes, but we need to win now and this lad wins games.\u2019 He beat us on his own.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also true he was expensive and Palace didn\u2019t want to sell,\u201d Emery concedes. \u201cThere were a series of decisions that had repercussions.\u201d</p> <p>Including his own: \u201c<em>autocr\u00edtica</em>,\u201d self-criticism, is a word he throws in often, despite seeing himself partly as prisoner of others\u2019 mistakes and there were injuries too. But could he not have intervened? Convinced Ramsey to stay or pushed harder to renew his deal? Or Monreal, or Koscielny? And why allow the captaincy question to become so drawn out, so contaminated? Why choose Granit Xhaka, a decision so unpopular it ended in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/27/granit-xhaka-unai-emery-arsenal-football\" title=\"\">confrontations with supporters</a>?</p> <p>\u201c[Initially] he wanted to stay,\u201d Emery says of Ramsey. \u201cHe needed to negotiate a new contract and they didn\u2019t reach an agreement. The club had doubts about renewing for a certain sum. Ramsey wanted to feel valued. It was a financial matter; I can\u2019t get involved. And I still didn\u2019t know him well when I arrived. He\u2019s important but I can\u2019t say what they should pay him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI believed Xhaka could be captain. And the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/27/granit-xhaka-player-vote-arsenal-captain\" title=\"\">players voted for him</a>, he was respected in the dressing room.\u201d But why vote? Why not own that decision yourself? \u201cMy strategy was 50% me, 50% them. I like to have players\u2019 input, their opinion. There were people with the character to be captain, but you need time and backing. Without the support of certain people or the fans, it\u2019s harder. If Xhaka had Koscielny and Nacho, or Ramsey, he could have eased into it. Emotionally, certain results and attitudes inside didn\u2019t help the team have the commitment and togetherness of before.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was always open to talking, he [\u00d6zil] was always in my plans, but he had to do his bit</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another criticism levelled at Emery is that he failed to accommodate \u00d6zil, his most talented player \u2013 a \u00a3350,000-a-week problem that conditioned so much. \u201cI spoke a lot with \u00d6zil,\u201d he says. There is a long pause. Maybe a hint of sadness. \u201cHe has to be self\u2011critical too, analyse his attitude and commitment. I tried with all my might to help \u00d6zil. Throughout my career, talented players have reached their best level with me. I was always positive, wanting him to play, be involved.</p> <p>\u201cIn pre-season I told him I wanted to help recover the best \u00d6zil. I wanted a high level of participation and commitment in the dressing room. I respected him and thought he could help. He could have been a captain but the dressing room didn\u2019t want him to be. That\u2019s not what I decided; that\u2019s what the players decided. Captains are ones who have to keep defending the club, the coach, teammates.\u201d</p> <p>The difference between \u00d6zil\u2019s performances home and away was stark. Even the number of appearances was. Why did Emery not trust him, play him more? Why were his displays not better? \u201cSometimes they were better, sometimes worse, like all players. Sometimes he wasn\u2019t available because he was ill or his knee hurt. Watford was his first after the robbery, and I put him [straight] in. I was always open to talking, he was always in my plans, but he had to do his bit. And there were things I couldn\u2019t control.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e49d1befbc1284e4bbf6c4535ae06da2d897d11b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e49d1befbc1284e4bbf6c4535ae06da2d897d11b/0_76_3836_2303/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arsenal protesters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arsenal supporters protest against Unai Emery during the Europa League match against Eintracht Frankfurt on 28 November, the day before Emery\u2019s dismissal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If so, Emery kept his counsel, and he seems to hold back now. He always will, he says \u2013 even if that means shouldering the blame. \u201cA coach has to have the strength to take responsibility, to be [in the firing line]. I protect the players and the club protects the manager. I\u2019m a club man, that\u2019s what they signed. With Ars\u00e8ne Wenger it was different: he did everything. Now there\u2019s Raul [Sanllehi] and Edu, and I have to trust them to do their job. My job\u2019s the football. The club have people who handle other stuff, although that impacts on the pitch. Some of that hurt us.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe him most of all. Emery was exposed. When results turned, he was an easy target. A comedy one, even. Language made it harder to build a relationship with fans or a public persona that might have insulated him. His English became a stick to beat him with, grounds for dismissal. \u201cI had a decent level, although I needed to improve. When results are bad it\u2019s not the same. You lack the linguistic depth to explain. And take \u2018good ebening\u2019: OK, it\u2019s \u2018good evening\u2019, but when I said \u2018good ebening\u2019 and won it was fun; when we were losing it was a disgrace.\u201d</p> <p>And results were bad. Awful, in fact. It unravelled fast. Emery changed players, formations and ideas but could not change the trajectory or regain control. He watched it fall apart, knowing he would be the one to fall. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult,\u201d he says, hands drawing swirls, so much going on. \u201cThe energy slips, things drift; everything does, everyone does. Some support you but you feel the atmosphere, relationships [shift]. And that transmits to the pitch. Losing leads against Palace and Wolves reflected our emotional state: we weren\u2019t right. It wasn\u2019t working. I told the players: \u2018I don\u2019t see the team I want.\u2019 That commitment and unity wasn\u2019t there any more. That\u2019s when I see I\u2019m on my own. The club left me alone, and there was no solution.\u201d</p> <p>Jorge Valdano once said there are two types of coaches: strong and weak. And once players realise theirs is the latter, he is screwed.</p> <p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Emery says. \u201cAt every club, I\u2019ve been protected: Lorca, Almer\u00eda, Valencia, PSG. At Sevilla I had Monchi. At PSG Nasser al-Khelaifi protected me in the dressing room and publicly. At Arsenal they weren\u2019t able to, maybe because they came from Wenger, who did everything. They\u2019d say: \u2018We\u2019re with you\u2019 but in front of fans and the dressing room they couldn\u2019t protect me. Truth is, I felt alone. And the results dictated I had to go.</p> <p>\u201cBut, look, I was happy at Arsenal and I remember the good things. The first year was magnificent, I gave opportunities to young players: Bukayo [Saka] played eight minutes and never touched the ball but that was a first step for a 17-year-old who\u2019s going to be great. Bernd Leno has grown. [Joe] Willock, Reiss Nelson, [Eddie] Nketiah, [Gabriel] Martinelli. Matt\u00e9o Guendouzi did very well, Lucas [Torreira]. It\u2019s rewarding seeing them grow. And [Pierre-Emerick] Aubameyang got 31 goals and was top scorer, [Alexandre] Lacazette scored 19 and gave 13 assists.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/02/unai-emery-language-barrier-english-manager-premier-league\">Unai Emery fails to clear language barrier in era of manager-storytellers | Jonathan Liew</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAll that was missing was Aubameyang scoring that penalty against Tottenham: two extra points for Champions League qualification. Or beating Brighton and Palace. We couldn\u2019t finish the job and then there were mistakes. I\u2019m self-critical; at certain moments I couldn\u2019t get results. I enjoyed the Emirates. I still follow Arsenal. They\u2019re making changes. [Mikel] Arteta was the right choice \u2026 I spoke to him around Christmas. I want the best for him and for Arsenal.\u201d</p> <p>Emery is keen to work again: \u201cThe desire and energy is there. I\u2019m watching football, learning. And if there\u2019s a good project in England, if someone wants me and is prepared to get behind me, I\u2019m available\u2026 In England that identification with your team brings the game alive. It\u2019s deeper there, like a church. I was born in San Sebasti\u00e1n and my team is Real Sociedad. That feeling is in my heart and that\u2019s what you find in England. It\u2019s marvellous, the loveliest thing there is.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Mike Tyson wants to make a comeback. And who can blame him? So do I. So do you.

Albeit in a way that seems to speak to that fantasy comeback talk. In the event I haven\u2019t been able to get past the cold white heat of early Mike: those 21 months that took him from dowdy halls in upstate New York to the Las Vegas Hilton, the total destruction of Trevor Berbick and enthronement as the youngest heavyweight champion of all time.</p> <p>Has there ever been a run like this in sport? From March 1985 to November 1986 Tyson fought 28 unbeaten fights, winning 26 by knockout, boxing only 52 completed rounds, and producing a sequence of such clarity, such gathering greatness, it is still startling to watch. When you\u2019ve touched this \u2026 well, of course some part of you always wants to go back.</p> <p>What is also striking now is the quiet nobility of his opponents, that run of pressed men and passing ships, wreathed in a fraternal quality of sweat and ring-ritual and squeaky-floored backwoods gyms. Larry Sims in Poughkeepsie, Sammy Scaff at Felt Forum, Steve Zouski at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum \u2013 guys with toughness and skill, but also with sagging chests and floppy guts, a time before abs, before muscle definition \u2013 getting in the ring with this force of destiny.</p> <p>This is the first thing about young Tyson: his physical beauty. He looks, from the start, almost like an embarrassment of human splendour, not only slabbed and ripped, with a back like a sand-smoothed granite cliff face, but toned and balanced and gleaming with potential energy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a946894d38266dd4e2688ff709d4b550dabc7861\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a946894d38266dd4e2688ff709d4b550dabc7861/0_534_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Tyson v Trevor Berbick\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike Tyson on the attack against Trevor Berbick.

The two men face up. Tyson throws 16 punches in 10 seconds. Mercedes falls like a Victorian chimney stack. Tyson rushes over and apologises. Next up is Trent Singleton in the same ring, same kit, same gloomy lighting. Tyson throws two punches. We see that famous left hook for the first time, which is more than Singleton did.</p> <p>At which point it is worth saying something about The Run. Tyson wasn\u2019t fighting cardboard cutouts. The guys were older and more experienced, standard obstacles for a teenage prospect. They just happened to have stepped in front of a talent that is literally impossible to resist, fall guys in one of sport\u2019s most brutal and apparently unforeseen sequence of mismatches.</p> <p>There are still some wonderful highlights. Tyson is thrown in the deep end with Michael Jack Johnson at the Atlantis hotel, a man with a ragged scowl and a run of knockouts. Tyson walks through him like he\u2019s a bead curtain. Next comes a bigger step up against Donny Long, AKA \u201cthe master of disaster\u201d. Long is cool and good-looking. \u201cI can punch better than Tyson,\u201d he schmoozes. \u201cThis is a big win to let everyone know Donny Long is back.\u201d But Donny Long is not back. He is instead battered through the ropes twice in 30 seconds.</p> <p>The Guys fight back. James \u201cQuick\u201d Tillis takes Tyson 10 rounds in Glens Falls, New York. But three months and four fights later Tyson has a title shot eliminator with Marvis Frazier, son of Joe. Marvis has an entourage. Marvis looks mean. Marvis is cut down like a dying dandelion. Tyson is in full peak\u2011era black trunks and boots by now. Afterwards, he talks about how he\u2019s decided to incorporate the jab into his style. Lol.</p> <p>And so to the Vegas Hilton, November 1986. Berbick is the WBC world champion. He\u2019s an ordained minister who calls himself the Soldier of the Cross. Later he will be convicted of raping his child\u2019s babysitter and end up being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/oct/30/guardianobituaries.sport\" title=\"\">brutally murdered</a> outside a church by his nephew. He makes the mistake of going toe to toe with the 20-year-old Tyson. He hits the canvas, leaps up like a madman, but ends up skittering across the ring on elastic legs, the most knocked-out man in the history of being knocked out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/feb/11/mike-tyson-underdog-buster-douglas-boxing-from-the-vault\">From the Vault: Mike Tyson is knocked out by 42\u20131 underdog Buster Douglas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And that was it for The Run. There was still time to beat Michael Spinks in 91 seconds, a career high. But things began to fall apart. There were troubles, excess, bad behaviour. The Buster Douglas defeat came three years later. Six years after Hector Mercedes, Tyson was arrested for rape, convicted, and gone.</p> <p>There isn\u2019t much left to say about this. Tyson has always been a deeply flawed human, and there will always be pain in that, mainly for those on the other end. Watch The Run and there is another kind of sadness in the glory of Young Tyson, who was, or should have been a role model, a hard-working kid from a tough background, a student of his art under Cus D\u2019Amato, funny, smart and courteous, obsessed only with angles and skills and ring craft.</p> <p>Think of that Tyson now and there is even a doomed kind of glory in that crazy talk of a comeback; in the sight of this aged fighter still hitting a bag, still wanting more, wanting even now to go back.</p>",

commission president Ursula von der Leyen in mid-June to break the impasse.<br><br>One senior UK source described the talks as \u201cdestructive and tetchy\u201d at times but believed short-tempers could reflect a sense of realisation the EU side that the UK will not be budging on level playing field issues.<br><br>Sources say the UK made it clear \u201cthere is no half-way house\u201d or

adding that there was good progress made towards a mutual understanding on some trade issues and issues such as civil nuclear energy, aviation and law enforcement.</p> \n   <p>The major obstacle to this is the EU\u2019s insistence on including a set of novel and unbalanced proposals on the so-called \u201clevel playing field\u201d which would bind this country to EU law or standards, or

It was the second leading cause of death in female care home residents, after dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, accounting for 23.5% of fatalities.</p> \n<p>Dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease was the most common pre-existing condition among care home residents whose deaths were linked to the virus and was found in 42.5% of those fatalities.

  "<p>The BBC has drawn up a shortlist in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/20/tony-hall-to-step-down-as-bbc-director-general\">hunt for its next director general</a> that includes Will Lewis, the outgoing chief executive of the publisher of the Wall Street Journal, and two of the corporation\u2019s most senior executives, Tim Davie and Charlotte Moore. The final contender is thought to be another woman.</p> <p>The corporation\u2019s board is understood to have informed the candidates and is planning to hold interviews in early June. The successful applicant will take over from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/20/bbc-faces-dangerous-moment-after-tony-halls-departure\">Tony Hall</a> when he stands down later this year.</p> <p>The BBC is known to have approached Alex Mahon, the chief executive of Channel 4, and held a conversation about the role in recent weeks, but she is understood to have declined to put her name in the hat.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/21/who-are-the-potential-candidates-for-bbc-director-general\">Davie continues to be seen as the frontrunner for the role</a>, among the biggest jobs in British broadcasting. A former Procter &amp; Gamble and Pepsi marketer, Davie previously ran the BBC\u2019s audio and music operation and acted as director general during the Savile crisis, before Lord Hall was appointed. He is currently the chief executive of BBC Studios, one of the broadcaster\u2019s commercial arms. </p> <p>His colleague Moore, who works on the licence fee-funded side of the corporation, is the BBC\u2019s director of content with a \u00a31bn budget responsible for hit shows including Bake Off, Bodyguard and Luther. BBC insiders keen to see the role kept in-house say an elegant solution to potentially keep Davie and Moore could be to split Hall\u2019s dual roles as director general and editor-in-chief.</p> <p>The wild card is Lewis, who finished a six-year stint at Dow Jones on Friday and who one source described as the \u201cmaverick option\u201d. The 51-year-old has an extensive background in journalism, having worked at the Financial Times, Sunday Times and Daily Telegraph, where he became the youngest editor-in-chief and oversaw the newspaper\u2019s investigation into MPs\u2019 expenses.</p> <p>It is understood that the whittled-down list of candidates until very recently included a senior executive at Amazon UK, as the corporation sought to canvas the widest range of potential contenders to lead BBC through its crucial next phase.</p> <p>The recruitment process is being led by David Clementi, the chair of the BBC board, who comes to the end of his four-year tenure early next year. The BBC declined to comment on the recruitment process.</p> <p>Whoever lands the role of director general will face challenges from all sides. The BBC is facing a mid-term review of its charter in 2022, which will focus on the cost and long-term future of the licence fee. Boris Johnson, who has had a combative relationship with the BBC since last year\u2019s general election campaign, has talked about decriminalising non-payment of the annual \u00a3157.50 licence fee. The corporation has said such a move will cost it hundreds of millions of pounds.</p> <p>While the corporation is widely viewed as having proved its worth as part of British life during the coronavirus crisis, it remains highly probable that by the time of charter renewal in 2027, the broadcaster will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/31/tv-licence-fee-could-be-replaced-by-broadband-levy-says-bbc\">funded by an alternative mechanism</a>.</p> <p>The BBC is also facing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/29/bbc-announces-450-jobs-will-go-in-newsroom-shake-up\">another round of cuts</a> after revealing that its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/29/bbc-likely-to-make-cuts-to-output-after-income-forecast-to-drop-125m\">income will fall by \u00a3125m this year</a> due to the coronavirus crisis. TV licence fee income will be down as door-to-door enforcement activity stops during the pandemic. The BBC has also been hit by the decision to delay the introduction of the licence fee for most over-75s, which had been due to come into effect this year but was deferred when older people were asked to self-isolate.</p>",

  "<p>Working humans are so much more than \u201cresources\u201d.

Human health and the care of the most vulnerable cannot be governed by market forces alone. If we leave these things solely to the market, we run the risk of exacerbating inequalities to the point of forfeiting the very lives of the least advantaged. </p> <p>How to avoid this unacceptable situation? By involving employees in decisions relating to their lives and futures in the workplace \u2013 by democratising firms. By decommodifying work \u2013 by collectively guaranteeing useful employment to all. As we face the monstrous risk of pandemic and environmental collapse, making these strategic changes would allow us to ensure the dignity of all citizens while marshalling the collective strength and effort we need to preserve our life together on this planet.</p> <p>Every morning, men and women, especially members of racialised communities, migrants and informal economy workers, rise to serve those among us who are able to remain under quarantine. They keep watch through the night. The dignity of their jobs needs no other explanation than that eloquently simple term \u201cessential worker\u201d. That term also reveals a key fact that capitalism has always sought to render invisible with another term, \u201chuman resource\u201d. Human beings are <em>not</em> one resource among many. Without labor investors, there would be no production, no services, no businesses at all.</p> <p>Every morning, quarantined men and women rise in their homes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/12/working-from-home-history-coronavirus-uk-lockdown\">fulfil from afar </a>the missions of the organisations for which they work. They work into the night. To those who believe that employees cannot be trusted to do their jobs without supervision, that workers require surveillance and external discipline, these men and women are proving the contrary. They are demonstrating, day and night, that workers are not one type of stakeholder among many: they hold the keys to their employers\u2019 success. They are the core constituency of the firm, but are, nonetheless, mostly excluded from participating in the government of their workplaces \u2013 a right monopolised by capital investors.</p> <p>To the question of how firms and how society as a whole might recognise the contributions of their employees in times of crisis, democracy is the answer. Certainly, we must close the yawning chasm of income inequality and raise the income floor \u2013 but that alone is not enough. After the two world wars, women\u2019s undeniable contribution to society helped win them the right to vote. By the same token, it is time to enfranchise workers.</p> <p>Representation of labour investors in the workplace has existed in Europe since the close of the second world war, through institutions known as <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=707&amp;langId=en&amp;intPageId=211\">works </a><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=707&amp;langId=en&amp;intPageId=211\">councils</a>. Yet these representative bodies have a weak voice at best in the government of firms, and are subordinate to the choices of the executive management teams appointed by shareholders. They have been unable to stop or even slow the relentless momentum of self-serving capital accumulation, ever more powerful in its destruction of our environment. These bodies should now be granted similar rights to those exercised by boards. To do so, firm governments (that is, top management) could be required to obtain double majority approval, from chambers representing workers as well as shareholders. </p> <p>In Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavia, different forms of codetermination (<em>Mitbestimmung</em>) put in place progressively after the second world war were a crucial step toward giving a voice to workers \u2013 but they are still insufficient to create actual citizenship in firms. Even in the United States, where worker organising and union rights have been considerably suppressed, there is now a growing call to give labour investors the right to elect representatives with a supermajority within boards. Issues such as the choice of a CEO, setting major strategies and profit distribution are too important to be left to shareholders alone. A personal investment of labour; that is, of one\u2019s mind and body, one\u2019s health \u2013 one\u2019s very life \u2013 ought to come with the collective right to validate or veto these decisions.</p> <p>This crisis also shows that work must not be treated as a commodity, that market mechanisms alone cannot be left in charge of the choices that affect our communities most deeply. For years now, jobs and supplies in the health sector have been subject to the guiding principle of profitability; today, the pandemic is revealing the extent to which this principle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/26/us-insurance-companies-coronavirus-hospitals\">has led us astray</a>. Certain strategic and collective needs must simply be made immune to such considerations. The rising body count across the globe is a terrible reminder that some things must never be treated as commodities. Those who continue arguing to the contrary are imperilling us with their dangerous ideology. Profitability is an intolerable yardstick when it comes to our health and our life on this planet.</p> <p>Decommodifying work means preserving certain sectors from the laws of the so-called free market; it also means ensuring that all people have access to work and the dignity it brings. One way to do this is with the creation of a job guarantee. Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reminds us that everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment. A job guarantee would not only offer each person access to work that allows them to live with dignity, it would also provide a crucial boost to our collective capability to meet the many pressing social and environmental challenges we currently face. Guaranteed employment would allow governments, working through local communities, to provide dignified work while contributing to the immense effort of fighting environmental collapse. Across the globe, as unemployment skyrockets, job guarantee programs can play a crucial role in assuring the social, economic, and environmental stability of our democratic societies. </p> <p>The European Union must include such a project in its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/what-is-the-european-green-deal-and-will-it-really-cost-1tn\">green deal</a>. A review of the mission of the European Central Bank so that it could finance this program, which is necessary to our survival, would give it a legitimate place in the life of each and every citizen of the EU. A countercyclical solution to the explosive unemployment on the way, this program will prove a key contribution to the EU\u2019s prosperity.</p> <p> We should not react now with the same innocence as in 2008, when we responded to the economic crisis with an unconditional bailout that swelled public debt while demanding nothing in return. If our governments step in to save businesses in the current crisis, then businesses must step in as well, and meet the general basic conditions of democracy. In the name of the democratic societies they serve, and which constitute them, in the name of their responsibility to ensure our survival on this planet, our governments must make their aid to firms conditional on certain changes to their behaviours. In addition to hewing to strict environmental standards, firms must be required to fulfil certain conditions of democratic internal government. A successful transition from environmental destruction to environmental recovery and regeneration will be best led by democratically governed firms, in which the voices of those who invest their labor carry the same weight as those who invest their capital when it comes to strategic decisions. </p> <p>We have had more than enough time to see what happens when labor, the planet, and capital gains are placed in the balance under the current system: labor and the planet always lose. Thanks to <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es102641n\">research from the University of Cambridge</a>, we know that \u201cachievable design changes\u201d could reduce global energy consumption by 73%. But those changes are labor intensive, and require choices that are often costlier over the short term. So long as firms are run in ways that seek to maximise profit for their capital investors alone, and in a world where energy is cheap, why make these changes? Despite the challenges of this transition, certain socially minded or co-operatively run businesses \u2013 pursuing hybrid goals that take financial, social and environmental considerations into account, and developing democratic internal governments \u2013 have already shown the potential of such positive impact.</p> <p>Let us fool ourselves no longer: left to their own devices, most capital investors will not care for the dignity of labour investors, nor will they lead the fight against environmental catastrophe. Another option is available. Democratise firms; decommodify work; stop treating human beings as resources so that we can focus together on sustaining life on this planet.</p> <p>\u2022 Isabelle Ferreras (University of Louvain/FNRS-Harvard LWP), Julie Battilana (Harvard University), Dominique M\u00e9da (University of Paris Dauphine PLS), Julia Cag\u00e9 (Sciences Po-Paris), Lisa Herzog (University of Groningen), Sara Lafuente Hernandez (University of Brussels-ETUI), H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Landemore (Yale University), Pavlina Tcherneva (Bard College-Levy Institute), Miranda Richmont Mouillot, Israr Qureshi (Autralian National University), Clare Wright (La Trobe University), Isabelle Martin (University of Montr\u00e9al), Neera Chandhoke (Delhi University), Lukas Clark-Memler (University of Oxford), Alberto Alemanno (HEC Paris-NYU Law), Elizabeth Anderson (University of Michigan), Philippe Ask\u00e9nazy (CNRS-Paris School of Economics), Aur\u00e9lien Barrau (CNRS et Universit\u00e9 Grenoble-Alpes), Adelle Blackett (McGill University), Neil Brenner (Harvard University), Craig Calhoun (Arizona State University), Ha-Joon Chang (University of Cambridge), Erica Chenoweth (Harvard University), Joshua Cohen (Apple University, Berkeley, Boston Review), Christophe Dejours (CNAM), Olivier De Schutter (UCLouvain, UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights), Nancy Fraser (The New School for Social Research, NYC), Archon Fung (Harvard University), Javati Ghosh (Jawaharlal Nehru University), Stephen Gliessman (UC Santa Cruz), Hans R.

  "<p>Transmission rates of Covid-19 remain dangerously close to levels that could bring a second wave, even before the easing of some restrictions this week, as the focus shifts to transmission rates in the north of England.</p> \n<p>The latest official estimate places the national R value \u2013 the rate at which people are passing on infections to others \u2013 at between 0.7 and 1. An R value above 1 means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which would result in a new surge of cases.</p> \n<p>It raises questions about the extent to which restrictions can be safely eased in coming weeks. In his address on Sunday, Boris Johnson said: \u201cWe have the R below 1, between 0.5 and 0.9 \u2013 but potentially only just below 1.\u201d</p> \n<p>The slight increase and narrowing in range is not linked to lockdown relaxations this week as the estimate is based largely on hospital admissions and deaths data, which reflect the levels of transmission two to three weeks ago.</p> \n<p>A likely explanation is that while overall levels of infection have fallen, hospital and care home settings are making a relatively bigger contribution to the overall estimate of R. Lockdown restrictions have less impact in these settings and there are still concerns about the levels of testing available in care homes.</p> \n<p>The figure suggests that, while the lockdown has been effective at bringing down case numbers, R is still close to 1, meaning that it would not be possible to ease restrictions significantly without new measures to contain outbreaks, such as extensive testing and tracing.</p> \n<p>It comes as data showed that while London was a hotspot of infection at the start of the epidemic, attention is now shifting to the north of England, where transmission rates of Covid-19 appear to be falling far less steeply.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/map_cases-zip/giv-3902e095lw65Q2kz/\" data-alt=\"Map - Covid-19 cases\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/map_cases-zip/giv-3902e095lw65Q2kz/\">Map - Covid-19 cases</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Some epidemiological models suggest transmission rates in the capital are now half those seen in the north-east and Yorkshire, raising the question of whether all areas will be safe to emerge from lockdown at the same time.</p> \n<p>There is growing unease among civic leaders in the north of England at plans to ease lockdown rules, with one council leader branding it as \u201cfrankly, madness\u201d.</p> \n<p>The leader of Gateshead council, Martin Gannon, said on Friday that the advice to the public to \u201cstay at home\u201d would continue. Gannon, whose views on lockdown were echoed by his counterparts in Newcastle and Sunderland, said there was evidence that the R rate was greater than 1 in his borough.</p> \n<p><strong>How do models calculate the R value?</strong></p> \n<p>The R value tells you how many infections each infected person passes the virus on to, on average. For an R above 1, the epidemic increases exponentially; below 1 it will eventually fizzle out. In the absence of direct measures of this elusive number, modellers have to rely on what firm data we have and extrapolate from there.</p> \n<p>Some models, <a href=\"https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/tackling-covid-19/nowcasting-and-forecasting-of-covid-19/\">such as one by Public Health England (PHE) and Cambridge University</a>, rely on the numbers of reported deaths, and the steep, steady decline in deaths in London translates into an estimate that community transmission must have also rapidly dropped off.</p> \n<p>Deaths are reliable figures, less subject to biases than some other measures, but they reflect the infection rates that were occurring about three weeks previously and so do not give a dynamic reflection of where things are.</p> \n<p>Policy changes around working and socialising introduced in the past week may have influenced R, but a model based on deaths will not give any insights into this. The PHE model projected that there might be as few as 24 new cases in the capital per day on 10 May. This reflects the strong downward trend London has been on, but the model is not designed to give razor-sharp predictions of day-by-day infection statistics. On Thursday, 49 people with new infections were admitted to hospitals in London.</p> \n<p>Some models rely on measures such as symptoms reported to phone apps, which have a shorter lag time. However, these data are more \u201cnoisy\u201d and so give a less robust measure of R overall, although they can give better insight into short-range changes.</p> \n<h2><strong>How sure are we about regional differences?</strong></h2> \n<p>Almost all available data and models suggest there are strong regional differences in terms of the number of infections and current transmission rates. Serology surveys suggest that more than 10% of people in London have been infected with Covid-19, compared with around 4% in the rest of the country. In general, urban centres have had more infections than rural areas.</p> \n<p>The data from hospital admissions and deaths also suggest that R has come down far more steeply in London than in other regions. The PHE and Cambridge model suggests that R in London is 0.4, compared with 0.8 in the north-east and Yorkshire and 0.75 for the country as a whole.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2020-05-15T14:17:23/embed.html\" data-alt=\"R value \u2013&nbsp;highest in NE and Yorkshire\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2020-05-15T14:17:23/embed.html\">R value \u2013&nbsp;highest in NE and Yorkshire</a> \n</figure> \n<p>This is one of a handful of models feeding into advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to government, and all are showing broadly similar patterns across the regions. However, the extent of the differences varies, meaning that an optimistic estimate for London cannot be relied on too heavily.</p> \n<p>Matt Keeling, professor of populations and disease at the University of Warwick, described the PHE/Cambridge estimate for London as \u201cextremely low\u201d. His own team\u2019s predictions put the London R value closer to 0.6.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis still predicts a faster decline in London than the rest of the country, but not as dramatic \u2026 The difference between 0.4 and 0.6 might sound like scientists arguing over small details, but these translate to very substantial differences in the rate of decline of cases, or the time for the epidemic to halve,\u201d he said.</p> \n<h2><strong>What are the reasons for regional differences?</strong></h2> \n<p>Initially, London was a few weeks ahead of other regions of the country because far more infections were seeded there at the start of the epidemic. However, it has also seen a steeper decline and, in fact, may have always had a slightly lower community transmission rate than some other geographical regions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/mini_charts-zip/giv-3902PGjWD7UZLBGG/\" data-alt=\"Daily reported Covid-19 cases by region\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/mini_charts-zip/giv-3902PGjWD7UZLBGG/\">Daily reported Covid-19 cases by region</a> \n</figure> \n<p>There are likely to be a wide range of factors behind this. London may now have a higher level of population immunity, which could be playing a role in bringing down transmission, since a higher proportion of people have been infected.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf it turns out that there\u2019s loads of immunity in the community, then that\u2019s brilliant, but I don\u2019t think we should plan for that scenario,\u201d said Thomas House, reader in mathematical statistics at the University of Manchester. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know yet.\u201d</p> \n<p>There are also likely to be substantially different contributions from hospitals and care homes, where transmission rates have not been effectively brought under control. In some regions, the spread of infection in these settings, where lockdown does not have the same impact, could be making a major contribution to keeping R close to 1.</p> \n<p>Differences in living arrangements \u2013 for instance, larger family groups living together outside London \u2013 could play a role. Models may also not fully capture the role of underlying health issues and deprivation in raising the risk of severe cases.</p> \n<h2>Is there evidence that people in some regions have complied less with the lockdown?</h2> \n<p>There isn\u2019t strong evidence for this. The lockdown has brought down transmission rates in the community across the country, and a forthcoming study from scientists at Imperial College London does not seem to suggest that London has been an outlier in terms of compliance.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe uniformity with which the UK responded to the lockdown is remarkable,\u201d said Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics. \u201cI thought maybe people in London who were close to a large epidemic would be much more compliant than elsewhere. But the behaviour change was very well synchronised across the UK.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Do the models suggest restrictions should be eased regionally?</h2> \n<p>This is an emerging view among scientists. \u201cBased on just the epidemiology, it makes a tremendous amount of sense,\u201d said House. \u201cThere\u2019s no point locking down if there\u2019s no cases to prevent.\u201d However, he and others acknowledge that the political decision will be weighted by factors beyond simply modelling the trajectory of case numbers.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s much more difficult to message the relaxation than it is to message the lockdown,\u201d said Riley. \u201cI suspect the most difficult aspect on possible regional differences is how you would message it. That uncertainty would be much greater than any mechanistic modelling uncertainty.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dd0e5a58-ea5e-4e76-89be-5885aa2e665c\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/poFrVc0M_Uc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",
  "<p>It is highly unlikely that anyone will ever win an Oscar for playing the caped crusader. Somehow, despite the remarkable enduring prominence of the dual role of Bruce Wayne and Gotham\u2019s dark knight, the idea of honouring someone for being very very good indeed at dressing up as a giant bat to scare criminals probably has less chance of finding traction with the Academy than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/28/uwe-boll-director-bloodrayne-alone-in-the-dark\">Uwe Boll</a> has of coming out of retirement to win best film. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiiWdTz_MNc\">The Joker?

Where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/22/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-review-ben-affleck-henry-cavill\">Ben Affleck</a> bulked up to ridiculous proportions to play a gun-toting, meat-headed mega-jock of a caped crusader, it is hoped Pattinson will represent a less showy and ultra-violent return to the dark knight\u2019s traditional role of costumed Gotham detective in Matt Reeves\u2019 film.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"76709c4ad444a972d98b7cf23383401d1709b8d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76709c4ad444a972d98b7cf23383401d1709b8d2/0_0_2048_1006/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nice ride \u2026 another sight of The Batman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"491\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nice ride \u2026 another sight of The Batman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/robert-pattinson-says-hes-found-his-gap-batman-portrayal-1294290\">Pattinson also hinted that he has found his Batman \u201cgap\u201d,</a> the natural space to craft a unique version of the superhero that we won\u2019t have seen before on the big screen. \u201cI kind of like the fact that not only are there very, very, very well-done versions of the character which seem pretty definitive, but I was thinking that there are multiple definitive playings of the character,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen this sort of lighter version, you\u2019ve seen a kind of jaded version, a kind of more animalistic version. And the puzzle of it becomes quite satisfying, to think: Where\u2019s my opening? And also, do I have anything inside me which would work if I could do it? And then also, it\u2019s a legacy part, right? I like that.\u201d</p> <p>While Pattinson may not have been hitting the gym, it sounds like he\u2019s been preparing for the role in other ways, not least by examining quite where some of his predecessors went wrong. \u201cI was watching the making of Batman &amp; Robin the other day. And even then, George Clooney was saying that he was worried about the fact that it\u2019s sort of been done, that a lot of the ground you should cover with the character has been already covered. And that\u2019s in \u201996, \u201997?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Director Matt Reeves\u2019 teaser of Robert Pattinson\u2019s new look for The Batman\">  <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/391277390?byline=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/391277390\">Director Matt Reeves\u2019 teaser of Robert Pattinson\u2019s new look for The Batman</a></figcaption> </figure>  <p>All of which brings us to another former Batman who has been reminiscing recently. If Kilmer wasn\u2019t quite so terrible as Clooney in the famous suit, he certainly runs gorgeous George <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/04/why-christian-bale-will-always-be-the-best-batman\">a close second</a>. (We\u2019ll excuse Affleck for now as his performances are still a little too recent to have received a final and definitive critical appraisal.) Joel Schumacher\u2019s Batman Forever is memorable these days largely for Jim Carrey\u2019s spectacularly overcooked turn as The Riddler, a typical example of the comic\u2019s ultra-manic early forays into Hollywood. Kilmer is utterly anonymous as Batman/Bruce Wayne, seemingly incapable of bringing anything to the role <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t4F7V_m760\">beyond the odd cheeseball one liner</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/magazine/val-kilmer.html\">In an interview with the New York Times</a>, the actor talks about his preference for character roles \u2013 he mentions his turn as Doc Holliday in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/17/val-kilmer-doc-holliday-tombstone-role-model\">Tombstone</a>, and even says he would have loved to have been a regular on Saturday Night Live. By contrast, he found Batman to be an empty shell, a realisation crystallised when the grandchildren of billionaire Warren Buffet arrived on Schumacher\u2019s set one day and were completely unimpressed at the sight of Kilmer in full costume, yet fascinated by the Batmobile and the caped crusader\u2019s other toys.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so easy to have five or six Batmans,\u201d Kilmer told the newspaper, suggesting that anyone could be in the suit. \u201cIt\u2019s not about Batman. There is no Batman.\u201d</p> <p>The comment makes sense to those of us who recall Kilmer\u2019s supporting turns over the years with such pleasure. His turn as the irascible, ultra-violent Gay Perry in Shane Black\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2005/nov/11/2\">Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</a> turned the tough guy private eye cliche beautifully on its head, while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSch2Wsakb8\">his sweaty, cold-eyed Doc Halliday was a thing of jaded splendour</a>. It\u2019s easy to see how Kilmer felt his talents were being wasted behind a mask. And yet the idea that there is nothing in Batman to create a memorable performance from seems undercut by Pattinson\u2019s determination to find something in the role to value. Perhaps, rather than an empty carapace, the dark knight is a blank canvas on which to paint one\u2019s own ideas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"00788ba52ef2c18667e61862bef5a4a72ce518f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00788ba52ef2c18667e61862bef5a4a72ce518f3/0_0_2200_936/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christian Bale in Batman Begins.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"425\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Intriguing \u2026 Christian Bale in Batman Begins.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Christian Bale, widely considered to be the best big-screen Batman, <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/celebrity-news/539958/Christian-Bale-Ben-Affleck-Batman-Movie\">has admitted to being devastated</a> when he found out that Affleck was taking the role. Director Christopher Nolan certainly played his part by delivering an intriguing, real world spin on Gotham in the Dark Knight trilogy, but the Wales-born actor responded with a nuanced, psychologically driven take on the caped crusader that stands in complete contrast to the one-dimensional figure of the Schumacher era.</p> <p>Where Kilmer opted out of returning as the caped crusader in 1997\u2019s Batman &amp; Robin because he wanted to do some \u201creal\u201d acting with Marlon Brando in the ill-fated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/16/marlon-brando-monster-sabotaged-my-film-island-of-dr-moreau\">The Island of Doctor Moreau</a>, Bale helped transform the superhero genre into a space where high-profile actors no longer dare to phone in their performances. Pattinson will surely take his cue from the latter \u2013 honourable mention should also go to the excellent Michael Keaton \u2013 though it is a pity Kilmer\u2019s time in the A-list came before the comic book movie really found its feet.

Witness the emerging evidence that Bashar al-Assad in Damascus and Xi Jinping in Beijing are allowing the disease to wreak havoc among those groups whom the rulers have deemed to be unpersons, their lives unworthy of basic protection. Assad is deliberately leaving Syrians in opposition-held areas more vulnerable to the pandemic, according to <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/cross-border-aid-covid-19-and-us-decisions-syria\">Will Todman</a> of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. As he puts it: \u201cCovid-19 has provided Assad a new opportunity to instrumentalize suffering.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, China continues to hold 1 million Uighur Muslims in internment camps, where they contend now not only with inhuman conditions but also a coronavirus outbreak. Those camps are cramped, lack adequate sanitation and have poor medical facilities: the virus couldn\u2019t ask for a better breeding ground. What\u2019s more, Uighur Muslims are <a href=\"https://uighurtimes.com/index.php/in-a-dangerous-move-china-forces-30000-uighur-workers-to-return-to-work-in-hotan/\">reportedly being forced to work as labourers</a>, filling in for non-Muslims who are allowed to stay home and protect themselves. That, according to one observer, \u201c<a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/humanrights/2020/04/23/the-impact-of-covid-19-on-uighur-muslims-an-ignored-crisis/\">is reflective</a> of how the [People\u2019s] Republic of China views [Uighur Muslims] as nothing but disposable commodities\u201d.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the pandemic has allowed would-be dictators an excuse to seize yet more power. Enter Viktor Orb\u00e1n of Hungary, whose response to coronavirus was immediate: he persuaded his pliant parliament to grant him the right to rule by decree. Orb\u00e1n said he needed emergency powers to fight the dreaded disease, but there is no time limit on them; they will remain his even once the threat has passed. They include the power to jail those who \u201cspread false information\u201d. Naturally, that\u2019s already led to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/hungary-viktor-orban-coronavirus-laws-prompt-new-showdown-with-brussels\">crackdown on individuals </a>guilty of nothing more than posting criticism of the government on Facebook. Orb\u00e1n has long sought to rule Hungary as an autocrat, but the pandemic gave him his chance, allowing him to brand anyone standing in his way as unwilling to help the leader fight a mortal threat.</p> <p>Xi has not missed that same trick, using coronavirus to intensify his imposition of China\u2019s Orwellian \u201csocial credit\u201d system, whereby citizens are tracked, monitored and rated for their compliance. Now that system can include health and, thanks to the virus, much of the public ambivalence that previously existed towards it is likely to melt away. After all, runs the logic, good citizens are surely obliged to give up even more of their autonomy if it helps save lives.</p> <p>For many of the world\u2019s strongmen, though, coronavirus doesn\u2019t even need to be an excuse. Its chief value is the global distraction it has created, allowing unprincipled rulers to make mischief when natural critics at home and abroad are preoccupied with the urgent business of life and death.</p> <p>Donald Trump gets plenty of criticism for his botched handling of the virus, but while everyone is staring at the mayhem he\u2019s creating with one hand, the other is free to commit acts of vandalism that go all but undetected. This week the Guardian reported how the pandemic has not slowed the Trump administration\u2019s steady and deliberate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/trump-environmental-blitzkrieg-coronavirus\">erosion of environmental protections</a>. During the lockdown, Trump has eased fuel-efficiency standards for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/31/trump-epa-obama-clean-car-rules-climate-change\">new cars</a>, frozen rules for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/14/trump-epa-soot-pollution-clean-air-standards\">soot air pollution</a>, continued to lease public property to oil and gas companies, and advanced a proposal on mercury pollution from power plants that could make that easier too. Oh, and he\u2019s also <a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/climate-desk-trumps-epa-halts-environmental-law-enorcement-during-coronavirus-pandemic\">relaxed</a> reporting rules for polluters.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s Brazilian mini-me, Jair Bolsonaro, has outstripped his mentor. Not content with mere changes to the rulebook, he\u2019s pushed aside the expert environmental agencies and sent in the military to \u201cprotect\u201d the Amazon rainforest. I say \u201cprotect\u201d because, as <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/deforestation-amazon-has-soared-under-cover-coronavirus-n1204451\">NBC News reported this week</a>, satellite imagery shows \u201cdeforestation of the Amazon has soared under cover of the coronavirus\u201d. Destruction in April was up by 64% from the same month a year ago. The images reveal an area of land equivalent to 448 football fields, stripped bare of trees \u2013 this in the place that serves as the lungs of the earth. If the world were not consumed with fighting coronavirus, there would have been an outcry. Instead, and in our distraction, those trees have fallen without making a sound.</p> <p>Another Trump admirer, India\u2019s Narendra Modi, has seen the same opportunity identified by his fellow ultra-nationalists. Indian police have been using the lockdown to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/34ad9282-74d7-4a85-a629-a9655339c366\">crack down on Muslim citizens</a> and their leaders \u201cindiscriminately\u201d, according to activists. Those arrested or detained struggle to get access to a lawyer, given the restrictions on movement. Modi calculates that majority opinion will back him, as rightist Hindu politicians brand the virus a \u201cMuslim disease\u201d and pro-Modi TV stations declare the nation to be facing a \u201ccorona jihad\u201d.</p> <p>In Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 who can claim to have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/09/donald-trump-twin-benjamin-netanyahu-israel-white-house\">Trumpist before Trump</a> \u2013 has been handed a political lifeline by the virus, luring part of the main opposition party into a government of national unity that will keep him in power and, he hopes, out of the dock on corruption charges. His new coalition is committed to a programme that would see Israel annex major parts of the West Bank, permanently absorbing into itself territory that should belong to a future Palestinian state, with the process starting in early July. Now, <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-there-will-be-lots-of-annexation-talk-from-netanyahu-but-no-action-1.8826440\">the smart money suggests we should be cautious</a>: that it suits Netanyahu to promise/threaten annexation more than it does for him to actually do it. Even so, in normal times the mere prospect of such an indefensible move would represent an epochal shift, high on the global diplomatic agenda. In these abnormal times, it barely makes the news.</p> <p>Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House, argues that many of the global bad guys are, in fact, \u201cdemonstrating their weakness rather than strength\u201d \u2013 that they are all too aware that if they fail to keep their citizens alive, their authority will be shot. He notes Vladimir Putin\u2019s forced postponement of the referendum that would have kept him in power in Russia at least until 2036. When that vote eventually comes, says Niblett, Putin will go into it diminished by his failure to smother the virus.</p> <p>Still, for now, the pandemic has been a boon to the world\u2019s authoritarians, tyrants and bigots. It has given them what they crave most: fear and the cover of darkness.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>Ever since Boris Johnson announced that he wanted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-lockdown-what-has-boris-johnson-announced\">England\u2019s schools to reopen</a> at the start of June \u2013 just over two weeks away \u2013 the government has been on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/14/teachers-can-legally-refuse-to-return-over-risk-to-health-union-warns\">collision course with teachers</a>. In deciding to bring back reception and year 1 children first, aged just four to six years, he has chosen the group of pupils who will find social distancing most difficult.</p> <p>Of course, after seven weeks of lockdown, it\u2019s understandable that Britain needs a roadmap to easing the restrictions, and schools are key in allowing parents to return to the workplace. At some point, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/15/when-will-schools-reopen-uk-children-safe-coronavirus\">classes will have to reopen</a>. But what I\u2019ve found baffling is that, given the messages we\u2019ve been hearing from the government since 23 March about staying home and saving lives, it has somehow become unpatriotic for teachers to question the speed and safety of the return to class. It\u2019s important to try and keep fit and healthy during lockdown, but why should \u201cteacher shaming\u201d be the new stay-at-home sport?</p> <p>In the House of Commons this week, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, accused concerned teachers of \u201c<a href=\"https://schoolsweek.co.uk/coronavirus-8-things-we-learned-from-gavin-williamson-on-plans-to-reopen-schools/\">scaremongering</a>\u201d, saying: \u201cMaking people fear is really unfair and not a welcome pressure that is to be placed on families, children and teachers alike.\u201d</p> <p>My old English teacher Mary Bousted, now the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, seems to be a prime target. She\u2019s a wonderful person and got me through my O-level years ago, but yesterday she was accused of \u201cworking against the interests of children\u201d and today of being a \u201cCorbynite lover of communist Cuba\u201d in the Daily Mail. Also in the Mail, and in language perhaps reminiscent of his time as defence secretary, Williamson urged teachers to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8321225/Time-class-Row-teachers-unions-explodes.html\">do their duty</a>\u201d. So it is perhaps worth considering what public duty looks like in a time of enormous crisis and mortal risk.</p> <p>I supported the lockdown and the blood-curdling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/mps-to-review-coronavirus-emergency-laws-every-six-months\">emergency legislation</a> that followed it. I swallowed more authoritarian measures than I could ever have imagined in the fight against an invisible \u2013 but very real and deadly \u2013 enemy. I even tried to bite my tongue at the lack of preparedness for and early handling of the pandemic. I didn\u2019t want to dent ministerial morale if it would do more harm than good.</p> <p>But as the death toll rises, we are still waiting for a comprehensive testing and tracing strategy and proper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/coronavirus-uk-privately-run-ppe-stockpile-chaos-movianto\">personal protective equipment</a> for all our frontline health and social care workers (let alone for those in transport, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/dancing-with-the-devil-safety-concerns-rife-among-people-forced-back-to-work\">construction</a> and other sectors now being told to work). Rightwing libertarians balk at the policing of social distancing in parks and beauty spots, but seem to care little about the lack of health and safety enforcement in unsafe places of work. For a sense of perspective, only <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/olympic-britain/crime-and-defence/the-fallen/\">70,000 UK civilians</a> perished during the whole of the second world war. No need to \u201cscaremonger\u201d. Every day\u2019s numbers speak for themselves.</p> <p>So what does public duty look like for those making life-and-death decisions in government, for teachers\u2019 representatives and for every concerned citizen? It surely means trying to learn from evidence, experience and even past mistakes. It means asking pertinent questions before putting more people in harm\u2019s way and creating new \u201cfrontlines\u201d of infection. Right now, Britain doesn\u2019t have the ability to even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/11/boris-johnson-advice-coronavirus-spread-work\">monitor the spread of the virus</a>, let alone keep it under control.</p> <p>What is the scientific basis for assuming that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/children-as-likely-to-spread-coronavirus-as-adults-says-scientist\">children don\u2019t spread </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/children-as-likely-to-spread-coronavirus-as-adults-says-scientist\">coronavirus</a>? How can social distancing really be made to work with small children in particular? We don\u2019t need intemperate attacks on those who ask questions or speak inconvenient truth to power.</p> <p>Some say that if doctors are putting themselves at risk, why shouldn\u2019t teachers? With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/148000-in-england-infected-with-coronavirus-in-last-two-weeks\">around 150,000 people</a> carrying the virus, which remains both highly infectious and as deadly as ever, surely we don\u2019t need more people on the frontline? If primary schools were to become hotbeds of virus spreading as children and teachers return to their homes and families each evening, I suspect that health workers would not thank teachers, parents or ministers for this show of solidarity.</p> <p>Others talk of opening primary schools in purely economic terms, as if a \u201chealthy economy\u201d can somehow be immunised from a health catastrophe. More sympathetic voices put the needs of children\u2019s education and wellbeing front and centre. But even if children seem to suffer less from the virus directly, their wellbeing cannot thrive were they to innocently infect their parents, teachers and communities.</p> <p>So why this special venom for our teachers? Why do we trust these professionals to care for and educate our precious youngsters, but not to consider school safety? I asked an old schoolfriend, now a headteacher of a secondary school, working night and day to make sure his most vulnerable kids get the best support possible. He talks of the profession as \u201clong being maligned and misunderstood (always on holiday, go home at three, etc)\u201d. And he worries about the long-term consequences of the current bout of shaming on morale, retention and recruitment for the future.</p> <p>I can\u2019t help wondering why these wonderful people, who teach us to read, write, care and question, are being vilified and not applauded for their service.</p> <p>\u2022 Lady Shami Chakrabarti was shadow attorney general for England and Wales from 2016 to 2020, and was director of Liberty from 2003 to 2016</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Campsites in England are preparing to reopen in July, with social distancing measures in place and reduced capacity. Under the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/884760/Our_plan_to_rebuild_The_UK_Government_s_COVID-19_recovery_strategy.pdf\">Plan to Rebuild (pdf)</a>, published on 11 May, accommodation providers may be able to reopen from 4 July, subject to certain conditions.</p> <p>Bookings with <a href=\"https://coolcamping.com/\">Cool Camping</a>, a website and guidebook representing 600 UK campsites and glamping sites, have increased fivefold since Boris Johnson\u2019s speech on 10 May announcing the plan, although they remain lower than usual. On 15 May the company launched a <a href=\"https://coolcamping.com/coronavirus/coronavirus-booking-guarantee\">coronavirus booking guarantee</a>, allowing customers to book with a 20% deposit, pay the balance 10 days before the holiday and move the booking date for up to 18 months in the event of continued or renewed restrictions.</p> <p>While 4 July is the earliest possible reopening date, this will apply only if the government\u2019s tests have been met regarding the NHS, death rates, infection rates, testing and PPE, and if it is confident that easing measures will not contribute to a second peak. This could mean that campsites in some regions of England may be open before others, while the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland may adjust restrictions at different times. In Wales, holiday accommodation is due to remain closed until 26 September, but this guidance is being reviewed every 21 days.</p> <p>Listings on the Cool Camping website now also include proposed social distancing measures. All sites will increase cleaning and many will reduce site capacity to allow more space between pitches. Chapelfield Camping in the New Forest, for example, is opening a second meadow in order spread out the tents. Some sites will be adding more toilets and showers, while others, such as Ettie\u2019s Field in Leicestershire, will introduce time slots for using the showers. Many will reopen basic facilities before communal areas such as on-site shops.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01823a8584eaabe1ae83e411c726b56ec625de4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01823a8584eaabe1ae83e411c726b56ec625de4d/0_62_1833_1100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ettie\u2019s Field campsite in Leicestershire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ettie\u2019s Field in Leicestershire</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: &quot;PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.campingandcaravanningclub.co.uk/\">Camping and Caravanning Club</a>, which represents more than 1,300 UK sites, is also looking into social distancing and other safety measures, and has called for more official guidance. In a statement, Sabina Voysey, the director general, said: \u201cWe would urge the government to provide greater clarity on how the sector can safely open and operate campsites with additional measures in place.\u201d</p> <p>Voysey has suggested that, initially, campers should be permitted to visit only local sites: \u201cWe believe that you don\u2019t have to travel far for a break and a change of scene \u2013 by supporting local businesses and local economies in a sensible and phased approach, we can start to help the rebuilding process when the time is right.\u201d She added that, based on the earliest possible reopening, the organisation will have lost \u00a325m during lockdown.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.caravanclub.co.uk/\">Caravan and Motorhome Club</a> also said it is developing new operating, cleaning and safety protocols ahead of reopening. While <a href=\"https://www.pitchup.com/\">Pitchup.com</a>, which lists about 1,500 UK campsites, says bookings have increased 135% since Johnson\u2019s speech compared with the previous week. It estimates that staycations could increase 81% year on year if holidaymakers are unable to travel abroad. Dan Yates, Pitchup\u2019s founder, has noticed that while tents are usually the most popular form of accommodation, people who are already booking ahead for 2021 are choosing lodges, cabins, caravans or motorhomes. \u201cStructured accommodation offers a layer of protection and security which is important to holidaymakers who understandably feel a bit wary at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, this uptick could also be representative of families who haven\u2019t traditionally holidayed outdoors in the UK who have more money to spend on higher-cost accommodation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ebdd52dee6acd72bdad8de034a96289e41af447\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ebdd52dee6acd72bdad8de034a96289e41af447/0_87_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beudy Banc treehouse in Wales is listed on Canopy &amp; Stars\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beudy Banc treehouse in Wales is listed on Canopy &amp; Stars</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: POLLYLOVEGROVE/Canopy and Stars</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bookings with <a href=\"https://www.canopyandstars.co.uk/\">Canopy and Stars</a>, a collection of glampsites, have also increased over the past week. However, Mike Bevens, the managing director, said: \u201cThere is still a nervousness from travellers who don\u2019t want to book too early. Over 50% of our guests said that they are planning to make a last-minute booking when they have more information about travel restrictions.\u201d The company is introducing a Clean &amp; Safe charter for site owners to sign up to, committing them to additional safety and hygiene measures. It has also collated the <a href=\"https://www.canopyandstars.co.uk/self-check-in\">sites that offer self-check-in</a>, requiring no contact with anyone else.</p> <p>Visit Britain, meanwhile, is <a href=\"https://www.visitbritain.org/new-industry-standard-development-response-covid-19\">developing a quality mark</a> for tourism businesses, including campsites, in response to Covid-19. It is designed to reassure customers that businesses are adhering to government guidelines.</p> <p>Martin Smith, the founder <a href=\"https://www.campsites.co.uk/\">Campsites.co.uk</a>, said bookings are still down 90% on 2019 and sounded a note of caution: \u201cEven when sites are allowed to open again, many owners will be concerned for their own and their team\u2019s health. Some sites are choosing not to take campervan or tent guests when they reopen \u2013 only those with their own facilities \u2013 so that they can close their toilet and shower blocks.\u201d</p> <p>But even if the opening date is pushed back, Yates remains optimistic that many Britons will manage a domestic holiday this year. \u201cWe live in hope of an Indian summer, and around 20% of sites are open all year. Others may ask their local councils for permission to open longer.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Nearly two months after lockdown began, coming out of it was always going to be a difficult message to sell. It might have been easier if the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, had been a little happier about Downing Street\u2019s plan to announce an easing of the stay-at-home restrictions away from parliament on Sunday night.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson had claimed it was because restrictions had to be altered for the Monday. But in truth the goal was to secure as large a TV audience as possible \u2013 although keeping the Speaker onboard meant vital explanatory documents had to be held back until the Commons was sitting on Monday.</p> \n<p>In the gap, fateful confusion was sown. Traditional media management required trailing the prime minister\u2019s anticipated easing to the Sunday newspapers, and boldly Downing Street decided to brief its most reliable weekend paper, the Sunday Telegraph, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Telegraph/status/1259225012525039618?s=20\">with the revised slogan, </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Telegraph/status/1259225012525039618?s=20\">\u201cstay alert\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>That morning, though, there was little to back it up. How on earth was it possible to stay alert against a virus? Was it really time to drop the clearly understandable \u201cstay at home\u201d message, even though there were still around 400 people reported as dying every weekday? With little else to do, people rapidly shared their own versions online. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dylan_patel/status/1259382422048854016?s=20\">\u201cBe Vague, Cover Our Backs, Shirk Responsibility\u201d</a> said one of the many memes circulating.</p> \n<p>So the slogan \u2013 and the ensuing bafflement \u2013 became the story. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, tweeted out the Telegraph front page <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NicolaSturgeon/status/1259391575261696000?s=20\">saying it was \u201cthe first I\u2019ve seen of the PM\u2019s new slogan\u201d</a>. Welsh and Northern Irish administrations, responsible for their own health policies, followed suit \u2013 and a day later Labour-run Wales <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ecb509fd-f430-4c2d-ab19-d941a0f22b04\">briefly suggested it would be policing its own border with England</a>.

Except the government had to rush out a clarification to say, no, people can only meet one parent a time from outside their household, a baffling restriction that made less sense as the week wore on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/12/housing-market-in-england-to-reopen-for-socially-distanced-property-viewings\">and rules to allow estate agents into homes were relaxed</a>.</p> \n<p>It fell to <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/11594276/phillip-schofield-holly-willoughby-lockdown-confusion/\">Phillip Schofield, the perennial This Morning presenter, to voice the growing national frustration</a>. \u201cYou literally couldn\u2019t write this. If this was in a farce on the telly I would go: \u2018That is a bit far-fetched, no government would arse it up that much,\u2019\u201d he declared in a studio rant that left his co-presenter, Holly Willoughby, unable to get a word in.</p> \n<p>A day later Matt Hancock, the health secretary, went on to ITV to give the presenter some answers. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/matt-hancock-tries-to-clear-up-confusion-over-coronavirus-advice\">he ended up agreeing on-air that \u201csummer is cancelled\u201d</a> and that people should not hug each other until a vaccine was found. It was as if the government could not catch up.</p> \n<p>The repeated missteps were a gift to Labour, whose new leader, Sir Keir Starmer, had been struggling to cut through, while the public had rallied around the government, the NHS and Johnson himself as he recovered from his serious brush with the deadly virus.</p> \n<p>Starmer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Keir_Starmer/status/1259888498280067072?s=20\">was granted his own special broadcast on Monday</a>. \u201cAfter all this, all the sacrifice and the loss, we can\u2019t go back to business as usual,\u201d he said. And just as Downing Street finally thought it had managed to explain what the \u201cstay alert\u201d phase meant, Starmer successfully ambushed Johnson on Wednesday lunchtime at prime minister\u2019s questions.</p> \n<p>Switching to the crisis in care homes, he challenged a clearly unprepared prime minister. Brandishing official advice that was valid until 13 March, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/13/pmqs-keir-starmer-presses-boris-johnson-over-care-home-deaths\">Starmer coolly accused the government of having \u201cseeded\u201d the epidemic</a> in care homes by transferring in Covid-19 patients from hospitals.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5db220bd-91df-44be-8f21-f47c8505b40b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xAU2euHH8v0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Johnson vainly tried to deny the advice existed. Then Downing Street claimed, wrongly, that Starmer was misquoting. The Daily Telegraph sketch writer Michael Deacon wrote that Johnson <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/05/13/keir-starmer-took-boris-johnson-apart-like-duplo-train-set/\">had been taken apart \u201clike a Duplo train set\u201d</a> \u2013 and the sight of an effective, organised opposition attack left Tory MPs spooked.</p> \n<p>If there had been a truce over coronavirus, it was well and truly over \u2013 and pollsters recorded a shift in mood. This week <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/health/survey-results/daily/2020/05/13/fa60a/1\">YouGov reported that 65% of Britons believed</a> that the government\u2019s messaging had been \u201cnot very clear\u201d or \u201cnot clear at all\u201d. They also saw <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/trackers/boris-johnson-approval-rating\">Johnson\u2019s net approval rating </a><a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/trackers/boris-johnson-approval-rating\">fall to plus 22</a> \u2013 behind Starmer\u2019s at plus 23.</p> \n<p>It is too soon to say whether the government has bounced back from a week of disastrous communications, or whether the lifting of lockdown \u2013 and its necessary nuance \u2013 will continue to be dogged by frustration and confusion, but Schofield can be seen as a new barometer.</p>",

  "<p>Care workers have been warned by a trade union not to use a government app meant to help them during the coronavirus pandemic because it allows their managers to identify staff who have complained about pay, testing and personal protective equipment.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dedicated-app-for-social-care-workers-launched\">Matt Hancock launched a mobile app</a> last week for 1.5 million people in the adult social care workforce which was supposed to distribute policy updates and infection control advice through smartphones.</p> <p>The Care Workforce app promised to help \u201ccare workers get access to guidance, learning resources, discounts and other support all in one place\u201d.</p> <p>But the GMB union has advised members to avoid using the app because it has a webchat function which is insecure, and it gives managers access to what are presumed to be private messages.</p> <p>Documents seen by the Guardian include a claim by one named care worker that an employer had failed to pay the minimum wage.</p> <p>\u201cWas paid yesterday and noticed my wages didn\u2019t go up to the minimum wage on April 1st, I think it\u2019s a disgrace, we\u2019re all working so hard and risking ourselves and our families\u2019 lives coming in contact with the virus and now I\u2019m being underpaid!\u201d</p> <p>Another complained of a lack of PPE, saying it was \u201cwrong that you only get \u00a395 for sick pay when you get infected\u201d.</p> <p>And a third, who was identifiable by their name, said: \u201cIt is ridiculous that staff have to sort out testing ourselves. Our employers should sort it out.\u201d</p> <p>Rehana Azam, GMB\u2019s national secretary, said the app had already exposed many care workers to the possibility of sanctions and urged them not to use it.</p> <p>\u201cExposing users\u2019 personal details on this app in this way is grossly incompetent at best \u2013 but we say it\u2019s a downright betrayal of key workers whichever way you look at it,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cHealth and care workers are terrified of speaking out about the dangerous lack of PPE in case they get reprimanded or sacked by their employer for raising the issue.</p> <p>\u201cNow the government launches an app that slaps their private data all over the place for anyone to see. Bosses can quite easily use it to spy on workers, see what they\u2019re saying and potentially sanction them.\u201d</p> <p>Azam said Hancock was to blame for the \u201cdisaster\u201d.</p> <p>At the app\u2019s launch in March, the health and social care secretary called on all care workers to download the app.</p> <p>\u201cWe have launched a new app specifically for care workers to make sure they have the most up-to-date guidance to keep them safe, connected with their colleagues across the country, which also allows them to access discounts like their NHS counterparts.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s available to download right now, and I would urge everyone in social care to do so,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-key-workers\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>To register, workers must provide their name, email and region and the postcode of their employer.

  "<p>A police officer has been placed under criminal investigation after a man was shot with a Taser weapon and left paralysed from the waist down, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>The man, 23, was shot by an officer using a stun gun as he jumped over a wall and fell as officers tried to detain him in Haringey, north London.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/09/police-watchdog-london-taser-injury-investigate\">The incident</a> happened on 4 May and is being investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). The man was arrested for drug-related offences and has been in hospital ever since.</p> <p>The IOPC said that after it had examined the initial evidence one police officer was now subject to a criminal investigation for the alleged offence of causing grievous bodily harm.</p> <p>The police watchdog said the officer \u201cwill be asked by IOPC investigators to give a written account under caution. The officer has also been served notice of investigation for gross misconduct.\u201d It stressed it did not mean the officer had done anything wrong.</p> <p>The man\u2019s family are in turmoil after the incident and have asked not to be named. His sister told the Guardian: \u201cIt is a tragic time for the family. Emotions are high and there is a great deal of upset. Life has completely changed. He is young. We can\u2019t understand how this has happened.\u201d</p> <p>Sal Naseem from the IOPC said: \u201cHaving examined a range of evidence including body-worn video, witness statements and medical evidence, we have taken the decision that this is now a criminal investigation. A criminal investigation does not mean that criminal charges will necessarily follow.</p> <p>\u201cWe understand that many people are concerned about this incident and I want to reassure people that this is being thoroughly and independently investigated.\u201d</p> <p>David Lammy, MP for the area where the incident happened, said: \u201cI\u2019ve met with the family and there is definitely community concern about this incident. We need a full and thorough investigation into how he has ended up with life-changing injuries.\u201d</p> <p>Police and the government believe Taser weapons are a vital tool for officers. But they have been controversial because of claims of deaths linked to them, and alleged disproportionate use against black people.</p> <p>Police point to incidents where Taser weapons have saved lives, such as stopping a knife attacker at Leytonstone tube station in December 2015.</p> <p>In the Haringey case the IOPC are expected to examine if deployment of the Taser weapon was lawful and proportionate. They will also see if due regard was taken of the risk posed by firing the electric stun gun as a suspect clambered over a wall.</p> <p>The IOPC are accused by some in policing of subjecting officers to long investigations for little reason. Those who help families accuse the police watchdog of failing to be effective and hold state power to account.</p> <p>The veteran community activist Stafford Scott said: \u201cCommunity tensions are building. Even though we are on lockdown my phone hasn\u2019t stopped ringing.</p> <p>\u201cNo one appears able to hold the police to account for their use.</p> <p>\u201cWe are angry but not surprised whatsoever, as it is our experience as a community that the MPS [Metropolitan police service] is an institutionally racist organisation that shows no signs of, or willingness to change.\u201d</p> <p>The IOPC said the incident started when police on patrol approached a man, in his 20s, on Burgoyne Road, close to Finsbury Park.</p> <p>The IOPC said the man \u201csuffered a life-changing injury\u201d and added: \u201cWe understand that the man ran off and police officers chased and then Tasered him as he jumped over a wall. The man fell and suffered serious injuries. He was arrested for drug-related offences and was taken to hospital where he was assessed as having a life-changing injury.\u201d</p> <p>Police say they use force rarely and officers are highly trained in the use of Taser weapons, which more and more officers are carrying.</p> <p>Commander Kyle Gordon, the Met lead for firearms including Taser weapons, said: \u201cTaser can be a more appropriate tactical option for officers to resolve an incident and prevent violence escalating than the traditional use of a baton or pepper spray. Of the approximately 9,500 occasions a year a Taser is used in the Metropolitan police district, one is fired just 9% of the time.\u201d</p> <p>The IOPC said it was concerned about claims of the disproportionate use of stun guns against black people and those with mental ill health.</p> <p>Just under 7,000 Met officers carry Taser stun guns and that will rise to 10,000 by 2022, just under a third of the force.</p> <p>The incident in north London was one of several recent ones involving Taser weapons that led the IOPC this week to call for greater scrutiny of their use.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/police-urged-to-justify-use-of-stun-guns-against-black-men\">Other incidents</a> include use of a Taser weapon, caught on video, by Greater Manchester police on a man outside a petrol station, when his child was nearby. On 6 May a man was stopped in Southwark, London, for a drugs search and was red dotted with a Taser weapon.</p> <p>The IOPC also said it was examining an incident involving West Midlands police, but declined to give further details.</p>",

In co-ordination, Trump campaign manager BradParscale issued a <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/media/trump-campaign-statement-on-case-against-gen.-flynn-being-dropped/\">statement</a> saying: \u201c[T]he Obama-Biden officials responsible for these misdeeds must be held accountable.\u201d</p> <p>Immediately after the filing in the Flynn case, Barr went on national television and attacked the FBI, pointedly disparaging its 2016 investigation into Russian interference and <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/attorney-general-william-barr-on-michael-flynn-obamacare-and-coronavirus-restrictions-transcript/\">letting it be known</a> that FBI officials or ex-officials were under examination for prosecution: \u201c[J]ust because something may even stink to high heaven and \u2026 appear to everyone to be bad we still have to apply the right standard and be convinced that there\u2019s a violation of a criminal statute.\u201d</p> <p>Then on Wednesday, Barr\u2019s press spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec, upped the ante in the high-stakes effort to lend political support to Gen Flynn and to Trump\u2019s partisan political interests. Kupec complained about an allegedly nefarious effort involving Joe Biden to \u201cunmask\u201d Flynn\u2019s identity during the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p> <p>She <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/michael-flynn-unmasking-obama-biden/2020/05/13/d9593030-9545-11ea-82b4-c8db161ff6e5_story.html\">said this</a> to the Fox news correspondent Martha MacCallum: \u201cMartha, what happened to candidate Trump and then President Trump was one of the greatest political injustices in American history and should never happen again.\u201d</p> <p>It is remarkable how quickly Flynn\u2019s fate is put aside and the focus shifted to the president.</p> <p>When has a justice department press person ever issued so nakedly political a statement?</p> <p>Biden was among several people who asked that the intelligence committee to identify the unnamed American who had been recorded in a conversation with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, about Obama\u2019s newly imposed sanctions in December 2016. It apparently doesn\u2019t matter to the Barr justice department that the rules were scrupulously adhered to in this \u201cunmasking\u201d. It also doesn\u2019t matter that such requests are permitted if the identity unmasked is necessary to understand the information, and that such requests are hardly unusual. The National Security Agency handles such unmasking requests in thousands of cases: 10,000 in 2019 and nearly 17,000 in 2018.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Using the department in this way undermines the integrity of the lawyers and prosecutors who work there</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kupec\u2019s statement tracks perfectly with Mr Trump\u2019s partisan campaign messaging and with the president\u2019s efforts to present himself and his most loyal followers as victims of a conspiracy.

Indeed, Edmund Randolph, the first attorney general of the United States, was a close ally of George Washington, having served as the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/ag/bio/randolph-edmund-jennings\">general\u2019s chief of staff and personal secretary</a>. During Randolph\u2019s term, Washington relied on him for support on matters that went <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2213&amp;context=facpub\">well beyond the formal duties of his office</a>.</p> <p>Other attorneys general have followed in Randolph\u2019s footsteps, serving as close political allies of the president. Examples from the early years of the country include <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/about/history/pages/rbtaney.aspx\">Andrew Jackson\u2019s attorney general, Roger Taney</a>, who worked <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/us-government/bank-of-the-united-states\">hand-in-hand with Jackson to end funding</a> for the Bank of the United States.</p> <p>In the 20th century, Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s attorneys general regularly helped him in political battles. Some of those battles <a href=\"http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2010/04/KatyalCaplan.pdf\">involved the justice department</a> and some did not.

That is a new and dangerous ballgame.</p> <p>Using the justice department in this way undermines the integrity and professionalism of the lawyers and prosecutors who work there. It turns law into an arena for gaining partisan advantage and settling political grudges.</p> <p>Having gotten away with doing the same in his dealings with Ukraine, the president has an attorney general who is only too happy to go beyond merely politicizing the DoJ. He seems determined to turn it into a full-fledged arm of the Trump campaign.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you write a column about really bad wines?\u201d my neighbour Adam asked. \u201cBecause I have limited space and reckon readers find it more useful to know what\u2019s worth buying, actually,\u201d I retorted.</p> <p>Still, I take his point, and it\u2019s a subject that comes under periodic discussion among wine writers. Why don\u2019t we include adverse reviews more often? After all, restaurant reviewers do, and it makes for entertaining reading, even though it\u2019s a given that not everyone can get to the restaurant in question. Theoretically everyone <em>can</em> get hold of a wine I write about, though that may be a bit of a struggle right now.</p> <p>The thing is, personal taste comes into play with wine, and perceptions differ. The reason Adam asked about bad wine was because he\u2019d just bought a bottle from the Co-op \u2013 its <strong><a href=\"https://www.coop.co.uk/products/verdicchio-dei-castelli-di-jesi-697515\">2019 Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico</a></strong> (\u00a36, 12.5%) \u2013 that he thought was disgusting. I tasted it and thought it pretty decent myself: a typically neutral Italian white that doesn\u2019t stand out in a line-up or even make particularly thrilling drinking on its own, but that rubs along really well with food, particularly a plate of pasta.</p> <p>What you think of a wine depends where you\u2019re coming from and your tolerance of sweetness and acidity. If you\u2019re sensitive to the latter, you may find wines such as picpoul and pinot grigio too sharp. If you don\u2019t have a sweet tooth (as I don\u2019t), you may find an <a href=\"https://www.decanter.com/learn/advice/what-is-the-difference-between-ripasso-and-appassimento-ask-decanter-377975/\">appassimento</a> red overly rich and cloying. And if you\u2019re used to conventionally made wines, you\u2019ll probably find natural wines weird and funky. Like your reds light and fresh and served cool (see the Gaillac in today\u2019s panel)? Then you probably won\u2019t enjoy a beefy, Barossa shiraz.</p> <p>That said, some wines are just not very well made : as with chefs, winemakers can be good or bad at their jobs. Wines can also suffer from the conditions they\u2019ve been kept in (under hot shop lights, for example) or the fact that they\u2019ve simply been kept too long: bin ends are bin ends for a reason.</p> <p>There\u2019s also the issue of price. You generally get what you pay for, though I have to say the <strong>Isla Negra Merlot</strong> I bought the other day in my local Tesco Metro showed remarkably good merlot character for \u00a35.25 and was a much better buy than the weedy and unpleasantly sharp <strong>Wine Route Merlot</strong> that was part of the same store\u2019s \u201cmeal deal\u201d, but priced individually at \u00a37.

  "<p>Joe Biden has had a hard time capturing the hearts of progressive Democrats. Like the media, progressive Democrats tend to see him as a centrist \u2013 a status quo candidate who just wants to return the US and the world to the pre-Trump era. Even Biden\u2019s collaborations with Bernie Sanders, including the recently announced <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/05/13/855203151/biden-and-sanders-announce-task-forces-to-find-party-unity-over-policy\">unity </a><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/05/13/855203151/biden-and-sanders-announce-task-forces-to-find-party-unity-over-policy\">task</a><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/05/13/855203151/biden-and-sanders-announce-task-forces-to-find-party-unity-over-policy\">forces</a>, are often dismissed as pure window-dressing. But this kind of blithe dismissal of the presumptive Democratic nominee misreads both the politician and the times.</p> <p>It is true that Biden was never a very progressive Democrat, but neither was he a particularly conservative one. He has been a classic \u201ccentrist Democrat\u201d. But it\u2019s important to note that this places him not in the political center of the US electorate, but in the center of the Democratic party \u2013 a party that has shifted left significantly since 2016, as has Biden.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/14/joe-biden-bernie-sanders-supporters-leftwing-voters\">Joe Biden needs to do a lot more if he wants to win over Sanders voters | Nathan Robinson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Biden is a realist. He knows when the times are a-changin\u2019. That\u2019s why he joined Barack Obama in 2008 and why he has moved to reconcile with Sanders in 2020. After two powerful primary campaigns, Biden is smart enough to acknowledge that Sanders represents the direction the party\u2019s base is moving to, and that he could shape that transformation.</p> <p>As Gabriel Debenedetti <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/05/joe-biden-presidential-plans.html\">argues</a> in his excellent New York magazine article on the Biden campaign, the Covid-19 pandemic has opened Biden\u2019s eyes to the need for a more radical approach to policy and governance. As Biden told a group of donors: \u201cThe blinders have been taken off because of this Covid crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Crises can lead to fundamental changes. While we mainly focus on the darkest consequences, such as Adolf Hitler\u2019s rise to power in the wake of the Great Depression, that same crisis also gave rise to the <a href=\"https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/remembering-made-fdr-great/\">greatest progressive project</a> in US history: Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal. While heralded as a \u201cradical\u201d by many today, FDR was in many ways a realpolitiker, politically expedient and adjustable to the mood of the times.</p> <p>But perhaps the best comparison would be FDR\u2019s protege <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/opinion/joe-biden-progressive.html\">Lyndon B Johnson</a>, the southerner who, in an atmosphere of intense polarization over civil rights and in the wake of the national trauma of the assassination of John F Kennedy, introduced some of the most important civil rights legislation in US history. As with Johnson, the current crisis provides Biden with an opportunity to step out of the shadow of his charismatic and inspiring Democratic predecessor, Obama, and become a much more transformative president.</p> <p>To be clear, this is not a foregone conclusion. Moderates, both Democrats and Republicans, also see Biden as a great opportunity, in their case to re-establish the status quo. Many of them have been around Biden for years, if not decades, and play important roles in his campaign \u2013 I\u2019m looking at you, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-biden-economy/biden-campaigns-outside-economic-advisers-include-larry-summers-idUSKCN2253QX\">Larry Summers</a>.</p> <p>But the recently announced unity taskforces \u2013 on the climate crisis, criminal justice reform, economy, education, healthcare and immigration \u2013 show a more mixed picture. First, they much better reflect the ethnic and gender diversity of the contemporary Democratic party and its electorate \u2013 with many prominent African American and Hispanic members as well as twice as many female than male co-chairs. Second, they include many prominent progressives, including Sanders surrogates such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Pramila Jayapal \u2013 hardly politicians who will accept a token role.</p> <p>While some \u201cBernie or bust\u201d keyboard warriors will invariably denounce these progressives as sellouts, and some jaded progressives as naive, they are actually realists who should be supported and strengthened. Few politicians understand the signs of the times better than Ocasio-Cortez. She knows that the country and the party are changing, and she understands that the Covid-19 crisis provides a unique opportunity to accelerate that change.</p> <p>Moreover, these progressives realize that Biden does not have a set ideology, but is in many ways an empty vessel whose domestic policies and priorities are still very much in flux and in play. In other words, progressives have two fights to fight: one for a President Biden, against the Republicans, and one for a progressive Biden presidency, against the moderate Democrats.</p> <ul> <li><p>Cas Mudde is a Guardian US columnist and the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor in the school of public and international affairs at the University of Georgia.

  "<p>Had everything gone to plan, Kalie Shorr would have just wrapped her first UK tour. Instead, the 25-year-old country songwriter is stuck in Nashville, diagnosed with coronavirus and fighting trolls who accused her of faking it for publicity. It\u2019s the longest she\u2019s spent at home since music became her full-time gig seven years ago. She has been writing songs with her two housemates but, otherwise, lockdown has been an exercise in getting comfortable with her own company. \u201cI am very extroverted and thrive on chaos,\u201d she says with a guilty laugh.</p> <p>Shorr is no stranger to it. Her 2019 debut album, Open Book, documents the worst year of her life: her older sister\u2019s fatal heroin overdose; a cheating boyfriend; an eating disorder relapse. \u201cI\u2019ve never been worse, thanks for asking,\u201d Shorr sings on the album\u2019s opening line. \u201cIs it making you nervous, all this honesty?\u201d Her poignant bleakness and acid wit (the latter honed at stand-up nights between gigs) did spook the famously conservative country industry. \u201cThey\u2019re terrified to take a chance on something they don\u2019t understand,\u201d says Shorr. So she self-released the album, a gloves-off evolution of Taylor Swift\u2019s Nashville years. It made the New York Times\u2019 best albums of 2019. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2020/mar/25/the-guide-staying-in-sign-up-for-our-home-entertainment-tips\">The Guide: Staying In  \u2013 sign up for our home entertainment tips</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shorr is more strategic and resourceful than that chaotic exterior. Age 11, she told her dad she wanted to sign a publishing deal one day: \u201cHe was like, you wanna write a book?\u201d The pre-teen Shorr avidly read CD liner notes, researching the songwriters whose names appeared alongside those of the Dixie Chicks and Faith Hill. \u201cFrom there I fell down a songwriting rabbit hole.\u201d Shorr grew up \u201chonestly, just poor\u201d in Maine, shuttling between her divorced parents. In a home where religion was \u201ckind of a replacement\u201d for psychology and therapy, she was sent to a pastor to address her anorexia, someone \u201cwho has no qualification in talking to a teenage girl about how she\u2019s not eating cos she\u2019s trying to maintain control over her world and she doesn\u2019t have any\u201d, Shorr recalls. She was left to figure it out on her own, and songwriting became a way of processing the world: \u201cMaking it rhyme and being able to organise it into three minutes and 30 seconds.\u201d <br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4MrLB2Ahe8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_4MrLB2Ahe8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Shorr posted covers on YouTube to lure listeners to her original material. After travelling to Nashville to perform at a showcase organised by Perez Hilton, she realised she would have to move there if she wanted to make it. So she headed south aged 18 and took a forensic approach to her hustle, studying the industry up close, \u201ctrying to pregame the whole thing\u201d, she says. \u201cI wanted to brace myself for the worst-case scenario.\u201d She worked by day in a clothing shop and took an all-night job at a hotdog stand. \u201cI\u2019d seen E! True Hollywood Story,\u201d she says. \u201cIf Faith Hill can work at McDonald\u2019s, I can most certainly work at the snack shack on Broadway.\u201d</p> <p>There was no worst-case scenario, at least not career-wise. Shorr joined Song Suffragettes, a female songwriters\u2019 collective countering the industry\u2019s gender disparity. Showcasing her song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGM849A3g0s\">Fight Like a Girl</a> (\u201cwhen you push me, I\u2019ll just push back harder\u201d) at its weekly live slot earned her a publishing deal. For a while, Shorr smoothed down her edges to try to write commercial material that might get playlisted on country radio. Then the beginnings of her bad year, in 2018, forced her honesty back out. \u201cMy manager told me, \u2018All you\u2019re doing right now is listening to Alanis Morissette and Fiona Apple and crying \u2013 channel that, that\u2019s clearly what you need to do on a personal level\u2019,\u201d she recalls. After her sister died, she wrote Vices, confessing to all her unhealthiest coping mechanisms: \u201cI keep waking up next to my ex because he knows my body / And his new girlfriend, well she doesn\u2019t know / And hell, I wish I was sorry.\u201d It was liberating, says Shorr. \u201cIt\u2019s accountability, being able to admit that, because then it\u2019s a lot harder to do it again.\u201d</p> <p>When she showed her manager another new song, the savagely funny kiss-off <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHm_H6S6iyU\">F U Forever</a>, he leaned back in his chair. \u201cHe was like: \u2018Fuck, I guess we\u2019re doing this!\u2019\u201d Shorr says. She recently revisited the songs she was writing at school. \u201cThey were so much like Open Book,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s so beautiful and reassuring that I\u2019m on the right path, because Open Book channels who I was when I was first using songwriting as a coping mechanism and a crutch \u2013 that raw emotion before you\u2019re really taught you need to be ashamed of it. I\u2019m never gonna go back to writing songs from a guarded perspective.\u201d </p> <p>Naming Open Book an album of 2019, the New York Times wrote: \u201cEveryone in Nashville is likely hoping to sandpaper her into something just a bit less confrontational; fingers crossed that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d It hasn\u2019t. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s tried to chisel me down because I really came in swinging,\u201d says Shorr. \u201cWhen you put out F U Forever, you can\u2019t go back.\u201d Still, she is frustrated by the labels\u2019 resistance to her: \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018We can\u2019t really sign another girl\u2019 or \u2018We don\u2019t really know what to do with it\u2019. Well, the fans know what to do with it. People are finding this and we haven\u2019t had a marketing budget.

  "<p>As quarantine measures are<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/lockdown-easing-have-other-leaders-fared-better-than-boris-johnson\"> slowly lifted</a> in the UK, the virus will continue to spread unless the government puts in place a strategy to curb the rate of infection. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/08/how-covid-19-contact-tracing-can-help-beat-the-pandemic\">Contact tracing</a>, a practice long used in public health to control infectious diseases, will be crucial to driving down the rate of infection, or R, and minimising further cases of coronavirus.</p> <p>Epidemiologists have been using traditional contact tracing for years to control sexually transmitted infections, infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and meningitis. The basic principle of how an infectious disease spreads is that one individual, person A, will pass on the disease to person B, who then passes it on to C, continuing in a chain to D, E, F and onwards. Epidemiologists interrupt these chains of transmission by identifying people through contact tracing before they spread the infection to others.</p> <p>If we diagnose a sexually transmitted disease in person B, for example, a highly trained public health or clinical professional will interview that person, and ask them who they have had sex with recently. There has to be a person A, from whom B acquired the infection in the first place, and there may be one or more Cs, or people they passed it on to. Though it\u2019s not always possible to identify all the As and Cs that could be involved, one major development in contact tracing has been mobile phones: person B may have the relevant phone numbers or dating app details that lead back to others.</p> <p>Once identified, these A and Cs are invited to attend a sexual health clinic for investigation and are treated if they test positive. If the contact tracing is successful and the chain of transmission is broken, there will be no Ds or Es. </p> <p>Tuberculosis follows the same principle. Contract tracers initially identify those in the infected person\u2019s household, where the risk of being infected with TB is highest. Because the disease is usually spread by a person who has TB in their lungs, public health professionals may also ask the patient to identify colleagues or friends who have had an obvious cough for a number of weeks.</p> <p>The third disease we use contact tracing for is invasive meningococcal disease. Close contacts \u2013 typically those within the same household, or people who have shared overnight accommodation \u2013 are at a markedly increased risk of developing these rare conditions. These people will usually be offered antibiotics to eliminate bacteria and stop the infection developing.</p> <p>Contact tracing for coronavirus is different to these diseases and presents new challenges. For one thing, the sheer number of cases \u2013 the Office for National Statistics estimates that 148,000 people in England have been infected with the virus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/148000-in-england-infected-with-coronavirus-in-last-two-weeks\">over the past two weeks</a> \u2013 means contact tracers will have their work cut out. But it\u2019s also much more difficult to identify a person A with Covid-19. They may have shown no symptoms, or may have already recovered before person B develops symptoms. So it\u2019s crucial to identify as many of the Cs as possible, before they go on to pass the infection to others. When contact tracers have identified potential Cs, these people are asked to isolate until they get tested, and stay at home until they test negative.</p> <p>Isolating one single case can prevent a whole chain of future transmissions. This is why tracing, isolating and testing people for coronavirus is essential for reducing the R rate across a population. Although it\u2019s impossible to find all cases, the more cases that are contact-traced, the more the R is driven down.</p> <p>The number of asymptomatic coronavirus cases means that a contact-tracing app is an important part of breaking the transmission chain. In countries such as South Korea, these apps, used together with traditional tracing methods, have been crucial for controlling the virus. The people you pass at the supermarket or on the street may be unknown carriers of the disease. If they later develop and report symptoms, the app sends an alert to people who came into contact with them.</p> <p>One important feature of apps such as the one used in South Korea is geolocation data. This additional feature allows public health authorities to identify potential hotspots of transmission earlier than they would otherwise, targeting measures quickly and efficiently at the places where these are most needed. Of course, some have raised privacy concerns about apps that use geolocation data (the <a href=\"https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/\">NHSX </a>app <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/bluetooth-contact-tracing-apps\">uses Bluetooth to inform other app users</a>, and doesn\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/nhs-covid-19-app-health-status-future\">currently capture geolocation data</a>). Many would consider South Korea\u2019s contact-tracing approach, which uses CCTV and credit card data alongside geolocation information, an invasion of privacy. But as we saw in the <a href=\"https://time.com/5834991/south-korea-coronavirus-nightclubs/\">recent nightclub outbreak</a>, where South Korean authorities were able to contact everyone present in the building, this level of detail allows public health authorities to quickly identify potential cases.</p> <p>The UK government has announced that it will deploy 18,000 contact tracers, 3,000 of whom will be health professionals. Ideally, each newly identified person with coronavirus would be contacted by one of these team members, who would then identify others that person had come into contact with, and advise them accordingly. The more cases that are found, the better \u2013 but even if contact tracers only manage to identify a portion of coronavirus cases, this will still have an impact on the spread of the virus.</p> <p>Crucially, contact tracing is part of a picture that should also include adequate testing, isolating and social distancing measures. Only with an integrated epidemic control strategy will we manage to reduce the spread of Covid-19.</p> <p>\u2022 Keith Neal is professor emeritus of epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham</p> <p><br><br></p>",
  "<p>Rain falls in the Almer\u00eda desert. A mummified hand gradually emerges from the sluiced sand. It appears to be giving a one-figured salute to the sky. It is the perfect opening image for Netflix\u2019s irreverent, brash, kinetic new 10-part crime drama-cum-caper.</p> <p>The desiccated corpse is identified as Axel Walker (Tom Rhys Harries), a young DJ who moved from Manchester to the Balearics 20 years ago with a group of friends trying to make their mark on Ibiza, and who subsequently disappeared without trace. The thriller unfolds on two timelines: the group\u2019s 90s glory days, when they ruled the clubbing roost in Manchester and their gradual comedown as they try to settle in Spain, and the present-day mystery of who killed Axel and why. In the absence of much police concern, his sister Zoe (Laura Haddock, the lead in recent BBC drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/03/the-capture-review-chillingly-real-thriller-or-utter-bobbins-lets-check-the-tape\">The Capture</a>) flies out to Nancy Drew it herself.</p> <p>Simply put, White Lines is a massive amount of fun. It\u2019s the latest creation of \u00c1lex Pina, the man behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/02/how-money-heist-became-netflix-biggest-global-hit\">Money Heist</a> \u2013 the streaming platform\u2019s most watched non-English language series \u2013 and it gathers momentum with every scene. Each one ratchets up the suspense (it emerges early on that Axel was involved with the daughter of the head of Ibiza\u2019s main crime family, the Calafats), the emotional investment (the effects of what Zoe thought was her brother\u2019s careless abandonment on her) or the gleeful absurdity. In the opening episode, Axel\u2019s former best friend, Marcus (Daniel Mays). can be found resuscitating a dog that has overdosed on the cocaine leaking from the inflatable banana boat he uses to haul his product in. There\u2019s plenty of sex, too, courtesy of Marcus\u2019s ex-wife Anna (Angela Griffin) who runs what the new girl guides are advised not to call orgies but do very much resemble, at least to the untutored eye, exactly that. They\u2019re especially popular with Oriol Calafat, the family\u2019s son and heir, as a way of relaxing in between trying to expand the family business beyond club-running and skimming drug money.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"White Lines trailer\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Uj7uyeaJjFQ?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, the head of the family is busy commissioning his heavies to find out who killed Axel and buried him on Calafat land \u201cto fuck with me\u201d. The first port of call for his right-hand man, Boxer, is Marcus, who is almost drowned in a swimming pool until Zoe harpoons the big fella through the leg. There are no hard feelings though \u2013 Boxer is a professional who understands the price of his business \u2013 and the three of them attend hospital together.</p> <p>White Lines has been hyped as the hit of the summer, and even though it will not be the summer any of us were expecting I\u2019d be surprised if this lurid, swirling, fantastically confident creation didn\u2019t hit the spot. Its energetic brio and the escapism-cum-nostalgia-trip (via a soundtrack stuffed with the Happy Mondays, the Farm, Radiohead and all points in between), may be even more rapturously received under current conditions than it would otherwise have been.</p> <p>Guardian trigger warning: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2020/jan/23/want-to-know-what-racism-feels-like-ask-laurence-fox\">Laurence Fox</a> pops up in episode three as a friend of Axel\u2019s who abandoned the club scene for a spiritual awakening in India. But I really wouldn\u2019t let it bother you unduly. Enjoy.</p>",
  "<p>My brother-in-law Robert Fieldhouse, who has died aged 68 after contracting Covid-19, was a teacher of students with learning difficulties. He was also a poet and an inspirational friend, who influenced many with his profound \u2013 and eclectic \u2013 love of music and literature.</p> <p>Born in Leeds, he was the son of Stanley Fieldhouse, a civil engineer, and his wife, Doreen (nee Wright). His father\u2019s career meant that for much of his childhood the family lived abroad, in places as varied as Yemen, Egypt and Germany. On return, they settled in Orpington, Kent, where Robert went to the Ramsden school for boys. In 1970 he trained as an English teacher at what is now Goldsmiths, University of London. </p> <p>His first posts were at secondary schools in south London, where he quickly showed an instinctive rapport with special needs students. His great height and good looks gave him an imposing presence, but he was a gentle giant, combining a calm kindness with true sympathy.</p> <p>In 1977 Robert married Angela Roddam, a head of communications in local government. When their daughter, Esme, was born, he happily put his career on hold to be a full-time father. Angela recalls the tenderness with which this huge man gently washed their child in a tiny baby bath. Robert resumed teaching in 1990, joining Oaklands College of further education in St Albans as a tutor of adults with learning difficulties.</p> <p>Many students had been restored to the community after long periods in psychiatric hospitals. Robert and his colleagues saw their job as reversing the damage caused by institutionalisation. They allowed students the freedom to broaden their outlook through experience rather than narrow, exam-based education. Robert gave his time and attention unsparingly, and the students loved him for it.</p> <p>Music was always at the heart of Robert\u2019s life. From Bach to Boulez, Tim Hardin to Tongan folk songs, Van Morrison to Memphis Minnie, ragas to ragtime, his passion knew no bounds. And he communicated it (via a shower of mix-CDs) with unstoppable enthusiasm to friends and students. He was also an accomplished poet, fired increasingly by his anger at social injustice.</p> <p>Robert\u2019s marriage to Angela ended in divorce in 2009. His last years were darkened by the lengthening shadow of dementia, which he contracted at an early age, and which left him acutely vulnerable to the coronavirus while living at a care home in Baldock, north Hertfordshire.</p> <p>He is survived by Esme and by his brother, Glynn, and sister, Jo.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>Many people I know are using lockdown creatively either to develop existing talents or to discover new ones. I appear to be the exception, unless you count working out how to do a Zoom call and worrying even more than usual as lifelong learning. The only skill I can vaguely claim to have acquired is how to cut the dog\u2019s hair. Badly. A week ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/17/herbert-hound-has-adjusted-new-normal-wish-i-could-say-same-digested-week\">Herbert Hound</a> was in a miserable state as his fur hadn\u2019t been cut since Christmas, apart the odd trim with scissors around his eyes so he could see out. So I went on Amazon to investigate buying a pair of dog hair clippers, only to find that they are identical to the ones I use to shave my own head \u2013 excess hair is one of the few things not to have presented a problem for me so far \u2013 except the dog ones had a nice picture of a dog paw on the handle. So my wife and I got out my own clippers and took Herbie out into the garden. It wasn\u2019t a total success. We started with me trying to keep the dog still and with Jill giving him a number 8 cut. Which appeared to make little difference, despite the large amount of fur that had collected on the patio. So we gradually worked our way down through the attachments before ending on a rather uneven number 3 cut \u2013 with the exception of the areas around the genitals which we felt required rather greater expertise than we possessed. Herbie has looked on us disapprovingly ever since, as if he believes we have made him the embarrassment of Tooting Bec common. He now doesn\u2019t even bother to come into our bedroom before saying goodnight to us and clearly can\u2019t wait for the time when we\u2019re out the house more. Annoyingly, the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/22/pets-at-home-under-fire-coronavirus-key-worker-school-childcare\">dog grooming</a> salon rang us this morning to say they had just opened. Herbie is now booked in for early July.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>We\u2019ve heard a lot about coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/ministers-accused-of-changing-covid-19-test-tally-to-hit-100000-goal\">tests that don\u2019t really count as tests</a>. The same people getting tested three times and the tests that were included in the daily figures merely on the grounds that someone had put them in the post. But we\u2019ve heard little of testing as surreal performance art. So meet my friend Kevin who, early on in the coronavirus pandemic, signed up to C-19, a research app that asks participants to report their symptoms online. On 30 April \u2013 possibly owing to Kevin saying his voice was a little huskier than usual, but more likely because of the government\u2019s desperation to meet its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/ministers-under-fire-as-covid-19-testing-drops-back-below-100000-daily-target\">100,000 daily target</a> by the end of the month \u2013 he was told he was eligible for a test and was invited to go to a centre in Cambridge the next day. There he was greeted by some soldiers in full camo suits who passed him a swab attached to the end of a long pole through his car window. Once he had done the necessary, he went home having been told he would receive the results within two days. The two days passed with no news, so Kevin emailed to find out what was going on. He was told the new estimate was five days. The five days passed with no news, so he contacted them again to be informed that the five days meant five working days and he should hang on a bit longer. Still nothing. When he emailed again on the Thursday, he was told to call a number, select option 1, and he would get his results. He phoned only to find there was no option 1, only an answerphone message saying the office was closed until the following Tuesday at 11am. After waiting out the weekend and still getting no joy when the phone line was open, he was sent an email offering him another test at Stansted airport. So Kevin now finds himself in a Kafkaesque situation in which he could have died before receiving the results of his early diagnosis test and faces the choice of going into self-isolation for a further two weeks if he takes up the offer of a second test. Luckily neither Kevin nor any other members of his family is a key worker as he could have been needlessly off work for a month. And the government wonders why so many people are sceptical about its testing numbers.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3da4033b58eebe11c2e9aa7f28afe00bafa0b4bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3da4033b58eebe11c2e9aa7f28afe00bafa0b4bf/0_334_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A rat on the pavement in Downing St\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Classic Dom to leave a sinking ship.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s suggestion that parliament should totally ignore government advice on social-distancing and meet as normal when it returns after the May recess has understandably been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/13/jacob-rees-mogg-tells-mps-to-set-example-and-return-to-commons-coronavirus\">met with derision by most MPs</a>. But his desire to fill the Tory benches almost certainly has less to do with his interpretation of health guidelines than with a desire to protect the prime minister. Because without the presence of fellow cabinet ministers to help him out and 300 or so Conservative MPs to kill themselves laughing at his rubbish jokes, Boris Johnson has been hopelessly exposed at prime minister\u2019s questions by the courtroom atmosphere in which Keir Starmer flourishes. The Labour leader will have had tougher days defending shoplifters as a junior barrister than questioning the prime minister about his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. It turns out that years of entitlement, bluster, lies and winging it aren\u2019t such great preparation for serious interrogation on the most serious health crisis for 100 years. In short, Boris is having a nightmare at the moment \u2013 his Sunday night address to the nation was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/10/boris-johnson-coronavirus-lockdown-shops-schools-june-reopening\">TV car crash</a> \u2013 and he and the Tory party know it. Matt Hancock is another minister who looks under the cosh. I\u2019m well aware of all his faults but I can\u2019t help feeling a bit sorry for him as he is clearly being lined up to take most of the blame for things that weren\u2019t entirely his fault. Matt now looks haunted: his Tigger-like enthusiasm is now a distant memory and he\u2019s even taken to getting stroppy with Louise Minchin on BBC Breakfast. He looks like a man on the edge of a nervous breakdown. The only cabinet minister who appears to be enjoying the crisis is Rishi Sunak who is lavished with praise for delivering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/13/treasury-tax-hikes-pay-freezes-covid-19-costs-budget-deficit-spending\">a new bailout budget once or twice a week</a>. Better still, no one thinks to ask how on earth he is going to pay for his spending commitments. Which is just as well as right now he doesn\u2019t have a clue.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>I am trying to Stay Alert, but the government\u2019s new physical distancing guidelines \u2013 brief summary \u201cGo to work but don\u2019t go to work\u201d \u2013 have left me feeling somewhat confused. I have no idea when I am going to see my daughter in Minneapolis again \u2013 we were due to go to the US in August \u2013 though it seems that my wife and I could arrange to see our son in a public space in Brighton, providing that only one of us was to see him at a time. So we\u2019re thinking of driving down this weekend so that my wife can him for an hour while I wait in the car. Then when she returns to the car, she can stay behind while I see Robbie for an hour. Another solution is for Robbie and his girlfriend, who are living together, to both go to an open space so that I can see Robbie and my wife can see Laila. Then we could leave for five minutes before returning so that Jill can see Robbie and I can see Laila. Right now, though, the easiest way to see him would be for him to get a job as an estate agent, as apparently they have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/13/opening-of-english-housing-market-catches-estate-agents-on-hop-coronavirus\">carte blanche to go anywhere</a>, and for us to put our house on the market. Not that I\u2019ve any intention of moving anywhere: we\u2019ve lived in the same house for 25 years and I\u2019d be more than happy to stay another 25 and besides London now has the lowest virus reproduction rate (0.4) of anywhere in the country. But we could theoretically put the house up for sale so that Robbie could come round to measure up and then just refuse to allow any viewers. The other possibility is that Robbie could become our cleaner. The downside is that he\u2019s only ever been known to make any place more untidy than he found it.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>As the days have long since elided into one another \u2013 apparently it\u2019s Friday, two new trends have begun to emerge. Fear of missing out (Fomo) has become a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/04/bye-bye-fomo-now-the-party-is-being-zoomed-to-my-laptop\">thing of the past</a>, as there is nothing to fear missing out on. Unless you don\u2019t have a Netflix subscription. Replacing Fomo are two competing behavioural traits: Fear of going out (Fogo) and Joy of missing out (Jomo). Being naturally cautious and highly anxious, I\u2019d put myself in the Fogo camp. I just don\u2019t feel as safe, even in my own neighbourhood, as I used to. Apart from two trips to the local supermarket each week \u2013 face mask, check; hand sanitiser, check \u2013 the only times I go out in the day are either to walk the dog or to cycle up and down the same hill on my wife\u2019s boneshaker. And as I\u2019m counting down the days till my exercise bike arrives \u2013 Amazon promises 1 June \u2013 I\u2019ll soon be able to cross that last activity off my list and watch Grant Shapps take the Downing Street 5pm press conference. There will be something quite zen about us both putting in a lot of effort to go nowhere. It\u2019s come as a surprise to me but the closest I\u2019ve come to Jomo is not having to schlep all the way up to White Hart Lane to watch Spurs put in another lacklustre performance. At the start of lockdown, I couldn\u2019t imagine life without football \u2013 even during periods of depression, it\u2019s always been a fixed point in my week, not to mention a timely reminder of how little control I have over the world \u2013 but within a comparatively short period I\u2019ve experienced little sense of loss. On occasions even a sense of relief. I just don\u2019t understand those who are rewatching the whole of Euro 96 on ITV catch up. Guys, you know it ends badly with England losing to Germany on penalties in the semi-final. It has occurred to me though, that, I am beginning to experience Fomo on my season ticket part refund as it\u2019s clear the Premier league season will at best be only completed in empty stadiums. Every other organisation from whom I had bought event tickets has been in contact either to make refund arrangements. From Spurs I have heard nothing.</p> <p><strong>Digested Week: </strong>Stay Alert!</p>",

  "<p>My son is dressed as a giant banana and he is throwing hamburgers at me. I am making my getaway on a solid gold quad bike. For once, neither of us has access to automatic weapons.</p> <p>No, our home schooling regime hasn\u2019t taken a dark turn. This is Party Royale, the brand new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/fortnite\">Fortnite</a> mode, where deadly violence is banned and where the emphasis is on messing about and engaging in non-lethal competitions \u2013 but mostly messing about. It\u2019s only been live for a few days but already it feels like what the early-millennium online social experiment Second Life could have been if it had been built by game designers rather than Californian internet eggheads.</p> <p>Launched on 8 May with an in-game party featuring live performances by Steve Aoki and Deadmau5, Party Royale starts like any Fortnite: Battle Royale session \u2013 with dozens of online players landing on a remote island. However, instead of then running about searching for guns before shooting each other until only one remains, Party Royale players can do what they like. It\u2019s a smaller environment than the main game, but it still has rolling fields, meandering rivers and a little town crowded with fast-food joints. Vending machines distribute paint guns, plunger bows and other comedy projectiles with which to assault players, but no one gets hurt \u2013 you just get covered in glossy gloop or burger sauce.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b25028976fae9b2c22d5df745f9c94ff2f07ebfa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b25028976fae9b2c22d5df745f9c94ff2f07ebfa/78_0_2156_1294/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Epically failing at a quad bike challenge in Fortnite Party Royale\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Epically failing at a quad bike challenge in Fortnite Party Royale</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fortnite</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dotted around the place, there are also lots of little challenges. Over here you can clamber onboard a speed boat and whiz through a series of markers to set the fastest time possible; over there you can jump through a time rift and then swoop through a series of aerial hoops \u2013 like the classic Nintendo game PilotWings. Each activity has a high-score table for players to aim at, so there is still a competitive element, but while we were playing no one seemed that serious about it, judging by the number of quad bikes and speed boats careering into the scenery.</p> <p>Epic Games says that it will hold regular live events and there is a dedicated concert area; once again this brings Second Life to mind. That vast online metaverse experiment, which launched to much fanfare and fascination in 2003, was billed as an explorative virtual social space with its own culture and economy \u2013 and over the next decade many music artists and theatre groups gave virtual performances within its ever-changing world. But the technological demands of the service, together with the impossibility of moderating such a huge space, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/second-life-plagued-security-flaws-ex-employee-says/\">led to problems and controversies</a> from cyber fraud to riots to flocks of flying penises.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hjWMSOmEew\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9hjWMSOmEew?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Second Life is still going, and there\u2019s a VR equivalent called Sansar, but it\u2019s a lot quieter now, and it\u2019s definitelt an adults-only space. Party Royale, where the visuals are bright and toy-like and most communication is through the medium of short dances such as the famed Floss and Electro Shuffle, feels much more like the Red Bull-guzzling little brother to Second Life. It\u2019s the virtual world as bouncy castle.</p> <p>Currently, all you can really do is pop in for an hour and race about the map with a few friends, firing each other out of the cannons on the pirate ship in Buccaneer Bay or throwing burgers at strangers from a speeding boat. But in the future, Epic clearly wants to run events and competitions, and this would be an amazing venue for film trailer premieres.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86f3b0a6aa5f09ce25bae926073ff5dc380d221b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86f3b0a6aa5f09ce25bae926073ff5dc380d221b/100_0_1993_1196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fortnite Party Royale is crammed with racing challenges, each offering a high score to beat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fortnite Party Royale is crammed with racing challenges, each offering a high score to beat</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fortnite</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Players can\u2019t build in the mode right now, but that could change. Maybe Party Royale could be combined with Fortnite\u2019s creative mode, allowing players to construct their own buildings and racing challenges. There are currently phone booths around the map where you can change your outfits, but perhaps participants will one day be able to design and trade clothes, custom emotes or spray paint tags.</p> <p>We\u2019ve seen something like this before, in the form of PlayStation Home, a gamified online multiplayer metaverse that arrived for the PlayStation 3, a year after its launch. For a few years, PlayStation owners could decorate their own virtual clubhouses, explore a virtual shopping mall and make real-life purchases from fashion brands and furniture companies. Millions of PS3 owners gave the service a try, but it <a href=\"https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2015/07/29/the-untold-story-of-playstation-home-sonys-most-successful-disaster\">never attracted</a> the player interest or commercial support it needed, and closed in 2015.</p> <p>But now, with 350 million players who are used to hanging out in a vibrant, ridiculous online world filled with dancing bananas and cartoon skirmishes, Party Royale could be the experience that finally realises the idea of a playful, mass participation online metaverse. Right now, with a whole generation of teenagers desperate to go <em>anywhere</em> where their parents can\u2019t or won\u2019t follow them, it\u2019s pretty much a godsend.</p>",
  "<p>The British-born Zen master <a href=\"https://tricycle.org/magazine/houn-jiyu-kennet-roshi/\">Roshi Jiyu-Kennett</a> used to say that her philosophy, when it came to teaching students, wasn\u2019t to try to lighten the burdens they carried through life, but to make those burdens so heavy they\u2019d choose to put them down. I\u2019m no Zen master (I do have the requisite baldness; it\u2019s just that I\u2019m still working on the boundless equanimity). But I\u2019ve always loved that line, because it gets at something profound about the stressfulness of existence.</p> <p>To spell out what I take from it, which is something a Zen master would never do: most of us subliminally spend our days scrambling to get to a point where we feel like life\u2019s finally in working order, and everything\u2019s under control \u2013 which for you might mean total financial security, becoming the perfect parent, leaving your childhood traumas entirely behind, or anything else.</p> <p>The \u201cburden-lightening\u201d approach, as preached in a thousand self-help books, involves somehow actually reaching that place of safety. The burden-increasing approach, by contrast, involves pointing out that the goal was impossible all along. And when you grasp that you were chasing a mirage, you\u2019re <a href=\"https://www.lionsroar.com/you-dont-have-to-know-tales-of-trauma-and-transformation-march-2013/\">disinclined</a> to keep chasing. You get to <a href=\"https://onedharmanashville.wordpress.com/2011/01/09/pema-chodron-on-the-benefits-of-hopelessness/\">relax into life</a> as it is.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Right now, all sorts of things we tell ourselves we need to do \u2013 to be happy, or secure \u2013 have been impossible to do</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Which is easier said than done. Though perhaps slightly easier than usual right now, at a time when all sorts of things we tend to tell ourselves we need to do \u2013 to be happy, or secure, or to justify our existence \u2013 have been rather obviously impossible to do. You just <em>can\u2019t</em> do a full-time job at full throttle while caring for small children; you <em>can\u2019t </em>be absolutely certain your relatives are safe from the pandemic; you <em>can\u2019t </em>guarantee your family won\u2019t feel the shocks of economic meltdown. Etcetera. </p> <p>Of course, realising this doesn\u2019t magically make it fine to be overstretched, sick or struggling financially. But it triggers a kind of inner liberation. You\u2019re still in a bad fix, but you\u2019re no longer staking everything on achieving an impossible kind of escape from it. Moreover, the result of this shift isn\u2019t that you become passively resigned to your fate. Instead, you\u2019re more motivated to take whatever useful actions you can.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/08/how-to-have-fun-during-lockdown-oliver-burkeman\">How to have fun during lockdown | Oliver Burkeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recently, I\u2019ve noticed that I read the news with a similar subconscious yearning for something impossible: deep down, I think I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll find some confirmation, somewhere among the headlines, that everything will eventually be OK with the world.

  "<p>Lockdown isn\u2019t much fun for parents of small children, who now find themselves attempting round-the-clock childcare while possibly juggling work as well, and with the added hassle of overseeing a schedule of schoolwork.</p> <p>I\u2019ve found that the best way to cope \u2013 aside from a renewed interest in drinking \u2013 has been to get the kids involved in cooking. Mine are young (five and two), but if they can help out at dinnertime a little, I\u2019ve decided that it counts as home-schooling. Here are a few tricks that I\u2019ve discovered to gain their interest, as well as some expert tips.</p> <h2>1. Bake, bake, bake</h2> <p>Assuming you\u2019ve achieved the tricky task of sourcing flour, bread dough should be your new best friend. It\u2019s simple enough that older kids can make it themselves with light supervision, and sturdy enough that smaller kids can give it a real battering if they want. The highlight of our day is now the knockback stage, because it gives my children a chance to punch something other than each other. Another really good starting point is cake-mix packets. There\u2019s no technique to them; just a cracked egg and some oil. The big kid cracks the egg, the little kid pours the oil and then they each get a spoon to mix and (most importantly) lick. The cakes aren\u2019t very good, but it kills half an hour, so whatever.</p> <h2>2. Check you have all the ingredients first</h2> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/chefs/mary_anne_boerman\">Mary-Anne Boermans</a> from series two of The Great British Bake Off says: \u201cMake sure you have the ingredients before you suggest a recipe. Nothing kills the mood faster than a promise unfulfilled. If you\u2019ve suggested brownies, then find you have no cocoa, a Nutella sandwich is going to be a hard sell.\u201d Also, adds the food writer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/signesjohansen/\">Signe Johansen</a>, it doesn\u2019t hurt to have everything prepped before the kids arrive on the scene. \u201cAvoid wasting ingredients by measuring out as much as you can before you start,\u201d she says. \u201cDepending on how old the kids are, ingredients can go flying or fall on the floor.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2dcff073ed52355da984588c04897e84a6d292b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2dcff073ed52355da984588c04897e84a6d292b/0_118_5411_3246/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Starting the learning process is way more important than a perfect cake.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Starting the learning process is way more important than a perfect cake.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3. It\u2019s about having fun \u2013 not perfect results</h2> <p>Let the kids take the lead. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-atherton\">David Atherton</a> \u2013 2019\u2019s Bake Off winner and author of the forthcoming My First Cook Book \u2013 says: \u201cIt\u2019s not fun if you\u2019re always controlling it all. Having fun and starting the learning process around food is way more important than the perfect fluffy cake.\u201d Incidentally, Atherton\u2019s recipe for near-instant banana ice-cream is a winner. Take two frozen bananas, two spoons of yoghurt, a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of malt extract. Blend until smooth.</p> <h2>4. Try one-pan dishes</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/chefs/rukmini_iyer\">Rukmini Iyer</a>, the author of the Roasting Tin series of books (the latest is The Roasting Tin Around the World), advocates getting kids involved in one-pan dish assembly. \u201cThere\u2019s no stovetop stirring, so less chance of falling off a kitchen chair or sticking tiny hands into hot oil. Replace hot oil with boiling sugar syrup and you have my first kitchen burn, at the proud age of four years old. Ovens are, blissfully, self-contained.\u201d</p> <h2>5. Make things they\u2019ll want to eat</h2> <p>Start small with things they actually want to eat. If they like pasta, let them throw the pasta into the saucepan. If they like mash, let them mash the potatoes. Anecdotally, this may result in your kid demanding that everyone around the table thanks them for single-handedly making dinner, but better that than wiping clumps of mash off the walls. At the same time, the pride of making dinner may help them overcome some of their food weirdness. As Atherton says: \u201cYour child will eat a lot of foods they usually refuse if they\u2019ve been involved in the cooking.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97f726b031358ad484fbf990729e851e6f0fc07d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97f726b031358ad484fbf990729e851e6f0fc07d/0_0_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The pride of playing a part may help them overcome some of their food weirdness.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The pride of playing a part may help them overcome some of their food weirdness.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacob Lund/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6. Keep it simple</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/nov/28/mince-pies-tasted-by-baker-alice-fevronia-it-screams-christmas\">Alice Fevronia</a> \u2013 a teacher and 2019 Bake Off alumna \u2013 suggests picking recipes that the kids won\u2019t absolutely ruin. \u201cStick to simple recipes that don\u2019t need to be too precise, and allow them to make decisions in adding additional things they want to. Flapjacks and cookies are a good place to start.\u201d The chef Romy Gill likes to present her kids with a single ingredient \u2013 say a fruit, vegetable or pulse \u2013 and ask them to list everything they can make with it. With potatoes, for instance. \u201cI do this stuffed Indian flatbread called aloo paratha, spicy chips or a mashed potato bake with carrots, spinach, beans, cheese and a little bit of cream or butter.\u201d However, \u201cthey are not a fan of jacket potatoes. School has ruined them\u201d. The best way to meal plan, especially when young kids are involved, can be to limit the options, says Boermans: \u201cDon\u2019t give too much freedom because tiny brains can\u2019t cope. Don\u2019t ask: \u2018What do you want to make?\u2019 Rather: \u2018Do you want soup or a sandwich?\u2019 It\u2019s still their choice, just with a bit more focus.\u201d</p> <h2>7. Embrace kids\u2019 adventurous side</h2> <p>Iyer recommends embracing stranger ingredients. \u201cI enjoy handing over particularly offensive or strong-smelling items, such as fish sauce, to nieces and getting them to think of as many words as possible to describe the smell. It\u2019s always worth handing over new and \u2018weird\u2019 ingredients, and seeing if anyone will try them as a dare. Peer pressure works wonders if you\u2019ve got a bolder kid in the mix.\u201d</p> <h2>8. Don\u2019t wait until they\u2019re hungry</h2> <p>More first-hand lockdown advice: don\u2019t wait until the kids are hungry before bringing them into the kitchen because their patience will be shot and \u2013 this is entirely hypothetical and in no way related to the precise thing that happened to me three days ago \u2013 your two-year-old will have an hour-long screaming fit on the floor because you wouldn\u2019t let him eat a raw egg.</p> <h2>9. Avoid the oven if you have to</h2> <p>Short on flour, and cooking with children you don\u2019t trust around heat? Make a fridge cake. Johansen recommends the cherry, almond and dark chocolate tiffin from her book Solo. Once you\u2019ve melted the chocolate \u2013 and mixed the butter, egg and golden syrup together \u2013 you have a perfect base to throw in biscuits and anything else you like. (Johansen uses sour cherries and flaked almonds.) Then you pour it all into a clingfilmed loaf tin and leave it to chill in the fridge overnight \u2013 if they can wait that long.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fb9a32697a62ff837864fff6fa0ea6f8f38d248\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fb9a32697a62ff837864fff6fa0ea6f8f38d248/0_0_5220_3134/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018If you praise them, they\u2019ll make it again.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If you praise them, they\u2019ll make it again.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yagi Studio/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>10. Offer feedback</h2> <p>\u201cIf you praise them for what they\u2019ve made,\u201d says Boermans, \u201cthen it can be used to cajole them into making it again. \u2018I loved that ham sandwich you made. Will you help me make another one?\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>11. Chill out</h2> <p>There are hundreds of ice lolly recipes online. Most just require fruit juice that the kids can pour into the moulds themselves. And then, while they wait for them to freeze, they get to learn the art of patience. Imagine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47493366f571333d3e2bceff1da8ea53fa8b0563\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47493366f571333d3e2bceff1da8ea53fa8b0563/0_260_5913_3549/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Don\u2019t forget it\u2019s supposed to be fun.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Don\u2019t forget it\u2019s about having fun.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darrin Jenkins/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>12. Remember their attention spans</h2> <p>Speaking of patience, don\u2019t assume that your children will have limitless amounts of it. When we\u2019re making cookies, for instance, my kids\u2019 interest is only sparked by three things: when we\u2019re measuring the flour (because it\u2019s the first part of a new activity), when we\u2019re shaping the dough (because it\u2019s fun) and when they come out of the oven (because food). For the rest of it, I\u2019m on my own. We would all have a much worse time if I insisted on keeping their noses to the grindstone for the duration.</p> <h2>13. Go to a farm shop</h2> <p>We\u2019ve been leaning heavily on the local farm shop during lockdown, and the benefit of this is that the vegetables are much dirtier than their supermarket equivalent. As a result, the kids now have a better understanding that their food was grown in the ground.

Everyone loves popcorn, pastry and potatoes</h2> <p>Buy some popping corn. If you\u2019re a toddler, popcorn is fireworks that you eat. And I\u2019ve discovered that pre-rolled pastry has yet to become scarce. Get your kids to cut it into squares, place a bit of bacon in the middle, fold it up, put cheese on the top and then bake until golden. It\u2019s like Greggs is still a thing. Returning to the humble spud, the first thing I ever cooked at school was a baked potato. I took a potato to school, and gave it to the home economics teacher. She put it in the oven and then, when class started two hours later, she took it out of the oven and I ate it. If was good enough for the national curriculum in 1991, it\u2019s good enough now.</p> <h2>15. None of this really matters</h2> <p>If you don\u2019t have the ingredients or the time to do any of these, or your kids aren\u2019t showing any interest in cooking, please remember that none of this really matters. We\u2019re all being asked to do something unprecedented at the moment. Just getting everyone to the end of the day in one piece counts as a victory. All the other stuff can wait. Actually, though, this is the most important point, and it\u2019s based on the horrified look on my wife\u2019s face after she came downstairs and saw my two-year-old squidging sopping-wet bread dough between his fingers just now. The tip is this: whatever you do, use aprons.</p>",

  "<p>On a recent afternoon in San Jose, California, Chuck Rossi held up his AR-15 in front of his computer camera, talking through how to hold the weapon safely, and how to load it with ammunition. </p> <p>\u201cAR-15s are modular. They\u2019re like Legos for men,\u201d Rossi said. The man on the other side of the Zoom call chuckled.</p> <p>Rossi is an activist turned safety instructor, one of the many gun owners across the country who are using Zoom or social media to teach new gun owners how to use their weapons.</p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic has driven <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/us-gun-purchases-coronavirus-record\">record-breaking numbers</a> of gun sales in the United States, as gun sellers have succeeded in being categorized as \u201cessential businesses\u201d. At least anecdotally, many of the millions of guns sold during the pandemic have gone to first-time gun buyers, sparking concerns about potential increases in domestic violence, gun accidents and child gun deaths. Gun control advocates say the panic-buying during a time of anxiety, uncertainty and economic distress has also made gun suicide a particular concern.</p> <p>In response, gun rights advocates have focused on safety training, with some offering free sessions to make sure new gun owners understand how to operate their weapons \u2013 and feel welcomed to the gun community.</p> <p>Rossi was an early Facebook employee who left the company in 2018, and still lives in San Jose. He co-founded Open Source Defense, a Silicon Valley gun rights group. The group\u2019s founders live across the country, but many of them are current or former tech workers.<strong> </strong>Between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/15/the-gun-numbers-just-3-of-american-adults-own-a-collective-133m-firearms\">20% and 30% of Americans</a> say they personally own a gun, a number that has fallen for decades, and the group aims to grow the base of American gun owners by being friendly, digitally savvy and \u201czero percent\u201d focused on culture wars. Zoom \u201coffice hours\u201d for new owners is one of their initiatives.</p> <p>When he signed up for a Zoom gun safety session, one new gun owner, a 40-year-old tech company worker from San Jose, said he expected he would be chatting with \u201csome hillbilly NRA guy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIs he even going to be nice to me?\u201d the tech worker, who is black, wondered.</p> <p>Instead he got Rossi, who works in the same industry and lives in the same town.</p> <p>Just a few years ago, the new gun owner, who asked that his name not be used, said he was someone who had believed that AR-15s should be banned.</p> <p>In early March, as concerns about coronavirus grew, his company told employees not to worry, that \u201cthe government has it under control, there\u2019s going to be a vaccine.\u201d Then he went to grocery store, \u201cand there was nothing\u201d so he had to go to his parent\u2019s house to get toilet paper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e5d7fb15a5ae24bdd1896f96ba76114f76daba9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e5d7fb15a5ae24bdd1896f96ba76114f76daba9/11_0_935_561/500.jpg\" alt=\"Chuck Rossi holding his rifle during a Zoom gun safety training course.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chuck Rossi holding his rifle during a Zoom gun safety training course.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lois Beckett/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He starting thinking about stories of civil unrest during the Los Angeles riots or Hurricane Katrina and said he worried about desperate people, hungry people, who might see homes in his nice San Jose neighborhood as soft targets.</p> <p>\u201cPeople take from those who have,\u201d he said. How likely was it that he would ever be a target? \u201cOne in a million,\u201d he said. \u201cI consider it an extreme impossibility. But why not be prepared?\u201d</p> <p>In mid-March he went to buy self-defense weapons: a handgun and, because shotguns were sold out, an AR-15, which retails for about $1,000. </p> <p>The new gun owner\u2019s parents were appalled, and worried about the safety of his young children, ages three and one. His mother tried to get his brother to intervene. Instead, his brother bought himself three guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition.</p> <p>The new gun buyer said the Zoom session was part of his attempt to be responsible. Rossi, hefting his own high-end AR-15, recapped the principles of gun safety: always keep the weapon\u2019s muzzle pointed in a safe direction. Keep your finger off the trigger until you\u2019re ready to fire. Be aware of what might be behind the target you\u2019re shooting at. Treat every gun as if it\u2019s loaded.</p> <p>They did some troubleshooting: what should he do if an ammunition round got jammed inside his gun? How long would his military-surplus ammo be usable?</p> <p>Ammo didn\u2019t go bad, Rossi said. He was still \u201cshooting shit\u201d from the second world war and \u201csurplus from the Korean war\u201d.</p> <p>While \u201cwhite Americans tend to be more vocal about their gun ownership\u201d, the new owner said, being a black gun owner didn\u2019t feel special.</p> <p>But it came with different concerns. He was more afraid a police officer might shoot him than that someone else might attack him on the street; he would \u201cnever\u201d carry a gun in public.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/suicide-us-gun-sales-searches-coronavirus\">Surge in US gun sales and online searches raises fears of rise in suicides</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If he ever had to call the police to his home, he said, he would emphasize: \u201cThe black guy with the gun is the homeowner.\u201d</p> <p>Owning guns had already shifted some of his political opinions. He said he still supported limits on larger-capacity ammunition magazines. But when he bought his guns, he said, he had to wait 10 days to get them. \u201cThat was an eternity to me,\u201d he said. \u201cAre these really common sense gun laws?\u201d</p> <p>Rossi was encouraged to hear this, and said he\u2019d try to persuade the new gun owner about why he actually needed larger-capacity magazines next. The two men made a plan to go shooting in person as soon as possible.</p>",

  "<p>Even now, I\u2019m one of those people who can\u2019t bring herself to say: \u201cIf Hillary Clinton had won the 2016 election \u2026 \u201d Because, to me, she <em>did </em>win. She received nearly 2.9m more votes than Donald Trump, but of course Trump received more electoral votes. So instead I say: \u201cIf Hillary Clinton had become president\u201d or \u201cIf the outcome of the 2016 election had been different \u2026 \u201d Finishing the sentence requires less finessing on my part; it is perfectly clear: \u201c\u2026 I would not have written a Hillary novel.\u201d</p> <p>If Hillary had become president, I wouldn\u2019t have needed to. Instead of watching in real time as our country becomes a more racist, sexist, xenophobic and homophobic place, Americans would have had a leader committed not just to equality among people but also to addressing climate change, gun law reform and healthcare. And it seems equally unprovable and indisputable that her response to a global pandemic would have been vastly different \u2013 science-based, measured, compassionate.</p> <p>But instead we live in this world, not that one, and, for my own sake, I did need to write a novel in which the 2016 US presidential election unfolded differently. I\u2019m 44, and it was only a few years ago, after well over three decades of writing fiction, that I realised I have devoted much of my life to this creative act for two reasons above all: to entertain myself and to soothe myself. Writing <em>Rodham</em> was definitely an example of the latter. Plus, it tapped into my fascination with politics, fame, and the discrepancy between our public and private selves \u2013 all themes I first explored in my 2008 novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/12/fiction\">American Wife</a></em>, which was a fictionalised retelling of the life of Laura Bush.</p> <p>But where <em>American Wife</em> mostly embellishes the real or historical timeline, <em>Rodham</em> creates a parallel universe. What I didn\u2019t know when I embarked on writing in March 2017 was how much I\u2019d teach myself \u2013 or perhaps I should say how much Hillary would teach me. These are some of the lessons I learned:</p> <p><strong>Multi-decade rumour mill notwithstanding, it\u2019s hard to find examples of things Hillary has done wrong.<br></strong>The false accusations levelled at her range from murky acts of financial malfeasance, to bonkers conspiracy theories about paedophilia, to persistent suggestions that she mishandled email when she was secretary of state. On close examination, what\u2019s striking about these supposed scandals is that they either have no relationship to reality or she\u2019s being accused of something that I (and admittedly I\u2019m not a lawyer) would not at first glance understand to be inappropriate, let alone illegal. After reading multiple accounts of the controversy around \u201cWhitewater\u201d, Bill and Hillary\u2019s late 1970s real estate investment, I still would struggle to cogently summarise the sequence of events to another human. This murkiness contrasts with the events that currently unfold on a weekly basis in the White House \u2013 consider the New York Times headline on 21 April \u201cTrump (the Company) Asks Trump (the Administration) for Hotel Relief<em>\u201d </em>\u2013 that prompt me to sincerely wonder, how can this <em>possibly</em> be legal?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94d359c32312a5da17c7812f63f0a30f612bb1cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94d359c32312a5da17c7812f63f0a30f612bb1cc/0_61_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Clintons campaigning with Al and Tipper Gore, in Michigan, 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Clintons campaigning with Al and Tipper Gore, in Michigan, 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dirck Halstead/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I don\u2019t see Hillary as saintly, but the two damning titbits that emerged about her in my research that have stayed with me are actually absurdly insignificant. The first is that, according to biographer Carl Bernstein, in 1993 the Clintons travelled together to St Louis, Missouri. Hillary told an aide to leave Bill\u2019s briefcase aboard Air Force One, but when Bill later asked for it, Hillary supposedly told him: \u201cYour staff always does that ... They don\u2019t serve you well.\u201d This is not, I\u2019d venture to say, grounds for locking her up. Nor is the other scrap of scandal: New York Times reporter Amy Chozick, who covered the 2016 campaign, describes in her book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/12/chasing-hillary-by-amy-chozick-review\">Chasing Hillary</a></em> how, at events, members of Hillary\u2019s staff sometimes confiscated supporters\u2019 homemade signs and instructed them to hold up mass-produced campaign signs instead. Then again, given the ease with which one can find photos that show supporters holding homemade placards and flags, this practice doesn\u2019t seem to have been widespread \u2013 and in any event, it\u2019s safe to assume it wasn\u2019t Hillary herself doing the confiscating.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many see Hillary as either irredeemably corrupt or heroic \u2013 little attention is given to the possibility she\u2019s neither</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The disparity between the vitriolic criticism Hillary has faced and who she actually is seems to be so great that it reminds me of that optical illusion \u2013 itself a sexist binary \u2013 where from one angle the image looks like a beautiful young woman and from another angle like a hag. Many Americans perceive Hillary as either irredeemably corrupt or heroic, with little apparent attention given to the possibility that she\u2019s neither. Sometimes while writing, I thought that if, in a parallel universe, I ended up sitting next to her at a dinner party and she were exactly the same person but instead of going into politics was a university president or corporate executive, I would be dazzled by her. \u201cThat woman is so smart<em>,\u201d</em> I\u2019d think. \u201cShe\u2019s so tough and interesting and impressive<em>.\u201d</em><br><br><strong>If Bill Clinton had wanted to marry me in 1975, I\u2019d have accepted.<br></strong>When I decided that the premise of my novel would be \u201cWhat if Hillary hadn\u2019t married Bill?\u201d, it wasn\u2019t because I find Bill loathsome. I do find him very flawed \u2013 some of his behaviour has been disturbing at best \u2013 but my main goal was to examine chance, fate, free will and the notion of parallel universes or other, unlived lives. As Hillary has mentioned publicly more than once, in the early 1970s, she was initially reluctant to accept Bill\u2019s marriage proposals. Indeed, as an epigraph for <em>Rodham</em>, I chose these lines from her 2017 memoir <em>What Happened</em>: \u201cMy marriage to Bill Clinton was the most consequential decision of my life. I said no the first two times he asked me. But the third time, I said yes. And I\u2019d do it again.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It seems facile and preposterous to claim that if Hillary hadn\u2019t married Bill she\u2019d be president today</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It seems facile and preposterous to claim that if only she hadn\u2019t married him, she\u2019d be president today. On the one hand, if almost anything in 2016 had happened differently, that seems a likely outcome, but on the other hand, who knows? And while I used this particular marital departure from reality for fiction, Bill\u2019s charms aren\u2019t lost on me. In fact, in June 2017, I tweeted a picture of his almost thousand-page memoir along with the comment: \u201cVERY unexpected outcome of writing my Hillary novel \u2013 I myself am now in grave danger of falling in love with Bill<em>.\u201d</em></p> <p>In his autobiography <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jun/27/biography.politicalbooks1\">My Life</a></em>, Bill is a funny, self-deprecating raconteur with an excellent eye for colourful details (especially of the southern fried variety) and an apparent fondness for almost everyone he has ever met. Plus, the photos of him and Hillary from back then, along with the ones in her memoir <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jun/14/featuresreviews.guardianreview30\">Living History</a></em>, are downright swoony. Though the couple are far less polished-looking than now, she\u2019s pretty and he\u2019s dashing, and in pictures from their wedding, they gaze at each other with adoring intensity. In the present day, it\u2019s never a foregone conclusion that an ambitious man will be smitten with an ambitious woman; 50 years ago, it was all the more notable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c09e9b17bdce2df03c23ebed141607ed43d80d48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c09e9b17bdce2df03c23ebed141607ed43d80d48/0_10_1296_778/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adoring intensity \u2026 Hillary and Bill Clinton on their wedding day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Downright swoony \u2026 Hillary and Bill Clinton on their wedding day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And though I\u2019ve never met either Clinton, his in-person charisma is legendary. In fact, in response to my tweet about Bill, one of my Twitter followers shared that someone she knew had seen him in a London department store shortly after the news of his affair with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/monica-lewinsky\">Monica Lewinsky</a> had emerged. The woman approached, planning to tell him he was a national embarrassment. Instead, as they shook hands, she exclaimed, \u201cI love you!\u201d</p> <p><strong>The Clintons just might have a good marriage.</strong><br>In late January 1992, when Bill\u2019s first presidential campaign hung in the balance due to the cabaret singer Gennifer Flowers\u2019s recent allegation that she\u2019d had a 12-year affair with him, he and Hillary sat for a joint interview with the news show <em>60 Minutes</em>. \u201cI think most Americans would agree that it\u2019s very admirable that you\u2019ve stayed together,\u201d said the journalist Steve Kroft. \u201cThat you\u2019ve worked your problems out and that you\u2019ve seemed to reach some sort of understanding and arrangement.\u201d</p> <p>Kroft and the Clintons were in a hotel suite in New Hampshire, the Clintons on a loveseat across from their interlocutor, and Bill quickly responded: \u201cWait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. You\u2019re looking at two people who love each other. This is not an arrangement or an understanding. This is a marriage. That\u2019s a very different thing.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think Hillary will read the book, and if she does, she won't like it \u2013 it\u2019s not a straightforward love letter</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When this interview aired, I watched it in my boarding school dorm; I was 16 and had never had a boyfriend. I\u2019ve now been married for 12 years, and the pertinent question doesn\u2019t seem to be, is the Clintons\u2019 marriage an arrangement? The question is, what marriage isn\u2019t?</p> <p>Yes, I understand that Kroft was essentially saying: \u201cDo you not love each other but stay together anyway because of your shared ambition?\u201d But this question itself seems simplistic, a pretence that the default mode of marriage is happily ever after. I don\u2019t know any couple for whom it\u2019s this easy.</p> <p>I believe that the Clintons genuinely enjoy each other\u2019s company, are genuinely interested in each other\u2019s opinions, have considered divorce and made the choice not to pursue it. At the risk of sounding cynical, it\u2019s possible such a dynamic is about the best any of us can hope for. I sometimes think about how their marriage outlasted that of Bill\u2019s vice-president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/02/al-tipper-gore\">Al Gore</a>, and his former wife Tipper. Little information was public about the Gores\u2019 marriage, whereas I know as much about the Clintons\u2019 marriage as I do about my own. Or maybe \u2013 bear with me here \u2013 I don\u2019t. Maybe <em>every</em> marriage is unknowable except to the people inside it.<br><br><strong>In the United States, it\u2019s rare to hear the unfiltered voices of female politicians.<br></strong>More than a year after it had aired, I learned about the existence of a 2016 campaign podcast created by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/25/clinton-foundation-bill-hillary-us-election-state-department\">Clinton Foundation</a>. Called <em>With Her</em>, it was hosted by a quintessentially podcasty guy named Max Linsky \u2013 a smart, casual Brooklyn-based white man \u2013 and featured interviews with Hillary, Bill, Chelsea, vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine, and assorted campaign staff members.</p> <p>From the first seconds of listening to it, I was aware of something weird and unfamiliar in its tone, though it took a few minutes to pinpoint what: Hillary was not being addressed with reflexive scepticism and cynicism, and she therefore did not need to respond defensively. The assumption was not that she was a power-hungry Machiavellian. The assumption was that she was a likable hard worker who cares about the American people. Even more disorienting: the person giving her the benefit of the doubt was male.</p> <p>As research, I read many articles and watched many news segments from the autumn of 2016, before the election, and there is a weary undertone to almost all of them, a kind of irritation that Hillary will be the first female president when she\u2019s so, you know, polarising and baggage-laden. Her victory is both foregone and irksome. This undertone would seem laughably wide of the mark were it not for the fact that so many Americans have paid such a high price for the ignorance.</p> <p>Also as research, I listened to audiobooks by all the female senators running for president in 2020: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kirsten-gillibrand\">Kirsten Gillibrand</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/amy-klobuchar\">Amy Klobuchar</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren\">Elizabeth Warren</a>. They narrate their own books, and, once again, to listen to their literal voices was to feel a heartening disorientation. They got to speak for as long as they wanted without interruption, tell their own stories, and present themselves, instead of being presented through the lens of America\u2019s profound ambivalence about, or outright aversion to, women in power. Of course I understand that these kinds of books are a form of campaigning, but I\u2019m not convinced that being in charge of the way you are portrayed makes your portrayal inherently false.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"18c33a9dd1aa3a591f7b32853b2f0f4ac38fa650\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18c33a9dd1aa3a591f7b32853b2f0f4ac38fa650/66_437_1222_733/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Curtis Sittenfeld.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Curtis Sittenfeld.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo Sittenfeld</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Based on my remarks here, a person could be forgiven for thinking I wrote <em>Rodham</em> because I\u2019m such an ardent fan of Hillary. This isn\u2019t quite right. I am a fan of Hillary, but, to answer a question I\u2019ve already been asked many times, I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll read the book, and if she does, I don\u2019t necessarily think she\u2019ll like it. It\u2019s not a straightforward love letter. The character I\u2019ve created makes personal and professional tradeoffs. She\u2019s not perfect, and the character of Bill is (spoiler alert) even less so. Also, the sex scenes are way too detailed.</p> <p>I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s less that my novel grew out of my admiration for Hillary and more that my admiration grew out of my research about her. For my entire adulthood, she has been not merely a public figure but a cultural touchstone. Many Americans still say they don\u2019t know her, yet she\u2019s shown us over and over who she is: how strong and capable, how caring and complicated.

  "<p>Pandemics hand power to the people. Leadership is necessary, for an optimal outcome, but essentially it\u2019s up to us what happens next. It\u2019s in times like these that grassroots political movements can come into their own \u2013 if they know how to adapt to the circumstances.</p> <p>A few days ago, a potted basil plant appeared in the main square in Bologna, one of the Italian cities that has been so hard hit in the coronavirus crisis. There was a crumpled cardboard sign attached, with two hashtags daubed on it in felt-tip pen: #6000SARDINE and #FOTOSINTESI.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Soon they were raising funds, organising flu relief centres, and distributing medicines, milk and blankets</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The reference to Sardines would have been meaningful to local people. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/14/sardines-pack-piazza-in-rome-for-protest-against-matteo-salvini\">The grassroots Sardines movement</a> came into existence late last year, in Bologna, to protest at Italy\u2019s swing to the right and in particular the politics of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/matteo-salvini\">Matteo Salvini</a>. It took its name from the fact that so many people attended its rallies they were squeezed together like sardines in a shoal. Such behaviour having become inappropriate thanks to Covid-19, the Sardines have adapted.</p> <p>If curiosity prompted you to search for the hashtags, you would discover that over 48 hours this coming weekend, the Sardines are organising an online sale of 6,000 begonias and aromatic herbs. You pay \u20ac5 a pot, and Sardines volunteers on bikes deliver them to your home (assuming you live in Bologna). In a city with a love of open-air cinema and neighbourhood theatre, the goal is to raise \u20ac30,000 (\u00a327,000) for local culture which has suffered terribly during this pandemic. Organisers are calling it a \u201csymbolic flash mob\u201d.</p> <p>Real sardines also adapt to survive, of course, and according to one eye-catching <a href=\"http://www.wildoceanfilm.com/sardinerun.html\">description</a>, form \u201cmetamorphosing silver baitballs at the surface, twisting and dividing to avoid the ocean predators\u201d. But if historical precedents are anything to go by, the Sardines of Bologna may be doing more than just surviving. Such gestures, in a time of crisis, can have a powerful mobilising effect.</p> <p>In 1918, the colonial authorities in India put out a call for help because their woefully underpowered healthcare provision for the local population was about to be overwhelmed by a tidal wave of flu. The people who answered the call, and stepped into the breach, were usually members of organisations that had close connections to the independence movement. Because they were also active in social reform, these organisations were well placed to motivate dozens of local caste and community groups. Soon they were raising funds, organising influenza relief centres, and distributing medicines, milk and blankets to devastated communities \u2013 often making deliveries on bikes.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mahatma-gandhi\">Mahatma Gandhi</a> was emerging as the head of the national independence movement at that time, but he still lacked grassroots support. Earlier in the year, he had organised a couple of peaceful campaigns \u2013 or satyagraha \u2013 among the workers and peasants of Gujarat, to protest at low pay and what they perceived as unjust taxes. He had been able to persuade thousands of people to come out, not hundreds of thousands. Then Gandhi fell ill with flu, and it\u2019s likely he developed pneumonia because he remained out of action for months that autumn.</p> <p>While he languished in his ashram in Gujarat, his followers in the same state went to the aid of the workers and peasants. Usually their efforts did not extend beyond the towns, but in one Gujarati district, Surat, the relief extended right out to the most remote villages and to some of the most marginalised groups in Indian society. It was organised by two young brothers, Kalyanji and Kunvarji Mehta, and a likeminded man who would eventually become their friend, Dayalji Desai. These three had given up good government jobs in the previous decade and set up their own ashrams where they educated young people about the fight for home rule and the need to reform the caste system. They now mobilised their students to provide a district-wide relief operation.</p> <p>That operation is estimated to have reached at least 10,000 people \u2013 Hindus, Muslims, Christians, tribesmen and untouchables alike \u2013 and people in big cities such as Ahmedabad and Mumbai read about the young men\u2019s exploits in the papers and admired them. Gandhi soon heard about them too, and he drew the young men into his circle as he slowly recovered and resumed his political activities. Anti-British feeling was stoked in early 1919, first by the Rowlatt Act \u2013 which extended martial law into peacetime in India \u2013 and then by the shocking Jallianwala Bagh <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/12/britain-amritsar-massacre-centenary-1919-india\">massacre</a>, at which an estimated 1,000 protesters died after British troops fired into the unarmed crowd.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/28/italy-progressives-sardines-salvini-election-far-right\">Italy\u2019s progressives had lost hope. The Sardines movement is starting to restore it | Jamie Mackay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 1920, the Mehta brothers travelled with Gandhi in a train from Mumbai to Kolkata, where he was due to attend a special session of the Indian National Congress party. At that meeting he promised self-rule within a year if Congress backed his call for nationwide satyagraha. By then the Mehtas were being hailed as miracle workers for their ongoing social work among deprived groups. Hearing Gandhi\u2019s call, Kunvarji Mehta returned to Gujarat, mobilised his network and delivered five towns to the cause.</p> <p>The next year, half a million workers came out on strike in India. It would take another few decades of bitter struggle before Gandhi could deliver on his promise, but 1918 was a crucial turning point \u2013 the moment, according to the historian AJP Taylor, when Indians turned definitively against British rule. Thereafter, Gandhi was recognised as the undisputed head of the independence movement and he had popular support.</p> <p>The lesson may be that when the stakes are high the reward is great \u2013 as local hubs of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/virus-neighbours-covid-19\">community support</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/mutual-aid-coronavirus-pandemic-rebecca-solnit\">mutual aid groups</a> around the world are discovering. And that loyal local followings can make a difference on the national and international stage, eventually. So watch out for grassroots movements in times of pestilence, they could be the start of something significant \u2013 even if they call themselves \u201csymbolic\u201d, and even if they start with a humble pot plant parked in a city square.</p> <p>\u2022 Laura Spinney is a science journalist and author</p>",

It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics.</p>\n    <p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is being watched very carefully.

  "<p>\u201cThis is a great place to relax,\u201d a familiar, deep voice coos out from the screen. \u201cEnjoy the calm feeling as you make patterns in the sand \u2026 that looks splendid!\u201d</p> <p>If anyone\u2019s dulcet tones has the power to soothe the public (and a legion of housebound hyperactive three-year-olds), it\u2019s Stephen Fry. Fry was recently announced as the calming narrator of CBeebies\u2019 The Mindful Garden, a wellness cartoon app for young children, in which users can rake a Zen garden, plant a tree or breathe along with a frog to help them \u201cde-stress and unwind\u201d from the day.</p> <p>Parents\u2019 ears may prick up when they first recognise Fry\u2019s voice, and he\u2019s far from the only A-lister lending their skills to kids\u2019 TV at the moment. Just like when the penny finally drops when tuning in to Bing the bunny (\u201cIs that \u2026 Mark Rylance?\u201d), adult viewers get a little extra appreciation for the shows home-schooling the nation\u2019s children when they check out the credits.</p> <p>Usually, I tend to \u201cwatch\u201d children\u2019s cartoons with my toddler at 6am, while slumped on the sofa. Also: resting my eyes. But, currently on lockdown \u2013 and with 12 straight hours of entertainment to provide for an under-five each day \u2013 much of the day is now devoted to TV animation studies, and it\u2019s a regular game of who\u2019s who, guessing the high-profile actors.</p> <p>If it\u2019s a golden age for television, it\u2019s a platinum age for children\u2019s cartoons. From Kathy Burke in School of Roars, Alexander Armstrong in Hey Duggee, Tamsin Greig in Love Monster, Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton in Green Eggs and Ham, and Lin-Manuel Miranda and David Tennant in the DuckTales reboot, Oscar- and Bafta-winners are lending their voices to children\u2019s cartoons.</p> <p>Take the Rylance-fronted Bing. Since its launch in 2014, it has become one of the BBC\u2019s most popular children\u2019s cartoons, winning multiple awards and with episodes clocking up more than two million views each on YouTube. Bing is a CGI toddler bunny, looked after by an odd knitted ant (possibly?) half his size called Flop. Every episode features a microdrama: Bing steals a lollipop! Bing breaks a toy drum! Bing goes full Lennie from Of Mice and Men and accidentally squashes a butterfly! It all rounds off with the unflappable Flop announcing: \u201cIt\u2019s a Bing thing.\u201d The kids go absolutely mad for it.</p> <p>Despite its huge fanbase, it\u2019s the cause of much <a href=\"https://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/am_i_being_unreasonable/2647454-Theories-about-Bing-Bunny?pg=1&amp;messages=25\">consternation \u2013 and theories \u2013 for Mumsnetters</a>, namely, what on earth is Flop, played by Rylance for three series, then taken over by Shameless\u2019s David Threlfall in series four? The producer of Bing, Mikael Shields, tells me: \u201cFlop is Flop.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s obviously a competent grownup, in looking after Bing, and he\u2019s also very joyfully engaged with that. Beyond that, we haven\u2019t really defined him much. He just loves Bing, and Bing loves him. There\u2019s a certain mystery to that, which is probably a good thing.\u201d</p> <p>Shields says it was his love of the theatre that led him to cast the Tony and Olivier award-winning Rylance as Flop: <strong>\u201c</strong>I saw Mark play Henry V decades ago, then I saw his amazing performance in the Jez Butterworth play Jerusalem, so I wrote to him and we met up, and he kindly agreed to work with us. I think he saw we were sincere about telling stories and creating characters that were really thoughtfully made for the audience.</p> <p>\u201cHe was instrumental in creating who Flop is. We wanted the voice not to be like a dad or a grandfather, but fall somewhere in between that, and we had to think about his cadence, his gentleness, the amount of breath in his voice.\u201d</p> <p>Bing also has a supporting cast worthy of the National Theatre. Father Ted\u2019s Pauline McLynn plays Gilly, Bryony Hannah from Call the Midwife voices Padget, while established theatre actor Akiya Henry (last seen as Lady Macbeth in the 2018 film Macbeth) plays Amma \u2013 not that the producers shout about it: \u201cWe\u2019ve never promoted any of the characters or who they are in the show,\u201d says Shields. \u201cWe have a range of really talented actors across the board, but they\u2019re cast because of their fantastic voices and because of the connection we think they\u2019ll make with the children in the audience.</p> <p>\u201cChildren are very emotionally porous \u2013 in some sense, they\u2019re almost a more discerning audience than adults. If they\u2019re not interested, they\u2019ll walk off or even turn the television off. Show me a 50-year-old, sitting on the sofa who\u2019ll do that. Children are elite consumers of a story because they\u2019re developing language, cognition, emotional intelligence, social skills and identity,\u201d he adds. \u201cSo high-quality writing is vital and so are voice performances that need to be highly authentic and expressive. We put our heart and soul into making it like this, which is why I think we\u2019ve got such a loyal audience.\u201d</p> <p>The other big hitter for children\u2019s cartoons is Hey Duggee, a joyous 8-bit-inspired cartoon about a gang of young animals in a scout-like group called The Squirrels. They\u2019re presided over by a giant, knowledgable dog called Duggee, who communicates through just one word (\u201cWoof!\u201d) which themed badge they\u2019re aiming to complete each day. It all ends in a big, group hug for the characters. \u201cAh, woof!\u201d as Duggee puts it.</p> <p>There are little jokes and cultural references embedded in each episode for the parents. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K05N2jqFHc8\">The Stick song</a> \u2013 a ravey beat that seems to be heavily inspired by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5A9OIIapSko\">ATB\u2019s banger, 9pm (Til I Come)</a> \u2013 sung by a stick insect was mooted to become Christmas No 1 in 2017 and ended up being discussed on Newsnight. Last Christmas, Hey Duggee was the third most watched series on BBC iPlayer, coming in behind EastEnders and Gavin &amp; Stacey.</p> <p>The narrator for the comedy cartoon is Alexander Armstrong, somebody who Grant Orchard, creator of Hey Duggee, had earmarked for the role right from the beginning. \u201cI quite specifically wanted Alexander Armstrong. There was a voice he did, t<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaOELExvOk8\">he drunken detective in Armstrong &amp; Miller, who had an imaginary friend called Chuffy the train driver.</a> It was a great voice, all encompassing. I decided I wanted an avuncular narrator for the show and his was the only voice I wanted.\u201d</p> <p>Making the switch from prime-time to breakfast time took a bit of persuading. \u201cInitially he [Armstrong] was quite reluctant to take part,\u201d Orchard says. \u201cBut we said \u2018We really don\u2019t want you to be soft, we want you to be almost military\u2019 \u2013 we referenced Lionel Jeffries from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and that I think really hooked him.\u201d</p> <p>Orchard says that the plan from the start was that the cartoon would be a shared experience. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want the parents to sit the kids in front of the TV then walk off, we wanted them to be engaged with it as well,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWe wanted the kids to watch their parents laughing. When I was younger, that only happened when it came to something like The Generation Game on Saturday nights, the whole family would watch and laugh, but other than that, it\u2019s kind of segregated. Hopefully, it\u2019s going to be part of a family\u2019s shared nostalgia.\u201d</p> <p>As I load up another Hey Duggee episode for my son (no judgments, please), it\u2019s hard to think how we\u2019ll look back on this strange time with nostalgia. But by watching these engaging cartoons voiced by some of the acting world\u2019s finest, it\u2019s making us both laugh. These actors \u2013 Fry, in particular \u2013 may just be providing their greatest performance yet: a lifeline for every parent\u2019s last nerve.</p>",
  "<p>The British government has said there is \u201ca serious risk\u201d that the European Union will fail to meet its duties to protect the rights of UK nationals living in the bloc, in the latest sign of tensions over Brexit.</p> <p>In a letter to the European commission, Michael Gove said British residents living in the EU had raised concerns, while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/coronavirus-british-eu-solidarity-vital-ambassadors-europe-trade\">coronavirus pandemic</a> had diverted the attention of many governments from implementing the Brexit withdrawal agreement, which is intended to protect the rights of an estimated 1.2 million British nationals in the EU and 3.5 million Europeans in the UK.</p> <p>There is \u201ca serious risk that the EU will not fulfil its obligations under the withdrawal agreement by the time the transition period ends on 31 December 2020\u201d, said Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.</p> <p>He added that the government was \u201calready seeing several instances of misapplication of the withdrawal agreement\u201d, which, although \u201clocalised incidents\u201d, made it harder for British nationals to exercise their rights.</p> <p>The letter comes at a tense moment in EU-UK relations, with both sides expected to report later on the latest round of talks, which conclude on Friday morning.</p> <p>One of the government\u2019s criticisms is the lack of official campaigns in EU member states to raise awareness about new requirements for UK nationals \u2013 a stipulation under the treaty.</p> <p>France and Spain, home to large numbers of UK migrant workers and retired people, are deemed not to have done anything proactive to raise awareness among British residents.</p> <p>The Czech Republic and Hungary have published information that the UK government believes to be confusing or out-of-date, without translation into English. In contrast \u2013 the government says \u2013 information on the settlement scheme for EU nationals in the UK is available in other EU languages.</p> <p>In Austria and Slovenia the government is concerned British nationals have only six or seven months to secure their rights, whereas EU nationals in the UK have 27 months.</p> <p>Other EU member states, such as Malta, Cyprus and Slovakia, are faulted for relying on face-to-face meetings with local officials, rather than offering people the option to secure their status online.</p> <p>Gove complains that some countries have still not provided detail on what their application processes will entail.</p> <p>The government is also concerned about limited attention to vulnerable UK citizens, with Gove stating that member states have not shared information about help for elderly, hard-to-reach or other vulnerable citizens, adding that \u201cin many cases there appears to be none\u201d.</p> <p>In contrast the government says the UK has given \u00a39m to help community organisations support vulnerable EU nationals, with a further \u00a38m due in 2020-21. It also reports \u00a33m earmarked to help support British nationals in the EU.</p> <p>Gove represents the government in the Joint Committee, an EU-UK group set up to monitor compliance and implement the Brexit withdrawal treaty, which came into force when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/31/britain-has-left-the-eu-what-happens-now-guide-negotiations\">the UK left the EU on 31 January</a>.

  "<p>Damon Runyon was a Depression-era New York newspaperman who wrote, I think, some of the funniest short stories ever published. Yet he\u2019s been only patchily in print in the UK over the last few decades, and inasmuch as most people know his work it\u2019ll be through a vague sense of him as the writer behind the musical Guys and Dolls.</p> <p>I don\u2019t denigrate that musical, but Runyon\u2019s stories are their own thing. No musical can capture their special quality, for they are magical to the sentence level. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone who wouldn\u2019t benefit from reading him. He\u2019s as funny as PG Wodehouse and, like Wodehouse, Runyon creates entirely his own idiom and entirely his own comic world. But unlike Wodehouse, who is always sunshine and innocence, Runyon\u2019s world is wry and coloured with exquisite melancholy.</p> <p>His is a world of gangsters and hustlers and conmen, ill-starred professional gamblers and diners serving blue-plate specials and gefilte fish \u2013 all observed by a narrator \u201cknown to one and all as a guy who is just around\u201d. The characters seldom ever have normal names: they are called things like Harry the Horse and Rusty Charley and Dream Street Rose. And this narrator speaks in an inimitable slang that is at once vernacular and almost comically circumlocutory, where a gun is a \u201croscoe\u201d and money is \u201cscratch\u201d or \u201cpotatoes\u201d, and women are \u201cdolls\u201d or \u201cJudies\u201d or \u201cever-loving wives\u201d. If you are inconveniencing a citizen as he goes about his unlawful business there are such guys as will lay you plenty of six-to-two that you will receive a \u201cbust in the snoot\u201d.</p> <p>The famous thing about Runyon\u2019s stories is that they are infallibly (or nearly infallibly; scholars scour the text for the handful of rare slips) narrated in the present tense. Hence the typically talky opening of The Snatching of Bookie Bob:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now it comes on the spring of 1931, after a long hard winter, and times are very tough indeed, what with the stock market going all to pieces, and banks busting right and left, and the law getting very nasty about this and that, and one thing and another, and many citizens of this town are compelled to do the best they can.</p> <p>There is very little scratch anywhere and along Broadway many citizens are wearing their last year\u2019s clothes and have practically nothing to bet on the races or anything else, and it is a condition that will touch anybody\u2019s heart.</p> </blockquote> <p>When talking about Runyon, sooner or later all you want to do is quote him. Here, for instance, is a passage from The Hottest Guy in the World, in which Big Jule describes how he passed the time shooting rats for target practice while holed up in a barn:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, sir,\u2019 Jule says, \u2018I keep score on myself one day, and I hit fifty rats hand running without a miss, which I claim makes me the champion rat shooter of the world with a forty-five automatic, although of course,\u2019 he says, \u2018if anybody wishes to challenge me to a rat shooting match I am willing to take them on for a side bet. I get so I can call my shots on the rats, and in fact several times I say to myself, I will hit this one in the right eye, and this one in the left eye, and it always turns out just as I say, although sometimes when you hit a rat with a forty-five up close it is not always possible to tell afterwards just where you hit him, because you seem to hit him all over.</p> </blockquote> <p>For belly laughs from darkness, you will struggle to beat Sense of Humor. And that streak of melancholy I mentioned? Man alive. Try The Lily of St Pierre. And not for nothing is the title of one of his best stories All Horse Players Die Broke.</p> <p>There are dozens of these stories, and the standard omnibus edition is called On Broadway (bundling the collections More Than Somewhat, Furthermore and Take It Easy). <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/571/57177/on-broadway/9780141184234.html\">It\u2019s in Penguin Modern Classics</a>.

  "<p>The relaunch of Scooby-Doo, a character born in the late 60s and sustaining a presence in the decades ever since, carries with it the potential for both high highs and low lows. Because universal familiarity and affection among parents might make it a swifter rental decision but the weight of expectation and of childhood association will mean that casual, uninvested background watching won\u2019t suffice. Which is where the problem with Warner\u2019s early summer franchise-relauncher Scoob lies. While a younger audience might be enthralled by the fast pace and bright colour palette, those understandably curious adults sitting nearby will find themselves watching in horror, a deep, sorrowful howl emerging.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/20/the-willoughbys-review-netflix-animated-movie\">The Willoughbys review \u2013 imaginative animated Netflix adventure</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Originally intended for a theatrical release, the studio decided to demote their animated adventure (the first big-budget Scooby-Doo film since 2004) to the home cinema, a wise sacrifice given a captive family audience thirsty for new content as shown by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/02/studios-bypass-cinemas-with-lucrative-streaming-premieres-the-end\">controversial success of last month\u2019s Trolls: World Tour</a>. Scoob has a steeper hill to climb though, without the inbuilt younger fandom of Universal\u2019s sequel, so it\u2019s important to woo an older crowd and so while longtime animation director Tony Cervone might be at the helm, the script includes input by comedy writer Adam Sztykiel, whose previous projects have been aimed at adult viewers. The end result, trying to appeal to both ends of the spectrum, can\u2019t quite master something that say, Pixar, manages with ease. It\u2019s uncomfortably strained with laboured winks scattered among the sub-par slapstick action, a dog\u2019s dinner of a movie best enjoyed by those with no knowledge of who or what Scooby-Doo used to be.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzlEnS7MmUo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GzlEnS7MmUo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>But even then, Scoob stumbles because so much of the plot plays off an assumed knowledge of the history of these characters and their dynamic, hoping that we fill in the many gaps it can\u2019t fill itself. It starts promisingly, with a neat meet-cute as we learn how a young Shaggy befriends a stray dog he calls Scooby-Doo. On one Halloween night, the pair then end up meeting three friends, Fred, Daphne and Velma, who help them bring a thieving local in a ghost mask to justice. It\u2019s a charming throwback and so it\u2019s then frustrating that we\u2019re dragged into the future via lazy mystery-solving montage as the gang find their business underfunded leading to a bizarre and dated cameo from Simon Cowell, playing himself as a potential investor. He bitchily recommends dropping Shaggy and Scooby from the Mystery Inc banner and so the group splits, a befuddling inciting incident that\u2019s indicative of a confused and confusing plot to come.</p> <p>The ensuing mess of events continues to take us further away from the ingredients that made the original show and its many iterations so well-loved by so many, replacing a goofy small-town mystery with a blockbuster-level global quest. In trying to update the formula, the film\u2019s four writers have expanded the focus too wide, flattening out the distinctively <em>shaggy</em> mystery elements and turning it into just another soulless kids movie. The tiresome insertion of a superhero narrative feels patronising, as if a younger audience can\u2019t be trusted without it, and transforming kitschy Wacky Races bad guy Dick Dastardly into a slick, all-powerful supervillain is both boring and a predictable sign that a Hanna-Barbera cinematic universe is upon us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e96eac969fe2a9577b8becb4dc00fe8bc82305e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e96eac969fe2a9577b8becb4dc00fe8bc82305e/0_0_2864_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"419\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s something too <em>big</em> about the plot, making it feel more like the third or fourth instalment in a franchise, rather than the more modest scene-setter it needed to be. We get so little time with the group as a whole and have such little understanding of what it is they actually do that suddenly throwing them into jeopardy doesn\u2019t have much of an effect, especially when it\u2019s on such a large scale. It doesn\u2019t help that the garish animation looks more suited to a mobile game than a studio movie, passable in the bigger action sequences but hideous when trying to portray human features. There\u2019s a stacked voice cast \u2013 including Zac Efron, Mark Wahlberg, Gina Rodriguez and Amanda Seyfried \u2013 and while Will Forte nails his Shaggy impression, the others are hard to distinguish, struggling to add life to a script that relies on clunky pop culture references (most of which conveniently nod to other Warner properties).</p> <p>At one point in Scoob, Fred insists that this is their \u201cmost important mystery ever\u201d rather than being \u201cabout some guy in a rubber mask\u201d, an annoyingly smug attempt to elevate this above the many entertainingly dopey adventures we\u2019ve seen them on before.

After winning the grand prize that has to this day eluded Argentinian writers, he gets a letter from his home town, where he hasn\u2019t lived for 40 years, inviting him back to receive a special award in recognition of his achievement and the town\u2019s highest honor. He\u2019s at first apprehensive, but realizes that a vacation to the soul of his writings \u2013 the town and its people inspired all his novels \u2013 may do him good. But, upon arrival in Salas, a fictional place in the middle of nowhere, town life soon consumes him. What he thought would be a quiet retreat to his roots quickly escalates. The longer he stays, the more his presence seems to rot, as does his power and control over the place.</p> <p>As the pride of the town, Mantovani is paraded around on a fire engine by the mayor, presented with a bust and a painted mural of himself and asked to teach a workshop. He\u2019s charmed at first, but Mantovani\u2019s cosmopolitan cynicism starts to clash with the townspeople. When a childhood friend, played by comedian Dady Brieva, finds him, the life he ostensibly exiled himself from and the woman he left behind hook him back in.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f5La9q2_k8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2f5La9q2_k8?start=11&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=11\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Two narratives unfold simultaneously. The first is directly in front of the viewer, watching Mantovani, a caricature of himself, trying to navigate his few days around the townies. The jaded writer is tense but tolerant at first. Finally, he rebels \u2013 and is met with a life-threatening scenario.</p> <p>The second narrative, and whether it exists at all, is up to the viewer to debate. What\u2019s happening in Mantovani\u2019s head? Was it Mantovani\u2019s intention to leave the town the way he does?</p> <p>While some may find the results of this set-up predictable, I found it packed with keen observations and intriguing ideas. By bringing a conventionally successful writer back to his old town, the film raises questions about the creative process, the responsibility of writers, and how their fiction \u2013 or what is, at least, supposed to be \u2013 can affect reality. It also explores a package of classic oppositions: town v city, tradition v progress, morals v ethics, nationalism v globalism, honesty v fact.</p> <p>With such universal themes, one could easily see the film recreated and textured with the aesthetics of another country. Yet it\u2019s exactly the precision of detail in the film\u2019s setting that makes it unique and so real. Like the Coen brothers\u2019 Fargo or Harper Lee\u2019s Maycomb, The Distinguished Citizen\u2019s directors, Gast\u00f3n Duprat and Mariano Cohn, create a character of their fictional Salas. It\u2019s in the small things: the mayor\u2019s unbuttoned shirt, the khaki-colored Renault 12s with corroding bumpers, the colonial-era buildings covered in moss and art deco fonts peeling off the walls. Even the sing-song tone of the town\u2019s public TV host is quintessential to the decaying Anytown Argentinian <em>pueblo.</em> It\u2019s exactly this mix of precise reality and obtuse cliche that allows the film to flourish.</p> <p>Although it might appear so, by the nature of the themes it explores, The Distinguished Citizen is not trying to make a political statement or take a stance. It does not posit a right and left or right and wrong. It does, however, force the viewer to question themselves and whether they find themselves laughing at Mantovani or the townspeople. I\u2019d argue there\u2019s room for a Hollywood remake, ideally one that works better than the glossy redo of Argentinian thriller The Secret in Their Eyes. In this climate of political division in the United States, it might soothe some sores.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Distinguished Citizen is available on Netflix in the UK and US</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>In July 1971 military leaders launched a coup against Morocco\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/jul/26/guardianobituaries2\"> King Hassan II</a>, descending on his summer palace in Skhirat, where he was hosting a sumptuous garden party. A bloodbath ensued. Aziz BineBine was a junior officer at the time. He had been told, like most of his comrades, that he was taking part in a military exercise. Only as the chaotic, and quickly foiled, coup unfolded did the young officer realise he\u2019d been tricked. He fled the scene, his gun unfired.</p> <p>BineBine came from a well-connected Moroccan family. His father was a close confidant of the king but this had no bearing on his fate. After a summary trial, BineBine was sentenced to 10 years. Worse was to come. Following a second failed coup the next year (Hassan II was not universally admired), he and his fellow military inmates were plucked from the relative sanctuary of civilian prison and deposited in a place that didn\u2019t officially exist, and wouldn\u2019t exist until 18 years later, when they finally emerged blinking into the light.</p> <p>Tazmamart was a purpose-built dungeon situated in the Atlas mountains, searing in the summer, freezing in the winter, cramped and hellish all year round. The rations were meagre, the clothes spartan, the sewers open. Exercise consisted of \u201cthe diagonal of life\u201d \u2013 \u201cfour steps one way and four the other, a half-turn to the left and right alternately, so as not to get dizzy\u201d. The prisoners were repeatedly reminded that their sole exit was death. Only following international pressure did Morocco admit to the prison\u2019s existence and close it down. Of the 58 men sent there after the coup attempts, more than half had died.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8a18f5b9c763636e1025c007d241b2ac669bf9d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a18f5b9c763636e1025c007d241b2ac669bf9d1/0_138_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"King Hassan II of Morocco.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">King Hassan II of Morocco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abdelhak Senna/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tazmamart was a pit of despair \u2013 but also a well of stories. Several memoirs and documentaries have emanated from its horrors, along with a novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jul/24/featuresreviews.guardianreview14\">This Blinding Absence</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jul/24/featuresreviews.guardianreview14\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jul/24/featuresreviews.guardianreview14\">of Light</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jul/24/featuresreviews.guardianreview14\"> (</a>2001) by Tahar Ben Jelloun, probably Morocco\u2019s most famous living author.. He had based it on a three-hour interview with BineBine, whom he renamed Salim. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/may/06/featuresreviews.guardianreview27\">BineBine wrote an open letter denouncing the book, claiming that he\u2019d been pressured </a>into handing over his story. The novelist hit back, insisting that he\u2019d been approached to write it by BineBine\u2019s brother.</p> <p><em>This Blinding Absence of Light</em> is a brilliant novel \u2013 clear-eyed, humane, richly metaphysical \u2013 and, whatever the truth of its origins, it undeniably did good in bringing the Tazmamart story to an English-speaking world. Now BineBine has been given the chance to do the same, following the publication of his own account (which first appeared in French in 2009) in Lulu Norman\u2019s translation. What is remarkable \u2013 though perhaps it shouldn\u2019t be \u2013 is how similar <em>Tazmamart</em> is to <em>This Blinding Absence of Light</em>. This isn\u2019t just because the sources are the same but because BineBine is a talented author in his own right, who perhaps gave Ben Jelloun more than raw material. Both accounts convey with extraordinary vividness the clash between physical degradation and psychological transcendence necessitated by the hardships of the regime. Both writers deserve their places in a tradition of incarceration literature alongside Dostoevsky, Koestler, Solzhenitsyn and Genet.</p> <p>One could play a game of spot-the-parallel all day: the description of the tiny cell as a \u201ctomb\u201d, of the starch that passes for food and the filth that passes for drinking water;<strong> </strong>of the agony of the narrator\u2019s ruptured gall bladder and the damage to morale when he and a fellow inmate descend into a ferocious slanging match. It also becomes clear, reading BineBine\u2019s memoir, how Ben Jelloun conjured up the character of Salim the story-spinning jailbird, whose verbal flights help to keep his comrades removed from their material condition.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>BineBine's role as entertainer in the king\u2019s dungeon is remarkably similar to his father's at the king\u2019s court</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>BineBine is (by his own, characteristically fabular description) \u201ca merchant of dreams, a master of imagination\u201d. He keeps the other prisoners entertained with his yarns and regurgitated passages from novels, his \u201ccourses\u201d in philosophy and literature. This imaginative capacity \u2013 allied with his religious faith and apparently formidable memory \u2013 is what helps to keep him sane. He feels that he is serving \u201cthree sentences\u201d: one imposed by men (he admits culpability for having been naive); one by heaven (which he accepts \u201cunconditionally\u201d); and one by himself (\u201cI was responsible for my own destiny\u201d). As the book unfolds, we see that those who rail and rage tend to be the quickest to lose hope, and to die. The wretch who appears in this book is perhaps even more accepting than Ben Jelloun\u2019s version of him, and he displays no anger at the father who publicly disowned him following the coup. Although BineBine doesn\u2019t mention this, his role of erudite entertainer in the king\u2019s dungeon is remarkably similar to the one his father enjoys at the king\u2019s court.</p> <p>It is easy to see how BineBine became \u201cthe star of the prison block\u201d: as well as his gift for storytelling and generous grasp of ethics, he has a keen eye for absurdity. The food may be appalling but the corollary of his constantly roiling stomach is the warmth he can harvest from his flatulence: no fart is wasted. Denied even an onion to draw out the pus of his suppurating thumb, he urinates on it instead: \u201cI had achieved total self-sufficiency.\u201d When a needle is fashioned from a scrap of metal (\u201cThis took \u2026 months of patience and work\u201d), \u201cwe\u2019d passed from the Stone Age to the Bronze\u201d.</p> <p>Perhaps the main difference between the two books is BineBine\u2019s focus on his fellow inmates. His testimony, one feels, has partly been written to honour this \u201cgroup of wise young men\u201d. On a political level, this lends his account a function beyond the scope of the fictionalised version; on a literary level, it causes the narrative to plod a little, as BineBine dutifully moves his gaze from cell to cell. Such disparities are fertile ground for discussions about the different remits of fiction and memoir. But <em>Tazmamart</em> is far more than a vital document: it is a powerful tribute to human fortitude and imagination \u2013 and perfect reading for incarcerated times.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Tazmamart is translated by Lulu Norman and published by Haus (RRP \u00a314.99).</em></p>",

It is clear that criminals on some sporting estates, both in the uplands and lowlands, have used the wider closure of the countryside as an opportunity to ramp up their efforts to kill birds of prey.</p> <p>\u201cSpring is the time when birds of prey are most visible and therefore vulnerable, as they put on courtship displays, build nests and find food ready to breed. The criminal actions are targeted and malicious in nature, taking out birds before they have the opportunity to breed, often in areas where they have previously faced persecution.\u201d</p> <p>Supt Nick Lyall, the head of <a href=\"https://www.nwcu.police.uk/raptor-persecution-priority-delivery-group/\">a national police and policy group tasked with tackling raptor persecution</a>, said he was \u201csickened\u201d by the number of cases in recent weeks.</p> <p>\u201cLockdown has been seen as a green light by those involved in raptor persecution offences to continue committing crimes, presumably in the belief that there are fewer people around to catch them doing so,\u201d he said. \u201cI remain grateful to everyone involved in investigating these crimes, and thankfully in the vast majority of the cases I am aware of, it looks like some really good lines of inquiry are taking place which should lead to arrests and interviews.\u201d</p> <p>Amanda Anderson, director of the Moorland Association, said: \u201cAny confirmed reports of raptor persecution are cause for concern. The incidents specified near Leeds and York ... [by the RSPB] are clearly not on grouse moors, while reports we have from our members in the uplands have suggested that many birds of prey are in fact benefiting from the lockdown restrictions and the subsequent reduction in disturbance from members of the public.

The furore over children\u2019s rainbow drawings, combined with dogwhistle remarks by the head of the religious affairs directorate during a Ramadan sermon that gay people \u201cspread disease\u201d, were met with concern by human rights and legal advocacy groups. The Izmir Bar Association said Ali Erba\u015f\u2019 comments could fuel hate crimes, while an Ankara-based human rights group filed a judicial complaint.</p> <p>Those actions in turn led to a veiled threat from president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan that any attack on the head of the <em>Diyanet</em>, or religious affairs directorate, was tantamount to an attack on the state. Retaliatory investigations into the bar associations in Ankara and Diyarbakir on the grounds of \u201cbelittling the religious values adopted by Turkish society\u201d followed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty sad that the natural beauty of a rainbow is automatically assumed to have a political agenda in Turkey,\u201d said activist Aydin\u00e7 Y\u00fcksel.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s pretty typical for the government to try and find a scapegoat for its problems. With coronavirus it was the Chinese first, and now seemingly out of the blue, it\u2019s us. It\u2019s all the more surprising because more and more people these days are realising that being LGBT and being religious are not mutually exclusive.\u201d</p> <p>Control over the flow of information and political narratives has been even more important than usual for Ankara during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Donation campaigns, soup kitchens and attempts to distribute bread and masks across the country have been halted.</p> <p>The goverment has said such initiatives are an illegal attempt to undermine the state: Istanbul mayor Ekrem \u0130mamo\u011flu and Ankara mayor Mansur Yava\u015f are both facing criminal probes for collecting donations not authorised by the local governors\u2019 offices, and at least 900,000 lira (\u00a3105,000) in collected money has been been seized by the treasury.

In other words, his ascent and seemingly impregnable position since are explained in largely British terms.</p> <p>That\u2019s justifiable: everywhere in the world, a lot of politics is local. But another way of looking at the great balloon of his popularity \u2013 how it\u2019s kept inflated, and why attempts to puncture it so often fail \u2013 is to remember the leader he perhaps most resembles.</p> <p>In 2011, he told the Sunday Telegraph that <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/borisjohnson/8901683/Boris-Johnson-Ive-a-healthy-dose-of-sheer-egomania.html\">Ronald Reagan</a> was his favourite politician. Like Johnson, Reagan was a telegenic celebrity who became a high-profile regional and then national politician; first as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorship_of_Ronald_Reagan\">governor of California</a> from 1967 to 1975, and then as <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/ronald-reagan/\">US president from 1981 to 1989</a>.</p> <p>As with Johnson, Reagan\u2019s periods in office were frequently marked by broken promises and scandals, by evasiveness and incompetence. Having <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1989-01-10-8902240061-story.html\">pledged to eliminate</a> the federal government\u2019s debt \u201cby 1983, if not earlier\u201d, he trebled it during his presidency. In the mid-80s, when some of his senior officials were found to have illegally aided rightwing rebels in Nicaragua, he professed ignorance.</p> <p>Like his counterpart, Reagan sometimes came across in public as vague, not in control of events, out of his depth. Many commentators, and even some close colleagues, thought he was lazy and often disengaged. Yet many Americans weren\u2019t bothered by his shortcomings. Exasperated critics called him the \u201cTeflon president\u201d \u2013 responsibility for anything bad rarely stuck to him. Johnson\u2019s enemies know the feeling.</p> <p>Reagan expressed a hazy but potent sense of optimism instead. \u201cUnfailingly he sent forth the message that people wanted to hear: better days were ahead,\u201d wrote the historian Haynes Johnson in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/20/books/books-of-the-times-recounting-the-lowlights-of-the-reagan-years.html\">Sleepwalking Through History: America in the Reagan Years</a>. Our prime minister does the same.</p> <p>And while Reagan smiled and chuckled for the cameras, out of sight the ideologues and hard men of his circle \u2013 the Dominic Cummings and Lynton Crosbys of their day \u2013 further militarised the American state and inserted coded racial messages into his election campaigns. A likeable premier, as Johnson remains to many Britons, is a great decoy for a government with confrontational aims.</p> <p>How can opponents trap such slippery leaders? When Reagan stood for re-election in 1984, the Democrats tried soberly pointing out his flaws and warning about their consequences. Their candidate, Walter Mondale, a lawyer by profession, accused Reagan of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/13/us/mondale-attacks-reagan-s-policies.html\">\u201cirresponsibility and deception\u201d</a> in office, and said that taxes would have to rise as a consequence. He <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/organization/?10663/Walter-Mondale\">lost to Reagan</a> in 49 of the 50 states.</p> <p>This may be a warning to Keir Starmer, even as he exposes Johnson\u2019s bluffing and recklessness with almost embarrassing ease in parliament. Sometimes, voters prefer irresponsible leaders to realistic ones \u2013 partly because voters can be political fantasists themselves.</p> <p>Previously a successful but hammy actor, as president Reagan maintained a persona that was so obviously mannered, delivering patriotic one-liners like a movie cowboy, that when he bent the truth many people weren\u2019t shocked or necessarily disapproving. Instead, they judged the quality of his act. The similarly cartoonish public Johnson often gets the same indulgent treatment, with his half-truths tolerated as just him \u201cbeing Boris\u201d. Boris isn\u2019t even his real first name.</p> <p>He does lack one of Reagan\u2019s advantages, though. In the 80s, with Silicon Valley burgeoning and the Soviet bloc in terminal decline, America\u2019s position in the world really was improving. The famous claim of Reagan\u2019s re-election campaign, that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/every-winning-slogan-from-us-presidential-campaigns-1948-2016-2019-5?r=US&amp;IR=T\">\u201cit\u2019s morning again in America\u201d</a>, was a blend of truth and fantasy \u2013 which is often the most effective propaganda of all.</p> <p>But in today\u2019s Britain, it\u2019s much harder to promise, as Johnson did yet again this week, that under him the country <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1260500656760279042\">\u201ccan be stronger and better than ever before\u201d</a>. Divided by Brexit and devolution, struggling economically even before the lockdown, the UK is an increasingly risky place for politicians to be bullish about. There is a danger of them sounding deluded and absurd. Johnson\u2019s cheery nationalism may backfire in ways that Reagan\u2019s never did.</p> <p>We\u2019re not there yet. But during crises voters can turn on governments suddenly. It\u2019s usually forgotten that for the first two months of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/winter-of-discontent\">1978-9 winter of discontent</a>, Britain\u2019s last experience of protracted national disruption, Jim Callaghan\u2019s Labour government continued to lead the Conservatives in some polls. But as the crisis dragged on, and seemed increasingly beyond Callaghan\u2019s control, the government\u2019s ratings collapsed and never fully recovered.</p> <p>If that happens to Johnson, the disconnect between his popularity and his political abilities will stop being a mystery that columns like this try to solve. His long hold over voters and the media, ever since he won the mayoralty in usually Labour-supporting London 12 years ago, will be seen as a bit of a con \u2013 like an enticing but dodgy company that eventually went bust.</p> <p>The Reagan presidency, for all its breezy airs, is actually an exacting model for other politicians to follow. It shows that charming half-truths can only sustain a government if you can keep voters half-believing in them, right to the end.</p> <p>\u2022 Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist</p> <p><br></p>",

And until borders reopen, airlines start flying and the 14-day quarantine is lifted, there will be no foreign tourists.</p> <p>In the meantime, to ensure health security and help restore confidence, government health-and-safety guidelines have been drawn up for every sector of the tourism industry. For hotels, this means vigorous cleaning and disinfection multiple times a day by staff wearing PPE, as well as changes to the guest experience, such as a ban on buffets.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll change all hotel services to ensure minimum contact,\u201d said Manuel Vegas of the Spanish Association of Hotel Directors (AEDH). \u201cKitchens will be transformed to reduce handling and we\u2019ll be demanding maximum guarantees from service providers. It is a radical change.\u201d</p> <p>Many hotels are installing screens between tables in their dining rooms, and introducing staggered dining hours and room service deliveries by staff in masks and gloves. Rooms are more wipe-down, with coffee makers, extra bedding and decoration removed. The government protocol also suggests removing carpets and minibars. And when common areas such as pools and gyms can be reopened, strict social distancing and disinfecting regimes will be in place.</p> <p>Credit-card payment is being promoted in hotels and bars, and contactless technology is coming faster than anticipated. Until the lockdown, AEDH had been running a hotel digitalisation project, providing tools and expertise, said Vegas: \u201cPlanning apps to generate a welcome the moment you arrive at the hotel, to create a virtual key, for the lift to take you to the right floor without having to touch a button, to place orders in the restaurant and bar without contact with a waiter. We had been anticipating the crisis without knowing it.\u201d This innovation needs to continue he said, to free up more staff to act as hosts to meet and greet guests.</p> <p>Guests will be welcomed with a \u201csafe smile\u201d from receptionists (albeit from behind a screen) at Room Mate Hotels. \u201cAfter so much time in confinement, we need that warmth. We are needy,\u201d said the group\u2019s founder, Kike Sarasola. Screens will be widespread - and the brand will ensure they look stylish. \u201cWe have designers competing to design the best screen and the public can vote on them,\u201d said Sarasola, adding that hotels will offset the strict rules in common areas with personalised touches in the bedrooms, making \u201cguests feel like kings\u201d with personalised notes and messages. Room Mate has gained extensive practice of working with safety protocols, having made 13 staffed hotels available free of charge to healthcare workers and the elderly from the start of the crisis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2639a8968a6c24de50e67819b30b80d4bbf28780\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2639a8968a6c24de50e67819b30b80d4bbf28780/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A closed hotel in the Canary Islands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A closed hotel in the Canary Islands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mercedes Menendez/Pacific Press/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whether guests will \u201cfeel like kings\u201d or feel a little uncomfortable in an environment of screens, masks and none of the usual interaction, is another question.</p> <p>\u201c[Who wants to] go to a hotel and not be allowed to enjoy the swimming pool or the common spaces? To finally be free, after quarantine, and spend money to go and be confined in a hotel room?\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Luis Zoreda, executive vice-president of non-profit group Exceltur (Alliance for Excellency in Tourism).</p> <p>Post-Covid, seaside resorts and beaches will be very different. Senator Hotels and Resorts, a major presence on Spain\u2019s Costas, plans to ensure physical contact is avoided in its kids clubs, and will monitor the spaces between loungers and disinfect them after use. The usual summer crowds of up to 40,000 will certainly not be gathering on the beaches of Benidorm this year; the most popular beaches are being divided into plots in order to manage social distancing, and access will be controlled by using QR codes for booking a patch (as in Valencia) and AI and sensors for monitoring (as they hope to do in V\u00e9lez, M\u00e1laga).</p> <p>Those booking hotels can expect bargains but not a fire sale. Acknowledging that \u201cmany families will be in a situation that\u2019s not good\u201d, MP Hotels has two-for-one offers and free accommodation for children. The majority of hotels are offering no payment upfront deals and free cancellation policies.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re aware that 2019 prices can\u2019t be maintained, and we have to promote prices that are attractive, but we are promoting dynamic pricing not offers,\u201d said Vegas. The industry is keen to avoid a potentially ruinous price war.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m completely against it,\u201d said Sarasola. \u201cWe should raise quality and service instead. This is the time for solidarity, to help small and medium hotels survive the summer.\u201d</p> <p>Smaller hotels may do better than most, especially those in the uncrowded natural locations 87% of Spanish people say they plan to holiday in post-lockdown. \u201cThey can offer more personalised attention,\u201d said Vegas. \u201cThose that will suffer most from the lack of international tourists are the biggest hotels in the top destinations, dependent on tour operators.\u201d</p> <p>Due to the uncertainty (and adding to it), it is estimated that around a third of hotels will not reopen this summer, or until there is the demand. Costa del Sol hotels are currently anticipating 30% occupancy. The holiday hotels that do open, said Vegas, will try to extend the season and, instead of closing in September as usual, will continue to November.\u201d Hope also rests with the Canary Islands where the peak season starts in November and runs through the winter.</p> <p>Spain has adopted health-and-security protocols that are among the strictest in the world, including antibody tests for all workers in the hospitality industry in the Canary Islands. They now need to ensure that when tourists eventually come, they don\u2019t bring the risk of infection. The hotel chain Riu is among many of the major groups to introduce temperature control at the hotel entrance, while VP Plaza Espa\u00f1a Design in Madrid is even introducing rapid tests for arriving guests, who then must wear masks and gloves in common areas.</p> <p>What\u2019s needed, said Vegas \u201cis confidence in the measures adopted, confidence in the protocols, confidence in the future \u2026 and then planes full of healthy guests.\u201d</p> <p>Keeping Spain\u2019s hotels secure has to start with testing foreign visitors at the point of origin. Coronavirus arrived in Spain with a German tourist flying into La Gomera and, appropriately, from July the Canary Islands will be the first destination in the world to require tourists to carry a digital health passport, developed by the islands\u2019 Laboratory Project with the support of the World Tourism Organization. If there are flights.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>Hard to set something in Ibiza, isn\u2019t it? There are reasons for this, obviously: that most people\u2019s idea of Ibiza was fixed a long time ago, the summer they turned 20, during one particularly hedonistic week they spent there getting rawly sunburned, only eating one meal in eight days and shaking Tim Westwood\u2019s hand at a urinal seconds after dropping their first ever pill. Capturing that sweat-sticky, flirting-with-the-shots-girl feeling on film is close to impossible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2020/mar/25/the-guide-staying-in-sign-up-for-our-home-entertainment-tips\">The Guide: Staying In  \u2013 sign up for our home entertainment tips</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Also, there\u2019s something inescapably <em>Ibizan</em> about Ibiza, some salty magick that leaks out from the rocks and sand, a fine film that settles over everything it touches. Much like EastEnders can only happen in the miserable confines of outer east London, and the backbiting of Emmerdale can only happen in a small town that smells of manure, so Ibiza-set programmes are necessarily shaped by the island\u2019s inherent ridiculousness.

Daniel Mays (Line of Duty, Rogue One, everything) is the one with the banana boat full of coke.

White Lines is the answer to the question nobody has ever thought to ask: what if Poirot got on the sesh?</p> <p>Curiously, for a Netflix production, White Lines defies the binge: there\u2019s so much going on \u2013 so many threads and flashbacks and days turning to night \u2013 that it\u2019s hard to consume more than an episode at a time. This feels weirdly refreshing, pulling you back from the sprint-to-the-finish watch-through like a bouncer in a smoking section. For that reason, it doesn\u2019t quite feel like it\u2019s Netflix\u2019s next discourse-shaping blockbuster. But it does prove there\u2019s still space for TV dependables: a murder that needs solving, a secret from the past that threatens the calm of the present, and people with Drama Centre Manc accents passing ecstasy around while loudly saying \u201cproper\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Domestic cats are killing an estimated 230m native Australian birds, reptiles and mammals every year, according to new research that quantifies the pet\u2019s national toll on native animals for the first time.</p> <p>Researchers said owners of Australia\u2019s 3.7m domestic cats needed to make sure their pets were indoors or contained to reduce their impact on native species.</p> <p>As well as killing native animals, pet cats were also preying on about 150m introduced animals \u2013 mostly rodents \u2013 the research found.</p> <p>Dr Sarah Legge, lead author of the <a href=\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/wr/WR19174\">study published in the journal Wildlife Research</a>, told Guardian Australia: \u201cIf we want native wildlife in our towns and cities \u2013 rather than introduced rodents and birds \u2013 then there are choices to be made.</p> <p>\u201cAll we need to do is keep pet cats contained.\u201d</p> <p>The research, funded by the Australian government\u2019s National Environmental Science Program, reviewed data from more than 60 studies on domestic cats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/18/parasitic-disease-spread-by-feral-cats-likely-to-be-killing-native-wildlife\">Parasitic disease spread by feral cats likely to be killing native wildlife</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Feral cats are a significant threat to Australia\u2019s native animals but less is known about the hunting habits of pet cats. </p> <p>There are about 2.1m feral cats in Australia, with numbers almost tripling during wet periods, said Legge. </p> <p>Understanding the impact of Australia\u2019s pet cats has been harder to track than feral cats. </p> <p>Much analysis of the eating habits of feral cats is based on analysis of the stomachs of killed cats. </p> <p>The new analysis on pet cats drew on recent studies that had used a range of techniques to understand their hunting habits, including GPS trackers, video collars, analysis of scats and surveys of owners.</p> <p>The study found each feral cat kills an average 576 native birds, mammals and reptiles per year, while pet cats kill an average of 110 native animals every year \u2013 40 reptiles, 38 birds and 32 mammals.</p> <p>In total, this meant pet cats were killing 66.9m native mammals, 79.7m native birds and 82.9m native reptiles every year.</p> <p>The study was not able to estimate the numbers of frogs and insects eaten by pet cats.</p> <p>Because pet cats live in higher densities, they were responsible for killing up to 50 times more animals per square kilometre in residential areas than feral cats killed in out-of-town areas.</p> <p>\u201cIf we accept that feral cats in the bush are a problem, then we have to accept that pet cats in town are also a problem,\u201d said Legge, of the University of Queensland.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s easier for us to manage the impacts of pet cats than feral cats. Either keep them inside, or in secure pet runs outside.\u201d</p> <p>In the study, researchers accounted for the numbers of pet cats that are contained \u2013 about 30% \u2013 but warned there could actually be more roaming pet cats.</p> <p>One study carried out in Adelaide found more than one-third of pet cats were going out at night when their owners thought they were contained.</p> <p>The study also accounted for the known difference between the prey that pet cats brought home and analysis done of pet cat scats. This suggested roaming pet cats only brought home about 15% of their prey.</p> <p>Legge said there was often an argument that pet cats helped keep rodents or sparrows under control, but she said there was little evidence to back this up.</p> <p>Legge said: \u201cAll cats will prefer a mammal if they can find one \u2013 animals like feathertail gliders, for example. For birds you could be talking about rosellas or fairy wrens. Cats will learn to stalk around bird feeders.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/08/australian-government-stops-listing-major-threats-to-species-under-environment-laws\">Australian government stops listing major threats to species under environment laws</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She said blue-tongue lizards and possums were also known prey items for pet cats. Cats that roamed at night tended to kill more mammals, while daytime roaming cats killed more reptiles and birds.</p> <p>She added: \u201cIf you have anywhere that prey animals are coming together, cats will get onto that very quickly.\u201d</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.rspca.org.au/adopt-pet/adopting-catkitten/safe-and-happy-cats\">guidance from the RSPCA</a>, cats are healthier if kept at home and away from the risk of traffic accidents, insect and snake bites and fights with other cats and dogs.</p> <p>Dr Sarah Zito, senior scientific officer for companion animals at RSPCA Australia, said: \u201cContrary to what some might believe, cats do not need to roam to be happy. Indoor cats can live longer lives, protected from all these dangers. And, if provided with everything they need, they can be just as happy at home.</p> <p>\u201cIf your cat is a hunter, keeping them safely contained at home can also help to eliminate or minimise the risk they might pose to wildlife.\u201d</p> <p>Sean Dooley, of BirdLife Australia, said the organisation welcomed the study, saying it was further confirmation that \u201cboth feral and domestic cats are a major threat to birds\u201d.</p> <p>Dooley said it was likely domestic cats were a major contributor to the decline of smaller bird species in urban environments.</p> <p>He said there was evidence an entire colony of fairy terns \u2013 a nationally listed threatened species \u2013 had been <a href=\"https://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/wildlife/2019/08/a-single-cat-wiped-out-an-entire-colony-of-fairy-terns/\">wiped out by one feral cat and a domestic cat</a> in Mandurah in Western Australia. He said the introduction of a cat curfew in Victoria\u2019s Dandenong Ranges had helped superb lyrebirds to recover there.</p> <p>Holly Parsons, BirdLife Australia\u2019s urban bird program manager, added: \u201cNot only do domestic cats have an impact on native birds, keeping your cats inside and contained is healthier for them and they live longer. We want people to enjoy both our diverse and wonderful wildlife as well as their pet companions.\u201d</p>",

Following years of financial instability, the Oaks golf club at Mollington, a couple of miles to the north of Chester, closed its doors in May 2016.

  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/26/australias-coronavirus-tracing-app-set-to-launch-today-despite-lingering-privacy-concerns\">Australian government has launched Covidsafe</a>, an app that traces every person running the app who has been in contact with someone else using the app in the previous three weeks, in a bid to automate coronavirus contact tracing and allow the easing of restrictions.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s what we know about the app so far.</p> \n<h2>How does the app work?</h2> \n<p>After you download and install the app from the Australian <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/au/app/covidsafe/id1509242894\">Apple App store</a> or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.gov.health.covidsafe\">Google Play store</a> \u2013 which you can also access from the government\u2019s Covidsafe app page <a href=\"https://www.covidsafe.gov.au/\">covidsafe.gov.au</a> or <a href=\"https://www.aus.gov.au/app\">aus.gov.au/app</a> \u2013 you\u2019ll be asked to register your name (or pseudonym), age range, postcode and phone number.</p> \n<p>That registration information is stored encrypted on a government server, and then passed on to state and territory health authorities in the event that someone you\u2019ve been in contact with has tested positive.</p> \n<p>Using Bluetooth, the app records anyone you get close to who also has the app. The two apps exchange anonymised IDs, which cycle every two hours and are stored encrypted on phones and deleted after 21 days.</p> \n<p>If someone is infected with coronavirus, they then get a unique code from a health official via SMS to use in the app to consent to upload the list of anonymised IDs for the past 21 days of contact for contact tracing. It uses signal strength and other data then to work out who needs to be contacted.</p> \n<h2>What personal data is collected?</h2> \n<p>The name you choose to provide, your age range, your phone number, and your postcode, information about your encrypted user ID, information about testing positive for coronavirus, and then the contact IDs should you consent to that being uploaded.</p> \n<p>Bluetooth data is also uploaded to the server upon testing positive in order for the government to figure out, using signal strength, which contacts need to be notified.</p> \n<h2>Who can access the data?</h2> \n<p>The data, once you consent to it being uploaded from your app at the time you test positive, will be held by the federal government on an Amazon Web Services server in Australia.</p> \n<p>Morrison said that while the data will be held by the federal government, only state health authorities charged with contact tracing will be able to access it. He says federal agencies including Centrelink, Home Affairs and others will not be able to access the data.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-app-will-australians-trust-a-government-with-a-history-of-tech-fails-and-data-breaches\">Coronavirus app: will Australians trust a government with a history of tech fails and data breaches?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Health minister Greg Hunt has written <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020L00480/Html/Text\">a direction</a> that sets out only health authorities or those maintaining the app can get access to the information. This will be backed up by <a href=\"https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/Privacy/Documents/exposure-draft-privacy-amendment-public-health-contact-information.pdf\">legislation</a> to be introduced into parliament in May.</p> \n<p>The government has said police will not be able to get the data, even with a warrant, and court orders will not be able to force the government to hand over the data \u2013 but this is not explicitly outlined in the draft legislation. </p> \n<p>The registration data will remain on the government server until the end of the pandemic, which will be declared over by the health minister, or until you request it to be deleted.</p> \n<h2>Should I be worried Amazon is holding the data?</h2> \n<p>Amazon Web Services, which is hosting the data in Australia, is one of the biggest cloud companies in the world. Given the millions of people expected to use the app and outages will make the app less effective, as well as the government\u2019s history with using AWS, it isn\u2019t surprising Amazon was chosen for the contract.</p> \n<p>The company has the <a href=\"https://awsinsight.com.au/insight/aws-protected-status/\">highest data security certification</a> for its Sydney data centre.</p> \n<p>The 2017 postal survey was supported by AWS, and the 2021 Census will be hosted by AWS.</p> \n<p>Chances are, some of your data \u2013 be it through your bank, your airline, through Netflix or any number of services \u2013 is already hosted by Amazon.</p> \n<p>The government will legislate to prevent data from the app being moved offshore, including for requests for data by the US government under laws such as the Patriot Act.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/Privacy/Documents/exposure-draft-privacy-amendment-public-health-contact-information.pdf\">draft legislation</a> makes it a crime to store the data outside Australia, or communicate the data to someone outside Australia.</p> \n<h2>Can it trace my location?</h2> \n<p>The app does not track location. The Google version of the app does seek permission for location information but that is due to permissions needed for bluetooth.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian Australia coronavirus email signup button\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Will it drain my battery?</h2> \n<p>Not significantly, however the Apple version of the app will need to be open in order for the bluetooth functionality to work.</p> \n<p>That will drain the battery more, however, the government made a change to the Apple version of the app and you can now lock your phone screen as long as the app is open when you lock it.</p> \n<p>It is understood that the federal government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/apple-google-coronavirus-us-app-privacy\">will implement the functionality developed by Apple and Google</a> in a few weeks that will eliminate this issue and allow iPhone users to have the app running in the background.</p> \n<h2>Will it be mandatory?</h2> \n<p>No. The prime minister has said consent would be key to the app, indicating it would not be mandatory, and people would share information through the app only if they consented to it.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/Privacy/Documents/exposure-draft-privacy-amendment-public-health-contact-information.pdf\">draft legislation</a> to support the app specifically makes it a crime punishable by five years in jail to force someone to download the app, and upload data from the app against their consent. It also makes it a crime to refuse service or entry or employment to people if they\u2019re not using the app.</p> \n<p>But Morrison muddied the waters somewhat when he would not entirely rule out making it mandatory.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ScottMorrisonMP/status/1251304490952605696\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The App we are working on to help our health workers trace people who have been in contact with coronavirus will not be mandatory.</p>\u2014 Scott Morrison (@ScottMorrisonMP) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScottMorrisonMP/status/1251304490952605696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 18, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cMy preference is not to do that, my preference is to give Australians the go of getting it right ...

What we\u2019re doing in fighting this fight is we\u2019ll be asking people to download an app which helps us trace the virus quickly and the more people who do that, the more we can get back to a more liveable set of arrangements.\u201d</p> \n<p>The state governments in NSW and Victoria have both indicated they will not make use of the app a condition for easing restrictions, and will not require a certain percentage of the population to be using the app before restrictions will be eased.</p> \n<p>However, since the release of the app, the federal government has urged Australians to download the app, tying download numbers of the app to the national cabinet discussion about the easing of restrictions.</p> \n<h2>Should I be worried about the privacy implications?</h2> \n<p>Always. The government has stressed it has designed the app with privacy in mind, however.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn terms of privacy, no other person can access what is on your phone,\u201d Hunt said.</p> \n<p>The health minister added it will be against the law to use the data for a purpose other than contact tracing, and the data will be kept in Australia.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt cannot leave the country. It cannot be accessed by anybody other than a state public health official. It cannot be used for any purpose other than the provision of the data for the purposes of finding people with whom you have been in close contact with and it is punishable by jail if there is a breach of that.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is no geolocation. There is no Commonwealth access and it is stored in Australia and importantly it is deleted from your phone after 21 days.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government will have a repository of the names, phone numbers and postcodes of everyone who had downloaded the app, which could be a potential honeypot, but the key data of who you\u2019ve been in contact with stays on your phone and is frequently deleted.</p> \n<p>The government has published <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/covidsafe-application-privacy-impact-assessment\">a privacy impact assessment</a> on potential concerns with the app. </p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.dta.gov.au/news/dta-publicly-releases-covidsafe-application-source-code\">source code for the app</a> has been released by the government, which can show how the app works in practice, but there are calls for the server source code (which will show what the government does with the data) to be released.</p> \n<p>You can delete the app from your phone at any time, and the government has said all the information held will be deleted from its servers at the end of the pandemic. This sunset clause is built into the legislation being introduced into parliament.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/Privacy/Documents/exposure-draft-privacy-amendment-public-health-contact-information.pdf\">draft legislation</a> sets out that the data will be deleted once Greg Hunt declares, via an instrument, that the pandemic is over.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Will police be able to access the data?</h2> \n<p>Attorney general Christian Porter told Guardian Australia regulations would be developed to ensure that police and other government agencies would not be able to access the data.</p> \n<p>\u201cLaw enforcement agencies will not be provided access to information collected via the app,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cSpecific regulatory action will be taken to prevent such access for law enforcement agencies at both the Commonwealth and state/territory level.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government has already made the decision not to make any information collected by the app available for other purposes, including law enforcement investigations.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/04/government-releases-draft-legislation-for-covidsafe-tracing-app-to-allay-privacy-concerns\">Government releases draft legislation for Covidsafe tracing app to allay privacy concerns</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/Privacy/Documents/exposure-draft-privacy-amendment-public-health-contact-information.pdf\">draft legislation</a> does not explicitly rule out access via warrant or court order, however access for purposes outside of contact tracing has been made a crime.</p> \n<h2>Is the app even working yet?</h2> \n<p>If you have the app running on your phone as per the guidelines, it is collecting the contact data and storing it on your phone.

Charities are allowed to exclude government revenue from the turnover test.</p></li> \n <li><p>Universities are not entitled to the lower threshold applied to charities. On 24 April the government ruled that universities must count commonwealth grants funding towards their revenue, and on 30 April that they must count six months of revenue when calculating their projected downturn, rather than one month or three as for other institutions.

Partnerships are eligible but can only claim on behalf of one partner and the employees of the business.</p> \n<p>On 24 April the government announced special purpose services entities would be subject to a modified turnover test, measuring the revenue decline of the related entities using the services of the employer entity.</p> \n<p>Eligible employees:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Were employed by an eligible employer at 1 March 2020</p></li> \n <li><p>Can be sole traders, full-time, part-time, or long-term casuals employed on a regular basis for longer than 12 months as at 1 March 2020.</p></li> \n <li><p>Are at least 16 years of age, but those aged 16 or 17 must be financially independent to qualify</p></li> \n <li><p>Are an Australian citizen, the holder of a permanent visa, a protected special category visa, a non-protected special category visa who has been residing continually in Australia for 10 years or more, or a New Zealander on a special category (subclass 444) visa.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>The government estimates that 6 million workers will receive this payment. Gig economy workers will be covered, as they are sole traders.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday 28 April <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/treasury-officials-defend-delay-in-rollout-of-130bn-jobkeeper-scheme\">Treasury officials said</a> that 540,000 employers had formally registered for the jobkeeper wage subsidy scheme, covering an estimated 3.3m employees.</p> \n<h2>What if I am on a temporary visa?</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/scott-morrison\">Scott Morrison</a> explained that New Zealanders on 444 visas would get the payment because \u201cthey are part of an ongoing economy in Australia\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are about keeping them part of it economy because they are part of what happens on the other side,\u201d he told reporters in Canberra.</p> \n<p>The government has announced it will allow backpackers to extend their stay in Australia and most temporary visa holders to access superannuation payments early.</p> \n<p>Seasonal workers will be exempt from a rule that normally prevents them from staying with the same employer for more than six months.</p> \n<p>Any seasonal workers will have to self-isolate for 14 days before they start working in regional communities.</p> \n<h2>How will it be paid?</h2> \n<p>Eligible employers will have to pay $1,500 per fortnight per eligible employee from 30 March 2020, and will be reimbursed monthly in arrears starting from 1 May.</p> \n<p>Employers have until 8 May to make payments for April, but can join the scheme at any time. Jobkeeper is legislated to continue for up to six months.</p> \n<p>Eligible employees will receive from their employers a minimum of $1,500 per fortnight, before tax. Employers are able to top up the payment.</p> \n<h2>Will I receive $1,500 even if I ordinarily earn less?</h2> \n<p>If an employee ordinarily receives less than $1,500 in income per fortnight before tax, their employer must pay them, at a minimum, $1,500 per fortnight, before tax. It is therefore possible for a long-term casual or part-time worker to receive more than their ordinary pay.</p> \n<p>However, employers have gained new powers to change the ordinary hours, duties and location of work, meaning they may vary work to match the $1,500 payment. They cannot vary workers\u2019 ordinary rate of pay.</p> \n<h2>What if I was stood down or sacked?</h2> \n<p>If an employee has been stood down, their employer must pay their employee, at a minimum, $1,500 per fortnight, before tax.</p> \n<p>This means that employees of businesses that shut down due to various restrictions \u2013 such as cafes, restaurants, theatres, casino workers and the like \u2013 will continue to be paid even if they are not working.</p> \n<p>If an employee was employed on 1 March 2020, subsequently ceased employment with their employer, and then has been re-engaged by the same eligible employer, the employee will also receive, at a minimum, $1,500 per fortnight, before tax.</p> \n<p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said this payment \u201cchanges the equation\u201d and he expects employers who were forced to lay off workers may now \u201cput them back on the books\u201d.</p> \n<h2>When will it start being paid?</h2> \n<p>The subsidy will be backdated to start on 30 March, with the first payments to be received by employers in the first week of May.</p> \n<p>In the meantime, employers must pay their employees $1,500 fortnightly and then claim the money from the first week of May.</p> \n<p>Jobkeeper operates with a one-in all-in principle, meaning that once an employer decides to participate it must pay jobkeeper to all eligible employees who complete nomination forms.</p> \n<h2>What about superannuation?</h2> \n<p>Employers must continue to pay the superannuation guarantee on regular wages but it is up to employer whether they pay superannuation on additional jobkeeper payments.</p> \n<p>For example, a worker who ordinarily receives $1,000 a fortnight plus superannuation will receive the $1,500 jobkeeper payment, with superannuation paid on the first $1,000 and the employer able to decide whether to pay it on the last $500.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Can I get the jobkeeper and other payments?</h2> \n<p>On 30 March, Scott Morrison said a person receiving the jobkeeper payment could not also receive the jobseeker payment (formerly Newstart).</p> \n<p>On 20 April, a spokesperson for the Department of Social Services clarified that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of people could not receive both payments because the $1,500 a fortnight jobkeeper payment \u201cexceeds the typical income limit for jobseeker which is $1,086.50\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, some people may qualify for both because jobkeeper counts as \u201cordinary income\u201d and there are categories of jobseeker recipients, such as single parents, with <a href=\"https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/jobseeker-payment/how-much-you-can-get/income-and-asset-limits\">a higher income threshold</a>.</p> \n<p>People who have already applied for jobseeker can withdraw and shift to jobkeeper payments if they are re-engaged by their employer.</p> \n<p>A person cannot be in receipt of jobkeeper payments from two or more employers.</p> \n<h2>What about eligibility for jobseeker payments?</h2> \n<p>Eligibility has been expanded.

  "<p> A troubled super fund run by an offshoot of the Commonwealth Bank has had the highest proportion of withdrawals under Josh Frydenberg\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/22/australia-is-easing-superannuation-access-for-those-worst-hit-by-coronavirus-but-can-we-afford-it\">coronavirus early access scheme</a>, according to data compiled by Guardian Australia.</p> \n<p>Smaller superannuation funds appear to be hardest hit by applications for early release of super, the data suggests.</p> \n<p>The average amount people using the scheme have so far drawn out is about $8,000. You are allowed to draw a maximum of $10,000 before 30 June and another $10,000 after that.</p> \n<p>The Guardian has drawn together data about early releases <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/23/early-release-super-coronavirus-when-access-superannuation-how-impact-your-money\">so far applied for under the scheme</a>, released this week by the prudential regulator, and data about the size and memberships of funds released last year to figure out which have taken the biggest hit.</p> \n<p>You can look up your fund using our interactive widget below.</p> \n<p>The data isn\u2019t perfect, because the fund size data dates from June 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic wiped about 30% from global share markets.</p> \n<p>How much of a hit any individual super fund has taken from the worldwide stock market rout depends on how it invested its assets, which varies from fund to fund.</p> \n<p>However, hospitality industry fund Hostplus, which on the Guardian\u2019s figures saw 1.4% of its assets redeemed under the scheme, said its withdrawals were about 1.5% so far \u2013 a very close match.</p> \n<p>Readers can also check to see what percentage of members have asked for early release. Leading the table for drawdowns was Commonwealth Essential Super, a $3.8bn fund that has lost about 5.4% of its value to coronavirus early withdrawals.</p> \n<p>Problems with the fund, which is closed to new members, were raised at the banking royal commission and it is the subject of a class action against the bank over the low rates paid to members who chose to invest in cash.</p> \n<p>The fund is managed by CBA division Colonial First State, which the bank is in the process of selling.</p> \n<p>A CFS spokeswoman said the average member balance in the fund was about $18,000.</p> \n<p>She said that across all the funds managed by CFS requests for early access have totalled about 65,000, or 7% of super customers, for a dollar value of about $473m, she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cColonial First State\u2019s investment approach has always favoured investing in assets that have a high level of liquidity,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis approach has proven its value with the early release scheme. As the largest account based pension provider in Australia, we are accustomed to managing liquidity for significant payments on a regular basis.\u201d</p> \n<p>Second-ranked fund by percentage of drawdowns was the small Sharia-compliant Crescent Wealth <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/australia-news/superannuation-australia\">Superannuation</a> Fund, with drawdowns totalling 2.3%. It couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.</p> \n<p>And third was Queensland industry fund Intrust, a $2.8bn fund that saw 2.2% of its assets redeemed. It also could not be reached.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1eWniNkfVaLgFSVzlwywJ_oby-cNqycMXZgFahGFlRmQ\" data-alt=\"super fund table\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1eWniNkfVaLgFSVzlwywJ_oby-cNqycMXZgFahGFlRmQ\">super fund table</a> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2018/03/interactive-enhancer-master-aus\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/05/iframe-fix\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>"
