One of the effects is that gradually more people become immune to the virus, which will eventually lead to herd immunity, as is the case for other viral infections. As we are dealing with a newly emerged virus, WHO correctly states that there is no certainty about the development of immunity against COVID-19, or about how long this immunity will last.

Greece is preparing to lift restrictions on movements to the islands. European stock markets have rallied. </p> <h2><strong>Boris Johnson says the UK is beginning to turn the tide </strong></h2> <p>The prime minister said the UK is turning the tide on tackling coronavirus but is still facing a moment of \u201cmaximum risk\u201d and he will not be forced to end the lockdown prematurely. Speaking outside 10 Downing Street on Monday, his first day back after recovering from coronavirus, he urged the public and business to contain their impatience to lift the restrictions. </p> <h2><strong>Iran announces 96 more deaths </strong></h2> <p>A further 96 people have died of coronavirus in Iran taking its death toll to 5,806, the ministry of heath announced. But Iran plans to go ahead with reopening of mosques in areas where the virus has not struck. </p> <h2>Russia has passed China in the number of new infections </h2> <p>Russia has confirmed 6,198 new coronavirus cases over the past day, bringing the total number in the country to 87,147 in all regions, the anti-coronavirus crisis centre reported on Monday. This is more than the 84,500 confirmed cases in China. Meanwhile, China has denied it is spreading disinformation about the virus. </p> <h2><strong>New Zealand prepares to move out of its strict lockdown measures</strong></h2> <p>The government reported only one new confirmed case of Covid-19 and said it had eliminated the virus. At 11.59pm on Monday, New Zealand will lift its level-4 lockdown which has been in place for more than four weeks. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said the nation had \u201cwon the battle\u201d against widespread community transmission.</p> <h2><strong>More US states to end lockdown as economy crumbles</strong></h2> <p>Colorado, Mississippi, Minnesota, Montana and Tennessee will join other US states in the lifting of lockdown restrictions, as economists predict an unemployment rate of 16% or higher for the month of April. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said some regions of the state might qualify to open sooner \u201cwith certain precautions\u201d, such as upstate New York, as the daily death toll was markedly lower on Sunday than it was on Saturday.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-27T11:04:45.098Z\">at 12.04pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ea6ac0d8f0845d1c895e6b1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-27T10:00:37.404Z\">11.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Iran announces 96 more deaths</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A further 96 people have died of coronavirus in <strong>Iran,</strong> taking its death toll to 5,806 the ministry of heath announced.

At least 206,549 people have lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic, though the true toll is likely to be much higher due to under-reporting and some countries not including deaths among those with underlying conditions in their tolls.</li> <li><strong>New Zealand prepares to move out of its strict lockdown measures. </strong>The government reported only one new confirmed case of Covid-19 and said it had eliminated the virus. At 11.59pm on Monday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/new-zealand-prepares-to-lift-strict-lockdown-after-eliminating-coronavirus\">New Zealand will lift its level-4 lockdown</a> which has been in place for more than four weeks. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said the nation had \u201cwon the battle\u201d against widespread community transmission.</li> <li><strong>More US states to end lockdown as economy crumbles. </strong>Colorado, Mississippi, Minnesota, Montana and Tennessee will join other US states in the lifting of lockdown restrictions, as economists predict an unemployment rate of 16% or higher for the month of April. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said some regions of the state might qualify to open sooner \u201cwith certain precautions\u201d, such as upstate New York, as the daily death toll was markedly lower on Sunday than it was on Saturday.</li> <li><strong>The UK economy will take three years to recover from coronavirus. </strong>It will take the UK economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/27/uk-economy-will-take-three-years-to-recover-from-coronavirus-ey\">three years to fully recover</a> from the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a leading forecasting group. As the damage to jobs and growth unfolds, the EY Item Club said it would take until 2023 for the the economy to return to the level reached at the end of last year due to the depth of the crisis, Richard Partington reports.</li> <li><strong>British PM returns to Downing Street. </strong>Boris Johnson returned to Downing Street on Sunday night for the first time since he was admitted to hospital with Covid-19 on 6 April. The UK reported its lowest daily rise in the death toll since the end of March. The number of deaths in UK hospitals from the coronavirus has risen to 20,732 \u2013 an increase of 413 in the last 24 hours</li> <li><strong>Trump denies he will fire his health chief. </strong>US president Donald Trump, who for a second day skipped the White House press briefing, on Twitter denied reports that he planned to fire health and human services secretary Alex Azar. He said Azar was doing \u201can excellent job!\u201d. Trump also attacked the press, and was roundly mocked after tweeting about \u201cNoble\u201d prize for journalists, seeming to mean the Nobel prizes \u2013 which are not awarded in the field of journalism.</li> <li><strong>Lebanon\u2019s roads blocked in protest at dire economy. </strong>Demonstrators blocked roads through Lebanon late on Sunday to protest against the deteriorating economic situation, despite a lockdown and curfew imposed because of the coronavirus. Lebanon\u2019s worst economic crisis since the 1975-90 civil war is now compounded by the coronavirus lockdown. Forty-five per cent of the population are in poverty, according to official estimates. Its economy is forecast to contract 12% in 2020, according to the International Monetary Fund.</li> <li><strong>A million Australians downloaded a coronavirus tracking app. </strong>Health minister Greg Hunt said 1.13 million Australians downloaded the tracing app CovidSafe as of 6am (20.00 GMT) on Monday, nearly 4.5% of the country\u2019s population. </li> <li><strong>European countries announce easing of lockdown measures. </strong>Italy recorded lowest daily deaths since mid-March and prime minister Giuseppe Conte told the nation \u201cif you love Italy, maintain distance\u201d as he announced a plan that will see the country slowly ease lockdown measures from 4 May. The prime minister of France, Edouard Philippe, will on Tuesday present a national strategy for emerging from the coronavirus lockdown to the national assembly, while Spain partially relaxed its lockdown as its daily death toll dropped below 300 for the first time in weeks.</li> <li><strong>Egypt asks IMF for coronavirus bailout loan. </strong>Egypt declared on Sunday that it had asked the International Monitory Fund (IMF) for financial assistance to deal with the economic fallout caused by the coronavirus.

For Karan Gokani, director of <a href=\"https://www.hopperslondon.com/\">Hoppers in London</a>, specialists in south Indian and Sri Lankan cuisine, the main concern with frozen seafood is its quality. \u201cThere\u2019s a niggle in our minds that it\u2019s second rate, but you can get fantastic products these days, and it\u2019s<strong> </strong>undeniably useful when it\u2019s hard to buy fresh.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s not wrong there, but even so, an unnaturally uniform frozen cod portion is never going to compare with a prime fillet, so, yes, you do have to use it slightly differently. \u201cFrozen is especially useful in fish cakes, pies and curries \u2013 anything that\u2019s a bit forgiving,\u201d Gokani says. \u201cIt also benefits from being paired with strong flavours. Obviously, don\u2019t cook from frozen \u2013 defrost it fully first.\u201d Try telling that to my mother: one of her signature dishes is frozen white fish baked on a base of onion, garlic, peppers and tomato<strong> </strong>until it\u2019s no longer crunchy, and the memory sends me all Prousty.</p> <p>Rick Toogood of <a href=\"http://prawnonthelawn.com/\">Prawn on the Lawn</a> in Padstow and London agrees that punchy flavours are the way to go. \u201cFrozen fish isn\u2019t my specialist subject, but there\u2019s a time and a place for everything. Jazz up fish pie mix, say, by poaching it in milk until just underdone, add a spoonful of Thai green curry or madras curry paste \u2013 for me that means <a href=\"https://www.pataks.ca/products/madras-curry-paste\">Patak\u2019s</a> \u2013 top with a coriander mash and bake. The topping doesn\u2019t <em>have</em> to be spuds, either: swede would work brilliantly here.\u201d Add oomph to your fishcakes, too: \u201cPoach the fish in milk, cook potatoes in the same milk, mash with dill, gherkins, mustard and lemon zest, combine with the fish, then breadcrumb and cook until golden.\u201d</p> <p>Frozen shellfish also benefits from robust accompaniments \u2013 prawns especially. \u201cCoat in desiccated coconut, deep-fry and serve with sweet chilli sauce for quick coconut prawns,\u201d Toogood advises. \u201cOr give big ones the ceviche treatment \u2013 red onion, chilli, tomato, lime juice and salt.\u201d As for those bags of mixed frozen mussels, squid and prawns, they\u2019re ideal in a cheat\u2019s bouillabaisse, he says, and if you have a frozen fillet to add to the pot, so much the better: \u201cSoften onion and garlic with some thyme, add white wine, saffron, if you have it, a tin of tomatoes, season and cook down, then add the seafood and cook through.\u201d</p> <p>Frozen white fish is also fantastic burger material, Toogood says: \u201cYou can\u2019t go wrong with a breaded fillet packed in a bun with lettuce, slaw, gherkin and lime pickle mixed with mayo \u2013 which is genius stuff, by the way.\u201d Or smear wholegrain mustard on a frozen fillet, wrap in foil and bake. \u201cThat\u2019s so, so simple, and mega-tasty.\u201d</p> <p>So much for this not being Toogood\u2019s specialist subject \u2026 though he does fail to mention the finest frozen fish product of all: fish fingers \u2013 served, of course, in white bread with an obligatory dollop of salad cream.

But he also pledged to \u201cfire up the engines of this vast UK economy\u201d as soon as it is safe to do so.</p> <p>No 10 previously had little time for either business groups such as the CBI \u2013 which it regarded as a hotbed of remainers \u2013 or the trades unions.</p> <p>Yet, since the onset of the crisis, both groups have been closely involved in drawing up chancellor Rishi Sunak\u2019s economic rescue package \u2013 and they are now helping to prepare the ground for what Johnson called the \u201crefining\u201d of lockdown restrictions.</p> <p>While Tory donors and backbenchers have been calling for economic activity to resume as soon as possible, polling suggests strong support for lockdown measures remains, and government insiders pointed to so-called \u201cover-compliance\u201d with the restrictions already in place.</p> <p>When schools were ordered to stay open for key workers\u2019 children, ministers expected perhaps a fifth of pupils to attend \u2013 but the actual figure has been just 1% as concerned parents have kept the vast majority at home.</p> <p>Getting schools up and running again \u2013 and persuading parents their children will be safe \u2013 is regarded by ministers as a necessary precondition for allowing many people to return to work. Schools are not expected to reopen fully until June, after the spring half-term.</p> <p>In a characteristically upbeat statement delivered outside Downing Street two weeks after he was discharged from hospital following intensive care treatment for coronavirus, Johnson compared the virus to \u201can unexpected and invisible mugger\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle it to the floor and so it follows that this is the moment of opportunity. This is the moment when we can press home our advantage. It is also the moment of maximum risk,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He said it was too soon to say when the lockdown measures would be altered. Addressing those calling for an early lifting of the restrictions, he said: \u201cI entirely share your urgency. It\u2019s the government\u2019s urgency and yet we must also recognise the risk of a second spike; the risk of losing control of that virus.</p> <p>\u201cThat would mean not only a new wave of death and disease but also an economic disaster and we would be forced once again to slam on the brakes across the whole country and the whole economy, and reimpose restrictions in such a way as to do more and lasting damage.\u201d</p> <p>The government\u2019s scientific advisers are working to model the potential impact on R0 \u2013 the infection rate of the virus \u2013 of lifting different restrictions. The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said on Monday it was not yet clear how much difference reopening schools would make, for example.</p> <p>He said the Sage committee of scientists, of which he is a member, would present ministers with estimates of the impact of various measures in the coming days \u2013 allowing the politicians to make decisions of how to adjust the lockdown.</p> <p>Echoing the language used by Dominic Raab, deputising for the prime minister, on Sunday, Johnson said the government would \u201crefine\u201d the stringent distancing restrictions imposed on 23 March, which are due to be reviewed by Thursday next week.</p> <p>Conservative campaign chief Isaac Levido is involved in the task of replacing the government\u2019s \u201cStay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives\u201d slogan with a more nuanced message for what Johnson repeatedly called the \u201csecond phase\u201d of the crisis.</p> <p>Sunak disclosed on Monday that 4m workers had been furloughed under the government\u2019s unprecedented job retention scheme, in which the taxpayer underwrote the costs of paying staff wages as they are temporarily laid off.</p> <p>He also announced the creation of a new loans scheme for the smallest businesses, which will be 100% guaranteed by the government.</p> <p>Johnson stressed his determination to build a consensus over future measures, saying he would include opposition parties in his deliberations.</p> <p>Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has so far adopted a cautiously supportive approach to the government\u2019s handling of the crisis, while pressing ministers on specific issues including testing and the availability of personal protective equipment for frontline health workers.</p> <p>Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: \u201cProtecting workers\u2019 safety and rebuilding the economy must go hand in hand.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we have called on government to set up a national recovery council with unions and employers. Any business that refuses to put in place safe systems of work should face the threat of prosecution.\u201d</p> <p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced on Monday that some hospital treatment halted because of the virus, including cancer care, will now be progressively resumed. Presenting the daily Downing Street press conference, Hancock stressed that the NHS remained open, and urged the public to continue to make use of it as usual.</p> <p>Ministers are concerned that while it has suppressed Covid-19 cases, the lockdown is creating its own risks to public health because people are anxious about going to hospital with other conditions.</p> <p>\u201cOur message is that the NHS is open: help us to help you,\u201d Hancock said. He urged members of the public suffering chest pains, or who fear they may be having a stroke or heart attack, to use A&amp;E.</p>",

And I\u2019m sure they will help a lot of families. But they shouldn\u2019t distract from the key issues around PPE, including the continuing shortages - real attention should be given to that - the distribution of it and how the guidelines are formed, followed and interpreted [by hospitals].</p> <p>\u201cThere needs to be accountability over the guidelines.

It is more relevant to my sister in-law and nephew who don\u2019t want to speak to the media but on their behalf would welcome any contribution from the government to recognise the sacrifice loved ones made not just now but throughout whole time working for the NHS.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cBut what is more important is that the government appreciate doctors and nurses going forward. They have had a hard time for the last 15-20 years \u2013 they had a 1% cap on [the] limit for salaries, and they tried to lift that and the current government voted against that. There is nothing more noble than what they do, everything for [the] benefit of others, but so harshly treated \u2026 We hope to see something long-term for their benefit, large increases in their salaries.\u201d</p> <p>There were also worries about the scheme. The family of Donald Suelto, 51, who died alone after treating a patient infected with coronavirus at Hammersmith hospital in London, said that they hope they would qualify despite failing to get his death certificate.</p> <p>\u201cWe can prove Donald died of Covid-19 but we are struggling at the moment to get his death certificate,\u201d said Ian Robertson, the husband of Suelto\u2019s niece Emylene Suelto Robertson. \u201cI fear the government will make it hard for people to prove they deserve the money, there will be some nurses who died in the community who will not get the \u00a360,000. I am not trying to be negative. It\u2019s good but I am worried it will be hard for families to get it.\u201d</p> <p>Hancock said that 82 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">NHS</a> workers and 16 social care staff have died during the pandemic. A Guardian count has recorded 119 deaths of health professionals while Nursing Notes, a platform run by nurses for others in the profession, has found that at least 134 health and care workers have died of coronavirus.</p> <p>The website has been recording all deaths since the outbreak began, verifying all the information they receive using a number of independent sources and permissions sought from family, friends or colleagues.</p> <p>Hancock has repeatedly been challenged over whether frontline workers have adequate PPE to prevent them from contracting the disease.</p> <p>Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, where he announced an increase of 360 in the number of hospital deaths from the virus, Hancock said the NHS had been able to make treatment available to everyone who needed it, throughout the crisis.</p> <p>He said the government wanted to do \u201ceverything that we can\u201d to support families dealing with bereavement. \u201cI feel a deep personal sense of duty that we must care for their loved ones.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are also looking at which other groups of key workers that applies to who don\u2019t have a scheme already in place.\u201d</p> <p>Donna Kinnair, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), said: \u201cNo amount of cash can make up for a family member who passes away but financial security should never add to the worries of those in grief.</p> <p>\u201cThe RCN and other health unions fought for this government announcement and we will examine the detail closely. It must be easily accessed, open to those in social care and primary care too and be paid promptly \u2013 no family should face a lengthy or complex process.\u201d</p> <p>Shadow health minister Justin Madders said: \u201cIt is welcome that the government has listened to workforce representatives and ensured that death-in-service benefits are available to everyone working in the NHS and social care sector.</p> <p>\u201cNow the government must finally get a grip over PPE supplies so that NHS and care staff aren\u2019t putting their lives on the line to do their job and protect the rest of us.\u201d</p>",

Asked about the likely overall death toll, he said: </li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My view, actually, is we need to view this epidemic over the long run, and this has got a very long way to run.</p> \n   <p>I\u2019m really cautious about putting out these kind of absolute numbers, because this could go in a lot of different ways over the next many months until such time as we have a clear exit that has a vaccine or drugs or some other route that allows us to be able to say we now can stop people dying from this. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And later he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This has got a very long way to run. Just thinking about the first peak, which due to the fantastic work the whole nation has done and the work of the NHS we have actually managed to go through - we have still got some way before it is falling right off - but there is a long, long way to go beyond that. And I think it\u2019s a big mistake, in my view, just to consider just the first phase. We need to consider the epidemic as a whole. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Ministers insist their priority at the moment is to avoid a second peak.

Of course, nothing replaces the loss of a loved one but we want to do everything we can to support families who are dealing with this grief.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The scheme could be extended to other frontline workers, he said.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock said some NHS services which had been paused due to the coronavirus outbreak will be restored from tomorrow.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the government would be able to run a contact tracing system with 100,000 coronavirus tests (the government\u2019s target for the end of this week) being carried out a day.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said there were 3,190 spare critical care beds - adding \u201c42% of oxygen-supported beds in the NHS now lie empty\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He did not rule out the government introducing quarantine for travellers arriving in Britain in the next phase of the crisis.</strong> According to the Sunday Telegraph, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/04/25/two-weeks-quarantine-travelling-uk/\">the government may put new arrivals in quarantine for 14 days. </a>Asked about the proposal, Hancock did not deny it was an option. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Given the current level of infections, level of new cases in the UK, and the very low amounts of international travel that\u2019s going on right now, it is clear that the impact on the epidemic as a whole of the number of people coming through the borders as a proportion is very low.</p> \n   <p>But as we bring the number of new cases down in the UK, that proportion coming from those who are travelling internationally will rise.

A total of 321 inmates are confirmed to have contracted coronavirus as of 5pm on Saturday, and 15 have died, the justice secretary has confirmed. As many as 293 prison staff have also tested positive for Covid-19 in 53 jails and five have died.</p> \n  <p>All offenders must pass a risk assessment before their release is approved. But plans to release a \u201csignificant number\u201d over the last week had to be put on hold after six inmates were released by mistake due to an \u201cadministrative error\u201d before being returned to prison, the MoJ said.</p> \n  <p>Answering questions in the House of Commons on Monday, <strong>Justice Secretary Robert Buckland</strong> said: \u201cProgress has, I admit, been careful and slow, but we have reached a position now where, also taking into account the release of pregnant women, a total of 33 prisoners have been released.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s a scheme that I did not embark upon lightly, it is the result of very careful risk assessment, so that we want to minimise any risk to the public, and of course it\u2019s coupled with the reduction that we\u2019ve seen in prison places and prison capacity of about 3,000, which to my judgment and the judgment of those who advise me, is already making a big difference in creating the space that we need in order to increase compartmentalisation and to reduce the spread of the virus.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In another plan, low-risk offenders could be moved into temporary prison cells in the grounds of seven jails so fewer are sharing. Prison charities have launched legal action against the Justice Secretary, claiming measures taken so far to address coronavirus behind bars are \u201cunlawful\u201d because they will have a \u201cmanifestly insufficient impact\u201d.

The letter states:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The three-month time limit for bringing a discrimination or harassment claim is one of the shortest limitation periods for any kind of civil case. The argument for such a limit \u2013 that it encourages the prompt resolution of workplace disputes \u2013 cannot be maintained in current conditions.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The pandemic is making it difficult for those who allege they have been unfairly discriminated against or dismissed to pursue claims. Many law firms have furloughed staff and advice agencies have had to restrict or halt advice clinics during lockdown. The letter adds: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As the time limit for harassment and discrimination cases runs from what the tribunal concludes is the last unlawful act, this puts individuals without the benefit of specialist legal advice at a particular disadvantage, as they may not be able to identify when their time will run out ...

For example, Johnson has, [Johnson\u2019s biographer Andrew] Gimson told me, always preferred doing \u201ca lot of things imperfectly than one thing perfectly,\u201d choosing to press ahead on the basis of imperfect information rather than waiting until all the facts are clear. In the days and weeks ahead, this carries the risk of overreaching and overpromising \u2013 of moving too quickly based on information that confirms things he wants to be true, but might not be. Of course, this is also a reality of being in charge: As Henry Kissinger has observed, the skill of leadership is to make marginal decisions with imperfect information before others are comfortable doing so, taking a calculated gamble and being willing to stand alone first.</p> \n   <p>Today, the reality of the situation is that when Johnson was admitted to the hospital on 5 April, the death toll in Britain was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-toll/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-by-621-to-4934-idUSKBN21N0JO\">4,934</a>.

This compares to those aged 40-59 years, who made up 39% of admissions to critical care units, but only constituted 8% of all hospital deaths ...</p> \n   <p>Among the elderly aged 80 or more years there was a peak of deaths on April 8, but there is far less evidence of a subsequent sustained decline in numbers of deaths in this group.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Prof David Leon</strong>, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who led the research, said:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The fact a peak may have been reached on April 8 is not an argument for relaxing social contact.

A second attendee said they were shocked when Cummings first began participating in Sage discussions, in February, because they believed the group should be providing \u201cunadulterated scientific data\u201d without any political input.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-27T11:25:56.922Z\">at 12.25pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea6bc188f0845d1c895e75a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rorycarroll\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-27T11:04:18.940Z\">12.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A loophole in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland\">Ireland</a>\u2019s lockdown laws means police cannot detain visitors from Northern Ireland, raising concern that some people may cross the border and defy physical distancing regulations.</p> \n  <p>Garda\u00ed have been ordered not to arrest anyone from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a> because they have no powers of enforcement over people who do not live in the republic, <a href=\"https://www.rte.ie/news/2020/0425/1134822-garda-headquarters-restrictions/?utm_source=xtremepush&amp;utm_medium=webpush&amp;utm_campaign=Garda%C3%AD+cannot+arrest+Northern+Ireland+day-trippers+for+breaches+of+Covid-19+restrictions%2C+RT%C3%89+learns+%28xtremepush+%2323759747%29&amp;utm_term=notification+%23277021357_1030641281&amp;utm_content=A\">RT\u00c9 reported</a>.</p> \n  <p>The disclosure prompted concern from politicians and residents in Donegal and other border counties that Northern Ireland residents frustrated at the UK\u2019s continued lockdown may visit holiday homes and tour beauty spots in the republic.</p> \n  <p>Residents in the republic are chafing at a ban on travelling more than 2km from home and would bristle at any sign of cross-border visitors taking advantage of the loophole.</p> \n  <p>Sinn F\u00e9in said the loophole reinforced the need for an all-island response to the coronavirus pandemic.

In the three weeks while Johnson has been off work, Dominic Raab, who has been deputising for him, has not given this sort of commitment. The Scottish government <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/strategy-plan/2020/04/coronavirus-covid-19-framework-decision-making/documents/coronavirus-covid-19-framework-decision-making/coronavirus-covid-19-framework-decision-making/govscot%3Adocument/coronavirus-covid-19-framework-decision-making.pdf?forceDownload=true\">(here)</a> and the Welsh government <a href=\"https://gov.wales/sites/default/files/publications/2020-04/leading-wales-out-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic.pdf\">(here)</a> have both published discussion papers about the issues to be considered as the lockdown gets lifted and Downing Street may be stung by the criticism that it is not consulting the public properly in a similar way. A good example is <a href=\"https://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/news/statement-covid-19-and-the-basics-of-democratic-governance\">this statement</a> from the <strong>Nuffield Council on Bioethics</strong> at the weekend. It says citizens\u2019 assemblies should be used to help determine the path forward.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson claimed that preparations were underway for the easing of the lockdown. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can tell you now that preparations are under way, and have been for weeks, to allow us to win phase two of this fight, as I believe we are now on track to prevail in phase one.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He did not elaborate, but he will have been referring to things like the ramping up of testing, and the introduction of contact tracing system.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He presented the government\u2019s fight against coronavirus so far as a success. He said:</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We defied so many predictions. We did not run out of ventilators or ICU beds, we did not allow our NHS to collapse, and on the contrary we have so far collectively shielded our NHS so that our incredible doctors and nurses and healthcare staff have been able to shield all of us from an outbreak that would have been far worse, and we collectively flattened the peak.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is one interpretation of events. An alternative view is that the UK has one of the worst coronavirus death rates in Europe, perhaps because it implemented the lockdown later than other countries, and that the government has been behind the curve in implementing testing and stockpiling PPE.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson stressed that he understood the pressure from business for the lockdown to be eased.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>So let me say directly also to British business, to the shopkeepers, to the entrepreneurs, to the hospitality sector, to everyone on whom our economy depends: I understand your impatience, I share your anxiety, and I know that without our private sector without the drive and commitment of the wealth creators of this country there will be no economy to speak of, there will be no cash to pay for our public services no way of funding our NHS, and yes I can see the long term consequences of lock down as clearly as anyone.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This passage seemed to be addressed in particular to Johnson\u2019s colleagues in the Conservative party. \u201cI still a free-market Tory,\u201d he was telling them - while failing to offer them any actual concessions on policy.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He depicted coronavirus as a mugger.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If this virus were a physical assailant, an unexpected and invisible mugger, which I can tell you from personal experience it is, then this is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle it to the floor, and so it follows that this is the moment of opportunity, this is the moment when we can press home our advantage.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He thanks the public for their contribution so far.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Once again, I want to thank you, the people of this country, for the sheer grit and guts, you have shown and are continuing to show.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Every ministerial public statement now contains a passage of thanks to the public like this.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He ended by saying the UK could come out of this stronger.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If we can show the same spirit of unity and determination as we have all shown in the past six weeks, then I have absolutely no doubt that we will beat it together, we will come through this all the faster, and the United Kingdom, will emerge stronger than ever before.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson speeches almost always contain passage of evidence-free utopianism like this one. At a press conference last month he said he was often accused of being \u201cunnecessarily boosterish\u201d. Today\u2019s speech showed that, despite his illness, he has not really changed.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ab5795e02480b12d4f56f861cd366ce8f7361a0\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ab5795e02480b12d4f56f861cd366ce8f7361a0/0_384_7586_4555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaking in Downing Street this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson speaking in Downing Street this morning.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-27T11:28:36.649Z\">at 12.28pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea6a9e48f0845d1c895e6a1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/damiancarrington\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-27T09:46:38.388Z\">10.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The coronavirus pandemic is likely to be followed by even more deadly and destructive disease outbreaks unless their root cause \u2013 the rampant destruction of the natural world \u2013 is rapidly halted, the world\u2019s leading <strong>biodiversity </strong>experts have warned.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThere is a single species responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 us,\u201d they said. \u201cRecent pandemics are a direct consequence of human activity, particularly our global financial and economic systems that prize economic growth at any cost.

The difference is that this time the repercussions have been felt outside its borders.</p> <p>It has accelerated the clear shift towards a more hostile view of China across the political spectrum, albeit fuelled in the US by outright hawks in the Trump administration. Hopes that China might one day pursue political reform have been erased by its <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/01/14/china-backlash-against-increasing-repression\" title=\"\">increasing repression</a> at home and hardball tactics abroad. Countries worldwide have been taking heed. The UK had already moved away from the \u201cgolden relationship\u201d that David Cameron and George Osborne pursued with apparent indifference to the cost. Now senior Conservatives want a fundamental <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b1dfb7b5-5140-4408-abc0-7d0b7f783a58\" title=\"\">reset</a>, while UK spy agencies are, more cautiously, calling for a reassessment.</p> <p>Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-16/no-business-as-usual-with-china-after-coronavirus-u-k-says\" title=\"\">warned</a> this month that after coronavirus there can be no return to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d with China. The outbreak has shown how serious and widespread the ramifications of suppressing information can be. On the economic front, the scramble to obtain personal protective equipment has underlined the recklessness of a dependence on any one country for manufacturing.</p> <p>Beijing\u2019s successful attempts to change the narrative, to dilute domestic anger, have caused fury. Diplomats and state media have touted conspiracies suggesting that the US could be responsible for the virus. US <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/us/politics/coronavirus-china-disinformation.html\" title=\"\">intelligence agencies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/04/27/world/asia/27reuters-health-coronavirus-china-eu.html?searchResultPosition=4\" title=\"\">an EU report</a> say Chinese operatives spread disinformation about Covid-19 on social media (Beijing denies it). State media\u2019s highlighting of imported cases (almost all of which have been Chinese nationals returning home) have fuelled xenophobia: Africans in Guangzhou have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/chinese-official-claims-racial-targeting-reasonable-concerns\" title=\"\">targeted for tests</a>, harassed, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-52274326\" title=\"\">barred</a> from shops and restaurants, and even evicted.</p> <p>Beijing has also seized the opportunity to crush opposition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/what-better-time-than-now-fears-china-will-use-crises-to-cement-grip-on-hong-kong\" title=\"\">in Hong Kong</a> while the world\u2019s attention is elsewhere. Police arrested 15 veteran activists including Martin Lee, the region\u2019s \u201cfather of democracy\u201d, hours after China\u2019s liaison office declared it was not bound by a clause in the city\u2019s mini-constitution which bars Beijing from interfering in local affairs. The liaison office\u2019s chief has called for the urgent passing of a highly controversial national security law.</p> <p>Britain has a particular duty to speak out over Hong Kong; but many countries are reassessing relations. The bigger question is not how we see Beijing, but whether we are willing to reappraise ourselves. China\u2019s worst behaviour has been encouraged by the greed, complacency, division and short-termism of others.</p> <p>But there is a distinction between holding China to account, and using that to distract from other governments\u2019 failings. There is also a world of difference between reconsidering the role of Chinese companies in essential infrastructure, such as 5G, and absurd <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/24/west-must-ensure-china-pays-role-spread-covid-19/\" title=\"\">calls for pandemic compensation</a>, or \u2013 in the US \u2013 to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-26/gop-senator-says-don-t-let-chinese-students-study-stem-in-u-s\" title=\"\">ban all Chinese students</a> from science and technology degrees. The virus has shown how much our futures are linked; things would be far worse had China suppressed all news of the outbreak for months, as it did with Sars, instead of telling the World Health Organization quickly. What is needed is careful, informed, considered and unified action, rather than macho posturing or buck-passing.</p>",
  "<p>This is going to sound like the setup to a surreal joke, but nevertheless: last week, a young man from St Helens called Harry Roberts was lying in bed when he looked up and saw the comedian Johnny Vegas standing at his bedroom window, bearing a box of face masks.</p> <p>As it turned out, Roberts \u2013 a 19-year-old St Helens fan who suffers from cerebral palsy and quadriplegia \u2013 had been the unwitting beneficiary of a visit from the Steve Prescott Foundation, the charity set up by the 1990s and 2000s Saints full-back who died in 2013 of a rare form of stomach cancer. Over the last decade the foundation has become one of rugby league\u2019s best known philanthropic enterprises.

Leeds Rhinos have been identifying elderly and vulnerable fans via their ticketing database and getting club stalwarts such as Stevie Ward and Kevin Sinfield to ring them and check if they\u2019re OK. Castleford and Keighley are among the clubs to have designed special charity jerseys. The former England forward Ben Westwood has been turning up at Warrington hospital <a href=\"https://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/news/18393691.warrington-wolves-ben-westwood-gives-bacon-butties-nhs/\" title=\"\">with hundreds of bacon sandwiches</a> for the staff. The Swinton prop Lewis Hatton has fast-tracked the last six months of his nursing studies in order <a href=\"https://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/news/18351569.rugby-leagues-lewis-hatton-tackles-coronavirus-nursing-frontline/\" title=\"\">to help out on the front line</a>. While athletes in other sports wrangle over wages and kick their heels, rugby league mucks in first and asks questions later.</p> <p>There\u2019s nothing new or faddish about any of this, of course. The vast majority of rugby league clubs have always been deeply embedded in their communities, often some of the most deprived and forgotten in the country. But perhaps it\u2019s only at times like this that their true value becomes apparent. When towns are relying on the powerful cohesive force of their local club more than ever. And when those very same clubs are fighting for their own lives.</p> <p>Rugby league is hanging on by a thread. Never a fantastically profitable enterprise even in the good years, the onset of Covid-19 and the ensuing economic downturn have driven a sport overwhelmingly reliant on match-day revenue to the very brink. According to the Wakefield chief executive, Michael Carter, just a single postponed home fixture costs his club about \u00a360,000 in lost income. Project that over an entire season, which now looks like the likeliest scenario, and for clubs that count their revenue in the thousands rather than the millions, the effect could be disastrous.</p> <p>In a way, the sport\u2019s smallness offers it a certain protection. Furloughing of players and staff, the vast majority of whom are on modest wages (even in Super League the average annual salary is \u00a360,000), has helped relieve the burden. But with no broadcast revenue \u2013 Sky\u2019s last payment was on 1 April, with another due in July \u2013 and without access to the substantial credit lines available to Premier League football clubs, the margins are small and vanishing fast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"024e939bc7f7f41940cfbd5fd784a4268278559c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/024e939bc7f7f41940cfbd5fd784a4268278559c/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St Helens\u2019 Totally Wicked Stadium lies empty with the Super League season on indefinite hold.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St Helens\u2019 Totally Wicked Stadium lies empty with the Super League season on indefinite hold.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The owner of Hull Kingston Rovers, Neil Hudgell, has warned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/26/hull-kr-owner-rugby-league-could-cease-to-exist-full-time-sport-coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">rugby league could cease to exist</a> as a full-time sport by this time next year without some sort of government funding. And if you\u2019re not a rugby league fan and that doesn\u2019t overly bother you, then it\u2019s worth considering that when a town loses its rugby league club, it doesn\u2019t just lose a sliver of its local economy and some residual income for pubs and taxi drivers. It loses a part of itself.</p> <p>This goes beyond tries and trophies, beyond nostalgia and tradition and pride. For example, every single school in Warrington gets six weeks of free coaching sessions from Wolves players and staff. Wath Brow, a small amateur club in Cumbria, run a community gym that is open for all to use. St Helens run a veterans\u2019 cafe and support groups for those with autism and dementia. For so many of these places, the club is the town. The town is the club. As Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary and Wigan MP, puts it: \u201cFew sports encapsulate a place like rugby league does. The survival and success of rugby league is a symbolic test for the government\u2019s commitment to our towns.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/26/hull-kr-owner-rugby-league-could-cease-to-exist-full-time-sport-coronavirus-outbreak\">Hull KR owner warns rugby league could 'cease to exist' as a full-time sport</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over recent weeks, rugby league\u2019s administrators have been in talks with the government over a potential rescue package. Political geography is a factor here, of course: for successive Conservative administrations, rugby league territory was Labour territory, industrial towns populated almost exclusively by the sort of people who would never vote for them, and who thus could be safely ignored. No longer: northern towns are the new frontier of British politics, as unthinkable as it might have seemed a generation ago, and, though few in the sport would be impolite enough to say so explicitly, the fact that rugby league\u2019s heartlands are now electorally live may just ensure them a proper hearing.</p> <p>But the fate of rugby league is a bellwether for wider concerns, too. There has been plenty of talk since the start of the crisis about the role the state can or should play in supporting small business. Rugby league clubs aren\u2019t charities, but neither are they run entirely on profit. They\u2019re the community cafe, the small independent bookshop up the road, the record store, the tech start-up, the neighbourhood restaurant. Perhaps their demise won\u2019t make the evening news. But if they go, something quiet and devastating will be lost, and probably for good.</p>",

  "<p>The results of early studies from the US and China, which show disappointing results in the use of an antimalarial drug and an anti-retroviral drug in treating Covid-19, will not impact trials of the drug under way in Australia, researchers say.</p> <p>To date<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(20)30086-8/fulltext\"> more than 300 clinical trials in humans</a> are under way around the world to investigate treatments for the virus, with several of these occurring in Australia.

Neither the Queensland department of health nor the hospital responded to multiple requests for comment from Guardian Australia as to whether the trial would be reassessed in light of evidence from overseas.</p> <p>A separate study, known as Ascot (AustralaSian COVID-19 Trial), is under way in more than 70 Australian hospitals and will test whether lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination, prevents deterioration of Covid-19 patients. A leader of the Ascot study, Prof David Paterson, said despite the disappointing findings from the US, the Australian study would go ahead. The US study was retrospective and conducted in a relatively small group of patients, whereas the Ascot study is being conducted as a randomised control trial, the strongest type of study and the gold standard for evidence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/controversial-malaria-drug-hydroxychloroquine-to-be-given-to-coronavirus-patients-in-australia\">Controversial drug hydroxychloroquine to be given to coronavirus patients in Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe conclusions of the authors of the US study were that randomised trials are needed,\u201d Paterson said. \u201cThis is exactly what we are undertaking with Ascot. Many commentators have observed that the US study was observational in design, and that it may have been that people who were not very sick were given no treatment and therefore had a greater chance of surviving, while those who were very sick and were at a greater intrinsic chance of dying were given hydroxychloroquine or other treatments in desperation.</p> <p>\u201cThere is clearly a lot still to learn about treatments for Covid-19. Large randomised clinical trials like Ascot are the only way to do this.\u201d</p> <p>A federal Department of Health spokesman said the government was closely monitoring the results of studies from around the world investigating treatment or preventions for Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cThe clinical evidence base is currently limited and results from large, prospective and controlled studies are required before the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine is better understood,\u201d he said. \u201cClinical trials in Australia are conducted by a sponsor who has overall responsibility for the trial, with oversight by a human research ethics committee. Within the bounds of a clinical trial, safety is carefully monitored and the sponsor and committee can halt a trial at any time should serious safety issues emerge.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Panic causing bad decisions\u2019</h2> <p>However, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/09/australian-government-experts-at-odds-with-health-department-over-using-hydroxychloroquine-to-treat-coronavirus\">advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee that experimental use of medications is not recommended for Covid-19</a>, and should only be prescribed as part of a clinical trial, some hospitals around Australia are giving the drugs to critically unwell patients outside of trials.

But if it\u2019s clearly shown \u2013 and I think the evidence is showing this for hydroxychloroquine \u2013 that it\u2019s doing more harm, then it should be unethical to give patients these drugs outside of a trial.\u201d</p> <p>He added that ethics committees should be constantly reviewing approvals of clinical trials as evidence emerges.</p> <p>Dr Gaetan Burgio, an Australian National University infectious disease specialist ,<em><strong> </strong></em>said given the lack of proven efficacy and the potential serious toxicity on seriously unwell patients, he also believes hydroxychloroquine should not be administered to patients outside of clinical trials.</p> <p>However, he said there was no reason to stop Australian clinical trials as a result of the findings from overseas so far. \u201cIn my view, as the patients are a well controlled clinical setting and thoroughly monitored, there is no reason to halt them.\u201d</p> <h2>Maintaining scientific standards</h2> <p>Australian states and territories have differed in their approach to off-label use of drugs to treat Covid-19. In Western Australia and Victoria, there is no off-label or experimental use of medications for patients outside of clinical trials.

He said the issue had been compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic as many people affected by bushfires in regional communities later lost the income they relied on from tourism and hospitality.</p> <p>\u201cInsurance promises to offer peace of mind, but with delayed claims, confusing policies that don\u2019t always provide the expected coverage and woeful responses to financial hardship by the insurance industry we\u2019re concerned that home insurance still isn\u2019t working for many people,\u201d Brody said.</p> <p>The law centre\u2019s call follows similar warnings elsewhere. Murich Re, the world\u2019s largest reinsurance company, last year told the Guardian that climate change could make cover for ordinary people unaffordable as it attributed US$24bn of losses from the Californian wildfires <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/21/climate-change-could-make-insurance-too-expensive-for-ordinary-people-report\">on human-induced heating</a>.</p> <p>In October, the Reserve Bank of Australia found it was increasingly important that investors and institutions manage carbon risk, and warned insurers were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/04/reserve-bank-warns-climate-change-posing-increasing-risk-to-financial-stability\">the most directly exposed to climate change</a>. It said inflation-adjusted insurance claims for natural disasters were more than twice as large last decade as the one before, and was likely to continue to grow.</p> <p>The Consumer Action Law Centre said since the summer bushfires it had received reports from community organisations in regional areas of significant delays in insurers undertaking assessments or arranging quotes for bushfire damage in remote parts of Victoria.</p> <p>It said problems spanned different types of natural disaster, citing an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission <a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/inquiries-ongoing/northern-australia-insurance-inquiry\">inquiry into insurance in northern Australia</a> that found premiums had increased far more in that part of the country than elsewhere over the previous decade after insurers adopted a more fine-grained assessment of the greater risk in the north from cyclones and floods.</p> <p>The group said rising costs were increasingly being worn by people who needed insurance most, when historically risk had been shared across the community.</p> <p>\u201cWe have significant concerns about how this will play out as the impact of climate change worsens, particularly for regional parts of Australia where climate change means bushfires will be more frequent and more severe,\u201d Brody said in the centre\u2019s submission to the royal commission.</p> <p>\u201cIt was recognised in the letters patent of this royal commission that this is the reality Australia is facing. For Australians who live in areas increasingly at risk from bushfires, premiums are going to continually (and sometimes rapidly) increase.</p> <p>\u201cIf homeowners cannot afford to rebuild due to the cost of premiums or the impacts of underinsurance, then they will be forced to leave their community.\u201d</p> <p>Consumer Action\u2019s recommendations include the government introducing outstanding recommendations from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/banking-royal-commission\">banking royal commission</a> relating to insurance as a matter of urgency to ensure people were treated fairly.</p> <p>Submissions to the natural disasters royal commission close on Tuesday.

Literally so, for he seemed to have lost weight with his suit now being several sizes too large, his face washed out and tired and his hair in urgent need of a trim. Nor were there any of the familiar upbeat enthusiasm and ebullience to his speech. The references to Churchill all fell rather flat and his performance seemed to be geared towards reminding himself as much as the country that he was back in charge. On the upside, even an underpowered Boris is an improvement on Priti Patel or Grant Shapps.</p> <p>He was here because he was here. That seemed to be the main thrust of what he had to say. He was grateful to the NHS, he was grateful to the public for by and large containing their impatience with lockdown \u2013 though the internal battle between his own cabinet on the timing of any relaxation in the guidance seems to have encouraged more people to make up their own rules \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/boris-johnson-uk-beginning-to-turn-the-tide-on-coronavirus\">we were making progress</a> against the coronavirus mugger. Not exactly the best analogy to use, as the most sensible advice when faced with a bloke with a six-inch knife is to give him whatever he wants. In Boris World, a mugging is just a harmless duffing up by the Bash Street Kids.</p> <p>\u201cMany will be looking at our apparent success,\u201d Boris continued. At which the only sound to be heard was of jaws hitting the pavement. To be fair, even he looked a bit embarrassed at that line. So far, the UK has recorded more than 20,000 coronavirus deaths in hospital and possibly as many as that again at home and in care homes. Which would already be roughly the number of civilians who died during the Blitz in the second world war, with the prospect of many thousands still to follow.</p> <p>If that\u2019s a success, I\u2019d hate to see what failure looked like. Or perhaps, the prime minister regards it as a matter of honour to top the European mortality figures. Either way, most other countries will be looking at the UK as an object lesson in how not to handle a pandemic.</p> <p>What followed was, in its way, just as startling. In claiming to have protected the NHS by flattening the levels of infection, he completely forgot to mention his government\u2019s own negligence in failing to provide adequate supplies of personal protective equipment for NHS staff and care home workers.</p> <p>Nor did he offer any explanation or apology for his failure to take the coronavirus seriously right from the start of the pandemic, a decision that may have cost many thousands of lives. Nor was there any recognition that other countries that had implemented a rigorous \u201ctest, track and trace\u201d policy had achieved far more success in containing the coronavirus. Or that his 250,000 daily testing target had always been bollocks. As so often, it was the subtext of what Johnson didn\u2019t say that provided by far the more informative meta narrative.</p> <p>By now, Boris was beginning to develop a hunted look in his eyes. His own brush with death has provided him with just a hint of conscience previously absent throughout his political career. The eyes are a window into a very troubled soul. He can sense the stench of battery chickens staying at home to roost.</p> <p>He talked of transparency when his government has done everything it could to keep Dominic Cummings\u2019s role in the Sage meetings secret. He talked of bringing in opposition parties, though none would do so without first making clear that they would never have started from the current position. He talked of reaching the second phase without saying how many phases he expected there to be. Mainly because he just doesn\u2019t know. Three? Four? Five? He\u2019s flying blind.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/boris-johnsons-post-coronavirus-speech-what-he-said-what-it-means\">Boris Johnson's post-coronavirus speech: what he said, and what it means</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just wittering on about enthusiasm and determination no longer cuts it. The situation has outgrown Boris\u2019s capacity for being serious. He knows he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/26/six-urgent-items-in-boris-johnson-inbox-as-he-returns\">faces some tough choices</a> in the next few weeks. A cabinet battle between the hawks who reckon tens of thousands more old people dying is a price worth paying to kick-start the economy and the doves who put the nation\u2019s health as its first priority is looming. With him stuck somewhere in the middle. And Boris has never been in politics to make enemies. He\u2019s Mr Fun Guy. All the tough decisions he has made have only ever been taken by accident. By default: the law of unintended consequences.</p> <p>Now he really is going to have to take the tough calls that will define his legacy. The honeymoon period of his resurrection will be over in a matter of days. Then comes judgment day. Whatever he does, he risks losing the confidence of half the cabinet and half the country. And the tricky calls will keep on coming.</p> <p>Over at the Brexit committee, Michael Gove had clearly taken far too many psychedelics, as he imagined the coronavirus could make a UK-EU deal far more likely. Hilary Benn, the committee chair, just looked bewildered. How can you possibly reach an outline of an agreement in two months, when no one has a clue what the global economy will be like in a year\u2019s time? Nor can you blame a botched Brexit deal on the coronavirus without first spelling out your negotiating objectives. Something the government has so far refused to do. Welcome to another week in the Fantasy Factory.</p>",

  "<p>The first minister of Wales has said he is ready to move the country out of lockdown earlier than the rest of the UK as he demands more contact from ministers at Westminster.</p> <p>Mark Drakeford said he would rather work with Boris Johnson\u2019s government but has the power to start enacting his own plan to ease restrictions if he thinks it is in the best interest of Wales.</p> <p>The Labour politician has been in regular talks with his Scottish counterpart, Nicola Sturgeon, and both countries have now released their own roadmaps to easing lockdown. Johnson said on Monday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/boris-johnson-uk-beginning-to-turn-the-tide-on-coronavirus\">he would release more details of his response to the lockdown in the \u201ccoming days\u201d</a>.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Drakeford said the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/7/contents/enacted/data.htm\">Coronavirus Act 2020 </a>allows the devolved nations to go their own way and it may now be time to consider putting that into action. <br><br>\u201cWe have the power to do it, definitely. I\u2019d rather we did it together. If we can\u2019t get to that point and we think there are things that are right to do for Wales then we will go ahead and do that but my ambition is that we do things still together across the United Kingdom.</p> <p>\u201cThe Coronavirus Act does respect devolution. It puts the solution in our own hands and we have already done things differently in a range of different matters where that\u2019s been right for us,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Wales was the first nation to offer testing to hospital staff and postpone routine operations. The Welsh government has also put into law the two-metre social distancing rule, which is government advice in England.</p> <p>Drakeford said the government needed to step up its contact with the leaders of the devolved nations and has requested Michael Gove, the de facto deputy prime minister, speak with them early this week and then invite them to a Cobra meeting before the weekend.</p> <p>That \u201crhythm\u201d of contact is essential, he said, with his last conversation with Gove was more than 10 days ago.</p> <p>Johnson said on Monday that he would be reaching out to build a consensus across the country and with opposition parties as the government tries to win \u201cphase two\u201d of the crisis, although no details of what that would entail have been released.</p> <p>The first minister\u2019s plan for Wales to incrementally leave lockdown if there is a clear decline in coronavirus cases in the next two weeks would operate on a traffic light system. He said 50% of general acute care beds in Wales are currently unoccupied.</p> <p>Drakeford said the first changes he would implement in the \u201cred phase\u201d would not look very different to the lockdown and would be cautious and careful and their consequences well mapped out.</p> <p>Already in Wales, shops are able to open if they can use a click and collect system, and people can exercise twice a day if there is a medical reason to do so. <br><br>Drakeford denied he was undermining a UK-wide response, saying his plans could and should contribute to what is being worked on in Westminster.</p> <p>A row over whether people can continue to stay in their second homes in Wales during the lockdown period ignited over the weekend when it was claimed wealthy second home owners were claiming business grants from their Welsh address.</p> <p>However Drakeford told the BBC that banning people from their second homes was a \u201cvery draconian\u201d response and he was not sure it was a legal position they could back up and might have human rights implications. <br></p>",
  "<p>An allegation that a Rwandan police commander sexually assaulted a child refugee has rocked an EU-funded scheme, under which hundreds of refugees and asylum seekers have been <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/rwanda/third-group-refugees-evacuated-rwanda-libya-unhcr-support\">evacuated from detention centres in Libya</a>.</p> <p>The allegation was made by a 16-year-old Eritrean boy, who had returned to Gashora transit centre, south of Kigali, after a coronavirus-related curfew on 13 April.</p> <p>Refugees say the boy was detained there along with three others \u2013 an Eritrean and two Sudanese boys \u2013 between 6.30pm and 10.30pm, and picked out by the police commander in charge.</p> <p>\u201c(He) ordered him to take off his clothes,\u201d said a refugee leader who spoke to the teenager afterwards. \u201cThe kid did as he was told since he thought he was going to be searched, but then he was asked to take off his pants, which he refused.

Preliminary findings show that the complainant used the occasion to try to avoid punishment for violating curfew and instead raised other grievances about the food menu, medical services, and police presence at the camp,\u201d the organisation said on Twitter.</p> <p>The police said refugees had been playing music in the week commemorating the 26<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Rwandan genocide. Refugees said they were listening to a preacher read prayers in the run-up to Eritrean Easter. \u201cWhen everyone wants to pray they use the speaker and everyone prays in [their] room, because everyone was using social distancing,\u201d said one man.</p> <p>\u201cStill the commander is there, circulating all the time,\u201d another said.</p> <p>The Rwandan government did not respond to requests for comment, but confirmed an investigation is underway.</p> <p>Most of the refugees evacuated to Rwanda are survivors of sexual or physical abuse and spent months or years in Libya with smugglers known to <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/africa/inside-the-smuggler-s-warehouse-africa-s-21st-century-slave-trade-1.4224073\">torture victims who can\u2019t pay large sums of money</a>.

Refugees said the organisation is not active or responsive. Alight did not reply to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment.</p> <p>The Guardian has visited Gashora twice, most recently last month, shortly before the lockdown. Refugees have repeatedly said they are happy to follow restrictions. Many have had tuberculosis or other health problems, making them vulnerable.</p> <p>On Saturday, refugees told the Guardian they were growing increasingly upset and frustrated that the alleged assault was not being taken seriously. \u201c[There is] no fucking justice in this society,\u201d said one Eritrean in his 20s. \u201cThey want to suppress our voice totally.

  "<p>Mark Johnston is the most successful trainer in terms of winners that British racing has seen, with nearly 4,500 on the board so far. Ralph Beckett has saddled three Classic winners and earned at least \u00a31m in prize money for his owners for the past five years. Their judgment is clearly excellent \u2013 when it comes to racehorses and preparing them for the track.</p> <p>Reading the room, though, seems to be more of a challenge for the pair of them. Johnston, who has recovered from Covid-19, and Beckett were the most familiar names on emails sent to Annamarie Phelps, the chair of the British Horseracing Authority, in recent days, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/26/mps-back-bha-chief-nick-rust-as-trainer-calls-him-a-lame-duck-leader-horse-racing\">calling for the immediate resignation of Nick Rust</a>, the BHA\u2019s chief executive.</p> <p>We know this because somebody then forwarded the emails to the Sunday Telegraph, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/25/trainers-call-horse-racing-chief-quit-restart-delay/\">which splashed with a story</a> claiming Rust faced \u201cexplosive calls to quit\u201d, seemingly because of \u201cdismay at the sport\u2019s lack of preparations to get back on track\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/26/mps-back-bha-chief-nick-rust-as-trainer-calls-him-a-lame-duck-leader-horse-racing\">MPs back BHA chief Nick Rust as trainer calls him a 'lame-duck leader'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Racing stables, of course, do not stop just because racing does. Horses need to be fed and exercised, staff need to be paid and so do the vets, the farriers, the feed merchants and so on. And the spring is perhaps the busiest time of the year in a Flat yard, as many new faces arrive to peer over the stable doors.</p> <p>But even so, did these trainers not get a spare 10 minutes over the last few weeks to switch on the news? It is not just racing. The whole country, the entire economy, is in lockdown. Millions are wondering whether they will have a job to go back to when the restrictions eventually ease. Every sector in the travel, tourism, leisure and entertainment industries, including racing, is experiencing a devastating loss of business and revenue while also facing up to the likelihood \u2013 the near certainty, in fact \u2013 that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/15/prepare-for-the-coronavirus-global-recession\">a deep recession is just around the corner</a>.</p> <p>In these circumstances, special pleading from any one sector, suggesting that its needs are more urgent than those elsewhere, is a terrible look. It is also one that, thus far, the locked-down racing industry has managed to avoid. The message has been clear and consistent (even when the line from government has been anything but): racing in some form will be ready to resume <em>as soon as the national restrictions in place to combat the coronavirus pandemic allow it to do so</em>.</p> <p>When the moment arrives, it will be days, not weeks, before the first horses go to post to race behind closed doors, thanks to an immense amount of work at BHA headquarters to pick a path through the most challenging circumstances the sport has ever faced. Beckett, above all, should be aware of what has been happening, since he will be the president of the National Trainers Federation in 2021 and he has been in the loop from the start.</p> <p>It will not look like racing as we knew and loved it this time last year, or even as it was three months ago, and in some respects, it probably never will be. Owners, trainers and horses will be lost to the sport over the coming months and years, and possibly several racecourses too. An annual fixture list with 1,500 meetings may well be a thing of the past. But it will be a vital first step on a very long road towards a new normal, and quite what any of the trainers who emailed Phelps to demand Rust\u2019s head expected to achieve in doing so is all but impossible to divine.</p> <p>There was never any chance that Phelps would ask for Rust\u2019s resignation, nor any valid reason for her to do so. Quite the opposite, in fact: the BHA board confirmed that Rust has its \u201cfull and unequivocal support\u201d, while racing-minded MPs from both sides of the house have also rallied around.</p> <p>Everyone in racing is suffering during lockdown, including many in a much more challenging situation than trainers like Johnston and Beckett. If special pleading is a terrible look, it is worse still when it is initiated by some of the (relatively small) group of trainers whose major owners include a few who will emerge on the other side of the current crisis with their sovereign wealth largely intact.</p> <p>There are some in racing who have never accepted Rust as the sport\u2019s chief executive because of his previous life in bookmaking. That does not necessarily include any of the trainers whose emails were leaked, but the BHA employees who work under Rust seem fiercely loyal to the CEO and have been working tirelessly as a team to come up with a plan to get racing again as soon as possible. That a cabal of trainers should seek to undermine him at this time above all seems perverse.</p>",

Tying him to his former leftist rival Sanders and questioning his mental fitness are seen as equally damaging themes, he said.</p> <p>Indeed, Trump and his allies continue to gleefully mock Biden\u2019s verbal miscues, amplifying them \u2013 some deceptively edited or altered \u2013 to affirm their charge that the 77-year-old has \u201clost his fastball\u201d. And while Trump encourages Sanders\u2019 supporters to join his own campaign, Republicans continue to press the case that Biden, perhaps the most moderate of all the Democrats who ran for president, has embraced the senator\u2019s Democratic socialist agenda. </p> <p>\u201cWhen faced with the choice of President Trump\u2019s record of accomplishment or Biden\u2019s weak record on China and far-left agenda, the choice for voters is clear,\u201d Sarah Matthews, deputy press secretary for the Trump campaign, said in a statement.</p> <p>But a China-centered strategy is risky, complicated in no small part by Trump\u2019s own rhetoric.</p> <p>Though Trump ran for the White House four years ago on a promise to \u201cget tough\u201d on China, he has struck a different posture as president in pursuit of a \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d trade deal with the world\u2019s second-largest economy. In recent months, he lavished praise on China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/15/trump-china-coronavirus-188736\">echoed</a> Beijing\u2019s assertions that it had the virus under control, even as it spread around the world.</p> <p>The focus also invites deeper scrutiny of Trump\u2019s own business dealings in the country. On Friday, Politico <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/donald-trump-bank-of-china-debt-report\">reported </a>Trump borrowed tens of millions of dollars from the state-owned Bank of China for his share in a New York property development.</p> <p>Democrats, incredulous that Trump would try to claim the upper hand on China, welcomed it as an opportunity to assail his handling of the crisis.</p> <p>On a press call organized by the Democratic National Committee, the Michigan congresswoman Debbie Dingell accused Trump of failing to hold China accountable and for understating the early threat from the virus.</p> <p>\u201cHis chaotic federal response delayed mitigation efforts for weeks,\u201d Dingell, a Democrat whose state is among the hardest hit in the country, said on Thursday. His actions have caused confusion and misinformation to spread, and it\u2019s made it really hard for our governors and local leaders who are trying to do everything they can.\u201d</p> <p>The escalating war of words over who is tougher on China was amplified in competing campaign commercials.</p> <p>The Trump\u2019s campaign released an ad earlier this month lashing Biden over his past remarks on China and reprising unfounded corruption accusations against the former vice-president and his son.</p> <p>The message was amplified in an ad from America First, a Super Pac supporting Trump, which declares that \u201cfor 40 years Joe Biden has been wrong about China.\u201d The group also launched a standalone website, BeijingBiden.com, populated with content related to Biden\u2019s purported \u201ccozy relationship with China\u201d.</p> <p>The Biden campaign responded with a blistering ad of its own. The commercial blames Trump for not holding China to account earlier over its handling of the virus, saying the president \u201cfailed to act\u201d as the coronavirus spread. The Democratic Super Pac American Bridge is also running ads on the same theme, featuring footage of Trump praising Xi and saying that the president \u201cgave China his trust\u201d.</p> <p>Yet the Trump campaign was targeting Biden long before the race narrowed to a one-on-one contest.</p> <p>As Biden competed for the nomination, the Trump campaign, with its vast war chest, deployed advertising campaigns against him while attempting to foment discord among Democrats. And Trump was ultimately impeached over his efforts to pressure Ukraine to open investigations into Biden and his family.</p> <p>Though Trump rarely pays a political price for taking differing or contradictory positions on an issue, the new push comes as Trump\u2019s support in key battleground states <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-battlegrounds-exclusive/exclusive-poll-signals-strengthening-support-for-biden-over-trump-in-three-midwest-battleground-states-idUSKCN2243KJ\">wanes</a>. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s critics hold out faint hope that the election will bring a political reckoning over what they view as his staggering mismanagement of the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>\u201cAll re-election campaigns \u2013 every single one of them \u2013 are a referendum on the incumbent,\u201d said Rick Wilson, co-founder of the Lincoln Project, a Republican-led effort to defeat Trump.</p> <p>\u201cAnd if Donald Trump had come into this election with peace and prosperity, it would be a very high hill to climb to defeat him. But he\u2019s not. He is coming into this with plague and depression.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The musician Ahmed Ismail Hudeidi, who has died aged 91, was the acknowledged king of the oud, a short-necked, lute-type instrument that is widely played across Africa and the Middle East. More than that, he developed a style on that instrument that came to epitomise modern Somali music.</p> <p>In the 1950s he began to put traditional Somali folksongs to new instrumentation, and he also composed in a new \u201cQaraami\u201d style, which, like the blues, could tell love stories as well as comment on life and society. Songs such as Ur Hooyo, Riftoon, Rogaal and Raheye became classics that have been reproduced by Somali musicians of every generation since \u2013 and remain popular still.</p> <p>Although he was better known in Africa and the Middle East, later in life Hudeidi came to prominence further afield, when he moved to London in his 70s and began performing to world music fans and the Somali diaspora at concerts around Europe and the US.</p> <p>Born in Berbera, in the British Somaliland Protectorate, Hudeidi was carried over the Gulf of Aden at 40 days old by his young mother, Qarad Hirsi, to join his father, Ismail Hussein, who was a police sergeant in the Aden Protectorate, which was also under British control. </p> <p>According to his biographer, Sultan Ali Shire, Hudeidi was a boisterous and restless boy, and was first introduced to music by a schoolteacher in Aden, who gave him a drum. At 17 he started playing the violin, and a few years later he bought an oud. He had a short stint in the Royal Navy as a cadet, which took him to Portsmouth in 1948. But his main intent was to become a musician, and in 1952, having left the navy, he was crowned \u201cKing of the Oud\u201d after winning a contest that brought musicians from all over the British empire to Aden. That same year he also established a band called Hawd, which grew into an influential musical and social force in Aden.</p> <p>Hawd was a group of 12 men that performed plays and musicals; the men also taking on female roles, as women were not allowed on stage at the time. It was during his period as an oud player in Hawd that Hudeidi wrote some of his most famous material, including the love song Riftoon, which was named after a French perfume, R\u00e8ve d\u2019Or, that was popular with Adeni women in the 1950s.</p> <p>When the British Somaliland Protectorate became the republic of Somali in 1960, Hudeidi composed a song, Dhalad (literally \u201cto be born\u201d), that was sung as the flag was raised at the new country\u2019s official independence celebrations in the city of Hargeisa. Shortly afterwards he moved from Aden to Hargeisa and began experimenting with his new Qaraami style and embarking on a hugely creative period during which many of his most popular songs were written. </p> <p>In 1961 Hudeidi moved to the nearby state of French Somaliland, joining the anti-colonial struggle there and helping to establish a local orchestra, becoming a folk-hero in the process. His resistance to French rule led to many arrests and periods in detention, until finally he left the country in 1967, still without independence achieved.</p> <p>Back in Somalia, Hudeidi worked as a recording artist for the state-owned radio station and wrote an anti-corruption play, Macal Cune Muuqan Doonee, which he performed in Mogadishu. As a founding member of Waaberi, a national music troupe that brought together many well-known performers, he travelled to the Middle East, Sudan and Nigeria, as well as Zaire, where Waaberi performed on stage in the musical build up to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/04/muhammad-ali-obituary\">Muhammad Ali</a> v George Foreman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/29/rumble-in-the-jungle-muhammad-ali-george-foreman-book-extract\">\u201cRumble in the Jungle\u201d</a> fight in 1974. He also developed close relationships with the Sudanese singer Mohammed Wardi and the Ethiopian songwriter Ali Birra. As Somalia did not have a formal music industry, Hudeidi recorded tracks at home and then cassettes of his music were distributed via cafes and music stalls.</p> <p>In the early 80s, as human rights violations by the mililtary regime in Somalia worsened, Hudeidi questioned the rule of the president, Siad Barre, and contributed to a long collaborative poem (made up of sections composed by different poets and songwriters) that was critical of Barre\u2019s regime. In response the authorities cut his state-sponsored salary by half and he began to be sidelined. Eventually, in 1984, he was forced to flee the country, and he relocated to the former French Somaliland, which had finally become independent (as the republic of Djibouti) in 1977.</p> <p>However, Djibouti was going through its own civil strife, and in 1994, aged 76, Hudeidi ended up as a refugee in London, the last stop in a life that had taken him to many places. In Britain he quickly began to reconnect with other Somali musicians who had been sown to the wind by various conflicts. Despite his age he also travelled widely across Europe, promoting Somali music and performing, in 2009, to an audience of 300,000 at the Mela world music festival in Norway. He also played in the US, in particular in Minneapolis, where many Somali refugees had settled, and was given the freedom of that city in 2004.</p> <p>He taught the oud to young people, often for nothing, and was especially supportive of women playing the instrument, even though this had traditionally been seen as undesirable in his homeland. He was a cosmopolitan and generous-hearted man who used his genius for music as a balm for weary souls and as a weapon against oppression. </p> <p>He is survived by seven children from various marriages.</p> <p>\u2022 Ahmed Ismail Hussein Hudeidi, musician, born 15 April 1928; died 8 April 2020</p>",
  "<p>A single red rose on the cover of Vogue, hospital car-park shoots rather than exotic locations, celebrities captured without makeup, supermodels relegated in favour of nurses and doctors, and amateur selfies usurping professional photography. This summer\u2019s newsstands and billboards are set to look unlike any other season in the history of fashion.</p> <p>The logistics of physical distancing and a zeitgeist paralysed by the pandemic are combining to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/22/lockdown-fashion-wakeup-call-coronavirus-lockdown\">turn fashion upside down</a>. Glossy magazines are scrambling to figure out what faces should be on the covers of the magazines that will hit stands during the crisis \u2013 and how to generate new imagery while travel and physical contact is curtailed under lockdown.</p> <p>The celebrity on the cover of the July issue of Harper\u2019s Bazaar has been shot \u201cby someone isolating in a remote location with the celebrity we had already booked\u201d, said the magazine\u2019s fashion director, Avril Mair. With no fashion editor allowed to visit, clothes were sent direct to the subject at home and styling guided by the magazine team over Zoom.</p> <p>A fashion story in the same issue was shot by the photographer Erik Madigan Heck at home with his wife, Brianna Killion, as model, without styling, hair or makeup. The theme of the issue is \u201cthat great creativity can come out of times of great crisis\u201d, said Mair.<br><br>\u201cEverything is different\u201d, said Albert Read, managing director of Conde Nast Britain. \u201cWe\u2019ll see that in the upcoming issues: the editorial production, a tonality and vision that is appropriate to the time.\u201d Its leading title, British Vogue, will focus on supporting healthcare workers in upcoming issues.</p> <p>Vogue\u2019s stance was reflected in its decision to cancel an interview for the August issue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/22/mia-claims-british-vogue-pulled-article-about-her-over-anti-vax-comments\">with </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/22/mia-claims-british-vogue-pulled-article-about-her-over-anti-vax-comments\">the singer M.I.A.</a> in light of her anti-vaccination stance. Last week, the singer posted a screengrab of a message from the magazine which reads: \u201cConsidering our August is an issue where we\u2019re chronicling the struggles of the NHS to cope while a vaccine is tried to be made we don\u2019t feel we can have her involved. It just wouldn\u2019t be right. All of our issues July-September will be supporting the frontline heathcare workers and we need to be respectful of them and all they are doing until a vaccine exists.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>Grazia was quick to transpose into a different key as the crisis unfolded. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed that you should be able to look at a Grazia cover and it be obvious what week it hit newsstands,\u201d said the editor, Hattie Brett. \u201cThe first week of working from home, it was clear we should focus on NHS workers \u2013 so we ripped up all our pre-existing plans and shot four medics for the cover.\u201d Earlier this month, Elle ran a digital portfolio of portraits of women doing essential work in supermarkets, on trains, and in schools and homeless shelters.</p> <p>\u201cThe smart editors will make magazines that reflect this moment,\u201d said Jefferson Hack of Dazed Media. \u201cFashion with a capital F is on pause right now.\u201d But magazines that have traditionally served their readers escapism and glamour are struggling with how to balance this historic role with the need not to appear out of step with the times.</p> <p>Tonal challenges are compounded by the logistical issues of producing imagery under social distancing rules. Imran Amed, editor-in-chief of the Business of Fashion, said \u201ceditorial and advertising shoots have come to a virtual standstill\u201d. Carol Hayes, who helms an established agency for makeup artists and hairdressers, reports business having \u201cground to an almost immediate halt\u201d.

A recent cover shoot with the British TV presenter Laura Jackson was fortuitously made possible because Jackson\u2019s husband, Jon Gorrigan, is a photographer.

  "<p>Lockdown is breaking down. Or is it? The Daily Express has pictures of packed beaches in Brighton, yet locals dispute their veracity. Traffic was at its highest over the weekend since restrictions began. Rumours abound that cleaners and nannies are being quietly rehired; that people are visiting loved ones under an array of special circumstances. On Sunday, you could smell the barbecues \u2013 but what were you doing out, within smelling distance, anyway? The guy in front of me in Co-op was buying 48 beers and a tub of ice-cream. But he can\u2019t have been having a party, I decided. No way was that enough ice-cream.</p> <p>In the last days of March, there was huge solidarity around the restrictions themselves: 10 days in, there was a much sourer unity building around censure of the bad people, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/uk-sunbathers-stricter-coronavirus-lockdowns\">the ones </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/uk-sunbathers-stricter-coronavirus-lockdowns\">who were sunbathing</a>. I suspect a new, nudge-nudge-wink-wink solidarity will emerge around noncompliance, which will go head-to-head against the group that remains committed to lockdown. But the lines will be confusing: especially in the US, but also here in Britain, those ideologically most aligned to the government are the ones that reject its proscriptions most strongly. Lockdown is active and collective \u2013 we all have to do it, constantly, for it to exist at all. So the process around it has to be deliberative, just, consensual and transparent \u2013 otherwise the buy-in will evaporate.</p> <p>On Saturday, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics spelled out the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/news/statement-covid-19-and-the-basics-of-democratic-governance\">basics of democratic governance</a>\u201d, as they related to Covid-19. There are balances to be struck between different interests and different risks, who and what should be prioritised, who should bear responsibility for what. Following the science \u201cis not politically or morally neutral\u201d. We all need to discuss decisions that affect us all, and to do so we need more information, more openness, more pluralism.</p> <p>This was all so unarguable, so level-headed, that it only became interesting when counterposed against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/boris-johnson-uk-beginning-to-turn-the-tide-on-coronavirus\">Boris Johnson\u2019s speech</a> this morning: a huge duvet of flim-flam congratulating us on our national resolve was meant to be warming, but instead felt infantilising and obscure. When the prime minister reached his point, it turned out to be: \u201cWe simply cannot spell out now how fast or slow, or even when, those changes will be made.\u201d While it made no sense on its own terms (\u201ceven when\u201d? What do \u201cfast\u201d and \u201cslow\u201d mean, except \u201cwhen\u201d?), its meaning was quite plain: the government cannot bring you into its decisions; you must prepare yourself to know nothing, until such time as we can tell you something; we will not be pressed on when that will be.</p> <p>There followed some lip service to \u201cmaximum possible transparency\u201d and building \u201cthe biggest possible consensus\u201d. But without any concrete sign of those things, it was simply a demand for ultimate trust. Trust the government to know when the first peak is over. Trust it to know what the second peak will look like. Trust it to evaluate all the trade offs in a democratic way. It\u2019s quite an ask from a government whose basic competence, throughout, has been so questionable.</p> <p>Johnson lacks the personal credibility to beg this confidence, but the inadequacies spread far wider. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is popular in some quarters: others point out that it\u2019s easy to be liked when, every time you open your mouth, it\u2019s to hose money at people (and easy to be disliked, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/applicants-uk-coronavirus-business-loan-cbils\">that money never materialises</a>). Either way, Sunak is completely untested; it would be extraordinary at any time to have such an inexperienced chancellor, let alone now.</p> <p>The key figures of the cabinet, Dominic Raab and Michael Gove, were chosen for their hawkishness on a now completely irrelevant issue, but that trait lingers in both: \u201cI\u2019m in charge, don\u2019t ask questions, leave me alone to get this done.\u201d There were, four months ago, enough people in the country with little enough interest in the future of tedious trade deals that they were prepared to do exactly that. There is nobody with so little to say about their own health and livelihoods that they\u2019ll extend the same blank cheque to a crisis like this one.</p> <p>Below these ministers sits a layer of politicians \u2013 Priti Patel, Matt Hancock, Helen Whately \u2013 who are trying to touch the grace notes of patriotism and self-sacrifice without anything like the gravitas or credibility they need. It\u2019s almost painful to watch, like someone trying to play Mozart\u2019s Requiem on the spoons.</p> <p>Even <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-kremlinesque-how-the-government-tried-to-dismiss-sunday-times-report-bt9dpjmjf\">normally supportive newspapers</a> are beginning to pick apart the competence, honesty and preparedness of the government. Yet what will really damage it is not the failing of any individual or policy, nor that failing coming to light; but rather, its modus operandi, which is built on dominance. We watched a cohort of politicians elevate themselves by their disregard for consensus: it came to be understood that discursive politics was for the good times, and when things got serious, strong men with their bare assertions were required. Of course, the opposite is true: a real crisis needs everyone to cooperate; and for that, everyone must be heard.</p> <p>If Johnson thinks his Downing Street statement bought him time, it didn\u2019t; it fired the starting gun for a race towards some real transparency, a wider debate of maturity and complexity, undertaken with better, fuller information. If he can\u2019t get there by 7 May, when the next review of the lockdown is due, the country will simply outpace him.</p> <p>\u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>Week six and it\u2019s fair to say we\u2019re through all the stages of grief now and are stuck at boredom. We\u2019ve had shock and denial (\u201cWhat, in my house? <em>Inside </em>my house?\u201d); we\u2019ve had pain and guilt (\u201cI\u2019ll do two YouTube workouts a day and somehow also write a novel\u201d); there was that fortnight of anger and bargaining (\u201cHands off my 36-pack of Andrex or I am calling the police\u201d); then the depression, reflection and loneliness (this means \u201cmaking sourdough\u201d, by the way. Sourdough is a depressed person\u2019s idea of bread); the upward turn (cracking open a can \u201cto furlough!\u201d every day at 4pm); reconstruction (building a new society where the only jailable offences are \u201cbeing in a park while the park is busy\u201d and \u201cnot clapping loud enough for the NHS\u201d); and then through to acceptance and hope (I\u2019ve started texting \u201csee you in 2021!\u201d unironically to friends and family). Every jigsaw has been done, every boxset has been binge-watched, every manuscript has been abandoned. Bored now. Done with this. Over it.</p> <p>Boredom is not a threatening feeling on its own, but it is in quarantine. In the US, the last couple of weekends have been dominated by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/19/protests-maryland-texas-ohio-coronavirus-stay-at-home-orders-video-report\">semi-formless protest movement</a> \u2013 nameless, mindless, shapeless, but bored \u2013 made up of a Tea Party-esque, libertarian-adjacent freedom-above-all faction who take masks and billboards and semi-automatic weapons and stand outside monuments, demanding the right to be allowed out to do the things they love: eat well-done steaks in restaurants, wear wraparound shades inside well-lit malls, run over wild animals with 4X4s. If you think this sort of thing will never make its way to the UK, can I remind you how many 5G towers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/06/at-least-20-uk-phone-masts-vandalised-over-false-5g-coronavirus-claims\">have been torn down</a> in the past month because people think they are beaming out coronavirus particles. If anything, it\u2019s weird the protests haven\u2019t made it here already.</p> <p>Which brings us to Boris Johnson, who is alive. On Monday morning, Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/boris-johnson-uk-beginning-to-turn-the-tide-on-coronavirus\">took to a podium outside Downing Street</a> to say that right, listen, no, lockdown restrictions won\u2019t be lifted any time soon, and can everyone stop thinking the problem is solved just because they haven\u2019t yet personally suffered at the hands of it. \u201cI know it is tough,\u201d he said, \u201cand I want to get this economy moving as fast as I can, but I refuse to throw away all the effort and the sacrifice of the British people and to risk a second major outbreak and huge loss of life and the overwhelming of the NHS.\u201d He might have spent the week hiding from public view so nobody said, \u201cSo, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-38-days-when-britain-sleepwalked-into-disaster-hq3b9tlgh\">the Sunday Times</a>\u2026\u201d at him, but it seems like roughly the right call.</p> <p>The pressure to relieve lockdown isn\u2019t just coming from a small revolutionary group of bored Britons, of course (and I do mean small: describing the lockdown as \u201cunlawful imprisonment\u201d on social media and \u201cbeing so mad at the TV licence that you end up going to court about it\u201d seem, to me, to share the same vibe) \u2013 it\u2019s also coming from big business. This week\u2019s Sunday Times bore the front-page headline \u201cTory grandees tell PM: it\u2019s time to ease the lockdown\u201d, where \u201cTory grandees\u201d can be read as \u201cbusiness owners with long histories of donating to the Conservative party who would quite like their shop floors back, thanks\u201d. Even Keir Starmer \u2013 who I will not trust until he drops the info on where he\u2019s getting his hair cut right now \u2013 penned one of those entirely useless <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/keir-starmer-urges-ministers-to-stop-treating-public-like-children-over-coronavirus-lockdown\">letters to the prime minister</a> where he talked in vague terms about an \u201cexit strategy\u201d. The message is there, rumbling in the background, an ominous grey cloud on the horizon: capitalism wants its ball back, and Westminster wants to help lob it over the fence. And, weirdly, the voice of resistance here is \u2026 hold on, I can\u2019t be reading this correctly. <em>Boris Johnson?</em></p> <p>One fact I always used to repeat a lot when I was boring people in the pub \u2013 a treasured memory from a life I had 100 years ago \u2013 was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/18/mass-grave-shows-how-black-death-devastated-the-countryside\">Black Death</a> inadvertently led to the creation of the middle class. Peasants were overwhelmingly affected by the spread of the disease, population numbers dwindled, a recovering economy of landowners v workers evened the odds for those who ploughed the land, and the savviest among the survivors negotiated pay rises and land of their own in exchange for their services. Long story short, we now have Waitrose, Heston Blumenthal and the Range Rover Evoque.</p> <p>I can\u2019t help but feel that history won\u2019t quite repeat itself this time: if we \u201copen up the economy\u201d to help Tory grandees make money again, there won\u2019t be much economy left once the second wave of infections has finally settled down, because all the Topshops will have to be razed to make space for graves. Essentially: what\u2019s the point in being rich if there is no one left alive to lord it over? Put the guns away, get the jigsaws back out, feed that wet gross pot of yeast.

And nor does Fox. \u201cThis is why you don\u2019t get actors involved in chats like this.

Maeve tracks Dolores down to a secret complex where Serac and his genius brother have been plotting the future of humanity and storing anyone who got in their way in suspended animation. As the Rohohohoboam\u2019s big brother Solomon pulses away in a hangar, Maeve stomps out of her chopper and mind messages Dolores. \u201cWe\u2019re overdue a little chat,\u201d she says. But she doesn\u2019t mean chat, she means fight.</p> <p>Dolores being Dolores, she can\u2019t resist a bit of sweet talk and after decapitating a hypnotised droid, she finds Maeve in the best location for any duel to the death \u2013 the canteen. Dolores shoots Maeve, Maeve lightly sautes Dolores in peanut oil. Dolores grabs a steak knife and jabs it in Maeve\u2019s gut several times in full view of the camera, just in case anyone missed any of the gory detail. Maeve makes a tapenade from Dolores\u2019 leather jacket. The action then spills outside and Maeve\u2019s faithful helicopter shoots Dolores\u2019s arm off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"051b7b2d622041660713b5bff00d4fc31deee8a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/051b7b2d622041660713b5bff00d4fc31deee8a8/0_71_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Living a drug-fuelled lie ...

Yes, the host who has taken it upon herself to be the messiah for her kind turns out to know a few things when it comes to robots, like the whereabouts of the on-off switch. She presses a button (it\u2019s a big one, so definitely powerful) and not only does Solomon stop throbbing, but both Maeve and Dolores plop to the ground like a pair of abandoned marionettes.</p> <p>This was not quite the explosion of hellfire many of us expected when the reckoning between humans and robots finally came to pass. Which kind of makes you suspect that it might not have. Indeed, there are still several threads to be knitted together, not least what will happen to Caleb \u201cjust a construction worker\u201d Nichols, who has been anointed both saviour and destroyer of humanity, depending on who you listen to.</p> <p>Thanks to the power of flashback, we learn that Caleb has been living a drug-fuelled lie so deep and convoluted that you probably needed to be on drugs to make any sense of it. Caleb was a special forces agent, operating in the Russian civil war of the future. But some of the jobs he thought he had carried out in the Crimea had actually been carried out years later in LA when he thought he had been just a construction worker with a sideline in app-based petty crime. Not only had Caleb got the time and place wrong, it turned out he had got the details wrong too. Rather than capturing an insurgent leader, he had kidnapped a pharmacologist, and rather than seeing the guy die in an ambush, he had killed him for being, like, \u201cI told you so.\u201d Caleb also killed his best mate, Francis, who he thought had been killed by insurgents. When all of this is revealed, not to mention the news that his memory was subsequently erased at the hands of Serac\u2019s multitalented goons, Caleb is understandably irate. \u201cSolomon you asshole!\u201d he screams at the throbbing orb.</p> <p>The intensity of his revelation and the deranged leer on Caleb\u2019s face at the end of the episode leave the viewer uncertain as to what might happen next. Bernard seems to know, however. The Good Bot has been marching around with William and Stubbs on the set of The Walking Dead, trying to decipher Dolores\u2019s plans. Well, Bernard and Stubbs have; William has been concentrating on delivering the most bloodthirsty barbs known to man. Here\u2019s a sample, after learning Dolores (/Hale) had injected a tracking device into his veins: \u201cI\u2019m going do to something to her blood. Mop the fucking floor with it.\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, Bernard has been trying to decode the significance of Caleb to the whole scheme, but only as the episode comes to its denouement does Stubbs provide him the opportunity to share. What is the significance of Caleb to the whole scheme, Stubbs asks, or words to that effect. \u201cIf we can find Caleb we might be able to stop her,\u201d Bernard explains. \u201cDolores was made with a poetic sensibility; she won\u2019t destroy humanity, he will.\u201d</p> <p>Now I thought a poetic sensibility meant being able to look at a cloud and see the fleeting nature of existence. But if Bernard says it means tricking a human into blowing up humanity then I\u2019ll go with it. We humans are stupid, after all. And that includes William, who comes back from an alleged \u201cpiss\u201d with a pump-action shotgun pointed at Bernard and Stubbs, and a murderous glint in his eye. Er, you do know these guys can take a bullet to the face and keep on trucking don\u2019t you?

  "<p>Her fertility medication had arrived and Ellen Rayment was waiting for the first day of her period so she could begin taking it. Rayment, a 40-year-old health professional from East Sussex, had been trying to conceive with her wife Debby for three years. It had been costly and emotionally draining. The Rayments were declined treatment on the NHS because they were using donor genetic material, so they had spent in excess of \u00a320,000 on private IVF.</p> <p>In November 2019, Rayment had miscarried twins at 22 weeks. After taking some time to both physically recover and grieve, Rayment\u2019s doctor gave her the go-ahead to proceed with egg implantation using the final frozen embryo from their second round of IVF in March. She was waiting for her period to start before taking the medication to thicken her uterine wall, ahead of embryo implantation. But when that came it was on the same day Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus. All non-urgent medical procedures, including IVF, would be postponed. Her clinic called her to confirm the bad news.</p> <p>With each month that Britain spends under lockdown, Rayment can feel her dreams of motherhood slipping away. \u201cMy biological clock is ticking louder and louder,\u201d she says. Rayment is aware that, after 40, it is difficult to conceive through IVF. \u201cIt just feels horrific, to be honest,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Rayment is one of a number of women whose IVF treatments have been cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Although many IVF clinics decided to suspend treatment after Johnson\u2019s 23 March announcement, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which oversees all NHS IVF clinics, did not officially stop all fertility treatments until 15 April. Exceptions are being made only when women are undergoing fertility-preservation treatment ahead of radiotherapy or chemotherapy for serious diseases.</p> <p>\u201cWe will do all we can to lift this restriction as soon as possible but we cannot give a date when this will happen given the current situation with the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK \u2026 our aim is for the UK fertility sector to restart as soon as possible and we are keeping the situation under regular review,\u201d says an HFEA spokesperson. Whereas the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish authorities have confirmed that fertility patients will not be disadvantaged by coronavirus when clinics reopen, meaning that clinics will pick up where they left off \u2013 with patients receiving the same treatment according to the same criteria that they would have been entitled to before the pandemic \u2013 England has not made the same promise. There are fears that IVF provision in England \u2013 which has already been squeezed by national cuts, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/19/uks-oldest-ivf-clinic-at-risk-of-closure-amid-increasing-privatisations\">some hospital trusts</a> selling or considering closing their IVF clinics, or offering a reduced number of IVF cycles \u2013 could be further cut after the coronavirus pandemic, to help rebalance the NHS funding black hole. </p> <p>For women who had already started fertility treatment and were on a cocktail of fertility-boosting drugs when the pandemic hit, the IVF ban was a bitter blow. \u201cThat was the hardest bit,\u201d says Kara*, a 34-year-old social worker from Sheffield. \u201cTaking all those drugs that affect you so much, for nothing.\u201d After Kara found out her NHS IVF treatment was cancelled in March, she had to continue taking oral and injectable oestrogen and progesterone for a further two weeks, to complete her monthly cycle. Kara and her husband have been trying to conceive for five years; she has miscarried five times.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>IVF is a long road, littered with obstacles; now the coronavirus pandemic is one more thing that\u2019s out of your control</p> <footer> <cite>Seetal Savla</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Being full of pregnancy-inducing hormones without being pregnant, in the midst of a global pandemic, did not do much for Kara\u2019s physical or mental health. \u201cI was devastated,\u201d she says. \u201cAll those hormones make you really emotional and the injectable progesterone makes your stomach sore, and you get so tired. You don\u2019t mind that when you\u2019re building up to an IVF cycle. But when it gets taken away from you you\u2019re like: \u2018Now what?\u2019\u201d Gwenda Burns of Fertility Network UK urges any women feeling distressed or overwhelmed to call the network\u2019s <a href=\"https://fertilitynetworkuk.org/\">support line</a>, or join one of its regional online support groups. \u201cWe believe no question is too trivial or worry too small,\u201d Burns says.</p> <p>IVF is, by definition, a time-sensitive endeavour: any delay diminishes the likelihood of a woman successfully conceiving, as her egg reserves drop month-on-month. \u201cTime is so precious in IVF,\u201d says Rayment. \u201cA month can make such a difference.\u201d If you have already spent years on a waiting list for NHS IVF, any further delay is agonising.</p> <p>\u201cWe went through a shocking number of delays until we finally got our NHS approval letter through,\u201d says Polly Towler, a 38-year-old audio typist from Bristol. Towler was due to commence her first round of NHS IVF this April, nearly four years after she first visited her GP about her fertility issues. \u201cI am very worried about my egg reserves,\u201d Towler says. \u201cI will be 39 at the end of this year. The decline will be steep from now on.\u201d</p> <p>A lack of clarity from the government about when the lockdown will end adds to many women\u2019s anxiety and sense of powerlessness. \u201cSo much of IVF is beyond your control,\u201d says Seetal Savla, a 38-year-old PR manager from London. \u201cIt\u2019s a long road that\u2019s littered with obstacles, and now the coronavirus pandemic is one more thing that\u2019s out of your control.\u201d After her first round of NHS IVF failed in 2017, Savla and her husband Neil turned to private clinics. Savla has low egg reserves, meaning that her chances of becoming a mother are already low. \u201cIf the government would say that in two or three months, IVF can start again, that would be something to count down towards,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the uncertainty that\u2019s difficult to accept.\u201d</p> <p>An exit strategy for the fertility sector is needed, says Dr Geeta Nargund, a fertility expert at St George\u2019s NHS Trust. \u201cWe need a proactive approach to restarting these services, detailing which social distancing measures and safety approaches will be required, and what protective equipment will be made available for staff,\u201d she says. When the lockdown is lifted, Nargund wants priority to be given to women with low egg reserves, or those who are older. \u201cTime is of the essence for them,\u201d she explains.</p> <p>All the women understand the pressures on the NHS. \u201cI get that we have to protect the NHS,\u201d says Kara. \u201cI understand why they\u2019ve cancelled all the treatments. But I\u2019m still allowed to have some personal grief about it.\u201d Even before her IVF was cancelled, Rayment felt uneasy, because her history of miscarriage and age made any pregnancy high-risk. \u201cI felt dubious, because I knew that by carrying on I could be a burden to the NHS,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then I thought: no one else is being told not to procreate. It didn\u2019t seem fair that I should be told to stop whilst everyone else was carrying on regardless.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The naturally fertile aren't being asked not to try to have children, only infertile, single women and same-sex couples</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Geeta Nargund</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nargund argues that the IVF ban exacerbates existing healthcare inequalities. \u201cThose who are naturally fertile are not being asked not to try to have children,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s only the infertile, single women and same-sex couples that are being delayed \u2026 access to fertility treatment is an issue of equality, whether it\u2019s a couple who delayed parenthood due to financial insecurity, or a lesbian couple. Denying them their fundamental right to parenthood exacerbates societal inequalities.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, for the women whose dreams of motherhood are on indefinite hold, lockdown conversations can be painful. \u201cHaving to hear people make baby-boom jokes or people complaining about having kids at home is really hard,\u201d says Savla. \u201cI would love to be in the situation of having kids at home to complain about.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/18/babysitting-embryo-carry-child-for-friend-surrogacy\">\u2018She said she\u2019d be babysitting our embryo\u2019: what\u2019s it like to carry a child for a friend?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many of the women I spoke to believe that coronavirus has cost them their chance of having biological children. \u201cI just feel like it\u2019s not going to happen now,\u201d says Towler. \u201cI am preparing myself for the possibility of not having children.\u201d Rayment is taking things day by day, but is similarly dejected. \u201cThe media is saying that we won\u2019t come out of full lockdown until we have a vaccine,\u201d says Rayment. \u201cThat could take a year.

  "<p>The Golden Girls returns to terrestrial TV today, for the first time in forever. Does terrestrial still mean anything? Does anyone make an appointment with the TV schedule any more? Does <a href=\"https://www.channel5.com/show/the-golden-girls/\">Channel 5 </a> even count as terrestrial, or is it a mysterious third space, between the respectable status of the old school and the Wild West of the new?</p> <p>Perhaps only the over-40s will notice, and maybe that\u2019s just as well, because this is nostalgia of the trippiest kind. Here I am, watching a cast whose central comic conceit was \u201cwhat are all these women doing on screen when they\u2019re so old?\u201d, which I remember from when I was young enough that there was no functional difference between a 55-year-old and her mother, and I am now around the same age as some of the characters in the show were pretending to be (45).</p> <p>The show first aired in 1985. Thirtysomething was only two years behind it, so the idea was certainty emerging that sitcoms didn\u2019t need a USP, they could just be people, going about their business, getting into scrapes. Yet, in the Cheers model, your classic sitcom needed a precinct \u2013 something more distinctive and enclosed than \u201clife\u201d \u2013 and some oddballs, to create some structure like a mobile over a cot, for all the pretty jokes to hang off. The dating lives, trials and histories of four women wouldn\u2019t have cut it (not until Sex and the City). The hilarity was that they were far too old to talk about sex, and yet that\u2019s pretty much all they did.</p> <p>The scene was an affluent Miami flatshare, a life filled with charity balls and self-serving good works (that portrait of the wealthy, endlessly congregating for unknown charities, is a distinctively American artefact. You can see its spine running through to Curb Your Enthusiasm).</p> <p>Nominally, the engine of the house was its owner, Blanche Devereaux, played by Rue McClanahan. Everyone on the production talks about her as a Blanche Dubois character, as she is from the south and has a wealthy background. She is nothing at all like Blanche DuBois. Sometimes I think Tennessee Williams is to American culture what the classics are to Etonians, they just blah the names and the lines, and have no idea what actually happened.</p> <p>Devereaux is not faded at all, not delusional, not a husk of instrumentalised femininity, tragically destined to be used by men who find in her something to hate more than they hate themselves. She is your classic good-time-girl: every third joke is about her life lived in the fast lane (\u201cI haven\u2019t disappointed this many men since my daddy dismantled the treehouse\u201d); more or less every plot line gets its twist from her having previously shagged one of the noises-off. She is the one pretending to be 45 (the real main character, Dorothy Zbornak, played by Bea Arthur, is 55 in season one, and we assume the others are the same).</p> <p>You can trace this tradition from the Wife of Bath to Samantha in SATC \u2013 the promiscuous woman who is old enough to live it without consequences; no STDs, no biological clock, no looking for Mr Right. Culture likes to imagine the post-menopausal woman defanged; her fertility was her venom, and without it, all her concerns are comic. Yet when McClanahan turned that cliche into a character, it was like a shot of HRT. You weren\u2019t laughing at her or even with her; she was laughing at you.</p> <p>The show\u2019s real star, though, is Dorothy: straight woman and joke-butt. How do you build a character who can weather the mockery of all the others, without feeling sorry for her? By making her pompous enough, a kind of female Frasier. But that\u2019s like saying, \u201clet\u2019s build a female Henry VIII to explain all these divorces\u201d. Arthur made it work, but in the process built something really quite idiosyncratic, the heroine who was neither pleaser nor what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/apr/27/features.weekend\">Stockard Channing </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/apr/27/features.weekend\">called \u201cthe pi\u00f1ata part\u201d</a> (the classic role for the older woman \u2013 villain enough that everyone would enjoy hitting her with a stick, then all the toys poured out). Daffy Rose (Betty White) and caustic Sophia (Estelle Getty) were like the album\u2019s B-sides: occasionally they would seem like the true soul of the show, before Blanche and Dorothy let fly some huge melody.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t do the show any harm that these are four great comic talents of a generation (Getty, playing Sophia, the mother, was actually a year younger than Arthur, playing her daughter). You could say the studio decision was hard-headed rather than mould-breaking \u2013 what a huge amount of capital would have been lost, had they all been put out to pasture. But what made it so delicious was the beady sagacity of the cast.</p> <p>The structure of the classic sitcom is schmaltz. From a saccharine opening jingle \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiQzUEc_FmI\">\u201cIf you threw a party / Invited everyone you knew / You would see / The biggest gift would be from me\u201d</a> (see also Friends, \u201cI\u2019ll be there for you / Cause you\u2019re there for me too\u201d) \u2013 to the homily on friendship reliably delivered at the end of most episodes, and with bells on at the end of the series (see Big Bang Theory), it is very often a little too much, and risks the whole enterprise.

It\u2019s usually a stock cupboard or the toilet \u2026 that\u2019s where you find people crying.\u201d Anne, an occupational therapist specialising in stroke patients, says, half-joking, that there is \u201cnow a queue for the crying cupboard\u201d. All of her patients now have Covid-19, and she describes her working day as harrowing. \u201cI have stopped talking to my family and non-NHS friends about it because I think it\u2019s too hard for them,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Much has rightly been made of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/25/nhs-staff-government-ppe-coronavirus\">threat to the physical health of NHS staff</a>, which has been compounded by inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and poor government planning, but it is important to also be aware of the toll that the outbreak could take on their mental health.</p> <p>There were already much higher levels of mental illness within the NHS than among the wider population: <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d1708\">a 2011 report</a> in the British Medical Journal found that nearly a third of doctors have a mental health disorder. According to a study by NHS digital, the NHS lost <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/workforce/mental-wellbeing-of-nhs-staff-is-at-a-tipping-point/7025957.article\">348,028 working days</a> due to anxiety, stress or depression in just one month last year. Many staff were already at breaking point before the disease hit. The impact of coronavirus has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/23/half-of-uk-health-workers-suffering-stress-because-of-covid-19\">stark</a>: half of health workers are suffering mental health problems such as stress and trauma as a result of dealing with the lack of PPE, colleagues falling ill and, in the most tragic scenarios, dying.</p> <p>Living with a perceived, continuous threat to life puts a person under intense psychological stress. This is exacerbated by feelings of isolation, or not being able to share what they are feeling. It\u2019s a potential recipe for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p> <p>The fact that the virus is novel compounds this. \u201cTypically one of the symptoms of PTSD is that sense of uncertainty, being out of control,\u201d says Claire Pooley, a British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP)-accredited trauma therapist and trained nurse. \u201cNone of us know right now. Staff have to count on their own hospital trust, that it is doing the best it can for them, but at the same time there\u2019s a sense of, \u2018Well, is it ?\u2019 And do we know if what we are doing is the right thing?\u201d</p> <p>Pooley has been volunteering for the organisation <a href=\"https://www.frontline19.com/\">Frontline</a><a href=\"https://www.frontline19.com/\">19</a>, which offers free mental health support for NHS workers. Set up in a matter of weeks, more than 1,500 therapists have volunteered so far. Pooley says clients are typically experiencing feelings of panic \u2013 with some having panic attacks for the first time \u2013 and that this is worsened by feeling unable to share their problems. \u201cPeople are making them out to be heroes but they are potentially trying to hold on to their own fears for their safety, [because they feel] a huge sense of responsibility,\u201d she says.</p> <p>While it\u2019s necessary to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/26/heroism-is-the-most-human-of-qualities\">praise the heroism</a> of NHS staff in this crisis, it is also important to acknowledge that they can be vulnerable and need help, or else potential psychological problems risk being buried by a \u201cwartime\u201d narrative. As in the armed forces, there\u2019s a pressure to be \u201cstrong\u201d \u2013 especially, one nurse tells me, because \u201ceveryone is clapping for you\u201d. Being unable to talk about what you\u2019re feeling can have long-term repercussions when seeking help depends on being able to recognise symptoms. Awareness is improving, but it can still take a long time to realise that you are suffering from a mental health condition that could benefit from treatment. Better understanding of the symptoms of PTSD \u2013 which include hypervigilance, edginess, flashbacks or nightmares, intrusive thoughts, negative beliefs and avoidance \u2013 will help some healthcare workers realise they need help.</p> <p>Peer support is vital, too. Anne may not feel able to talk to her family about what she is experiencing at work but she has a network of friends and colleagues in the profession with whom she can share. Having had PTSD herself, she is involved in mental health planning at her trust. \u201cAt the moment, I\u2019ve been really pleased to see such an emphasis on mental health support for staff,\u201d she says.</p> <p>As well as Frontline19, staff can access employee assistance schemes, a number of apps and resources have been made available, and PTSD guidance has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/20/military-veterans-help-draft-ptsd-guidance-for-nhs-workers\">drawn up by military veterans</a>. The important thing, Anne says, is that it continues in the long-term, after the \u201cflurry of support\u201d that often follows a critical incident. For some staff, it could be six months or a year before symptoms develop.</p> <p>On Anne\u2019s ward, the crying cupboard has been replaced by a \u201cwellbeing area\u201d, where staff can take a vital few minutes off the ward when it all gets too much. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how valuable that is,\u201d she says.

  "<p>The mayor of Prague has said he is under police protection from a \u201crisk to my life\u201d, with one Czech investigative outlet reporting he had been targeted in a Russian poisoning plot.</p> <p>Zden\u011bk H\u0159ib confirmed on Monday that police had placed him under protection several weeks ago after identifying a threat against him, but declined to say whether had been been targeted by Russia or reveal the nature of threat.</p> <p>\u201cFirst of all I should say that it is very important for me to stand by my belief although it means a risk for my life,\u201d H\u0159ib said in an interview with Russia\u2019s independent Echo of Moscow radio station. \u201cThe police protection was simply given to me by the Czech police. By their decision, I am not able to comment on the reasons.\u201d</p> <p>H\u0159ib added he had been under police protection for more than two weeks. Last week, Czech media reported he had been placed under \u201ctemporary police protection\u201d and had filed a police complaint after concerns he was being followed near his home. The Guardian has reached out to H\u0159ib for comment.</p> <p>On Sunday, the Czech weekly magazine <a href=\"https://www.respekt.cz/tydenik/2020/18/muz-s-ricinem\">Respekt</a> reported that a person carrying Russian diplomatic papers had arrived in Prague three weeks ago with the objective of assassinating H\u0159ib and another Czech politician, Ond\u0159ej Kol\u00e1\u0159. The news website, citing anonymous sources in Czech intelligence, said the would-be assassin had been carrying a suitcase containing the lethal poison ricin.</p> <p>Neither Czech law enforcement, nor the Czech politicians have confirmed that report. Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Vladimir Putin, called it \u201ca fake\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t know anything at all about this investigation,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who did the investigation. It looks like yet another canard.\u201d</p> <p>Both politicians have been outspoken in local conflicts involving Russia. H\u0159ib had spoken favourably about the renaming the square in front of the Russian embassy in honour of Boris Nemtsov, an opposition politician slain in sight of the Kremlin in 2015. The Russian embassy in Prague last week said it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/russia-changes-address-embassy-boris-nemtsov-square-prague\">would not take an address on the square</a>, but use the address of a street to which it is also adjacent.</p> <p>Kol\u00e1\u0159, the mayor of the Prague 6 municipality, played a prominent role in efforts to take down a statue to the Soviet-era Marshal Ivan Konev, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/russia-opens-criminal-case-after-czech-officials-remove-soviet-statue\">removal </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/russia-opens-criminal-case-after-czech-officials-remove-soviet-statue\">of which</a> earlier this month was met with angry protests by Russia\u2019s embassy in Prague and in Moscow. \u201cKonev has been toppled, but Konev will stand again \u2013 only in the museum,\u201d Kol\u00e1r said, according to local news reports after the statue was removed.</p> <p>Kol\u00e1\u0159 had previously been given police protection due to the conflict over the statue, which had been ongoing for years. In 2019 he said he had been forced to leave Prague after receiving threats by email, social media and text message.</p>",
  "<p>New rules have come into force legally requiring most people in Germany to wear face masks on public transport, long-distance trains and in shops.</p> <p>The so-called <em>Maskenpflicht</em> (mask duty) was introduced in 15 of the country\u2019s 16 states on Monday morning. The northern state of Schleswig-Holstein will on Wednesday be the last state to implement the legislation.</p> <p>Fines of between \u20ac25 and \u20ac10,000 can be imposed on those who fail to wear a mask, with rates differing widely across the country, and some states, such as Berlin and Brandenburg, insisting they would not levy fines at all, but would rely instead on people showing each other mutual respect by wearing them. Other states said they would allow a few days of grace for people to get used to the new rule.</p> <p>The heftiest fines will apply to shopkeepers whose staff are caught not wearing masks, and there are incremental fine systems in some states for repeat offenders.</p> <p>Authorities have been quick to insist the masks do not have to be medically approved. Scarfs or cloths over the nose or mouth are adequate. Tailors across the country, as well as bands of hobby sewers have been busy making masks to meet high demand, while there are reports of elastic shortages. Some states, such as Saxony and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, have said they will provide masks to their citizens.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Germany\" data-alt=\"Germany coronavirus graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Germany\">Germany coronavirus graphic</a> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the decision has drawn scorn from some medical experts, who say non-medical masks will have little effect in stemming the spread of the virus, and could even encourage it, if masks are worn incorrectly.</p> <p>\u201cPoliticians have known for three months that we have this problem, and have not managed to have FFP2 masks (which filter the air and can keep viruses out) produced in Germany or to import them. That is not a problem that it can offload on to the people,\u201d Frank Ulrich Montgomery, the chairman of the World Medical Association, told broadcaster Deutschlandfunk. He said the proper wearing of a mask was complicated. \u201cPeople are in danger of contaminating themselves if they wear a mask incorrectly,\u201d he said, adding that masks can lead to a false sense of security.</p> <p>Decision-makers have stressed the psychological importance of wearing a face covering, saying it sends out a signal to people who might come too near. They have repeatedly insisted the wearing of masks is altruistic, with the masks protecting less the wearer than those who they are in close proximity to, by limiting the dispersion of drops if a person coughs, sneezes or spits.</p> <p>As Deutsche Bahn, the national rail provider, announced the restrictions on its trains, it said there was a need for European countries to reach out and agree on rules for trains travelling across the borders with Belgium and the Netherlands, which unlike other borders have not closed.</p> <p>But as Germans sought to understand the rules \u2013 which could radically alter social interactions by hiding facial expressions \u2013 in a confusing twist car drivers were warned not to wear coverings that completely disguised their faces or risk a \u20ac60 fine. This is largely so they can still be recognised by speed cameras and police surveillance. Since October 2017 it has been illegal for people to cover their face while driving, with veils, burqas and niqabs specifically singled out. Passengers are not affected.</p> <p>In most states the mask duty applies to those aged six or seven and over. People with disabilities for whom wearing a mask would be inappropriate, such as those with breathing difficulties, are exempt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Amid calls for unified rules governing the <em>Maskenpflicht</em>, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor \u2013 who has offered tips on keeping masks hygienic such as ironing them \u2013 has said a meeting with all the state heads on Thursday will seek to at the very least come up with a nationwide fine system.</p> <p>A poll by the Kantar market research institute found that acceptance for mask wearing was extremely high, with 97% of those asked saying they supported the rule and recognised the importance of keeping it to help tackle coronavirus.</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>My father, John Jones, who has died aged 73, was a criminal barrister and a crown court recorder.</p> <p>He was called to the Bar in 1972 and worked mainly as defence counsel on serious fraud cases, including in the areas of banking, corruption, Ponzi schemes and huge credit and DSS frauds. But he also took on cases that involved arms and drugs importations, as well as people smuggling. Two of his biggest trials involved excise frauds in which tens of millions of pounds of alcohol and tobacco duties had been illegally avoided.</p> <p>He became an assistant recorder in 1991 and then a recorder in 1997, working in crown courts on the south east of England circuit until his retirement in 2014.</p> <p>Born in Southampton, John was the only child of William Jones, a Welsh butcher, and Annie Foley, an Irish boarding-house landlady. He went to St Mary\u2019s school in Southampton and after being kicked out of Leeds University for spending too much time in the air squadron - and too little studying for his engineering degree \u2013 he set his sights on the Bar.</p> <p>It soon became clear that he had found his vocation - and his wife. He met Carmel Green, who was also studying law and who too became a barrister, in the reading room of the Inner Temple in London, and they were married in 1973.</p> <p>He loved every day of his four decades as a barrister and judge \u2013 particularly his time as a pupil master, helping to train young barristers. Those he mentored were subjected to his awful jokes and often found themselves dispatched on character-building errands to pick up a copy of the London Evening Standard or a packet of fruit pastilles. Occasionally they were even pressed into babysitting. John was also well known for wearing fancy dress to the annual party thrown by one of his solicitors, even though it was not actually a fancy dress event.</p> <p>In his spare time he was a car and aeroplane enthusiast, and our childhoods were punctuated with visits to airshows and transport museums, while the garden was oil-slicked by a succession of \u201cclassics\u201d that were picked up at auction and tolerated by my mother with remarkable forbearance.</p> <p>Local history and architecture also fascinated him, and he chaired his local conservation society in west London for many years, showing a disdain for internal opposition and democratic norms that would have won him plaudits in Pyongyang. He was also an incorrigible tinkerer with houses, forever looking for ways to extend and improve his property. The house was always full of friends, neighbours and anyone else who needed his help and advice.</p> <p>John retired, reluctantly, after a huge stroke following surgery in 2014. The last few years of his life were also affected by dementia, but even at the end, when his speech had deserted him and his only pleasures were a bunch of grapes or a bar of chocolate, his smile remained intact and there was never a flicker of self-pity.</p> <p>He is survived by Carmel, and their three children, Damian, Imogen and me, and four grandchildren.</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>If we are honest, most of us yearn for the easy gratification and vicarious glamour of a globe-spanning thriller \u2013 the only reason we don\u2019t watch them every day is that they so often come encrusted with musty denim masculinity and conservative geopolitics. In 2018, Killing Eve swept all that away with one flick of its wrist. Here instead were women effortlessly revolutionising all the traditionally male roles, with every line of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/phoebe-waller-bridge\">Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a>\u2019s script a casually spat pearl. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/06/sandra-oh-killing-eve-golden-globes-host\">Sandra Oh</a> was Eve, an MI5 desk-jockey with a reckless interest in a series of elaborate murders. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/jodie-comer\">Jodie Comer</a>\u2019s Villanelle, the culprit, was one of TV\u2019s best ever stone-cold assassins.</p> <p>Those first few kills, spread across pristinely hip continental locations and soundtracked by smoky French-language pop, were so, so cool, setting up Villanelle as a crazed nihilist who was unimpressed by her own invincibility, nonplussed by money and tired of her impeccable wardrobe. The only time she wasn\u2019t bored to death was when she was watching someone die. There was a golden period at the start of Killing Eve when we felt like we could watch her do her deliciously terrible thing for ever.</p> <p>But it couldn\u2019t last for ever. In the end, it lasted \u2026 about four-and-a-half episodes. At the core of the story is a pas de deux between Eve and Villanelle. We can imagine why they are obsessed with each other (they both have a different woman inside them screaming to get out, and each sees this person in the other) but dramatically speaking, it has never been nailed down. It was just sort of \u2026 announced. In London, Eve was told that a woman had likely committed all these wonderful, awful crimes. Meanwhile, in Moscow or Ljubljana or the 3rd Arrondissement or wherever, Villanelle was told about the woman heading up a new off-books unit dedicated to tracking her. Each instantly decided they were besotted with their new life-defining nemesis and that was that.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh1icDxH5R0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vh1icDxH5R0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This problem of a central dynamic with no solid foundation has never been satisfactorily resolved. Eve\u2019s desire to swap domestic comfort for international peril has come closer to working over time but, despite repeated attempts to give Villanelle a plausible motivation for not doing what the programme\u2019s title teases, she remains a mood, not a character. The show could only survive for as long as this capricious deity never met the ruffled everywoman Eve \u2013 but it opened the oven door to check on that souffle halfway through season one, whereupon Killing Eve stopped being diaphanous and untouchable and started resembling one of those comedy thrillers where a humble putz, mixed up with the mob, keeps surviving due to massive contrivances.</p> <p>It seemed almost cruel when Waller-Bridge, like the songwriter in a platinum-selling band handing their guitar to a fan and saying \u201cwrite the next album\u201d, relinquished her showrunning duties for seasons two and three, which duly played the same chords slightly off beat. Writing dialogue as smart as Waller-Bridge\u2019s is hard. Replicating the rush of Killing Eve when it was fresh out of the box is impossible. </p>",
  "<h2><strong>The album to start with</strong></h2> <p><strong>Godfather (CTA Records, 2017)</strong></p> <p>Wiley told the world: \u201cEskiboy\u2019s the reason why everybody\u2019s here\u201d back in 2006, on the cult classic Roll Deep single When I\u2019m Ere. In grime\u2019s relatively short lifespan, the maverick genre has produced some of the finest albums and moments in contemporary British music: Mercury prizes and Glastonbury headliners. But there can only be one Godfather. A music career now in its fourth decade has produced 12 albums and a trove of singles, freestyles, radio sets, mixtapes and EPs. The man has more music than the Sahara has sand.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H452pG38S64\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H452pG38S64?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Wiley: Bring Them All/Holy Grime \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>As an in, his 2017 album Godfather offers a seamless trip through his sprawling back catalogue and legacy. Wiley\u2019s 11th album arrived in the fires of last decade\u2019s grime renaissance, a revival that saw the genre shatter music industry glass ceilings and swarm across the country. After landmark albums and single releases from Skepta and Stormzy, Wiley followed up with an album heralded as his crowning glory, a deserved victory lap to mark the success of a scene he had sacrificed himself to build: a showcase of the undisputed craftsmanship and erratic genius that has come to define his reign.</p> <p>Wiley\u2019s music is a distinct brand. Over these 17 songs, he swings flow as sharp as a guillotine, razing through high-pitched and adrenaline-fuelled instrumentals. Bring Them All/Holy Grime, a duet with Dagenham MC Devlin, shows Wiley at his most thrilling. The two fence over heady production that sounds like an orchestra on speed. The song carries the dizzying excitement of a skydive, the finesse of an F1 driver \u2013 and yet Wiley starts by mumbling: \u201cDrink \u2018nuff beers before the game, what d\u2019ya call that? Georgie Best MC\u201d, the kind of random cues that underpin his eccentric brilliance.</p> <p>Godfather puts a bow on Wiley\u2019s legacy and sees him connect with successive grime generations. On This is an engrossing, long-awaited reunion with MC prodigies Chip and Ice Kid, who Wiley first took under his wing and up to BBC Radio 1 for<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt9tfVyxggU\"> a now-legendary freestyle session when they were no more than 16</a>. Joe Bloggs is a titanic collaboration with D Double E and Footsie. And the final track, P Money is a tribute to its namesake, arguably grime\u2019s most consistent practitioner in recent times. On a remix for the album, P Money offers a verse of his own.</p> <p>A marriage of the boyish hunger and seasoned wisdom Wiley has honed over decades, Godfather is the high watermark of a prodigious career.</p> <h2><strong>The three to check out next</strong></h2> <p><strong>Treddin\u2019 on Thin Ice (XL Recordings, 2004)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpZGpmTFUdg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MpZGpmTFUdg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Wiley: Eskimo \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In retrospect, Treddin\u2019 on Thin Ice was less of an earth-shattering debut album proper, more the opening chapter teasing a thrilling catalogue to come. Still, the album features some of Wiley\u2019s \u2013 and grime\u2019s \u2013 most important records. Wot Do U Call It bullishly charts the splintering of UK garage and its winding devolution into what would eventually become grime. Perhaps most critically, the early grime instrumental Eskimo gets an official release. Originally produced around 2002, the arctic instrumental, inspired by Wiley\u2019s fascination with bleak weather and winter, is a cultural artefact that showcases grime in its embryonic form.</p> <p><strong>Playtime Is Over (Big Dada, 2007)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyRiQku-q3g\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YyRiQku-q3g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Wiley: Slippin \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Around 2007, Wiley was threatening to retire from life as an MC. After Playtime Is Over, he planned a retreat into the shadows, leaving a new breed of MCs to take hold of the scene. Thirteen years later, the album originally pitched as his swan song ranks as one of his finest studio albums. Over a skittish set of largely self-produced songs, we find Wiley surging with composed aggression as he reflects on his life growing up in east London: Nothing About Me and Slippin detail the fears, desires and ambitions that had riddled his life so far.</p> <p><strong>The Best of Tunnel Vision (Eskibeat Recordings, 2007)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4g4DQmDXi0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_4g4DQmDXi0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Wiley: Nan, I Am London \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>For a certain generation, the lore that surrounds Wiley began with the Tunnel Vision series, a string of seminal mixtapes feverishly written and released between 2006 and 2008. The first five emerged in a nine-month period, the kind of divine spark from which miracles are born. Double-disc collection Best of Tunnel Vision contains the scattered jewels from the series. At times it unspools like a diary, sketching intricate portraits of a claustrophobic grime scene and a long-torn relationship with London, as Wiley\u2019s live-wire flow darts around like a stray firecracker.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/24/wiley-godfather-grime\">Wiley: the enigmatic Godfather of Grime</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>One for the heads</strong></h2> <p><strong>Wiley and DJ Score 5 radio set (Rinse FM, 2013)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lnrNAqSF64\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7lnrNAqSF64?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Wiley and DJ Score 5: radio set \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Wiley finds flow states in radio sets and freestyles, unshackled from the confines of choruses and 16-bar verses.

Your white platelet count is down, my chemotherapy doctor explained.

He scheduled me for a shot the next day that would stimulate blood cell growth in my bone marrow.</p> <p>The doctor also explained that my creatinine is a little high, which means my kidneys aren\u2019t functioning the way they should be. To help protect my organs, they only gave me 75% of my normal dose of chemo treatment that day.</p> <p>He assured me that these were normal side-effects at this stage of cancer treatment. But I felt like I had somehow done something wrong. Maybe if I had just drunk a little more water, or eaten a healthier diet, this wouldn\u2019t have happened, I thought to myself.</p> <p>But the truth is even worse.

When we pass someone, we move as close as possible to each other, so we can all keep our distance together. Michael, my 15-year-old son, does not always participate, however.</p> <p>On Easter Sunday, rather than our usual barbecue with friends, two families we are close with visited. They stood in two separate clumps outside our yard, as Eric, my daughter James and I yelled to them from our patio.</p> <p>We chatted about what everyone had been up to, and how I was doing \u2013 a subject I have come to despise.

It was Tuesday evening and I was sitting around relaxing, when my heart started beating really fast. My cheeks flushed, and within seconds a volcanic heat was pulsing throughout my body.

  "<p>We\u2019ve all seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/13/successions-brian-cox-i-was-touched-up-by-princess-margaret\">Brian Cox</a> playing a fearsome media magnate with a perhaps non-coincidental resemblance to certain real-life figures. But many people won\u2019t realise that his performance as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/10/breath-of-fresh-heir-how-succession-became-the-must-watch-tv-of-the-year\">Succession\u2019s brutal patriarch Logan Roy</a> represents the completion of a circle. Back in 1968, when Cox was fresh out of repertory theatre, he landed the role of Lasar Opie, a junior but still pretty ruthless functionary at the heart of an imagined media landscape of the near future. And, although some of Opie\u2019s decision-making might have shocked even Logan Roy, The Year of the Sex Olympics \u2013 first shown on BBC Two \u2013 does a terrifyingly prescient job of imagining aspects of post-millennial television.</p> <p>The Year of the Sex Olympics was the brainchild of writer Nigel Kneale. Its forthcoming DVD release represents an act of retrieval: in common with so much television from the era, a colour version of the drama was wiped. By 1968, Kneale\u2019s adaptation of George Orwell\u2019s 1984 and three Quatermass serials had established him as a bleak and questioning small-screen auteur. The Year of the Sex Olympics takes place in a stratified, heavily regulated society in which the majority (known as Low Drives) are pacified by a constant diet of televised pornography produced by the ruling High Drives who control the government and media. </p> <p>It\u2019s less racy than that sounds; the action had to be sufficiently vanilla to appear on prime-time television in the late 60s. Superficially, the show resembles nothing so much as very early Doctor Who. But, although it\u2019s visually clunky at times, the physical, linguistic and behavioural world-building is convincing on its own terms, while the subject matter is smart, even revelatory. As Cox puts it in his engaging DVD commentary: \u201cIt\u2019s chilling, when you think about it, how prophetic this piece is.\u201d As the narrative unfolds, the echoes of television \u2013 and society \u2013 in 2020 become unsettling.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s chilling, when you think about it, how prophetic this piece is</p> <footer> <cite>Brian Cox</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s tempting to simply list the modern pathologies anticipated here that are all perceptively examined: the desensitising effects of porn, the invasive voyeurism of reality TV, the passivity of mass consumerism, our sensitivity to \u201ctriggers\u201d and sometimes unhealthy attachment to safe spaces, our conditioning to advertising and urbanised humanity\u2019s disconnection from nature. Matching a trajectory that will ring grimly familiar to observers of everything from Big Brother to The Jeremy Kyle Show, the effect of this unbalanced TV diet on its consumers is stupefying and eventually deadening. The Low Drives cease to react to porn. Something more \u201creal\u201d is needed to tickle their jaded palates. At which point Lasar Opie has an idea with alarming implications.</p> <p>The horror of the drama is very human and, as subsequent years have demonstrated, all too believable. Kneale was an atheist with no belief in the supernatural. Instead, The Year of the Sex Olympics was about the horror humanity might be capable of inflicting on itself. As the daughter of dissidents inside Nazi Germany in the 1930s, Kneale\u2019s wife, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/23/judith-kerr-nancy-banks-smith\">children\u2019s writer Judith Kerr</a> almost certainly influenced his worldview. Kneale is clearly interested in the lexical and, by extension, imaginative implications of mass hypnosis. In The Year of the Sex Olympics, the characters\u2019 communication has de-evolved. They speak in a sparse, detached argot that suggests a twee, baby-talk version of Nadsat, the teen-gang language in A Clockwork Orange. This is a language reduced to basics. It has lost its descriptive precision because society\u2019s horizons have become so limited. The food is protein sticks, the setting is entirely sheltered; basic human notions of discomfort (cold, hunger, pain) have been banished, but so has joy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"af5b5546d3e3f572c2a384deb4f480f87b7a437d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af5b5546d3e3f572c2a384deb4f480f87b7a437d/0_0_2200_3353/656.jpg\" alt=\"Fresh out of rep \u2026 Brian Cox as ruthless media functionary Lasar Opie.\" width=\"656\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fresh out of rep \u2026 Brian Cox as ruthless media functionary Lasar Opie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eventually, this self-limitation has practical implications. As the drama\u2019s climax approaches and a couple of the High Drives find themselves stranded in the outside world, it becomes clear that they no longer possess the apparatus for processing complex challenges or emotions. The word \u201clove\u201d is impossible to locate. The concept and properties of fire elude one character with blackly comic consequences. In his 2015 book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/08/landmarks-review-robert-macfarlane\">Landmarks</a>, Robert MacFarlane wrote about the diminishing of the \u201cword hoard\u201d as words relating to nature were nudged aside in children\u2019s dictionaries by ones connected to technology. Back in 1968, Kneale appears to have seen this coming.</p> <p>The film is admirably ambiguous; simultaneously a celebration of the freedom of the era that spawned it and a warning about potential unintended consequences. In his commentary, Cox ponders the paradoxes of the time. \u201cThe sad element of the 60s was that we weren\u2019t able to take it forward,\u201d he notes. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have enough real visionaries. It was a lost opportunity; in these islands at least, one that we\u2019ve never regained. I think in a sense, all the woes and the way the media has deteriorated stems from that. We\u2019re always so involved with our own time but you do need the prophets, the visionaries to progress.\u201d</p> <p>Like most visionaries, Kneale wasn\u2019t easily forced into a particular political or philosophical category. Inevitably, anti-obscenity campaigner Mary Whitehouse was a fierce opponent of the film and attempted to prevent its broadcast. And yet, if she had actually given it a little serious consideration, it\u2019s not impossible that she might have found some common ground with its moral position. \u201cInhibitions are like the bones in a creature,\u201d Kneale once said in reference to permissive hippy culture. \u201cYou pull all the bones out and you get a floppy jelly.\u201d There\u2019s a moral rigour at the heart of The Year of the Sex Olympics that feels anything but decadent.</p> <p>Reviewing the drama after broadcast in the Guardian, Nancy Banks-Smith sensed its prescience. \u201cThe play radiated ripples,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIs television a substitute for living? Does the spectacle of pain at a distance atrophy sympathy? Can this coffin with knobs on furnish all we need to ask?\u201d The continuing pertinence of these questions is striking. And Cox recognises it, too, perhaps shuddering as he considers a media-scape full of Logan Roys. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so important to see our history,\u201d he says, \u201cand how fast our evolution is on some levels and yet how slow it is on others. We depend on the media more and more and yet it\u2019s becoming more and more distorted and hard to believe. This programme predicts all of that.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://shop.bfi.org.uk/the-year-of-the-sex-olympics-dvd.html#.XqK2ldNKho4\">The Year of the Sex Olympics</a> is available on DVD now.<br></p>",

We brought another 45 ventilators to Italy as a gift, as well as protective suits, masks, personal protection systems and test kits\u201d.</p> <p>Where were the tests sent? \u201cWe suggested that Italy give them to Bergamo, but we don\u2019t know where they ended up\u201d.</p> <p>When are they planning to return to Russia? \u201cThese terms have not been defined, for the moment we are trying to give the best of ourselves\u201d, says Alexander Volosatov, the deputy head of media of the Russian defence ministry, who accompanies Yumanov throughout.</p> <p>Are they waiting for everyone to be cured? \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for the epidemiological situation to stabilise\u201d Volosatov says.</p> <p>It is still not clear how the Russian involvement came about. A politician from Matteo Salvini\u2019s pro-Russia Lega party <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/21/russia-coronavirus-offensive-200199\">claims he brokered</a> the intervention via the German far-right party the AfD. The colonel says it was a bilateral arrangement between Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, and the Russian president, Vladmir Putin. \u201cRelations with Italy have always been good\u201d he says.</p> <p>Oliviero Valoti, health director of this temporary hospital acknowledges early concerns about the Russian presence, from a medical perspective. \u201cWe were worried about language barrier issues and also cultural issues. In reality I must say that they have proved very efficient. They have aligned themselves perfectly with our approach, both from the therapeutic standpoint and from the clinical management of patients.\u201d</p> <p>Stepping across the wide corridor that separates the different sectors of the hospital, Valoti, an anaesthetist , talks admiringly about the ventilators flown in from Moscow on Russian cargo planes: \u201cAll the equipment in there consists of respirators donated by the Russian contingent. These are respirators that do not exist in the west. We have evaluated and used them, they are of the highest quality. They are extremely useful in intensive care.\u201d</p> <p>Guido Marinoni, president of the order of Bergamo doctors, contrasts the Russian intervention with EU solidarity. \u201cRussian military doctors work at the [field] hospital. Albanians, Cubans, Chinese doctors came too. But Germans didn\u2019t come, the French and Americans didn\u2019t come. This might make one think. It\u2019s not as if there was no coronavirus in China and in Russia.\u201d</p> <p>In fact 44 critically ill patients were airlifted by the Germany military from Bergamo to hospitals with spare capacity in North Rhine Westphalia and Saxony, although the patient transfer scheme began after the Russians\u2019 arrival. Germany also supplied Italy with ventilators while at least eight other EU governments provided protective equipment.</p> <p>Within the wards at the field hospital the patients are mostly male, many elderly and a few under thirty. </p> <p>Mauro Poleni, a 27-year-old technician from Paladina, was transferred here on 11 April. \u201cAt the beginning it was a bit strange. I thought it would be difficult to communicate with [the Russians], but the interpreters are good. They intervened promptly when I had a fever of 40\u201d.</p> <p>Infection rates and hospital admissions in Bergamo are now falling, and the city\u2019s youth are eager to resume their lives and jobs when lockdown is eased on 4 May. But traumatised by the losses in the city and villages of the surrounding valleys \u2013 officially the province of a million people lost 2,700 people, but the real toll is estimated to be closer to 5,000 \u2013 many older people remain wary.</p> <p>Dr Marinoni expresses a similar concern about resuming as before: \u201cIf we do not make sure that a gradual return is accompanied by a control of the infectious capacity of people going back to work, we are in dramatic danger of this taking off again\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Earlier this month in the Guardian, the Lancet editor, Richard Horton, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/deadly-virus-britain-failed-prepare-mers-sars-ebola-coronavirus\">suggested that</a> \u201ccoronavirus is the greatest global science policy failure in a generation\u201d. He recalled the many experts who have been predicting such a pandemic, some for decades, and argued that in the UK, \u201cthe experts \u2013 scientists who have modelled and simulated our possible futures \u2013 made assumptions that turned out to be mistaken.\u201d If he is right, and I think he is, then we should ask, why?</p> <p>I\u2019ve been researching the control of infectious diseases for 30 years, and I believe that an earlier debacle \u2013 one perhaps forgotten by many \u2013 offers insights. In 1976, fearful that an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_swine_flu_outbreak\">outbreak of swine influenza</a> at Fort Dix army camp in New Jersey was the centre of an influenza pandemic on a scale potentially similar to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/1918-flu-pandemic-coronavirus-drug-trials-scientists-treatments-evidence\">1918 </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/1918-flu-pandemic-coronavirus-drug-trials-scientists-treatments-evidence\">Spanish flu</a>, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised President Gerald Ford of the urgent need for a mass immunisation programme.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/21/doubt-essential-science-politicians-coronavirus\">Doubt is essential for science \u2013 but for politicians, it's a sign of weakness | Jim Al-Khalili</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The similarity between this swine influenza and the 1918 pandemic was overstated. But in the meantime, 40 million Americans were vaccinated. And the vaccine was associated with cases of <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/\">Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome</a>, some fatal. In the immediate aftermath, the affair was seen as a fiasco.</p> <p>In their remarkable study of the event, Richard Neustadt and Harvey Fineberg set out the lessons learned. <a href=\"https://www.nap.edu/catalog/12660/the-swine-flu-affair-decision-making-on-a-slippery-disease\">Their report</a>, The Swine Flu Affair: Decision-Making on a Slippery Disease, is unlike almost every other report I have ever read. It is a candid, unsanitised analysis that aims to determine the managerial errors made and draw lessons so that they would not be repeated. The report was commissioned by Joseph Califano, Ford\u2019s secretary of health, education and welfare: \u201cLessons were what he wanted,\u201d wrote the report\u2019s authors, \u201cnot a history; finger-pointing did not interest him in terms of last time; his concern was with next time.\u201d</p> <p>What lessons from that report should we reflect on now? Two, I think, are especially important. First, we should be cautious that experts may be overconfident in theories that are \u201cspun from meagre evidence\u201d. Second, we should question \u201cscientific logic and implementation prospects\u201d.</p> <p>The key issue the authors identified was that groupthink led to misjudgments of the evidence, and failed to question assumptions; and voices that opposed were silenced, excluded or denied entry. \u201cCollegial relations\u201d in key advisory committees were too close, many members worked \u201cwith mutual confidence\u201d. They \u201cwould talk it out together before writing memoranda to each other\u201d. In a critical passage, the report states: \u201cPanels tend toward \u2018group think\u2019 and over-selling, tendencies nurtured by long-standing interchanges and intimacy, as in the influenza fraternity. Other competent scientists, who do not share their group identity or vested interests, should be able to appraise the scientific logic applied to available evidence.\u201d</p> <p>I know many of the current members of the UK\u2019s key government committees. The membership of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) is <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/new-and-emerging-respiratory-virus-threats-advisory-group\">publicly available</a>. The membership of the more important committee, the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/scientific-advisory-group-for-emergencies-sage\">Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies</a> (Sage), which is responsible for scientific advice to the Cabinet Office briefing room, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/revealed-dominic-cummings-on-secret-scientific-advisory-group-for-covid-19\">was revealed on Friday</a> after a list was leaked.</p> <p>I like all the people I know on these committees. They are extremely bright. And I believe their values and motivations are \u201cgood\u201d. But I worry that their intimacy, their familiarity, lends itself to groupthink. Are there sufficient contrarian views? Are critically important assumptions subjected to sufficient critique? Is groupthink acknowledged as a risk, and if so, how is it addressed?</p> <p>The roles taken on by the members are enormously important. The decision-making process is challenging, but must be scrutinised. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and self-identified member of Sage, has talked of receiving personal abuse because of his position on Sage. But the deliberations and minutes and, in my view, the academic disciplines of the members should be made public, if not members\u2019 names. Transparency and scrutiny are critically important if groupthink is to be avoided. The revelation that Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s adviser, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/25/top-tories-demand-dominic-cummings-sage-bar-cross-party-call\">has been attending Sage meetings</a>, adds urgency to this demand.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/25/top-tories-demand-dominic-cummings-sage-bar-cross-party-call\">Top Tories join calls to bar Cummings from scientific advisory group</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Without this, the integrity, impartiality, and independence of the committee and its members will continue to be regarded as suspect. When political influence is added to groupthink among scientists \u2013 should it have occurred \u2013 then the result can only be a diminution of the committee\u2019s authority and the advice it gives.</p> <p>In their report, Neustadt and Fineberg wrote: \u201cPolicy decisions regarding influenza rest on judgments about the behaviour of the virus, the impact of the disease and our ability to interdict its course. But the virus is capricious, the disease elusive, and our remedies imperfect.\u201d All of us involved in attempting to control Covid-19, which means all of us, should reflect with humility, embrace those who challenge our assumptions, and draw on these lessons. </p> <p>\u2022 Richard Coker is emeritus professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Symptoms of Covid-19 appear to be partly down to genetic makeup, researchers at King\u2019s College London have discovered.</p> \n<p>The finding is based on data collected through the Covid-19 Symptom Tracker app, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/24/uk-app-aims-to-help-researchers-track-spread-of-coronavirus\">launched by the team last month</a>.</p> \n<p>While members of the public are encouraged to use the app to track how they feel day to day, the team also asked thousands of twins in the UK, who were already part of another research project, to use the app and record whether they had symptoms or not. The team employed machine-learning algorithms, together with data from the 2.7 million app users \u2013 many of whom have been tested for coronavirus \u2013 to work out the combination of symptoms that indicate an individual is likely to have Covid-19.</p> \n<p>The team then focused on data from just over 2,600 twins to try to establish whether the symptoms experienced by those predicted to have Covid-19 was related to genetic makeup.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe idea was to basically look at the similarities in symptoms or non-symptoms between the identical twins, who share 100% of their genes, and the non-identical twins, who only share half of their genes,\u201d Prof Tim Spector, one of the scientists leading the endeavour, told the Guardian. \u201cIf there is a genetic factor in expressing the symptoms then we\u2019d see a greater similarity in the identical [twins] than the non-identical [twins] and that is basically what we showed.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20072124v1\">The study, which has not yet been peer reviewed</a>, took into account whether the twins were in the same household, with the results revealing that genetic factors explained about 50% of the differences between people\u2019s symptoms of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>More specifically, the team found a substantial genetic influence for the symptoms of fever, diarrhoea, delirium, and losses of taste and smell. By contrast, a hoarse voice, a cough, skipped meals, chest pain, and abdominal pain were not linked to genetic makeup.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0a09a661-0ee2-41ea-b0a0-9e1deefd9268\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is Covid-19?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThis disease is very weird, the way it has a very different presentation in the population in different people \u2013 what we are showing is that isn\u2019t random,\u201d Spector said. \u201cIt is not mainly due to where you live or who you have seen; a lot of it is something innate about you.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think you can say that your likelihood of getting it at all, or getting it severely, is under some genetic control.\u201d</p> \n<p>The team hopes the findings will help scientists ascertain the mechanisms by which Covid-19 acts on the body, as well as offering a possible way to predict those most at risk from the disease.</p> \n<p>\u201cUnderstanding how symptoms of [the disease] Covid-19 pass through the population may indicate the pathogenic mechanisms of [the virus] Sars-CoV-2 infection, as well as offering utility in the allocation of scarce healthcare resources, particularly intensive care beds,\u201d the team writes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>They say the results could also help researchers around the world identify genetic variants that play a role in explaining why some individuals show no, or only mild, symptoms of Covid-19, which could in turn aid the development of drugs for the disease.</p> \n<p>But there were other possible targets, Spector said, noting that genetics were closely linked to the immune system and microbes found in the gut.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt reassures everyone that it is worth exploring this whole triangle of genes, immune system and gut microbes,\u201d he said.</p>",

In Carlisle, for example, <a href=\"https://www.athomepc.co.uk/\">@Home PC</a> is advertising contact-free delivery on laptops and accessories.</p> <p>In the US, you can find most electronic goods on <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/\">Best Buy</a>, which has an Amazon-price-match guarantee. With an added in-store Geek Squad to deal with all your electronic woes (once the shutdown is over, of course), it strikes a nice balance between online convenience and in-store customer service. It is currently offering curbside deliveries, too, which helps to keep you and your courier safe.</p> <p><strong>Household products</strong></p> <p>Environmentally friendly cleaning products, pet food and baby gear are available at <a href=\"https://www.ethicalsuperstore.com/\">Ethicalsuperstore.com</a>. Standard delivery in the UK is free on orders over \u00a350, or \u00a33.95 on smaller orders. It is a good place to buy in bulk \u2013 Ecover laundry liquid, for example, is available in a range of sizes up to 15 litres, which sells for \u00a349.59. Its <a href=\"https://www.ethicalsuperstore.com/covid-19-update/\">website has a lengthy description</a> of what it is doing to keep staff safe.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.wilko.com/\">Wilko\u2019s stores</a> are still open, and so is its online shop. It is offering delivery within seven days for a \u00a35 fee. Cleaning products, pet food and nappies are all available, as well as items from its DIY, gardening and stationery ranges. However, the virtual toiletries aisle looks pretty bare (when we checked, most toothpaste and shower gel was out of stock).</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.viking-direct.co.uk/en/viking-advantages\">Viking-direct.co.uk</a> usually supplies offices, but individuals can register. It sells all kinds of things you might need at work, home or the current hybrid of the two, including bin liners, dishwasher tablets, toilet rolls and biscuits. Delivery is free on orders over \u00a330 and is usually next day.</p> <p>For US customers, <a href=\"https://www.target.com/\">Target </a>has it all, from nappies to kids\u2019 toys to groceries. The store lets you select items by delivery option, including same-day delivery and store pickup. The same-day option uses Shipt, meaning free delivery for Shipt members, or those using a free trial; the free trial lasts four weeks. If you are not a Shipt member, the markup is applied per item, so it can end up getting pricey. Currently, you can expect purchases made at the beginning of the week to be delivered at the end of the week \u2013 but these windows are particularly sensitive to change at the moment.</p> <p><strong>Beauty and personal care</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.superdrug.com/\">Superdrug</a>\u2019s shops are open, and it is running a same-day delivery service from some shops via a courier firm called <a href=\"https://www.superdrug.com/stuart-delivery\">Stuart</a>. The delivery charge starts at \u00a35.40. You need to check that it works from a local branch before you make your order. If it doesn\u2019t, you can use the usual delivery service, which is free for loyalty card holders on orders over \u00a310 and for everyone spending more than \u00a315.</p> <p>For high-end beauty items, take a look at the companies\u2019 own sites. <a href=\"https://www.clarins.co.uk/\">Clarins</a>\u2019 online shop is still open, for instance, and delivery is free on orders over \u00a350. <a href=\"https://www.benefitcosmetics.com/uk/en-gb/bestsellers/whats-new\">Benefit</a> warns that its orders are taking a couple of weeks to arrive, but it does have a sale on so it may be worth the wait.</p> <p>For electric toothbrushes, razors and the like, manufacturers often offer direct sales. <a href=\"https://www.philips.co.uk/\">Philips</a> is offering free delivery on a range that includes personal care items, baby bottle sterilisers and very upmarket juicers. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.very.co.uk/\">Very.co.uk</a> is effectively an online department store, with a huge range of beauty products at different price points, and tech from men\u2019s grooming products to hairdryers. It also stocks toys, appliances and a small range of DVDs and music.</p> <p>In the US, <a href=\"https://community.sephora.com/t5/COVID-19/Store-Closure-COVID-19-Update/m-p/5228757\">Sephora offers high-street and luxury beauty products</a>. Sephora is a multinational chain, so unlike platforms where you buy from individual sellers, there is less reason to worry about counterfeit products. Plus you get two free samples with every order. Standard shipping orders can take up to two weeks to arrive, or you can choose a range of <a href=\"https://www.sephora.com/beauty/shipping-information\">speedier delivery options</a>, normally at a higher cost.</p> <p>Depop is like eBay, but for trendy clothing and beauty products. The platform has listings from a range of individual sellers and stores, and there are star ratings so you can choose to buy from trusted sellers. Purchases are protected by PayPal. </p> <p><strong>Entertainment</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s hard to avoid Amazon if you want to watch something that it has bought the rights for, but for films and music there are many other options.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/\">BFI has new and classic films to rent on its website</a>. One-off rentals start at \u00a32.50 each, or a subscription offers older films. That costs \u00a34.99 a month, but there is a 14-day free trial at the start.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.curzonhomecinema.com/content/in-cinemas-now\">Curzon</a> is offering the cinema experience at home, with very recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/01/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-review-celine-sciamma\">films such as Portrait of a Lady on Fire</a> available to stream for less than \u00a310. You don\u2019t need to subscribe to watch, and there is a free film when you register your details.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cinemaparadiso.co.uk/\">Cinema Paradiso</a> has a wider range of films and TV programmes, but this is a DVD rental service so you can\u2019t watch straight away. Again there is a 14-day free trial; the monthly cost depends on which subscription you choose. The basic one is \u00a35.99 and offers two rentals a month.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.zavvi.com/\">Zavvi</a> is not on the high street any longer, but lives online selling DVDs, music and games \u2013 both electronic and board. You can buy a delivery pass for \u00a39.99, which gives you standard delivery for a year and reduces the cost of the next-day service. It is warning that, to protect staff, orders are taking 48 hours longer than usual.</p> <p><a href=\"https://store.hmv.com/\">HMV</a> does most of its business online these days, too, and is another option if you don\u2019t need to watch something straight away.</p> <p><strong>Books</strong></p> <p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/23/amazon-mystery-250000-pound-donor-to-uk-bookshops\">Amazon was revealed to be the mystery donor of \u00a3250,000</a> to a fund to help bookshops suffering hardship. The organisers welcomed the gesture, while also noting that there was still \u201cno greater threat to high-street bookselling\u201d than the US giant.</p> <p>Books are in fact some of the easiest items to find a good alternative source for. Many independent shops are offering deliveries \u2013 a lot will order titles for you even if they don\u2019t have them in stock. You can find local shops <a href=\"https://www.booksellers.org.uk/home#\">via the Booksellers Association\u2019s website</a>.</p> <p>There are also online-only shops such as Wordery.com, which has more than 10m books available and also some notebooks and a very small number of games. It offers free delivery worldwide, although there is quite a <a href=\"https://wordery.com/covid-19-statement\">long list of countries that it cannot currently send books to</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.biggreenbookshop.com/\">The Big Green Bookshop</a> will order what you want and get it sent to you. It runs a weekly \u201cbuy a stranger a book\u201d scheme on its website and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Biggreenbooks?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter feed</a>, so if you have spare cash you can treat someone else.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.hive.co.uk/\">Hive.co.uk</a> is selling ebooks and books for home delivery and paying double commission to the smaller bookshops it normally uses for collection service. It is currently taking orders only for the UK and relies on Royal Mail for deliveries, so how long your order takes will vary depending on your local service. You can choose which shop the commission goes to, so if your local shop is not currently trading, this is a way to get some money to it. It usually sells CDs and DVDs, too, so keep an eye out in case they are added to its offering.</p> <p><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/\">The Guardian Bookshop</a> supports the newspaper and offers books at a discount. There is currently 20% off children\u2019s activity books, which could prove handy. Delivery is free on orders of \u00a315 or more.</p> <p>For ebooks, many libraries, for instance, are offering loans online \u2013 check out your local council\u2019s website for details. It is possible to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/246323/how_to_convert_an_ebook_to_the_amazon_kindle_format.html\">convert ebooks bought elsewhere</a> to Kindle\u2019s format using free software <a href=\"https://calibre-ebook.com/\">such as Calibre</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ebooks.com/\">Ebooks.com</a> serves customers around the world and has titles starting at 99p in the UK. It has <a href=\"https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/retailers/shopping-guide/booksellers\">got the thumbs-up from Ethical Consumer magazine</a> and is the only ebook seller in its top five.</p> <p>Through <a href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/\">Indiebound</a>, readers in the US can search for and buy from independent booksellers. You can search by zip code or store name \u2013 in case you are looking to support a particular store. Speed and cost of shipping depends on the bookstore.</p> <p>Alternatively, <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/\">Bookshop</a> is a platform that has been set up to help independent stores make a profit. Stores earn 30% commission on any sales they generate, while Bookshop handles the packing, shipping and returns for them and runs the website. It also puts 10% of its non-bookstore affiliated sales into an overall earnings pool that is evenly divided up and shared with participating stores every six months. In March, <a href=\"https://nerdist.com/article/bookshop-new-independent-bookstore-retailer/\">it raised more than $230,000 for independent stores</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 May 2020 to remove an incorrect reference to only being able to buy Kindle versions of ebooks on Amazon.</p> <p><br></p>",

He wrote the sequence years after the experience, and published it in 1977, by which time his major collections, <a href=\"https://edwinmorgan.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/1960s/the_second_life.html\">The Second Life</a> (1968) and <a href=\"https://edwinmorgan.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/1970s/from_glasgow_to_saturn.html\">From Glasgow to Saturn</a> (1973) had established his reputation. He chose the right moment for himself as a poet: it\u2019s as if the poem had always been waiting for him to find his \u201chail voice\u201d.</p> <p>The sequence is non-linear. There are narrative glimpses only. Many of the poems have a swift, strange jostle of images, like vivid dreams, almost surreal. War\u2019s violence is more often hinted than described, part of the symbolism of red, a favourite colour in the swirling weave. Blood, roses, sunset, fire, wine, the eyes after drinking \u2013 all shades and moods of red connect Morgan\u2019s\u201d divan\u201d (the word means in Persian a collection of poems) to the original Divan by the 14th-century Sufi poet Hafiz.</p> <p>Love, for Morgan as for Hafiz, is the major theme. In a context where homosexual relationships were officially forbidden, it\u2019s a charged and complex business. As the second poem here affirms, to be in love was \u201cagainst King\u2019s Regulations.\u201d It would not have been an easy subject for Morgan at the time of writing, either.</p> <p>Sufi mysticism and carnal ecstasy merge for both poets. Of course, Morgan\u2019s persona isn\u2019t seeking union with God, but the ecstatic union with the man he desires, Cosgrove, is a spiritual matter in that it\u2019s a quest for the utmost personal authenticity. The shapes, colours and syntax of Morgan\u2019s poems, so unlike Hafiz\u2019s stately <a href=\"http://www.shadowpoetry.com/resources/wip/ghazal.html\">ghazals</a>, make them seem to dance like whirling dervishes, <a href=\"https://sites.barbican.org.uk/sufimusic/\">the Sufi worshippers</a> who seek divine connection through bodily movement. As the Indian mystic, Acharya Rajneesh, (Osho), explained, \u201cSufis sing, they don\u2019t give sermons, because life is more like a song and less like a sermon. And they dance, and they don\u2019t talk about dogmas, because a dance is more alive, more like existence, more like the birds singing in the trees ... The whole life is a dance, vibrating, throbbing, with infinite life. Sufis like to dance; they are not interested in dogmas.\u201d</p> <p>In Poem 1, Morgan addresses the \u201cold nightingale\u201d Hafiz himself, and refers to the text where Hafiz declares: \u201cOpen my grave when I am dead, and thou shalt see a cloud of smoke rising out from it; then shalt thou know that the fire still burns in my dead heart; yea, it has set my very winding-sheet alight.\u201d (Gertrude Bell\u2019s translation). Death in Morgan\u2019s poem is retrospective transformation: \u201cBut / not the song the Sufi says we have / but our dying song, you knew, gives us our beings.\u201d It seems likely that Morgan wrote the Divan after Cosgrove\u2019s death; it was certainly written when the realisation of that love was no longer a possibility. But the love gives Morgan his song.</p> <p>No 82 is a long way \u201cahead\u201d in the sequence \u2013 or would be if The New Divan were chronologically structured. This poem has a lighter, airier voice: insouciant as well as sad, it captures the character of Cosgrove, and the obligatory playfulness which both defuses and heightens the relationship. Gallus (line 10) is an adjective in Scots . The fact that Gallus is a proper noun in Latin creates an ambiguity: might it also be read as a reference to the Roman prefect-in-Egypt, Aelius Gallus, <a href=\"http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/16D*.html\">whose expedition was described by Strabo</a>, among others?</p> <p>No 92 laments the disunity jarring the heart of Morgan\u2019s wartime experience. Angels are imperfect, or invisible. Capital letters shout, Beware Landmines. An excursion into concrete poetry results in a mechanical, anti-creation hymn . Mass, mess, miss, moss, muss: the hissing litany of words chancily formed by the sequence of vowels, recalls a device used humorously in <a href=\"https://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poem/computers-first-christmas-card/\">The Computer\u2019s First Christmas Card</a>. Poem 92 is a cry of pain, but still a word-dance.</p> <p>Edwin Morgan\u2019s 100th birthday would have been on 27 April. I\u2019m delighted to have an excuse to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/16/poem-of-the-week-ay-but-can-ye-by-vladimir-mayakovsky\">return to his work</a>, and for PotW to play a small part in <a href=\"https://www.expressandstar.com/news/uk-news/2020/04/14/edwin-morgan-centenary-celebrations-reimagined-online/\">his centenary celebrations</a>. No 20th-century poetry has brought me more varied, intense and unfading pleasure than Morgan\u2019s. His is the song of our time \u2013 the living, not the dying, song which \u201cgives us our being\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Linda Maynard sounded upbeat in a voicemail to her daughter on 21 March, joking about her fried chicken cravings and threatening to go \u201con strike\u201d until she got fast food.

But the situation is worse in California where the vast majority of the facilities are for-profit operations incentivized to make cost-cutting decisions with potentially fatal consequences, said Tony Chicotel, a California nursing home reform advocate.</p> <p>\u201cFor years and years, we\u2019ve tolerated really bad infection control, which has killed a lot of people. It\u2019s not surprising once Covid-19 enters the building, it spreads like wildfire.\u201d</p> <p>Like hospitals, the nursing facilities have recently struggled with a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) with staff forced to take care of patients without masks and gloves, labor officials said. But unlike doctors and nurses, many long-term facility workers are low-wage workers who may not be trained to handle a virus outbreak and who frequently work multiple jobs to make ends meet, sometimes at different nursing homes. That means in some cases they may be bringing Covid-19 from one facility to another.</p> <p>April Verrett, president of SEIU Local 2015, which represents nursing home employees, said some workers have sent photos of themselves in recent weeks wearing rain ponchos and garbage bags, because they lacked isolation gowns. Others were using plastic bags on their hands instead of gloves, and she heard of one facility running out of plastic sleeves for thermometers. And if the workers get sick or may have been exposed, she said, \u201cThey cannot afford to miss a shift, let alone two weeks.\u201d</p> <p>Harrington said the crisis is exacerbated by a lack of testing in the facilities. She argued the state of California should test every staff member and resident in all nursing homes and immediately adopt stricter requirements for staffing levels and reporting of Covid-19 outbreaks. It\u2019s unclear how quickly the state could accomplish this given ongoing testing problems. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b2202d1647224123f3ff23f7f15f156dc459acd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b2202d1647224123f3ff23f7f15f156dc459acd/0_0_4200_2903/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patients are removed from Magnolia Rehabilitation and Nursing Center after 39 tested positive for Covid-19.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"691\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patients are removed from Magnolia rehabilitation and nursing center after 39 tested positive for Covid-19.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gina Ferazzi/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Toni Greene, whose 89-year-old mother was diagnosed with Covid-19 in a Santa Monica nursing home, said she didn\u2019t blame the facility, but was frustrated that the government failed to do widespread testing, which would have probably saved her mother from the virus. \u201cThe nursing homes have to take in Covid people. They are stuck between a rock and a hard place. But it didn\u2019t need to get this far if we had tested in the beginning.\u201d</p> <p>The operators of Gateway, the northern California facility facing a criminal investigation, have a long history of violations, <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/19/coronavirus-nursing-homes-with-covid19-deaths-have-history-of-serious-problems/\">records show</a>. The <a href=\"https://abc7news.com/gateway-nursing-home-hayward-ca-coronavirus-antony-thekkek/6109546/\">owners</a>, husband and wife Antony and Prema Thekkek, operate several facilities. They were required to close one nursing home due to problems and the state has denied them licenses five times due to concerns, according to a Bay Area News Group <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/19/coronavirus-nursing-homes-with-covid19-deaths-have-history-of-serious-problems/\">investigation</a>.</p> <p>At Gateway, located in the city of Hayward, just south of Oakland, inspectors found the facility broke infection control rules in 2017 by not changing gloves or swapping out urine bags. In 2019, a patient with sepsis didn\u2019t receive antibiotics because no one on staff was qualified to handle care, the newspaper found.</p> <p>Attorneys investigating current conditions say it appears little has changed. In March, as the pandemic escalated, Gateway pressured its staff to continue working even if they might be sick and did not require them to wear masks or gloves, according to a letter filed with prosecutors on behalf of a patient. One staff member was responsible for 37 patients during the crisis, and at least one doctor stopped coming to the facility due to Covid-19 risks, the letter said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat you have is a nursing home run like a business, which thinks they are above the law,\u201d said Adante Pointer, a civil rights attorney representing families. \u201cIt\u2019s a place that is supposed to preserve life, but it\u2019s turned into a place where lives are being taken.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Unanswered phone calls</strong></h2> <p>Scott Akrie knew nothing of Gateway\u2019s history when his 88-year-old father, Costell Akrie, was transferred there on 6 March for physical rehab after complications with diabetes. When the family arrived a week later to visit, Gateway staff told them the facility was on lockdown and they could not enter, though the employees did not say anyone had the virus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6741d49a40606cb9ecd198fdd21109b83c668c19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6741d49a40606cb9ecd198fdd21109b83c668c19/76_0_1492_1866/800.jpg\" alt=\"Costell Akrie tested positive for coronavirus while at Gateway Care and Rehabilitation Center.

Then on 31 March, the family learned Costell had tested positive. Over the next four days, the family kept calling, Scott said, but could not get their father on the phone. A receptionist repeatedly put them on an endless hold: \u201cIt was infuriating. I would try to call, my mother would try to call, my sister would try, no one could speak to him,\u201d said Scott.</p> <p>On 4 April, a doctor finally called back and said Costell was having trouble breathing. A few hours later, the doctor called again: Costell had died.</p> <p>\u201cI felt like I was going to pass out,\u201d Scott recalled. . \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe what was going on. I felt like a part of me was dying.\u201d</p> <p>Scott said it was painful to process that his father spent the final four days of his life unable to talk to a single loved one on the phone. Gateway officials did call Scott to discuss his father\u2019s body. \u201c\u2018He has to be out of here within one hour, that is our policy\u2019,\u201d Scott recalled them saying. \u201cThe coldness was mind-boggling. It was like they would put him on the curb if we didn\u2019t get him,\u201d Scott said.</p> <p>Arena Burke\u2019s communications with staff at Gateway as her mother fell ill were equally confounding. Staff told neither Maynard or her mother coronavirus was spreading in the facility: \u201c[My mother] did not know there was reason for concern. She thought they had locked down the facility as a precautionary measure.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"31f7d443d17160a03eaae3a01649964a2a011098\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31f7d443d17160a03eaae3a01649964a2a011098/0_100_1200_1500/800.jpg\" alt=\"When Linda Maynard tested positive for Covid-19, staff at Gateway told her daughter she was the first case.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When Linda Maynard tested positive for Covid-19, staff at Gateway told her daughter she was the first case.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of arena burke</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Maynard was hospitalized and tested positive for Covid-19, Gateway told her daughter that she was the first case, suggesting she had somehow brought it to the facility, even though her mother had stayed in her room. After her death on 28 March, Gateway made no arrangements to mail her belongings, Burke said. At one point, the facility called and left a voicemail, saying it left seven boxes outside. Burke called back to plead that the possessions be mailed. Weeks later, she\u2019s still waiting for her mother\u2019s things.</p> <p>\u201cI just want her belongings. It\u2019s not much, but I don\u2019t feel like my mother\u2019s life should be disposable,\u201d said Burke, noting that there are sentimental photos and jewelry, and that her mother may have taken notes about the way the facility treated her. She said she was speaking out because she feared for the residents\u2019 safety. Only one of her mother\u2019s friends is alive at this point.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are still living there being neglected and mistreated and it\u2019s just not right,\u201d Burke said.</p> <p>Gateway did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

The health department is further working to place positive patients in alternative sites when they don\u2019t require hospitalization.</p> <p>But because of Covid-19, the department has stopped doing routine in-person inspections, a development that has deeply worried advocates. The spokesperson said the state was still doing on-site investigations for \u201cissues that might cause serious risk to residents\u201d.</p> <p>Lobbyists for the nursing home industry are now <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-23/nursing-homes-legal-immunity-coronavirus-deaths\">pushing</a> for California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, to grant the facilities broad immunity from civil lawsuits and criminal prosecution, arguing that liability laws should be waived and they should be shielding from litigation while fighting the pandemic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3b8e6193af35908d7a223d0163070677e10953a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b8e6193af35908d7a223d0163070677e10953a9/0_0_5382_3516/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emergency workers move a patient from Gateway to an ambulance.

  "<p>\u201cI\u2019m only 32 but I feel like I\u2019ve experienced a lot more, like 200 years of life, in bad ways and good ways,\u201d Nadia Nadim says near the end of an hour\u2011long conversation that has been more exhilarating than sobering. We have moved from the way her life \u201cchanged in the blink of an eye\u201d when the Taliban stopped her going to school at the age of 11 and then murdered her father.</p> <p>She has reflected on how her mother found a way to help her and her four sisters flee Afghanistan. We have remembered how she <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHdFAbgIx0I\" title=\"\">fell for football in a refugee camp</a> in Denmark and her life changed for ever. Nadim has since played 93 times for Denmark and, as a prolific goalscorer, become one of the world\u2019s most significant women footballers.</p> <p>She has played professionally in Denmark, New Jersey, Portland, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bszCWeB0pfQ\" title=\"\">Manchester</a> and now Paris where she helped PSG reach the Champions League quarter-finals. They were due to face Arsenal last month. She speaks seven languages fluently and is one semester from graduating as a reconstructive surgeon. Meanwhile, during this interview, she swears like a trooper and makes me laugh. Nadim is at home with her family in Denmark, finding solace and hope in lockdown life while reflecting on a past like no other.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/29/many-womens-football-clubs-are-short-of-backroom-staff-fifpro-survey-says\">Many women's football clubs are short of backroom staff, Fifpro survey says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen I have time to reflect I\u2019m like: \u2018Holy shit!\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think many people can say they\u2019ve experienced all this in their entire lifetime. I don\u2019t want to sound arrogant but I think I have more insight than most people when it comes to other human beings, culture, religion, language. This has been built inside me from different worlds. Does that make sense?\u201d</p> <p>It does because we\u2019ve just discussed how retirement from football will be more bearable for Nadim because she can replace one form of intensity with another. When a career ends for most footballers they understandably lament the fact nothing will match the sensations they experience on the pitch. It is different for Nadim. Working <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/video/c/nadia-nadim-talks-about-training-to-be-a-surgeon/vp-AAEH4X5\" title=\"\">as a surgeon</a> will feel even more dramatic than playing for PSG or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAubDsltNDU\" title=\"\">scoring the opening goal</a> in the European Championship final as she did when Denmark <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/06/womens-euro-2017-holland-denmark-match-report\" title=\"\">faced the Netherlands</a> in 2017.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A girl from Pakistan said my story inspired her to keep playing football.

Not so long ago I played a game and I was really tired but soon after the game I assisted one of our doctors in a kidney surgery. I was standing there for two hours, in the same position, holding an instrument so he could see better. I was hurting everywhere because of the match but I still was feeling so great and my pulse was racing.</p> <p>\u201cI had this rush of adrenaline, thinking: \u2018Holy shit, this is so cool. I\u2019m literally looking inside someone\u2019s stomach.\u2019\u201d Nadim laughs, as she does with infectious frequency, before becoming more thoughtful. \u201cThere will come a time as a surgeon when all the responsibility is on me and it\u2019s going to be more extreme than anything I\u2019ve experienced.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2db873e24ce41aee1f32a44bdc145cf618eeefb9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2db873e24ce41aee1f32a44bdc145cf618eeefb9/0_166_4962_2976/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nadia Nadim celebrates after scoring for Denmark. \u2018I experience similar emotions or adrenaline rush inside the operating room,\u2019 she says.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nadia Nadim celebrates after scoring for Denmark. \u2018I experience similar emotions or adrenaline rush in the operating room,\u2019 she says.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henning Bagger/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I once wrote <a href=\"https://www.donaldmcrae.com/book-every-second-counts-about.php\" title=\"\">a book about heart transplant surgeons</a> and so I know even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/06/zlatan-ibrahimovic-trash-talking-sweden-record-golascorer\" title=\"\">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> would seem self-effacing if he ended up in this different world. Surgeons can be fascinating company but they are invariably driven by huge ego. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced that as well,\u201d Nadim says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if reconstructive surgeons have the biggest egos but you need huge confidence when cutting up a human being. You have to fix the situation. These no-shit doctors inspire me. I\u2019ve always been near doctors who are headstrong and know what they\u2019re going to do, and how they\u2019re going to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Great footballers also have swaggering confidence. \u201cDefinitely. I\u2019ve not seen anyone with low confidence make a big difference in football. If I see someone shaking, I\u2019m not going to think: \u2018Oh, I have such confidence in you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But there is also a necessary tenderness within reconstructive surgery. Rebuilding a face or a limb after a car crash or bombing requires delicate work amid devastation. It is work for which Nadim is equipped because her compassion runs even deeper than her confidence. \u201cI know the value of helping a person when they have no hope. I\u2019m a walking reminder of that. All the help I was given in my life made me the person I am today. So I really want to offer this help. Someone\u2019s face can be blown up and it\u2019s hard for them to exist. I\u2019m going to give them some of their identity back.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af9d1696550045f712c2612d2721ae71daf88bf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af9d1696550045f712c2612d2721ae71daf88bf9/0_0_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nadia Nadim in action for PSG against Lyon this season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nadia Nadim in action for PSG against Lyon this season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fred Tanneau/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nadim\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p082gx1t\" title=\"\">personal story</a> is worth examining if you\u2019ve not heard it before but we both want to talk more about the lesser-known corners of her experience. Rather than reliving the nightmare of how the Taliban made her father disappear when she was 12, Nadim discusses more complicated feelings. When her mum looks at her and considers the courage and fire which have enabled her to achieve so much over the past 20 years, she sees Nadim\u2019s father.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes me happy,\u201d Nadim says \u201cbecause I remember most that he was a cool person. He could do everything. On the other hand I\u2019m sad because for the majority of my life I haven\u2019t experienced my dad. Even the time I did experience, most of it I don\u2019t remember because I was young. I still have my mother and she\u2019s a really cool lady. Even before the Taliban came, she knew the power of education. That\u2019s something she\u2019s really given to us. She also used to try to teach other kids in Afghanistan. It takes one person to make a change and she\u2019ll always try to be that person.\u201d</p> <p>Nadim has changed lives. She tells a story of how, during last year\u2019s World Cup, she spoke on a panel about empowering young women through football. \u201cI\u2019m sitting among all these beautiful ladies from around the world and everyone starts sharing their stories about what they had to overcome to play football. At first I thought it was really sad. Nowadays we\u2019re fighting for equality, especially in terms of pay, which is great, but in other parts of the world women and girls are not even allowed to touch a fucking ball. It\u2019s crazy.</p> <p>\u201cThis girl put her hand up. She\u2019s from Pakistan. She starts half\u2011crying, saying: \u2018I can\u2019t believe Nadia Nadim is here.\u2019 She says how she used to play football in this tiny town but everyone was saying girls could not play football because of her Muslim background. She said: \u2018I was about to run away and never play the game again but I came across your story and it made me believe I can play football, too.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a really emotional person but I don\u2019t cry easily in front of people but she made me tear up. Here we have this young girl from Pakistan saying: \u2018You saved my life. I play football now and I\u2019ve started a team in the area. This is thanks to you. You told your story and you said it was hard but if you really love something, you should push it.\u2019 So many people don\u2019t care what girls go through around the world but it\u2019s not impossible to get out of it and it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s football or anything else you believe in.

And for some, violence continued to haunt them even after their arrival.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I first arrived here in Oakland, I felt less safe than in Guatemala,\u201d student Kevin Xiloj said in Spanish, his second language after the native indigenous language K\u2019iche.</p> <p>Xiloj left Guatemala when he was 17 to get away from the gangs that dominated his rough neighborhood in the city of Huehuetenango. But when he finally made it to East Oakland in 2015, he was greeted by frequent gunfire in his new neighborhood.</p> <p>He said his American peers mocked him for not speaking English and were eager to pick fights. Xiloj followed the same rules he had learned growing up in Huehuetenango: Listen. Watch. Stay quiet.</p> <p>Yet he found Oakland\u2019s unfamiliar streets more intimidating. At least back in Huehuetenango, Xiloj explained, \u201cI knew people, I knew my neighborhood, I knew who was who.\u201d</p> <p>Even as the gun homicide rate in Oakland fell by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/jun/03/gun-violence-bay-area-drop-30-percent-why-investigation\">44%</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/jun/03/gun-violence-bay-area-drop-30-percent-why-investigation\"> between 2007 and 2017</a>, it remains a persistent problem. More than 60 people have been killed by gunshot wounds each year in the city for the past several years. People of color are disproportionately affected. Latino Bay Area residents are 3.5 times more likely to be victims of gun homicides than their white counterparts. Black residents are 22 times more likely.</p> <p>There are also signs that new immigrants in Oakland may be increasingly vulnerable.</p> <p>Ricardo Garcia-Acosta of Youth ALIVE!, an Oakland-based violence intervention organization, found the tally of recent immigrant gun homicide victims have inched up in the past four years, even as total gun homicides in the city have fallen. In 2019, Youth ALIVE! documented 11 such cases in Oakland, up from six in 2016.</p> <p>Many victims were Latin American adult men fatally shot in what appeared to be robberies, Garcia-Acosta said. He noted non-English speaking immigrants may be targeted because they are less likely to notify police and are often unfamiliar with \u201cthe landscape and rules of the uniquely challenging streets of Oakland\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"57f880bef4f3e89ffe72f43a2d02d2ef16ab7db4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57f880bef4f3e89ffe72f43a2d02d2ef16ab7db4/0_0_4500_3599/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anibal Andres Ramirez\u2019s body was found on a bench in East Oakland in this plaza near Foothill Blvd and Seminary Ave on 10 October 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anibal Andres Ramirez\u2019s body was found on a bench in East Oakland in this plaza near Foothill Blvd and Seminary Ave on 10 October 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Hussin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Anibal\u2019s case, older teenage boys seemed to have been after him, his parents said. On a few occasions, the boy came home beaten up. Once, he was robbed of his cellphone. \u201cHe was bullied,\u201d his father, Gilberto Ramirez, recalled.</p> <p>The 13-year-old often wore red clothing, which may have been a show of support for the gang that operated in his neighborhood, or a way to gain protection from it.</p> <p>Nathaniel Dunstan, who oversees refugee and newcomer students for the district\u2019s English language learners and multilingual achievement team, said he grew concerned about Anibal months before he was killed and initiated a number of home visits.</p> <p>\u201cAt that time, the best way I knew to engage students at risk was to get them involved in Soccer Without Borders,\u201d Dunstan recalled, referring to a soccer program for immigrant and refugee youth.</p> <p>But Anibal was not interested in soccer, and Dunstan said his outreach efforts \u201cfelt really inadequate\u201d.</p> <p>Capt Trevelyon Jones of Oakland police department\u2019s Ceasefire violence intervention program was one of the first officers on the scene the night Anibal was shot.</p> <p>\u201cI was there like maybe 45 seconds after he got shot,\u201d Jones recalled. \u201cI remember seeing him sitting there, [and] thinking like, \u2018Wow, this is a little kid.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Anibal was wearing red the night he was shot. His clothing may have made him a target from rival groups. Sgt Brad Baker of Oakland police department declined to provide details about the open homicide investigation, but said there were \u201cgang connections\u201d to the case.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Anibal\u2019s shooting catalyzed Dunstan and other educators to take action.</p> <p>\u201cAfter Anibal was killed, my office and administrators from across the district realized that we needed another tool, another intervention, to support newcomers that had safety concerns,\u201d Dunstan said.</p> <p>The district had already hired bilingual social workers and therapists to work specifically with newcomers and their families. It had also forged relationships with local pro bono immigration attorneys to take on students\u2019 immigration cases. And since many older newcomer students must support themselves, the district had opened a new continuation high school, Rudsdale Newcomer high school, with a class schedule designed to make it easier for students to juggle classes and jobs.</p> <p>When Rudsdale first opened its doors, Emma Batten-Bowman, the founding assistant principal, noticed her incoming students often faced danger walking to and from school. \u201cOur newcomers are targeted. They\u2019re jumped. They\u2019re held at gunpoint,\u201d she said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our newcomers are targeted.

They identified dozens of factors making newcomer students vulnerable to becoming victims or perpetrators of violence, including dangerous local neighborhoods, past trauma, poverty, debts to smugglers and a lack of support systems. It became clear no existing local youth violence prevention program addressed the specific challenges facing newcomers.</p> <p>Ultimately, the school district partnered with a local not-for-profit, Bay Area Community Resources, to hire safety specialists to implement a school district-wide violence prevention program for newcomers.</p> <p>The new initiative launched the following school year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F6e467a4eb0a74ba08fa962617d9111fe051436a8%3Fcrop%3D0_0_4500_3600&amp;left-caption=&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F595f6dbc37e582aade6978c5b342582bcf93b7f0%3Fcrop%3D0_0_4500_3600&amp;right-caption=&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Rudsdale Newcomer High school\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F6e467a4eb0a74ba08fa962617d9111fe051436a8%3Fcrop%3D0_0_4500_3600&left-caption=&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F595f6dbc37e582aade6978c5b342582bcf93b7f0%3Fcrop%3D0_0_4500_3600&right-caption=&always-place-captions-below=false\">Rudsdale Newcomer High school</a> </figure>  <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Starting up the new violence prevention program fell to Ernesto Qui\u00f1onez, the district\u2019s first newcomer safety specialist.</p> <p>Qui\u00f1onez, who was born in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, was gang-affiliated as a teenager and had been incarcerated for a string of offenses he committed as a juvenile, including assault and battery with a deadly weapon and armed robbery.</p> <p>By August 2018, Qui\u00f1onez had been out of prison three years, and wanted to spend his time helping youth and \u201cundo some of the violence that I\u2019ve done\u201d.</p> <p>He spent the fall of 2018 based out of Rudsdale Newcomer high school, a small campus of portable classrooms clustered around a courtyard.</p> <p>Qui\u00f1onez\u2019s background allowed him to understand the unique pressures her students were facing, Batten-Bowman, the assistant principal, said: \u201cYou need somebody who knows the streets.\u201d</p> <p>Right away, Qui\u00f1onez was busy.</p> <p>A new student who had arrived only months earlier from Guatemala and did not yet understand the seriousness of gang colors, wore red T-shirts to school and was followed home and shot at by another student with a realistic-looking BB gun. A recent graduate was hospitalized after he was shot twice in the stomach. Students were jumped.</p> <p>\u201cThere were so many violent incidents that I was responding to them as fast as I could,\u201d Qui\u00f1onez recalled.</p> <p>Qui\u00f1onez needed to help newcomer students across the school district, so he recruited Jose Garcia to take over as safety specialist for Rudsdale Newcomer.</p> <p>Garcia, a youth educator, activist and artist who had himself immigrated to Oakland as an 11-year-old from Mexico, discovered that adults involved in local criminal organizations were manipulating some newcomer students. The students were coerced into selling drugs or stealing in exchange for housing, he said. Some female students were ensnared by sex trafficking rings.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of these kids are falling into a lot of predatory dynamics just because they have no family,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThey have no support system, they really have nobody.\u201d</p> <p>The new safety specialists became that support system for the most at-risk newcomers. Qui\u00f1onez and Garcia designed a program to cycle the most vulnerable students into intensive case management \u2013 supporting them as they got out of dangerous situations, assisting them if they had run-ins with the criminal justice system, checking whether they had safe housing, linking them to social services, and eventually, helping students plan for their futures.</p> <p>They created a class where at-risk students practice non-violent conflict resolution techniques, learn about commonalities between their Central American cultures, express themselves through art projects and burn off frustration with physical exercises like boxing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a1646591f4ca5c880952423a36bd8ab359e65228\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1646591f4ca5c880952423a36bd8ab359e65228/0_0_4500_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jose Garcia, the safety specialist coordinator for Oakland unified school district\u2019s newcomer students, outside his Fruitvale home with his dog Rollo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jose Garcia, the safety specialist coordinator for Oakland unified school district\u2019s newcomer students, outside his Fruitvale home with his dog Rollo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Hussin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Garcia named the program \u201cYoung Hawks\u201d because hawks are sacred to many indigenous groups in the Americas. \u201cBut the problem with the hawk\u2019s energy is that if it\u2019s not channeled or is not given a purpose, then it can be destructive,\u201d Garcia said.</p> <p>He noticed many students came to the US fleeing gangs and violence from Central America, but had little knowledge of the historical context that created those conditions.</p> <p>\u201cThey just blame [themselves] automatically for everything wrong with them and their communities,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThey just feel like that\u2019s how the world works.\u201d</p> <p>Garcia responded by immersing his students in history, teaching about the violence indigenous peoples suffered during Europe\u2019s colonization of the Americas, and the United States\u2019 record of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/19/central-america-migrants-us-foreign-policy\">fueling violent conflicts</a> in Central America. He explains that a <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/08/trump-guns-honduras-central-america/\">high portion of guns</a> in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador can be traced back to the United States.</p> <p>\u201cWe dive into those things so that they don\u2019t blame themselves or their parents for the world they inherited,\u201d Garcia said.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>At the beginning of this school year, the Bay Area violence that Ernesto Qui\u00f1onez had been helping to quell struck close to home.

The three safety specialists manage caseloads for about 120 newcomer students district-wide.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Garcia said his workday began \u201cwhenever that phone rings\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes it starts at 3 in the morning,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might not be on my contract. But that\u2019s what it takes to get the job done correctly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhenever I need him, he is there,\u201d said Michael, a 17-year-old student who asked to only be identified by his first name for safety reasons. In an interview in Spanish, he called Garcia, \u201cA loyal friend.\u201d</p> <p>Michael said he left El Salvador when he was 13 because a cousin insisted he had to either join his gang, or be killed.

The Covid-19 audit approach will be outlined in a revised 2020-21 Annual Audit Work Plan (AAWP) which will be provided to the JCPAA in early May 2020 to consider the priorities of the Parliament. The draft AAWP will also be available for public consultation during May 2020.

Reports on the assurance reviews are expected to be tabled in parliament each month.</p> \n   <p>You have drawn attention in your correspondence to the amendment agreed by the parliament to the Coronavirus Economic Response Package Omnibus Bill 2020 giving certain powers to the Minister for Families and Social Services. I do not consider that the specific use of such powers lend themselves to the audit and review functions of the ANAO. However, a future audit of the effectiveness of programs or activities undertaken by the government in response to Covid-19 could consider the quality of evidence developed within the public sector to inform the minister\u2019s decisions in this area. <br></p> \n   <p>The monitoring of the use of the powers may be something that the parliament may wish to consider in other ways including the Senate

  "<p>The coronavirus pandemic is likely to be followed by even more deadly and destructive disease outbreaks unless their root cause \u2013 the rampant destruction of the natural world \u2013 is rapidly halted, the world\u2019s leading biodiversity experts have warned.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a single species responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 us,\u201d they said. \u201cRecent pandemics are a direct consequence of human activity, particularly our global financial and economic systems that prize economic growth at any cost. We have a small window of opportunity, in overcoming the challenges of the current crisis, to avoid sowing the seeds of future ones.\u201d</p> <p>Professors Josef Settele, Sandra D\u00edaz and Eduardo Brondizio led the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/06/human-society-under-urgent-threat-loss-earth-natural-life-un-report\">most comprehensive planetary health check</a> ever undertaken, which was published in 2019 by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). It concluded that human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating decline of the Earth\u2019s natural life-support systems.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://ipbes.net/covid19stimulus\">article published on Monday</a>, with Dr Peter Daszak, who is preparing the <a href=\"https://ipbes.net/nexus\">next IPBES assessment</a>, they write: \u201cRampant deforestation, uncontrolled expansion of agriculture, intensive farming, mining and infrastructure development, as well as the exploitation of wild species have created a \u2018perfect storm\u2019 for the spillover of diseases.\u201d</p> <p>These activities cause pandemics by bringing more people into contact and conflict with animals, from which 70% of emerging human diseases originate, they said. Combined with urbanisation and the explosive growth of global air travel, this enabled a harmless virus in Asian bats to bring \u201cuntold human suffering and halt economies and societies around the world. This is the human hand in pandemic emergence. Yet [Covid-19] may be only the beginning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuture pandemics are likely to happen more frequently, spread more rapidly, have greater economic impact and kill more people if we are not extremely careful about the possible impacts of the choices we make today,\u201d they said.</p> <p>The scientists said the multitrillion-dollar economic recovery packages being rolled out by governments must be used to strengthen and enforce environmental protection: \u201cIt may be politically expedient to relax environmental standards and to prop up industries such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/17/polluter-bailouts-and-lobbying-during-covid-19-pandemic\">intensive agriculture, airlines, and fossil-fuel-dependent energy sectors</a>, but doing so without requiring urgent and fundamental change essentially subsidises the emergence of future pandemics.\u201d</p> <p>A global \u201cOne Health\u201d approach must also be expanded, they said. \u201cThe health of people is intimately connected to the health of wildlife, the health of livestock and the health of the environment. It\u2019s actually one health,\u201d said Daszak.</p> <p>Furthermore, surveillance programmes and health services need to be properly funded in nations on the frontlines of pandemic risk, they said: \u201cThis is not simple altruism \u2013 it is vital investment in the interests of all to prevent future global outbreaks.\u201d</p> <p>Daszak said: \u201cThe programmes we\u2019re talking about will cost tens of billions of dollars a year. But if you get one pandemic, even just one a century, that costs trillions, so you still come out with an incredibly good return on investment.</p> <p>\u201cBusiness as usual will not work. Business as usual right now for pandemics is waiting for them to emerge and hoping for a vaccine. That\u2019s not a good strategy. We need to deal with the underlying drivers.\u201d</p> <p>In March, the UN\u2019s environment chief, Inger Andersen, told the Guardian \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-nature-is-sending-us-a-message-says-un-environment-chief\">nature is sending us a message</a>\u201d with the coronavirus pandemic and the ongoing climate crisis. She said failing to take care of the planet meant not taking care of ourselves.</p> <p>Last week, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said governments must seize the opportunity <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/un-coronavirus-communications-team/un-urges-countries-%E2%80%98build-back-better%E2%80%99\">to \u201cbuild back better\u201d after the pandemic</a> by creating more sustainable and resilient societies.</p> <p>Prof Thomas Lovejoy, at the United Nations Foundation and George Mason University in the US, who coined the term \u201cbiological diversity\u201d in 1980, said on Saturday: \u201c[The pandemic] is not nature\u2019s revenge; we did it to ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is the consequence of our persistent and excessive intrusion in nature and the vast illegal wildlife trade, and in particular the wildlife markets, the wet markets, of south Asia and bush meat markets of Africa,\u201d he said. Earlier in April, a major study found that the human impact on wildlife was to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/08/human-impact-on-wildlife-to-blame-for-spread-of-viruses-says-study-aoe\">blame for the spread of viruses</a>.</p> <p>In the new article, the biodiversity experts said: \u201cWe can emerge from the current crisis stronger and more resilient than ever, [by] choosing actions that protect nature, so that nature can help to protect us.\u201d</p>",

A headlong descent into a red, white and blue inferno, this is probably the last film most viewers feel like watching right now, although surely there is something to be said for cinematic immersion therapy. If nothing else, those despairing over the apocalyptic tenor of our current moment might take some measure of solace from the realization that the apocalypse has been going strong for four generations now.</p> <p>True to its word, The Killing of America is composed entirely of archival material: new broadcasts, courtroom footage, jailhouse interviews, candid recordings of carnage both quotidian (a fatal liquor store robbery) and historic (the Zapruder film). The film is bookended by the murders of the two greatest avatars of 1960s idealism: Johns F Kennedy and Lennon, respectively. Despite the fact that Kennedy was the fourth American president to be felled by an assassin\u2019s bullet, the film marks his murder as the moment the country\u2019s psychic dam broke, ushering in a tide of blood from which have yet to extricate ourselves.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsa7Fzu-xWk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Dsa7Fzu-xWk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Unafraid to stretch credulity or play fast and loose with some facts (Kennedy\u2019s murder is unabashedly presented as a conspiracy), the film-makers draw a direct line between the political violence of the civil rights era to the spate of mass murders committed by religious cults, lone gunmen and serial sex killers. Along the way we meet a rogue\u2019s gallery comprising the most notorious names in American tabloid history: James Earl Ray, Charles Whitman, Charles Manson, Sirhan Sirhan, Jim Jones, Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, Edmund Kemper, to name just a few.</p> <p>To anyone with even a cursory interest in true crime \u2013 which nowadays is seemingly everyone \u2013 these are well-worn subjects, although there\u2019s something to be said for the sheer amount of ground the film manages to cover during its 90-minute runtime. The Killing of America is at its most enthralling during its middle section, when it focuses on a handful of lesser-known and forgotten cases, including publicly staged hostage crises initiated by the likes of James Hoskins and Tony Kiritsis.</p> <p>Kiritsis\u2019s story is especially intriguing, and it\u2019s a wonder that it hasn\u2019t been the subject of a major feature film or series. Kiritsis was a dumpy, diminutive and foul-mouthed bartender who, in 1977, took mortgage broker Richard Hall hostage. Running a wire so that it ran between his and Hall\u2019s necks, as well as his sawn-off shotgun so as to keep the police from shooting him (less they trigger the weapon), Kiritsis paraded Hall through downtown Minneapolis and before reporters for three whole days. Thankfully, the situation was resolved without any fatalities, although it is in Kiritsis and Hall\u2019s ordeal that the film lights upon most its potent metaphor: \u201cFor three days, they seemed to embody the plight of their country: the man of progress with the fool of violence on his back.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4c3a9e8af18f75f77f570f3b426421f1ed66133\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4c3a9e8af18f75f77f570f3b426421f1ed66133/253_2_1419_1077/1000.jpg\" alt=\"For those with a strong stomach or a taste for the grindhouse, The Killing of America is essential viewing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"759\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">For those with a strong stomach or a taste for the grindhouse, The Killing of America is essential viewing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That metaphor could be applied to the new wave of violent urban dramas and thrillers made in the decade preceding The Killing of America \u2013 Taxi Driver, Death Wish, Dirty Harry \u2013 as well as any number in the years following (including this past year\u2019s Joker). While the documentary never bothers to address violence in media, it nonetheless feels as though it\u2019s in conversation with those other films. This sense is bolstered by the fact that the late Leonard Schrader was the older brother (and frequent collaborator) of Paul Schrader, the man responsible for some of the most defining films on the subject of urban violence and individual alienation. Clearly, this must have been a favorite subject during family get-togethers.</p> <p>While The Killing of America was popular in Japan and attracted a cult following in the UK and Australia, it was rarely seen in America, having only been widely available since 2016. It\u2019s hard to watch the footage of police attending to calls of domestic violence in minority and lower-income neighborhoods and not think of Cops and its subsequent bastard children of the reality TV age, just as it\u2019s impossible to take in the moving carousel of graphic carnage without being reminded of early shock websites like Rotten.com, which have now splintered into incalculable threads within the forums of Reddit, 4Chan and the like.</p> <p>Even though it presents itself as full-fledged, Old Testament-style prophecy, it wouldn\u2019t be right to call the film prophetic. The section dedicated to the figure of the lone shooter certainly plays as all too sadly familiar and relevant to today, as does its running excoriation of America\u2019s addiction to firearms. But when it comes to diagnosing the deeper sickness at the heart of its subject, the film offers little in the way of insight or revelation. Despite its air of gravitas \u2013 most of which comes by way of voiceover legend Chuck Riley\u2019s somber narration \u2013 The Killing of America exists firmly within the reactionary and highly problematic tradition of the mondo movie: documentaries (or, more often than not, pseudo-documentaries) which depict taboo subject matters in an intentionally sensationalized and exploitative manner.</p> <p>This all may sound as though I\u2019m dragging the film, but I\u2019m not: as with all exploitation films, the problematic nature of The Killing of America is its selling point. Unlike most pieces of true crime entertainment \u2013 which may be exploitative but lack the visceral and transgressive power of true exploitation cinema \u2013 the film will scare off the majority of viewers. But for those with a strong stomach or a taste for the grindhouse, it is essential viewing.</p> <p>Plus, if nothing else, its depiction of the outside world as a nightmarish hellscape from which there is no escape should make you feel at least slightly better about being stuck indoors.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Killing of America is available to stream on Amazon Prime in the US and UK</p></li> </ul>",

But there is also division over the way forward, as some residents clamour for the city to get back to work, and others fear that Parson, backed by Donald Trump, will risk lives by opening up the state again too soon.</p> <p>That divide is seen across the country in a <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/04/20/when-america-reopens-poll\">YouGov poll</a> showing that 60% of Americans oppose the recent spate of protests demanding the closures be lifted, including a majority of Republicans.

I can\u2019t understand that mentality.\u201d</p> <p>Still, Watkins is concerned about the long-term damage if the shutdown continues.</p> <p>Like many small midwestern cities and towns, Odessa went into decline in recent decades. For years, the heart of the old town was dotted with abandoned stores as shoppers drove to malls and large supermarkets. But recently it has revived ,and is now lined with shops including a bakery, a creamery, a spa, and a clutch of antique stores that bring shoppers from Kansas City.</p> <p>For many residents, it felt like the city was back. Now they fear all of that is at risk. \u201cI\u2019m nervous if some of the smaller businesses can withstand it.

  "<p>Some writers have always claimed they can hear their characters speaking, with Enid Blyton suggesting she could \u201cwatch and hear everything\u201d and Alice Walker describing how her characters would \u201ccome for a visit ... and talk\u201d. But a new study has shown this uncanny experience is very widespread, with almost two-thirds of authors reporting that they hear their characters\u2019 voices while they work.</p> <p>Researchers at Durham University teamed up with the Guardian and the Edinburgh international book festival to survey 181 authors appearing at the 2014 and 2018 festivals. Sixty-three per cent said they heard their characters speak while writing, with 61% reporting characters were capable of acting independently.</p> <p>\u201cI hear them in my mind. They have distinct voice patterns and tones, and I can make them carry on conversations with each other in which I can always tell who is \u2018talking\u2019,\u201d said one anonymous writer. \u201cThey sometimes tell me that what I have in mind for them isn\u2019t right \u2013 that they would never behave or speak that way. I don\u2019t usually answer back,\u201d said another.</p> <p>The study, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7068700/#b0120\">which appeared last month in the journal Consciousness and Cognition</a>, also found that 56% of the writers surveyed reported visual or other sensory experiences of their characters when they were writing, while a fifth had the sense that their character was occupying the same physical space. Fifteen per cent of writers said they could even enter a dialogue with their creations.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m trying to \u2018put words in their mouth\u2019 instead of listening they often talk back. And then we discuss things until I find what they would say,\u201d reported one anonymous respondent. Another revealed that their characters\u2019 voices were distinct from their own inner speech: \u201cWhen my characters are running dialogue in my head I feel like a spectator, but with my own inner speech I feel like the one speaking.\u201d</p> <p>According to Durham University\u2019s Dr John Foxwell, the lead researcher on the project, the authors in the study reported a wide variety of experiences.</p> <p>\u201cThe writers we surveyed definitely weren\u2019t all describing the same experience,\u201d Foxwell said, \u201cand one way we might make sense of that is to think about how writing relates to inner speech.\u201d Internal dialogue, or inner speech, is a phenomenon that people experience in many different ways, he continued, with some people including the voices of people they know as part of their verbal thinking. \u201cWhether or not we\u2019re always aware of it, most of us are trying to anticipate what other people are going to say and do in everyday interactions. For some of these writers, it might be the case that after a while their characters start to feel independent because the writers developed the same kinds of personality \u2018models\u2019 as they\u2019d develop for real people, and these were generating the same kinds of predictions.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/14/fictional-characters-make-existential-crossings-into-real-life-study-finds\">Fictional characters make 'experiential crossings' into real life, study finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even though some authors reported that their characters had a life of their own, the researchers were keen to stress that there was no question of writers confusing fiction with reality. When the academics rated the writers on how prone they were to hallucinations, they did not score differently to other samples of the population. \u201cHearing voices and other unusual experiences are not in themselves a symptom of a mental health problem,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThis shows that vivid imaginative states \u2013 including losing control of one\u2019s own imagination \u2013 [are] a healthy and safe thing which is important for how some people create fiction.\u201d</p> <p>One Day novelist David Nicholls said he could hear his characters, \u201cand I think I could pick them out of a line-up too. They certainly have a physicality and a vocal rhythm, though often for me that comes from actors rather than real-life friends.\u201d</p> <p>The bestselling crime novelist Val McDermid recognised the phenomenon, but explained that she is able to exert a measure of control. \u201cThey don\u2019t just pop up out of nowhere,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when I\u2019m working on a novel, I have conversations in my head with them. When I\u2019m out for a walk, there are all sorts of interrogations going on in my head and sometimes out loud. But if I\u2019m not working with a character, silence.\u201d</p> <p>As a writer who has worked in parallel on independent series of novels, this ability to quiet the voices in her head is crucial. If she\u2019s working on a Karen Pirie novel, for example, McDermid will never hear the voices of other series characters Carol Jordan or Kate Brannigan. And there\u2019s never any question of who is in charge.</p> <p>\u201cI do not think they act independently,\u201d McDermid said. \u201cThey have the life I give them and no more. Sometimes when I set myself a problem or a question before I go to sleep, my subconscious provides the answer in the morning, and that answer is sometimes surprising or unexpected. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019m possessed by the characters; I just think my subconscious is good at processing data.\u201d</p> <p>Her mind may be working hard in the background, she added, but there are limits. \u201cI don\u2019t feel their physical presence.

Wait until you get to <em>Clive.</em>\u201d</p> <p>I remember he laughed richly and for a long time at the mention of Clive\u2019s name, at the very idea of the world\u2019s No 1 fictional alsatian, lying like a doorstop on the floor of the Black Cross pub, getting showered in the ash from Keith Talent\u2019s cigarettes, panting hotly on various blighted pavements, being called Clive. <em>Ahaha ...</em></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I cannot read another Amis novel without at least briefly thinking 'I wish Clive was here'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My dad didn\u2019t say what it was about, which was smart of him. As I have learned to my cost over the years, it is a very rare person who will be sold on London Fields<em> </em>by a description of the plot, which is confusing, a bit top-heavy and very much beside the point. Technically, yes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1989/sep/21/fiction.martinamis\">Amis\u2019s 1989 novel</a> is a murder mystery (or, as the jacket copy mortifyingly puts it, a \u201cpostmodern whodunnit\u201d), centred around Nicola Six and her inscrutable efforts to get murdered in the way she has foreseen, by a man whose identity is known only to her. In theory, yes, the \u201cmystery\u201d for the reader lies in finding out whether the murderer is Keith Talent (the cheat) or Guy Clinch (the foil), and in watching to see how old Nicola chivvies the various participants along. It doesn\u2019t sound good when you put it like that.</p> <p>It certainly doesn\u2019t sound like something I would have been drawn to at 16 \u2013 if someone had started talking to me about \u201cpostmodern whodunnits\u201d when I was that age, I would have made a loud screaming noise until they promised never to talk to me about books ever again. </p> <p> But my dad was right: I couldn\u2019t believe how much good stuff there was, just page upon page of Keith Talent doing appalling things and then saying \u201cyeah cheers\u201d afterwards, various characters sloping off for \u201ca quiet glass of <em>porno</em>\u201d, Nicola Six scheming away, having refreshing ideas about underwear and kissing, Guy Clinch being stabbed in the eyes by his evil child, Samson Young moaning and groaning about time going about its immemorial work of making everyone look and feel like shit. All that.</p> <p>The fact that large tracts of it whizzed directly over my teenage head only made it more appealing. It was good that I could not make head or tail of the ending, or all that business with \u201cMark Asprey\u201d, and the stuff about the narrator constantly on the phone trying to get through to Missy Harter, being barred by her vicious secretary who for some reason is named Janit. What was Missy Harter\u2019s role in all this? What was her job, even? I couldn\u2019t say. If you\u2019d put a gun to my head, I couldn\u2019t have told you why Nicola Six did anything that Nicola Six did. Again, the book\u2019s opacity was key to its appeal.</p> <p>It\u2019s a sort of magic trick, that feeling, when it becomes not so much a matter of taste as of identity: by loving London Fields<em>, </em>you can become the sort of person who loves London Fields<em>, </em>who will hopefully one day understand what any of it actually means<em>. </em>I carried my copy around with me all over the place \u2013 it was the <a href=\"https://www.ideology.uk.com/website/portfolio_pages/penguin_archive.html\">one with</a> the neon writing and the blurry TV still of the naked woman on the front.

He asks Keith about a match he\u2019d missed the week before, and Keith launches into this unbelievable speech, producing a perfect stream of terrible sportswriter clich\u00e9s: \u201cDuring the first half the Hammers probed down the left flank. Revelling in the space, the speed of Sylvester Drayon was always going to cause problems for the home side\u2019s number two.\u201d Trying to make sense of this display later, the narrator says: \u201cAt first I thought he\u2019d just memorised sections of the tabloid sports pages. Absolutely wrong \u2026 When Keith goes to a football match, that misery of stringer\u2019s cliches <em>is what he actually sees.</em>\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s me and London Fields<em>. </em>I loved it so much and thought about it so much that it changed the way I apprehended certain slices of reality.

State-by-state guide</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u2018Very limited\u2019 spread</h2> <p>On Sunday, New South Wales Health\u2019s Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS) <a href=\"http://ncirs.org.au/sites/default/files/2020-04/NCIRS%20NSW%20Schools%20COVID_Summary_FINAL%20public_26%20April%202020.pdf\">published its findings</a> after researchers followed up all close contacts of Covid-19 across 10 of the state\u2019s high schools and five primary schools. Researchers collected Covid-19 test data from all 863 close contacts of the nine students and nine staff infected. They found it was likely, but not certain, that two students and no adults had been infected at school as a result of those infections.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a></figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe findings from this detailed investigation are preliminary,\u201d the study concluded. \u201cHowever, they do suggest that spread of Covid-19 within NSW schools has been very limited [and] appears considerably less than seen for other respiratory viruses, such as influenza. In contrast to influenza, data from both virus and antibody testing to date suggest that children are not the primary drivers of Covid-19 spread in schools or in the community.\u201d</p> <p>Epidemiologist Dr Kathryn Snow, from the University of Melbourne\u2019s Centre for International Child Health, said it was important to emphasise there is a difference between a child\u2019s likelihood of catching the virus themselves and their likelihood of passing the virus on to others. Evidence showed children were less likely to pass it on than adults but that did not mean scientists were saying children could not become infected.</p> <p>\u201cMany parents and teachers are finding the debate about schools confusing and stressful,\u201d Snow said. \u201cThe evidence shows that although primary school aged children can catch Covid-19, they usually only experience a mild illness. Interestingly, although primary school aged children can definitely catch it, it seems that they almost never pass the virus on to anybody else.</p> <p>\u201cThis will be counter-intuitive to a lot of parents, who know that children often bring home other germs from school. However, we see this same phenomenon with other diseases as well, for example with tuberculosis.\u201d</p> <p>She added that transmission from children is only one piece of the puzzle in terms of whether schools should be open.</p> <p>\u201cThere is also a risk of transmission between teachers and parents, and from teachers to students. Some teachers are in their 60s and could be at risk of a serious illness if they were to catch Covid at work. Globally, there have been some outbreaks among parents, teachers, and students linked to schools and school functions.\u201d</p> <h2>Support for the disadvantaged</h2> <p>But schools being closed will have a disproportionate impact on some students, especially students with learning difficulties or those with limited IT resources at home, she said. \u201cAs a health equity researcher, I\u2019m personally quite concerned about the impact on some students from disadvantaged backgrounds.\u201d</p> <p>Students returned to schools in South Australia on Monday, but parents who chose to keep their children at home reported widespread issues with the online learning system called LearnLink. The Australian Capital Territory and Victoria will deliver their curriculum via online and remote learning for term 2, while students face a staggered return in NSW from Wednesday. WA schools are open for term 2, with year 11 and 12 students especially encouraged to attend.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/children-unlikely-to-transmit-coronavirus-says-study-cited-in-pms-push-to-reopen-schools\">Children unlikely to transmit coronavirus, says study cited in PM's push to reopen schools</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Researchers led by London\u2019s University College undertook a systematic review of the effectiveness of Covid-19 related school closures globally, with <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lanchi/PIIS2352-4642(20)30095-X.pdf\">their findings to be published in the May edition of the international medical journal the Lancet</a>. The researchers examined data from nine published studies and seven non-peer-reviewed studies on school closures and Covid-19. Only one study the researchers reviewed examined school closures as a separate intervention to other measures, finding the impact of closing schools on transmission rates was marginal.</p> <p>\u201cThere are few data available from the literature on coronavirus outbreaks to guide countries on the use of school closures or other school social distancing practices during the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d the researchers concluded.</p> <p>\u201cAvailable evidence is consistent with a broad range of impacts of school closures, from little effect on reducing transmission through to more substantial effects. Yet, the economic costs and potential harms of school closure are undoubtedly very high.\u201d</p> <p>The researchers added that education is one of the strongest predictors of the health and the wealth of a country.</p> <p>\u201cPolicy makers and researchers should also look to other school social distancing interventions that are much less disruptive than full school closure and might substantially contribute to maintaining the control of this pandemic,\u201d they concluded. \u201cAlthough strong evidence is not available for the effectiveness of these practices, they might be implementable with much less disruption, financial costs, or harms.\u201d</p> <h2>Reopening with conditions</h2> <p>A paediatric infectious diseases specialist with Perth Children\u2019s Hospital, Dr Asha Bowen, said there was good evidence that children and adolescents have a lower rate of infection with Covid-19 than adults, and when infected, had a milder course of symptoms. She said the study of NSW schools supported this.</p> <p>\u201cThe transmission patterns are on the whole from adult to child within household studies (90% of cases), confirming that children are more likely to be infected by an adult than another child,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cThe health evidence supports children and adolescents being back in schools with reopening of schools occurring in term 2 in Australia.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/27/more-harm-than-good-the-cases-for-and-against-closing-schools-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic\">'More harm than good': the case for and against closing schools during the coronavirus pandemic | Peter Collignon and Marylouise LcLaws</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Epidemiologist and infectious disease physician with Alfred Health and Central Clinical School, Dr Allen Cheng, said the evidence so far suggested schools should be reopened, but with some important caveats.</p> <p>Schools need to make sure there are precautions in place to ensure good hygiene, that physical distancing is carried out, and that policies to identify and respond to any cases were in place, he said.</p> <p>\u201cBeyond those purely epidemiological considerations, there are obviously other factors that are important \u2013 that teachers feel confident that they are safe and that parents feel their children are safe.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday, the chief medical officer Prof Brendan Murphy insisted there is no need for social distancing in classrooms. The <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/news/australian-health-protection-principal-committee-ahppc-advice-on-reducing-the-potential-risk-of-covid-19-transmission-in-schools-24-april-2020\">official advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee</a> states \u201cit is of utmost importance that teachers and parents alike maintain physical distancing between themselves and each other at school\u201d, given adults are at higher risk of passing on and acquiring infection. The committee said children and teachers must not go to school if unwell.</p> <p>\u201cThere are many outbreaks that have been described \u2013 weddings, business meetings, religious gatherings, workshops \u2013 all relating to adults interacting together, and schools are notable in their absence from this list,\u201d Cheng said.</p> <p>Professor Kristine Macartney, the director of NCIRS and leader of the NSW schools study, said she understood the discussion and concerns in the community around reopening schools.</p> <p>\u201cBut our study isn\u2019t a model,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is real world data, showing what has actually happened. And we know education is critical for children and with conditions in place, they should be returning to school.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we don\u2019t know yet is why children aren\u2019t getting infected and passing it on at the rate of adults. We see children so highly affected by influenza, for example. It undoubtedly has something to do with how the virus interacts with cells that lie in our respiratory tract and the way the immune system of young people responds. But the exact mechanism underpinning that and the milder infections we see in children, we just don\u2019t fully understand.\u201d</p>",

It has also offered us the chance to notice and appreciate the natural world in cities in an unprecedented way.<br></p>\n    <p>In this special series of reports we'll be looking at how animals and plants adapt to city life, what to look out for right now and how we can encourage more wild cities in the future.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Cities are not mausoleums for nature but modern-day versions of the Galapagos archipelago, according to Menno Schilthuizen, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jul/23/darwin-comes-to-town-how-cities-are-creating-new-species\">author of Darwin Comes to Town</a>, a book about contemporary evolution in cities where rapid changes can be observed within a human lifetime.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"067e9e986984e0a4de04e77d1b21e1aba6847518\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/067e9e986984e0a4de04e77d1b21e1aba6847518/0_0_5593_3729/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mother and two wild boar piglets roam at a street of the Carmel neighbourhood in Haifa, Israel, 11 April 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mother and two wild boar piglets cross a street in the Carmel neighbourhood of Haifa, Israel, on 11 April.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abir Sultan/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cOnly in our flights of fancy can we still keep nature divorced from the human environment. Out in the real world, our tentacles entwine nature\u2019s fabric,\u201d Schilthuizen writes. \u201cWhile we have been trying to save the world\u2019s crumbling pre-urban ecosystems, we have been ignoring the fact that nature has already been putting up the scaffolds to build novel, urban ecosystems for the future.\u201d</p> \n<p>Haunting images of wolves, bison and bears living in deserted towns following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster indicate what happens when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/may/28/chernobyl-wildlife-haven-tour-belarus-created-nuclear-disaster-zone\">humans leave a place for good</a>. The coronavirus lockdown shows how quickly wildlife closes in. \u201cIt is interesting to consider how fragile our urban environment is. If we\u2019re not constantly present, it\u2019s being taken over by nature very quickly,\u201d says Schilthuizen, who is professor of evolutionary biology at Leiden University in the Netherlands.</p> \n<p>The unique thing about coronavirus is that it is causing multiple cities across the globe to simultaneously go into hibernation. This gives ecologists an insight into how humans change urban biodiversity in multiple locations. \u201cAnimals are nearby, constantly watching us from the outskirts and the forests, and as soon as our presence seems to be abating they start exploring where new terrain could be won \u2026 It makes you aware of how we\u2019re constantly competing with many species,\u201d says Schilthuizen.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2b96c8d02517de2e87a29e86329d469e04963180\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b96c8d02517de2e87a29e86329d469e04963180/0_0_3113_2075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two silvery-brown Tamarin or Grey Titi monkeys (saguinus leucopus) in Medellin, Colombia, 16 April 2020.

In the past few decades this has started to change but we still know little about the urban wildlife we live alongside, says Rana El-Sabaawi, associate professor of biology at Canada\u2019s University of Victoria.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you look in the literature, the field of urban ecology doesn\u2019t really come into its own until the last decade or two. Before that there were a smattering of papers and reports, mostly descriptions of biodiversity trends in and around specific cities. In recent years there has been a growing appreciation of the ecological mechanisms that explain biodiversity in the city,\u201d she says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f0af93063473d6b1f55a45621add1885f89b4de5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0af93063473d6b1f55a45621add1885f89b4de5/0_0_2050_1366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A puma in the streets of Santiago, 24 March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A puma in the streets of Santiago, 24 March 2020.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andres Pina/ATON CHILE/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Urban environments are messy places (full of lights, pollution and people pursuing their own interests), which makes studying them difficult. It\u2019s all very well to observe animals and plants in urban places, but understanding how these different processes fit together is more problematic.</p> \n<p>At the same time, there is increasing recognition that few places on Earth are free from human influence \u2013 there is a plastic bag at the bottom of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/20/plastic-pollution-mariana-trench-deepest-point-ocean\">Mariana </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/20/plastic-pollution-mariana-trench-deepest-point-ocean\"> Trench</a>, and Antarctica\u2019s remote glaciers are flecked with microplastics. Understanding places where humans interact with nature most should help planners and developers create cities that hold as much wildlife as possible.</p> \n<h2><strong>Opportunists do well in cities</strong></h2> \n<p>Broadly speaking, \u201csensitive\u201d species, whose habitat is destroyed by urban developments, are unlikely to venture into urban areas. \u201cOpportunists\u201d, which have a much broader diet and high tolerance for noise and pollution, are more at home. Coronavirus means species that might lie in the grey area between these categories are now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/animals-cities-coronavirus-lockdowns-deer-raccoons\">more likely to venture</a> into previously unexplored urban areas.</p> \n<p>Racoons, pigeons, foxes, gulls and crows are opportunists and considered a nuisance by many humans who live alongside them. Animals such as these, which scavenge human rubbish to get food, are likely to be struggling during lockdown.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c2060df50a3ead559c630f2ac1a357c102cae55\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c2060df50a3ead559c630f2ac1a357c102cae55/0_0_4122_2483/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A racoon walks over the running path in almost deserted Central Park in Manhattan, 16 April 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"602\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A racoon walks over the running path in almost deserted Central Park in Manhattan, 16 April 2020.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/06/the-great-green-expansion-how-ring-necked-parakeets-took-over-london\">Ring-necked parakeets</a> might disperse away from urban parks and forage on agricultural land instead. Residents of the East Riding in Yorkshire have been warned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/02/beware-hungry-seagulls-during-lockdown-yorkshire-residents-told\">seagulls could be more aggressive</a> because there are fewer seaside day-trippers feeding them leftover chips. In Amsterdam, even coots \u2013 which sometimes line their nests with plastic \u2013 may have a tough time finding replacement materials.</p> \n<p>\u201cOften what happens when food supply runs short is increased competition and aggression between animals,\u201d says El-Sabaawi. \u201cThere have already been fascinating reports from Asia about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/13/hungry-monkeys-brawl-over-food-as-coronavirus-hits-tourism-in-thailand-video\">monkey \u2018brawls\u2019</a> caused by food shortages. If the food shortages are really severe and extended, then populations might decline.\u201d</p> \n<p>Other animals seem to be doing well with fewer people on the street. Urban songbirds, for example, can communicate more easily when the din of background traffic is reduced. Deer, badgers and wild boar might be emboldened to start pinching food from suburban gardens or roadsides. A herd of goats has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/mar/31/llandudno-goats-herd-running-riot-coronavirus-lockdown\">running riot</a> through the Welsh town of Llandudno, munching on people\u2019s gardens as they go.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a6423f076c8c12a8e315846fd725bd7ee569b311\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6423f076c8c12a8e315846fd725bd7ee569b311/0_250_3500_2034/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A herd of goats in Llandudno, Wales 31 March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"581\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A herd of goats in Llandudno, Wales on 31 March.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Most researchers are agreed these species\u2019 corona-related behavioural changes are temporary and the luxury of living in town will stop when humans re-emerge. Lockdown will probably have a similar effect on wildlife populations as an exceptionally wet or hot year \u2013 provided things return to how they were.</p> \n<p>In terms of wildlife sightings during this period, it\u2019s hard to separate fact, fiction and wishful thinking \u2013 it\u2019s a complex picture and new research is starting to try to make sense of what is happening. Scientists have launched a <a href=\"https://renoir.hypotheses.org/files/2020/03/Silent%C2%B7Cities-Project.pdf\">Silent Cities</a><a href=\"https://renoir.hypotheses.org/files/2020/03/Silent%C2%B7Cities-Project.pdf\"> project</a> to look at the diversity of sounds in places normally masked by anthropogenic noise. People are being encouraged to record sounds in \u201cordinary\u201d suburban/urban spaces such as in a backyard or on a balcony during lockdown, and compare it to noises when things are back to normal.</p> \n<p>Cities are also powerhouses for permanent changes. For example, there are distinct subspecies of mosquitoes found on the London underground that no longer hibernate and feed on human blood as opposed to bird blood, according to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/6884120\">research published in Nature in 1999</a>. Even more remarkable, mosquitoes living on different tube lines do not mix so the population living on the Circle line is genetically different to those living on the Piccadilly line. This change happened over 100 generations or so \u2013 significantly faster than Charles Darwin thought possible.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42b1660ee5da06dfc64b22217cd44e0e72ecbbd5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42b1660ee5da06dfc64b22217cd44e0e72ecbbd5/0_0_7108_4744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A hungry seagull tries to open up a garbage bag at via Fori Imperiali, Rome, Italy, 9 April 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A hungry seagull tries to open up a garbage bag at via Fori Imperiali, Rome, Italy, 9 April 2020.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefano Montesi - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Urban blackbirds are also morphing into a new species, according to Schilthuizen. Across European and north African cities, blackbirds living in urban areas have developed shorter bills (probably thanks to an abundance of bird feeders and easier pickings in cities). Traffic noise has caused urban blackbirds to sing in the night when it\u2019s quieter, and they also breed around a month earlier than their countryside cousins.</p> \n<p>Scientists think the urban blackbird, <em>Turdus urbanicus,</em> could be the first of many species to adapt to life in the city. Schilthuizen writes: \u201cThe pace of evolution is set by ecological opportunities that emerge from human interactions \u2026 In those pressure cookers of environmental change, species will need to speed up their evolution or become extinct.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Plants tell the history of our cities</strong></h2> \n<p>Changes in botany have been massive in the past decade with huge shifts in wild plants living in urban areas, according to London-based botanist Dr Mark Spencer. \u201cPlants have lived with us in our cities for thousands of years and they move along with us and they tell stories about us,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>London is an important focal point for the arrival of non-native species in the UK, either arriving accidentally by international trade (via wool, for example) or escapees from domestic horticulture. Cities are the first pitstop for species that could later spread around the whole country.</p> \n<p>For example, loquat (a common cousin of plums, cherries and apricots) is becoming established in London where Greek and Turkish communities typically live because people spit out the pips on the ground after they\u2019ve eaten the fruit. And now it\u2019s starting to sprout in the wild.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bf852f44d112806c2edb218e01e01db694369c56\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf852f44d112806c2edb218e01e01db694369c56/0_0_4380_2920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Himalayan balsam (impatiens glandulifera) flourishes in Devon, UK.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Himalayan balsam<em> (impatiens glandulifera)</em> flourishes in Devon, UK.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Papilio/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Widespread non-native plants such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/05/country-diary-the-explosive-impatience-of-himalayan-balsam\">Himalayan balsam</a>, buddleia and Japanese knotweed were originally imported for horticulture. \u201cThe detailed research on the entry points of these well-established non-native species is not done,\u201d says Spencer. \u201cIn this country, we have a focus on doing biological and ecological research on nice pristine chalk grasslands \u2013 which are wonderful habitats. We don\u2019t like getting down and dirty with weird and wonderful street pavements. That\u2019s pretty much it, putting it in crass terms. Urban areas are very poorly understood.\u201d</p> \n<p>Like animals, plants also adapt to city life. <em>Crepis </em><em>sancta</em>, a widely spread Mediterranean member of the daisy family, has moved into Montpellier in France. In 12 years the <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/105/10/3796\">seeds have evolved</a> to be larger and heavier so they are more likely to fall into soil near their parent plant rather than on concrete which covers most of the city. Lighter seeds were 55% less likely to germinate, researchers found.</p> \n<p>\u201cOrdinary\u201d urban areas are places we desperately need to understand, Spencer says. \u201cA lot of this stuff is not about traipsing around recording hyper-rarities or incredible orchids, it\u2019s about getting the common and the widespread.\u201d</p> \n<p>People sending in samples of species can help researchers collect more accurate records about changes in botany. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve been trying to do for the past decade or so in natural history is get past this idea that it\u2019s elite, purely expert, frankly old, white, male, grey tops that can do it, and no one else can. Actually, the only way you get past this is by supporting people,\u201d says Spencer, who encourages people to submit plant sightings to <a href=\"https://www.brc.ac.uk/irecord/\">i-record</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e62083af1f8e8dbe24dea7e680882b4f19c28ec7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e62083af1f8e8dbe24dea7e680882b4f19c28ec7/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ducks in the fountains almost outnumber people on London\u2019s Trafalgar Square, 15 Apr 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ducks in the fountains almost outnumber people in London\u2019s Trafalgar Square on 15 April.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emerson Utracik/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Will lockdown change how people interact with nature? Probably not, says Schilthuizen. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying the quiet. I keep thinking to myself, this is the way things should be, without constant air traffic overhead and without constant noise of traffic and throngs of people spending money on the streets \u2026 But I think we have a short memory. The bliss of a quiet period \u2013 or the memory of that period \u2013 will disappear quite quickly.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Find more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction\">age of extinction coverage here</a>, and follow biodiversity reporters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phoeb0?lang=en\">Phoebe Weston</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgreenfielduk?lang=en\">Patrick Greenfield</a> on Twitter for all the latest news and features</em></p> \n<p>\u2022 A picture caption was amended on 30 April 2020 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to the young of wild boar as cubs.

  "<p>Stephen King has made good use of the sometimes tricky novella form over his nearly 50-year career, often as a vehicle to explore ideas and styles that lie off the more familiar path of his horror novels. <em>If It Bleeds</em> brings together four new stories, all offering vintage King themes with their own particular twist.</p> <p>The showpiece here is the title novella, a sequel of sorts to King\u2019s 2018 novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/18/the-outsider-by-sephen-king\">The Outsider</a></em>, which was shown as a 10-part HBO series at the beginning of this year. The title comes from the callous (but accurate) newsroom axiom \u201cif it bleeds, it leads\u201d. Private investigator Holly Gibney is watching breaking news coverage of a bomb attack at a middle school when she notices something odd about the reporter, Chet Ondowsky. A little background research suggests that Ondowsky\u2019s being first on the scene at incidents of horrific carnage is no coincidence, and Holly wonders if the reporter might be deliberately causing atrocities. King marries an obvious affection for the tropes of old gumshoe movies with carefully researched forensic technology to create an odd hybrid of procedural and horror that ratchets up the suspense, even if it feels a little familiar to readers of <em>The Outsider</em>, or the trilogy of Bill Hodges novels in which Holly first appeared.</p> <p>Mr Harrigan\u2019s Phone is set in classic King territory, with all the gothic ingredients of retribution from beyond the grave, Old Testament justice and the author\u2019s fascination with the ways in which technology can mimic \u2013 or be exploited by \u2013 supernatural forces, a literal \u201cghost in the machine\u201d. It\u2019s a straightforward story in which wrongdoers are punished and kindness rewarded, and as such not especially scary \u2013 except that this is the point, made with King\u2019s characteristic sly wit. The ghost here is a deliberate misdirection; the truly terrifying element of the story, the one with the power to unleash all manner of horror into our lives, is not the corpse rotting in its grave, but the shiny little gadget with the Apple logo in our pockets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/07/stephen-king-interview-the-institute\">Stephen King: \u2018I have outlived most of my critics. It gives me great pleasure\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The strangest novella, and perhaps the least coherent, is also the most beautiful, in its curious way. The Life of Chuck is three separate stories linked to tell the biography of Charles Krantz in reverse, beginning with his death from a brain tumour at 39 and ending with his childhood in a supposedly haunted house. Though the first and third acts rely heavily on fantasy and the supernatural, it\u2019s the middle part that stands out because of its entirely human tenderness. Chuck, an unremarkable accountant not yet aware that \u201cthe seeds of his end \u2026 have lately begun to awaken\u201d, finds himself walking down a street in Boston when a busker\u2019s tune takes him back to high school days and he begins to dance, a spontaneous, joyful expression of a part of himself he thought forgotten. King describes this little contagious outburst of happiness with such understated empathy for the multitudes we all contain that this part of the story could easily stand alone, and would even be the more powerful for it.</p> <p>Rat, the final novella, also returns to familiar ground. Drew Larson is an author \u2013 not, alas, a very successful one, but plagued with an array of writerly tics and foibles that King depicts with an insider\u2019s comic knowledge. \u201cWhen he came home, Lucy took one look at him and said, \u2018You\u2019re either coming down with something or you\u2019ve had an idea.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But, as any King fan knows, a struggling writer cut off in the backwoods may soon find his tics turning into full-blown madness, and Drew \u2013 trapped by a storm and in the grip of a fever \u2013 encounters a rat that talks to him in the slightly pompous voice of Jonathan Franzen. It\u2019s a wry variation on the Faustian bargain trope and although it strikes a more lighthearted note to end on, Rat is asking timely questions about the price we\u2019re willing to pay for personal success, and whether an old, sick person\u2019s life is worth less than that of someone younger. King, as always, is right on the money.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>If It Bleeds</em> by Stephen King is published by <a href=\"https://www.hachette.co.uk/titles/stephen-king-3/if-it-bleeds/9781529391534/\">Hodder &amp; Stoughton</a> (\u00a320)</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<h2>Top story: Problems, problems, problems for returning PM</h2> \n<p>Morning everyone. This is Martin Farrer bringing you the top stories to start the week.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/boris-johnson-returns-to-no-10-and-a-government-under-pressure\">will resume control of Britain\u2019s faltering response to the coronavirus crisis today </a>as pressure mounts on his government to spell out how it will begin to ease the lockdown and reopen schools and businesses. The prime minister last night returned to Downing Street where the question of how to lift restrictions is the most pressing matter in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/26/six-urgent-items-in-boris-johnson-inbox-as-he-returns\">an overflowing in-tray, </a>which also includes fixing the government\u2019s decision-making structure and dealing with the Brexit talks impasse. How to reach the target of 100,000 tests per day is also a key issue and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-uk-government-assessing-antibody-test-kits\">ministers are considering ordering millions of antibody testing kits</a> in the hope of establishing immunity levels across the country.</p> \n<p>As countries across Europe plan to ease <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/france-italy-spain-prepare-to-ease-coronavirus-lockdowns\">some lockdown restrictions</a> this week, pressure on Johnson to do the same is especially strong from business leaders who have appealed for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/27/bosses-appeal-to-the-government-for-a-lockdown-exit-plan\">more clarity about Britain\u2019s exit strategy</a>.

Europe\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has accused the UK of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/24/britain-running-down-the-clock-in-brexit-talks-says-michel-barnier-eu\">not engaging with key issues</a> such as fishing rights, and the so-called level playing field conditions to ensure neither side can undercut environmental, labour and social standards.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Kim \u2018is alive\u2019 \u2013 </strong>Kim Jong-un is alive and well despite widespread rumours that he was seriously ill with heart trouble, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/kim-jong-un-is-alive-and-well-says-south-koreas-security-adviser\">according to a security adviser to the South Korean president</a>.

  "<p>Julie Hesmondhalgh has had an epiphany \u2013 related to Covid-19, obviously.</p> <p>\u201cI realise that my main skill in the apocalypse is making videos of myself to send to exhausted NHS workers,\u201d she says. \u201c\u2018Hi! I\u2019m Julie Hesmondhalgh, better known as Hayley from Coronation Street. I know you\u2019re on your one 10-second break of a 12-hour shift and what you really need is to see some obscure TV personality making a video \u2026\u2019\u201d She pauses. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt more useless in my life.\u201d</p> <p>And yet she knows those videos mean a lot \u2013 to the people who get them and to those who organise them. That is why she records messages for shuttered theatres and stories for children\u2019s charities, as well as shiny shards of joy for shattered healthcare workers.</p> <p>A month into the lockdown, she is feeling a little fragile herself. \u201cI\u2019ve generally been doing all right, because I\u2019m in an incredibly privileged position. I live in a lovely place with a garden and countryside on my doorstep. My kids are that bit older and they don\u2019t have any special educational needs. Kersh [the writer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Iankershaw\">Ian Kershaw</a>, Hesmondhalgh\u2019s husband] is still working and I\u2019ve got a job coming up that\u2019s been deferred. But sometimes, despite all those things, I\u2019m not all right.</p> <p>\u201cI think that a lot of the problems that we\u2019ll have after this in terms of people\u2019s mental health is that the quiet heroism of staying inside ain\u2019t cutting it for some people,\u201d she says. \u201cEspecially people who are used to resisting in some way, through protesting or campaigning. So I do what I can and I do it the best I can \u2013 wholeheartedly.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3759c88d7340925f63498aa3a1034ee7ce4a2333\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3759c88d7340925f63498aa3a1034ee7ce4a2333/0_0_3888_2581/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julie Hesmondhalgh as Trish Winterman in Broadchurch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The whole point was to show an ordinary-looking, middle-aged woman being the survivor of something like that\u2019 ... Hesmondhalgh as the rape survivor Trish Winterman in Broadchurch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Decades of resisting, campaigning and protesting mean that Hesmondhalgh is now the patron of several charities, including <a href=\"http://www.transmediawatch.org/\">Trans Media Watch</a>, a role that dates from the late 90s, when she started playing Hayley Cropper, a transgender character, in Coronation Street; the <a href=\"https://www.sophielancasterfoundation.com/\">Sophie Lancaster Foundation</a>, since her involvement with the play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/sep/24/black-roses-sophie-lancaster-review\">Black Roses: The Killing of Sophie Lancaster</a>; and the sexual assault charity <a href=\"https://www.starsdorset.org/our-patron\">Stars Dorset</a>, from when she played Broadchurch\u2019s rape survivor, Trish Winterman. She also supports food banks, hospices and arts charities. \u201cYou have to admit it,\u201d she jokes: \u201cI am a really good person.\u201d</p> <p>A great actor, too. From Hayley and Trish to her latest \u2013 Heather in the BBC drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/23/the-a-word-review-bbc1-drama-autism\">The A Word</a>, about an autistic boy and his family \u2013 Hesmondhalgh\u2019s performances are truthful and grounded. As Peter Bowker, the writer of The A Word, says: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a fake note about her, either as a performer or a person. I saw her in a play at the Royal Exchange a few years back and she lets you see her soul. As a performer, she\u2019s generous, truthful and joyous.\u201d</p> <p>Bowker had wanted to work with Hesmondhalgh \u201cfor ever\u201d and it is an ideal match. The combination of Hesmondhalgh\u2019s humanity and Bowker\u2019s writing \u2013 tenderness tinged with vinegar \u2013 is glorious. So glorious, in fact, that Bowker says he would work with her again in a shot. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m planning to,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m writing a romantic comedy for her.\u201d</p> <p>Hesmondhalgh grins when I mention it. \u201cIs he telling people now? Ooh, great!\u201d</p> <p>A working-class girl from Accrington, Lancashire, the young Hesmondhalgh loved doing performing arts, but did not think it was for her. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a time when everybody felt like that kind of life was at their fingertips. I felt like I\u2019d be better placed being a social worker or a probation officer. So that\u2019s what I was planning.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3b3a4599519ce367dda65c05b7e53a85f2055b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3b3a4599519ce367dda65c05b7e53a85f2055b1/0_0_2008_1339/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Neilson and Julie Hesmondhalgh in their final episode together of Coronation Street\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If you want to fight prejudice, you put somebody likable in the living room\u2019 ...

Brian Astbury, a great teacher from Lamda, before the virus, and this week <a href=\"https://leamingtonobserver.co.uk/news/tribute-paid-to-local-theatre-stalwart-martin-cosgrif-who-has-died-from-coronavirus-18628/\">Martin Cosgrif</a>. He was the teacher from Accrington College who was responsible for getting loads of us into drama school. He died of the virus.\u201d</p> <p>The impression that Cosgrif and Astbury left on Hesmondhalgh is clear. When she left drama school, she, Astbury and others set up Arts Threshold theatre in the early 90s, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/apr/23/national-theatre-boss-rufus-norris-covid-19\">Rufus Norris</a>, now the artistic director of the National Theatre, directed his first play.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2020-03-13-tribute-to-brian-astbury-who-co-founded-the-first-non-racial-theatre-in-sa/\">Brian had set up the first multiracial theatre company in South Africa</a> in the 70s at the height of apartheid, and he taught me very much that you can marry your politics and art \u2013 and that, actually, theatre and art have a massive part to play in changing the world. Brian gave me permission to believe that and work with that. And that\u2019s been underlying in everything that I\u2019ve done.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The way the press was then, a trans actor playing Hayley would have been eaten alive</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As far as party politics goes, she was \u2013 and remains \u2013 a staunch supporter of Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cA series of unbelievable happy accidents meant that we got so far with the Corbyn experiment,\u201d is her verdict on his years at the head of Labour. \u201cEverything was put in place to stop him from becoming leader \u2013 and then it happened. Then everything was put in place to have a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/24/labour-leadership-jeremy-corbyn-wins-landslide-victory-party\">second leadership election</a> and for him not to win that \u2013 and he won it. And then, on the night of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/08/general-election-2015-the-winners-and-losers\">the 2015 election</a>, when so many of us thought that it might be possible, there were other people within our own party saying it was the worst night of their lives. The same forces that were recently being so, so awful [to Diane Abbott]. I find that extraordinary.\u201d</p> <p>While she believes that \u201cwe\u2019ll look back on this period as a missed opportunity\u201d, being negative is not her thing. \u201cSo for now I just feel like: OK, we\u2019ve got to move forward.\u201d</p> <p>How does she feel about Labour\u2019s new leader? \u201cMe and Kersh both said that, even in all the Blair years, Jeremy never left the party, but worked within it, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do. I think the party could do a lot worse than Keir as leader. He\u2019s very acceptable to the establishment, but with some good principles to him. Does the prospect of him make me dance around my living room? No.\u201d</p> <p>Labour\u2019s defeat in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/13/the-guardian-view-on-the-2019-election-result-a-new-political-landscape\">the 2019 general election</a> is not the raw wound it was for Hesmondhalgh, but she has been left with a scar. \u201cI did the audio version of the Labour manifesto and a couple of times I had to stop because I was choked up. It was beyond your wildest dreams \u2013 and yet it did seem like it could happen, because there was so much uncertainty and because 2015 had been such a shock. But now we go back to the old way of doing things, which is a more negative kind of campaigning. It\u2019s more about just getting the Tories out, rather than about creating an amazing socialist utopia.\u201d</p> <p>With big-P politics discussed, I ask Hesmondhalgh about the little-p politics around two of her highest-profile TV roles. Trish, her character in Broadchurch, was one of countless female characters who have been raped in TV drama for a storyline intended to entertain viewers. Was she unsure about taking on the role?</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to be really careful about it, because, when I got the first script, I didn\u2019t know <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/chris-chibnall\">Chris [Chibnall</a>, the creator of the series]. I\u2019ve loved Broadchurch, but I didn\u2019t know what his politics were and I knew what sexual violence looks like on telly \u2013 and I didn\u2019t want to be a part of that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c6ba82c8f7c1d84c5ed2dc0f33817768b98d6aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c6ba82c8f7c1d84c5ed2dc0f33817768b98d6aa/0_0_3000_1967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seasoned campaigner ...

She rang the Doctor for advice. Or rather, she rang <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/25/jodie-whittaker-i-believe-in-alien-100-per-cent\">Jodie Whittaker</a>, a friend of a friend, who at that point was yet to star in Doctor Who, but had played the grieving mother Beth Latimer in the first series of Broadchurch.</p> <p>\u201cOnce I\u2019d got over my shock that Jodie was a northerner \u2013 she looks like some beautiful English rose and I assumed she was posh \u2013 she was brilliant. She was just like: \u201cYep, Chris is a feminist and as sound as,\u201d so I decided to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Hesmondhalgh admits to being intrigued that she was approached about the part. \u201cI felt I wasn\u2019t like any sort of sexual-violence survivor that I\u2019d seen portrayed on telly before. So often rape is shown as an act of desire, which it isn\u2019t. So often it\u2019s a beautiful girl being pursued through the woods \u2013 and pursued by the camera. But the whole point of Broadchurch was to show an ordinary-looking, middle-aged woman being the survivor of something like that. So I am really proud of Broadchurch, because of the way the conversation shifted at that moment. And that\u2019s down to years and years of coal-face campaigning from people who were out working in the field. \u201d</p> <p>Which brings us to Hesmondhalgh\u2019s breakthrough role as Hayley in Coronation Street. The first trans character in a British soap, Hayley transformed trans visibility in the UK and <a href=\"https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/14697/portrayal-of-hayley-in-coronation-street\">led to Coronation Street being thanked in </a><a href=\"https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/14697/portrayal-of-hayley-in-coronation-street\">parliament</a> for changing public perceptions. This was in 1998. It was nothing short of radical.</p> <p>\u201cEven now, I can\u2019t quite believe the power of it,\u201d Hesmondhalgh says. \u201cLiterally within weeks, people were saying to me in the street: \u2018When are you and Roy getting married?\u2019 I\u2019d be like: \u2018We\u2019re not allowed to \u2013 it\u2019s against the law,\u2019 and they\u2019d be like: \u2018Oh, never mind that!\u2019 I knew then that something was shifting. If you want to fight prejudice, you put somebody likable in the living room and people can see beyond what makes them different to what makes them the same.\u201d</p> <p>Even then, though, there was controversy around a cis woman being cast as a trans woman. \u201cThere was a really great trans rights group, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/19/gender-recognition-act-reforms-six-legal-views-transgender-debate\">Press for Change</a>, who were really, really pissed off \u2013 and I totally understood why. I met them and said: \u2018I hear you, but honestly I think the pressure on a trans actor \u2013 who definitely would have had a certain amount of vulnerability anyway \u2013 would have been unbearable.\u2019 The way the press was then, they\u2019d have been eaten alive. So I assured them that I was their ally, that I would play the part with as much sensitivity and empathy as I could, that I would listen to them. And, honestly, I think I did a decent job.\u201d</p> <p>Would she take the part today? \u201cI would hope that it wouldn\u2019t be offered to me as a cis woman,\u201d she says, firmly. \u201cI definitely wouldn\u2019t take it. I left Corrie because it was time for me to go personally, but it was also time for Hayley \u2013 a trans woman played by a cis woman \u2013 to go, too. I was about to become an absolute anachronism, because there were then trans actors to play those parts, and even more now.\u201d</p> <p>All the same, given how popular Hayley \u2013 and Roy \u2013 were, Hesmondhalgh could easily have spent another 20 or 30 years in Weatherfield, safe in the knowledge that she would still be getting A-stories into her 80s, just as Barbara Knox, who plays Rita, does today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74b79006634cab7645ca0fbf5ff62775326f574b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74b79006634cab7645ca0fbf5ff62775326f574b/0_0_4663_3109/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julie Hesmondhalgh introduces Jeremy Corbyn at the launch of Labour\u2019s 2017 general election campaign\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019ll look back on the Jeremy Corbyn period as a missed opportunity\u2019 ...

But when it is time to go, it is time to go \u2013 and what an exit it was. Almost exactly 16 years after she first appeared on the cobbles in her red anorak, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/jan/16/hayley-cropper-coronation-street-suicide-euthanasia\">Hayley </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/jan/16/hayley-cropper-coronation-street-suicide-euthanasia\">killed herself after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer</a>. Her death attracted an audience of almost 10 million. One man remembers it especially vividly: David Neilson, who plays Roy.</p> <p>\u201cThat year leading up to Hayley\u2019s death was quite full-on and some of it was very difficult to play, not least because I lost two friends to cancer in that time,\u201d he says. \u201cPlaying that sort of story costs you. You have to dig deep to play it properly. And Julie always did.</p> <p>\u201cI remember the last scene we did; it was unlike any other scene I\u2019ve done in the show. The director, Kay Patrick, told us and the crew to take as long as we needed to prepare for it \u2013 because we\u2019d only be doing it once. And we did only do it once. You could have heard a pin drop in the studio. It truly felt like an ending.\u201d</p> <p>Where does Hesmondhalgh find the energy for all this? \u201cI was brought up Baptist and, for a time, was quite an evangelical Baptist,\u201d she says. \u201cI went to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/21/billy-graham-obituary\">Billy Graham</a> and got a full-body immersion baptism. I was doing testimonies at church when I was like 12; I was a Sunday school teacher when I left to go to Lamda.</p> <p>\u201cI think it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/22/jeanette-winterson-frankissstein-interview\">Jean</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/22/jeanette-winterson-frankissstein-interview\">ette Winterson</a> who said that, if you grow up in that sort of environment, you have an evangelical streak that never leaves you. I think that is what people see in me sometimes: the energy comes out through campaigning or through socialism. I like being part of something bigger.\u201d</p> <p>And so we return to where we began: with lockdown life. Amid the challenge, Hesmondhalgh sees hope. \u201cSuddenly, we\u2019re all not taking the NHS for granted. Suddenly, we are realising how much we need other people in every single way. Suddenly, we are appreciating the people who empty our bins and care for our elderly people.</p> <p>\u201cI think \u2013 I hope \u2013 it\u2019s going to be hard to revert to the way things were. I\u2019m hoping that what we\u2019re going through right now has shifted the national consciousness in some way that makes people look at the way the world runs.\u201d</p> <p><em>The A Word returns </em><em>weekly at 9pm on BBC One </em><em>from 5 May</em><em>; all six episodes will be available </em><em>on iPlayer from 5 May</em></p>",

It did confirm, however, that it ordered a batch of unapproved tests, from an unknown supplier, which was delivered to its Brisbane warehouse on 22 March.</p> \n<p>Promedical has repeatedly refused to say who manufactured the tests it is <a href=\"https://www.promedical.com.au/home/igm-igg-rapid-detection-kit/\">now marketing</a>.</p> \n<p>Guardian Australia understands that soon after becoming aware Promedical was promoting a different test, Wondfo rescinded its relationship with the Australian company.

[Wondfo] is not responsible for any product complaints arising from products purchased from Promedical Equipment Pty Ltd.\u201d</p> \n<p>In early April, the TGA revoked Promedical\u2019s approval to supply Covid-19 test kits, at the company\u2019s own request. The US Food and Drug Administration also removed Promedical\u2019s name from its list of test providers.</p> \n<p>Despite no longer having TGA approval to supply test kits in Australia, Promedical has since continued to market test kits in Australia and overseas, including publishing claims it has \u201cAustralia\u2019s first approved and certified rapid test kit\u201d.</p> \n<p>After being approached by Guardian Australia last week, some references to having Australian and US approval were removed from its websites.</p> \n<p>But, at the time of publication, the Promedical <a href=\"https://www.promedical.com.au/home/igm-igg-rapid-detection-kit/\">website was still claiming</a> the company had TGA approval for its test.</p> \n<p>\u201cPromedical\u2019s Covid-19 Rapid Test Kit is an Australia-first professional medical testing kit that can detect the presence of IgG and IgM antibodies in human blood,\u201d the website said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Covid-19 Rapid Test Kit is approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), which means the clinical kit is safe for use by the Australian public.\u201d</p> \n<p>Promedical also issued a press release on 1 April claiming it had TGA approval, which included <a href=\"https://www.promedical.com.au/2020/04/01/queensland-firms-world-first-15min-test-kit/\">images of a test kit</a>. It also supplied media outlets with the images.</p> \n<p>At that stage, it had TGA approval to supply the Wondfo product only.</p> \n<p>But the company confirmed it never proceeded with the Wondfo deal, and the pictured test kit looks similar to the non-Wondfo product delivered to its Brisbane warehouse on 22 March, according to video obtained by Guardian Australia.</p> \n<h2>Trading halt on US shares</h2> \n<p>On 10 April the Nasdaq-listed US supply chain and logistics company SCWorx filed <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1674227/000110465920047617/tm2016152-1_8k.htm\">documents with the US Securities and Exchange Commission</a> claiming it had entered into a \u201csupply agreement\u201d with Promedical for the purchase of 52m of its test kits. On 13 April, SCWorx\u2019s share price <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/WORX:US\">increased more than 500%</a>.</p> \n<p>A Promedical spokesperson said: \u201c[The company] had initial discussions with SCWorx in the US, and supplied an invoice, but an order was never placed, nor was payment ever made\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cSCWorx has not been approved to use the Promedical brand, or promote the Promedical branded [test] via their website.\u201d</p> \n<p>On 15 April, the chief executive and chairman of SCWorx, Marc Schessel, told investors on a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1674227/000110465920049258/tm2016544d1_ex99-1.htm\">conference call</a> he had chosen the supplier because the product was not manufactured in China or South Korea and that the manufacturer \u201chad the proper FDA authorisations\u201d.</p> \n<p>Two days later Schessel released a statement confirming the deal would involve the supply of 2m test kits per week for 23 weeks, which would be onsold to another company, Rethink My Healthcare, for $35m per week.

A \u201cCryo Australia\u201d sign was still on display outside.</p> \n<h2>Promedical\u2019s response</h2> \n<p>Responding to questions, Promedical released a statement that said it had \u201cpartnered with another Australian company to manufacture the [test kits] under the Promedical brand name\u201d.</p> \n<p>It confirmed it received a \u201csmall batch delivery\u201d from the supplier on 22 March. When asked to identify who was making the kits, Promedical said it \u201cdid not wish to disclose the name of the new supplier\u201d until TGA approval had been obtained.</p> \n<p>\u201cPromedical\u2019s \u2026 rapid test kit is the same initial response test that has been successfully and effectively used by medical teams throughout Asian countries hard-hit by the Covid-19 virus since the beginning of 2020,\u201d the company said.</p> \n<p>\u201cA new TGA application is currently awaiting upload to the TGA system. This is the same case with the FDA in the US.</p> \n<p>\u201cPromedical is not aware of any investigations relating to the company, involving the TGA.\u201d</p> \n<p>A TGA spokesman said it could not comment on applications that might have been lodged, but confirmed an investigation was under way into Promedical.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe investigation into Promedical Equipment Pty Ltd relates to Covid-19 rapid test kits. Promedical Equipment Pty Ltd is not currently approved by the TGA to supply Covid-19 test kits in Australia.\u201d</p> \n<p>In response to suggestions it wrongly claimed to have approvals, and that its marketing materials clearly linked the initial Wondfo approval to its new product, the company said: \u201cPromedical is not claiming that its current Covid-19 [test], from its new supplier, is TGA or FDA approved. All references to TGA approvals related to its past agreement with Wondfo, which has since ended along with all marketing of the product.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cPromedical have not, and do not, advertise they have FDA approval.\u201d</p> \n<p>At the time Promedical made the above comment it was still advertising its tests as \u201cFDA approved\u201d on an official export site.

So my food budget means I have to ration myself to eating every second day. Sometimes I\u2019ll go as long as four or five days without eating. I\u2019m very, very much looking forward to the supplement because it means for the first time in a long time I\u2019ll be able to buy fresh vegies, fresh fruit.</p> <p>It also means so much more. I haven\u2019t bought my daughter a birthday present since 2012. She\u2019ll be 33 in June. I\u2019ll be 59. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll buy her some art supplies \u2013 she\u2019s very artistic. She only uses the cheap stuff to experiment, but when she makes something she wants to sell, she uses the expensive stuff. As for me, there are all sorts of things I used to do that I\u2019ve forgotten because I can\u2019t afford to do them. I used to knit and crochet, but wool is expensive if you want to make anything like a jumper. I even used to dragon boat race. It\u2019s the only sport I\u2019ve loved and used to train three times a week when I had a job. I even competed nationally. Got medals and everything. But the membership costs money I didn\u2019t have, so I stopped.</p> <h2><strong>Avery Howard, 18, Sydney</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve been on the full independent youth allowance payment since I was 16 and became homeless. At the moment, the payment is $100 less than jobseeker, which is based on a highly outdated notion that young people are supported by their family.</p> <p>When the initial $750 stimulus pay came through, I used it to pay off some bills and buy some groceries. It was hard to find some things because of all the panic buying, but I was able to buy fresh food like mince and put that in the freezer, which I haven\u2019t been able to do until recently. Beforehand, skipping meals was definitely something I had to do. I still do it, but it\u2019s less of a necessity. I\u2019ve just gotten used to not eating as much.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fa08dbeae36d3ccf9fd7188e00f6a987afe74ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fa08dbeae36d3ccf9fd7188e00f6a987afe74ab/0_41_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Avery, 18, Sydney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Avery, 18, Sydney: \u2018It means I can breathe easier.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The $550 fortnightly supplement basically means I can breathe easier. It means I won\u2019t be so stressed about managing every cent like I\u2019m used to. I can use it to pay off an Afterpay bill from when I replaced my jeans and shirts that had been worn past repair. Longer term, I\u2019d like to save for a better computer as my current laptop was given to me by my school years ago, and has been put through the wringer. In the very long term, I\u2019d like to save some money to visit my partner who lives in the US. That\u2019s quite expensive, so I\u2019ll hope to squirrel away some money to get me there someday.</p> <h2><strong>Jessica Harrison, 65, Wonthaggi</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve worked part time and lived on what used to be called Newstart for around ten years. I live in a small town where there\u2019s limited chance for any kind of full-time occupation, any type of full-time paid work and because I\u2019m 65 it\u2019s hard to find a job at that age. I\u2019m lucky though, Wonthaggi is a beautiful place and I have lots of friends who help take care of each other. It\u2019s still tough at times. You get that sort of knot in the stomach when you think you\u2019ve spent too much on food that week. I suppose that big change with that temporary increase is what will lessen that feeling.</p> <p>The moment I heard about the supplement payment, I immediately started to mentally budget on what I could spend it on. It was instant. The first thing I am going to buy is some cream cheese, some crusty bread and one of those packets of smoked salmon. That\u2019s the luxury food that you don\u2019t buy at all when you\u2019re on that tiny amount. After that are the big things like house repairs and saving for dental work. The stuff on the house you just put off for a long time. There is a leak at the back of my toilet which I\u2019m going to be getting fixed. And my chimney is pretty rusted. Get my car serviced. These are things you put off as a long as you can because no matter what you calculate one repair will lead to another. Same with teeth, really.</p> <h2><strong>Cameron Ezzy, 25, Townsville</strong></h2> <p>Right now I\u2019m working at Dominos to support myself while I do a social work degree. I usually get $300 to $400 a week from Dominos, with Centrelink topping up my wage. Before the $750 stimulus, I was overcharging my bank account by $50. Usually we were just getting by, month-to-month.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"11b48dce225af8aa8cd90ed593bd73feef75c220\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11b48dce225af8aa8cd90ed593bd73feef75c220/250_0_489_546/448.jpg\" alt=\"Cameron, 25, Townsville\" width=\"448\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cameron, 25, Townsville.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve got $300 in savings \u2013 not much for an emergency. It was tough even getting basics like veggies and fuel. I help my partner out as well. She struggles with her mental health and studies. I work so she can take care of herself.</p> <p>The payment was announced pretty much on my birthday, so it was happy birthday from the Australian government. The money\u2019ll basically mean we\u2019re buying time. One day me and my partner would like to get married, have kids. We\u2019re thinking about moving to Melbourne one day, but we have to sort out work first, finish the degrees. Right now though we\u2019re just trying to survive, so the money means we\u2019ll be able to do that. I\u2019ll be able to cover car registration. I\u2019ll be stocking up on food a little bit \u2013 we go to the Asian grocer because no one tends to buy from there because they\u2019re worried about getting the coronavirus from Asian people. Which is stupid. Migraine medication is not on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme so that\u2019s $50 every time, which will be easier to get now. What it means is time to study. Less time to work. Time to prepare to make a big change.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/26/i-havent-left-my-building-life-gets-harder-for-vulnerable-australians-during-coronavirus-crisis\">'I haven't left my building': life gets harder for vulnerable Australians during coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Julie Wilson*, 54, Shoalhaven</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve variously been on what was called Newstart and the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme for nearly two years \u2013 I run an Airbnb, which gives me opportunities others don\u2019t have, though with the recent fires and now the pandemic, we\u2019re not getting any visitors.</p> <p>When I heard they were giving additional money, I was cynical.

I plan to take orders and deliver orders directly to homes.</p> <p>My life could change, but realistically, I won\u2019t believe it until I see it. I try not to get my hopes up, because I can\u2019t risk feeling hopelessness.</p> <h2><strong>Imogen Bunting, 47, Brisbane</strong></h2> <p>I walked to work at my part-time job this morning. A middle-aged man on a bike yelled at me because I didn\u2019t have cigarettes for him.

I\u2019ve got a bed this week in a $50 apartment. It\u2019s just a bed and bath with no other facilities \u2013 not even garbage collection. No cooking or laundry. At least I can lock my door and not worry about creeps staring in my car window.</p> <p>The extra $550 a fortnight is a great relief, but it was luck the government decided to do this. I\u2019ve been kicked off the public housing list so maybe I\u2019ll use that money to get a pair of glasses so I can see and write my re-application and housing appeal? It\u2019s not enough to pay my car rego. Definitely a good pair of shoes ... some new clothes. A bit of dignity. Is that a luxury? I\u2019ll eat a little better, if I can have a fridge to store food in. My overall health will improve with the certainty of a good night\u2019s sleep. Without a home I can\u2019t get my cat back.</p> <p>When Covid-19 clears up, I\u2019ll get back to studying my law and criminology degree. Maybe the money will help. Though it\u2019s terrifying there is an end date \u2013 afterwards people are going to be shunted back to abject poverty. Me? Next week, it looks like I\u2019ll be couch surfing in Brisbane again, where my tribe is.</p> <h2><strong>Mandy Weber, 48, Bacchus Marsh</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019m a single mum with two kids and usually a full-time chef. The transition from the parenting payment to Newstart, back when my eldest was eight, was rough. We spent three months living in a car. Now I use it to top up my income, but I lost my job in the pandemic. I don\u2019t think that pub will open again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3963d232fe0e039dc8d0891024780419157cc4b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3963d232fe0e039dc8d0891024780419157cc4b9/0_0_3017_1810/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mandy, 48, from Bacchus Marsh, Victoria, with her two daughters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mandy, 48, from Bacchus Marsh, Victoria, with her two daughters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Until they announced they were going to do the coronavirus supplement, I was honestly terrified. I didn\u2019t know what we were going to do for money. I was selling things to keep us going. Until it comes I\u2019ve only got $48 to survive on, and that\u2019s to feed my two girls. I did my grocery shopping this week on $19. Right now my bank balance is 42 cents. When the money does come through, I\u2019ll be replacing some of the stuff I sold.</p> <p>The main thing is to keep paying for my girls\u2019 education. I want them to have a better life than I had so I want to buy them a future. VET courses are $900 a year, combined. Then there\u2019s school books. E-books. Pens and pencils. School bags for when they go back. Uniforms. Their laptops were $1,000 each. Then there\u2019s the internet, which I have to have now at $90 a month. A printer.</p> <p>That supplement is going to make a huge difference to my household, being able to pay the rent, buy food. It\u2019s hope, but then there\u2019ll also be despair at the end. A bit of grief and loss. Because all of a sudden, in October, we\u2019ll go back to nothing again.</p> <p><em>As told to Royce Kurmelovs. The interviews have been edited for length and clarity</em></p> <p><em>*Name has been changed</em><br></p>",

On an episode of the New York history podcast The Bowery Boys dedicated to the film, the hosts point out that, like an opera, Moonstruck\u2019s characters each have specific themes they return to. For Loretta, it\u2019s luck \u2013 she believes hers is bad. For Rose Castorini, it\u2019s her belief that men chase women because they fear death: her husband Cosmo (Vincent Gardenia) is having an affair with a woman named Mona (Anita Gillette).</p> <p>Gardenia has one of those faces that always make me think of Maria in James Joyce\u2019s Clay. \u201cWhen she laughed,\u201d Joyce writes, \u201cthe tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin.\u201d We\u2019d know for sure if Cosmo ever laughed. But he\u2019s sick of his life \u2013 he fears death \u2013 so Mona laughs for him, at even his most banal stories about selling copper plumbing piping. Mona says precisely nothing of value.
