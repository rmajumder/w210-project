On Monday, the country posted 8,926 new cases, the lowest in weeks.</p> \n  <p>But concerns about the actual death toll of the disease have grown amid worrying reports from Dagestan and several other regions of hundreds of deaths from pneumonia, many of whom may have been infected with coronavirus but not tallied due to Russia\u2019s conservative autopsy standards. The country has tallied just 2,722 deaths from the disease.</p> \n  <p>The health minister of Dagestan, a southern Russian region of nearly three million people, said on Sunday that while officially 29 people in the republic had died of Covid-19, another 657 people had died of \u201ccommunity-acquired pneumonia,\u201d a sickness often contracted by those infected with coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>He also confirmed that more than 40 medics in Dagestan had died since the coronavirus crisis began, a concern that had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/painful-to-see-rise-in-russian-medics-falling-prey-to-covid-19-as-death-toll-questioned\">raised concerns across Russia</a>, but claimed that many had died of causes other than coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>Other regions also appeared to indicate that death rates from pneumonia were many times higher than from coronavirus. The St. Petersburg governor also announced late last week that 694 people had died from pneumonia since 1 March, while just 63 people had officially died of coronavirus and been added to Russia\u2019s tally of deaths from the disease.</p> \n  <p>Russia\u2019s mortality rate from the disease is considerably lower than other countries with more than 100,000 infections. The Kremlin has said that is attributable to the country\u2019s medical system, while critics have noted that deaths are tallied differently than in most countries in Europe and North America. New data from Moscow last week indicated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/coronavirus-russia-defends-its-exceptionally-precise-covid-19-death-data\">nearly 1,600 people with coronavirus</a> had died since the outbreak began, but that just 639 were included on official death tolls from the disease after autopsies found other causes of death.</p> \n  <p>Many academics believe that excess death rates are the best way to evaluate the total death toll from the disease.

the situation is stabilising. </p> \n  <p>Health officials reported 8,926 new infections in the last 24 hours, bringing the country\u2019s total to 290,678, the second-highest in the world after the <strong>United States</strong>. </p> \n  <p>It was the lowest number of new virus cases since 1 May, when Russia announced 7,933 cases. </p> \n  <p>Russia\u2019s consumer health watchdog chief,

At least 315,187<strong> </strong>people have died over the course of the pandemic The number of deaths in the US is approaching 90,000, with 89,562 confirmed fatalities and 1,486,757 infections, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker.</li> \n   <li><strong>US Federal Reserve Chair says unemployment could reach 25%. </strong>US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Sunday that US unemployment could peak at 25%, but expressed optimism that the economy could begin to recover from a devastating recession in the second half of the year, assuming the coronavirus doesn\u2019t erupt in a second wave.</li> \n   <li><strong>Japan </strong><strong>falls into recession. </strong>Japan dived into its first recession since 2015, according to official data on Monday, with the world\u2019s third-largest economy contracting by 0.9% in the first quarter as it wrestled with the fallout from the coronavirus. The cabinet office reported a drop of 3.4% annual pace in seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, or GDP, the total value of a nation\u2019s goods and services, for the January-March period, compared with the previous quarter.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Africa reports highest daily increase in cases. </strong>South Africa on Sunday reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March \u201cAs of today, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 15,515, with 1,160 new cases identified in the last 24 hour cycle of testing,\u201d the health ministry said in a statement.

Brazil has the fourth-highest number of infections worldwide, with 241,080, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. It has recorded 16,118 deaths. Meanwhile, Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro greeted hundreds of supporters and joined some in a series of push-ups who gathered before the presidential offices Sunday.</li> \n   <li><strong>Death tolls fall in UK, Spain and Italy. </strong>In a possible glimmer of hope, Sunday saw lower death tolls reported in the UK, Spain and Italy. The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. However, the Sunday and Monday figures tend to be lower than other days because of weekend testing rates. Meanwhile, Spain<strong> </strong>recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months. Italy on Sunday recorded its lowest daily toll, 145, since lockdown was declared. There were 153 deaths registered during the previous 24 hour period.</li> \n   <li><strong>Move Rohingya on Bangladesh island to refugee camps, says UN chief. </strong>Hundreds of Rohingya rescued by Bangladesh and sent to a flood-prone island after being stranded at sea for weeks should be moved to existing refugee camps, the UN secretary general has said. </li> \n   <li><strong>WHO committee to discuss Taiwan exclusion. </strong>The World Health Organization (WHO) is to raise the question of Taiwan\u2019s participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/world-health-assembly-what-is-it-and-what-is-the-coronavirus-inquiry-china-taiwan-origins\">which opens virtually on Monday</a>, before one of its committees. Diplomatic allies of Taiwan, including Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Paraguay, have formally requested to invite Taiwan to the meeting as an observer. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has also said publicly he wants Taiwan in the room.</li> \n   <li><strong>India extends lockdown by another two weeks. </strong>India has extended its lockdown to 31 May, but with some easing of restrictions. States are being given greater power to reopen markets and standalone stores, bus and other public transport travel being allowed between and within states.

The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. This should be taken with a pinch of salt: due to hospital reporting delays, the numbers reported on Sundays and Mondays tend to be lower than other days. Meanwhile Spain<strong> </strong>has recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months. Italy on Sunday recorded its lowest daily toll, 145, since lockdown was declared.

The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. This should be taken with a pinch of salt: due to hospital reporting delays, the numbers reported on Sundays and Mondays tend to be lower than other days.

  "<p>The mayors of Greater Manchester and Liverpool city region have called on ministers to take a \u201cmuch more locally focused\u201d response to the coronavirus crisis, urging them to loosen Whitehall\u2019s control of areas such as testing and personal protective equipment.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/16/are-we-all-in-this-together-it-doesnt-look-like-it-from-the-regions\">Andy Burnham said he did not want to gratuitously criticise central government but </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/16/are-we-all-in-this-together-it-doesnt-look-like-it-from-the-regions\">said its focus had been \u201cvery, very nationally driven\u201d</a> and was creating problems in the regions.</p> \n<p>The government has faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/16/revolt-over-easing-lockdown-spreads-as-poll-slump-hits-prime-minister\">criticism</a> over its easing of the nationwide lockdown and plans to reopen schools in a fortnight, with council leaders from across the north of England saying it is too early to lift the restrictions in their areas.</p> \n<p>In Yorkshire and the north-east of England, the rate of infection is double that in London, according to latest figures from Public Health England.</p> \n<p>Burnham has pressed for the eight regional metro mayors \u2013 who represent nearly 12 million people in England, or one in five of the population \u2013 to be given a seat at the table of the government\u2019s Cobra meetings, alongside the London mayor Sadiq Khan and leaders of the devolved nations, but this has not yet been agreed by ministers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/choropleth\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He said Whitehall-focused decision-making was creating issues locally, such as a drive-through testing facility for NHS staff that was opened at Manchester airport \u2013 miles from the region\u2019s major hospitals. \u201cIt might have made sense in an office in Whitehall but it doesn\u2019t make sense if you live in Greater Manchester,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>\u201cOn testing, on PPE, on volunteers, they would have made life easier for themselves had they picked up the phone to me and [other mayors],\u201d said the former Labour health secretary.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe response has been very, very nationally driven but the recovery has got to be much more locally driven. Local leaders should have much more control of issues like testing.\u201d</p> \n<p>The chronic shortage of protective equipment for NHS staff has emerged as one of the biggest challenges for Boris Johnson\u2019s government.</p> \n<p>In Greater Manchester, the only region that has devolved healthcare powers, Burnham established a PPE taskforce that has ordered 19m pieces of essential kit to hospitals and care homes and has so far delivered 4.8m, with a further 5.2m due to arrive in the next seven days. He said the shortage of PPE would have been a \u201cmuch bigger problem\u201d if the region had not sourced its own equipment.</p> \n<p>Other metro mayors, including Steve Rotheram in Liverpool and Andy Street in the West Midlands, have also launched local appeals for the supply of PPE amid frustration with the government\u2019s \u201cpriority drops\u201d system. One promised consignment of 500,000 items to Greater Manchester ended up delivering only 48,000 pieces, Burnham said, while other regions have reported similar issues.</p> \n<p>Rotheram said \u201ctrying to do everything from a national system hasn\u2019t worked as well as we\u2019d all have liked\u201d and that the government \u201ccould and should\u201d have involved local government more with PPE, coordinating testing sites and rolling out the tracing programmes.</p> \n<p>\u201cMayors, councils, and the local NHS are all closer to the situation on the ground than Whitehall and we know the needs of our communities better,\u201d he added.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cNow I worry government are making the same mistake again when it comes to changes to lockdown measures, which are being pushed down from a national level, with little to no local engagement.\u201d</p> \n<p>The calls from mayors came as the Tony Blair Institute (TBI) said it had developed a way to measure the local impact of lifting lockdown measures in real time, suggesting local leaders could be given a greater role in easing the restrictions in their areas.</p> \n<p>The model uses mobility data from Google to monitor how busy a particular place is at a particular time, alongside Public Health England data on the number of infections at a local authority level.</p> \n<p>It uses this data to calculate the infection rate for that area and track it alongside any increase or decrease in mobility. For example, it said mobility in the UK was 44% of its usual level in the first week of May, while in the same week the spread of the virus was slowing by about 21 percentage points over a five-day period.</p> \n<p>They concluded that the UK could increase mobility to 51% of usual levels without pushing the R value \u2013 the rate at which one infected person passes it to others \u2013 above the crucial threshold of one.</p> \n<p>However, it said the virus still appears to be accelerating in 14 areas \u2013 including York, Slough and the Isle of Wight \u2013 where mobility could be further reduced to bring the outbreak under control.</p> \n<p>Ian Mulheirn, the TBI\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cAs lockdown measures start to lift, the government will be driving by looking in the rear-view mirror. We have little sense currently of what impact the different steps will have on the all-important R number, and will only find out many days later, when deaths and new cases start to rise.</p> \n<p>\u201cBy establishing the link between mobility and the rate of spread of the virus, we have developed a real-time indicator of the effect of different easing measures, allowing the economy to be opened up safely and early targeted intervention to be taken if the virus looks likely to spread in local areas.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Offenders who commit \u201calcohol-fuelled\u201d crimes can be required to wear \u201csobriety tags\u201d and banned from drinking under legislation that comes into force in England and Wales on Tuesday.</p> <p>Courts will have the power to order those convicted of drink-related crimes to wear an ankle monitor for up to 120 days. It assesses whether there is any alcohol in their sweat.</p> <p>The first tags are expected to be fitted this year once probation staff have been trained and the monitoring contract agreed. When up and running, as many as 2,300 are likely to be fitted on offenders every year.</p> <p>The initiative follows successful pilot projects including one carried out in London when Boris Johnson was mayor. People who are found to be breaching an alcohol abstinence order can be brought back before the courts to face further punishment, which could include imprisonment.</p> <p>Announcing the national rollout, Kit Malthouse MP, the crime, policing and justice minister, said: \u201cAlcohol-fuelled crime blights communities and puts an unnecessary strain on our frontline services.</p> <p>\u201cSmart technologies like sobriety tags not only punish offenders but can help turn their lives around. While prison will always be the right place for many criminals, tough community sentences like this can help cut reoffending and protect the public.\u201d</p> <p>Two successful pilots, one across Humberside, Lincolnshire and North Yorkshire and another in London, recorded that 94% of offenders remained alcohol-free during their monitoring period.</p> <p>Keith Hunter, the police and crime commissioner (PCC) for Humberside, said: \u201cDuring the trial in our area they provided rehabilitation agencies a real opportunity to work with the individual and get them to recognise and change their behaviour.</p> <p>\u201cUndoubtedly their use will help reduce the number of victims of alcohol-related crime, many in domestic situations, and aid the rehabilitation of offenders as they become a standard feature of the criminal justice system.\u201d</p> <p>The tough community sentences not only punish offenders, according to the Ministry of Justice, but also help their rehabilitation by forcing them to address the causes of their harmful behaviour.</p> <p>An estimated 39% of violent crime involves an offender under the influence of alcohol, according to the Crime Survey for England and Wales. The social and economic cost of alcohol-related harm is calculated by Public Health England as being \u00a321.5bn per year.</p> <p>The sobriety tags sample an offender\u2019s sweat every half-hour to determine whether alcohol has been consumed. They are said to be capable of distinguishing between alcohol-based products, such as hand sanitisers, that could be used to mask alcohol consumption and can also detect when contact between skin and tag has been blocked.</p> <p>They will not be used on people who are alcohol-dependent or have certain medical conditions. Judges have been calling for many years for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/nov/22/top-judge-calls-for-tough-community-service-as-alternative-to-prison-lord-chief-justice\">tougher non-custodial sentences</a>.</p> <p>An unidentified offender, who wore one of the tags in the Humberside, Lincolnshire and North Yorkshire pilot scheme, said: \u201cSince I had the tag removed I feel 100% in control of my drinking. I was worried to begin with that when I had the tag taken off I might go back to drinking again but the process gave me a better understanding of alcohol. I also didn\u2019t want to go back to court.</p> <p>\u201cI no longer need a drink to manage my emotions which is down to the tag and my probation officer \u2013 I\u2019m much happier with my life now and pleased that more people can benefit from my experience of wearing the tags.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Gambling addiction rates may be much higher than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/aug/24/problem-gamblers-uk-gambling-commission-report\">previously thought</a>, according to research that also warns nearly half of those with a problem are not getting any help.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/27/isolation-will-fuel-gambling-addiction-we-must-protect-those-at-risk\">Isolation will fuel gambling addiction. We must protect those at risk | Carolyn Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a survey commissioned by the GambleAware charity, YouGov estimated that up to 2.7% of adults in Great Britain, or nearly 1.4 million people, were problem gamblers. Experts urged caution over the figure, insisting that the true addiction rate is likely to be closer to the health survey figures of 0.7% <a href=\"https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/PDF/survey-data/Gambling-behaviour-in-Great-Britain-2016.pdf\">cited </a><a href=\"https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/PDF/survey-data/Gambling-behaviour-in-Great-Britain-2016.pdf\"> by industry regulator</a> the Gambling Commission.</p> <p>But the findings still indicate that the number of problem gamblers \u2013 defined as scoring more than eight on the <a href=\"https://responsiblegambling.vic.gov.au/for-professionals/health-and-community-professionals/problem-gambling-severity-index-pgsi/\">Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI)</a> \u2013 may be significantly above current estimates. YouGov questioned 16,000 people for the survey.</p> <p>The report also found that as many as 7% of adults, or 3.6 million people, report having been negatively affected by someone else\u2019s gambling problem.</p> <p>Overall, the research suggests that nearly 5 million British people have experienced harm linked to gambling, even accounting for the overlap between problem gamblers and those they affect.</p> <p>Both GambleAware and the Gambling Commission said it was likely that YouGov\u2019s findings overestimated the addiction rate, highlighting a review of the data by survey sampling expert Prof Patrick Sturgis.</p> <p>Sturgis, a former GambleAware trustee, said both the YouGov survey and the health survey figures were likely to contain flaws, with the true rate of problem gambling likely to be closer to the commonly used 0.7% figure than YouGov\u2019s 2.7% estimate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42b2ba44d76f401114fb40d361483900ec0cc8f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42b2ba44d76f401114fb40d361483900ec0cc8f3/0_162_4745_2848/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man betting on smartphone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The findings are likely to fuel calls for stronger measures to address gambling addiction.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But he said the higher figure could not be ruled out and added that previous research had probably \u201csomewhat underestimated\u201d addiction levels. The findings are likely to fuel calls for stronger measures to address gambling addiction, amid increased concern about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/24/growth-in-problem-gambling-amid-coronavirus-lockdown\">added risk posed to frequent gamblers</a> isolated at home due to coronavirus.</p> <p>Labour MP Carolyn Harris, who chairs a cross-party group of MPs examining gambling harm, said the report was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the rate of 2.7% could well be an overestimate, the health survey data seems to be a significant underestimate. This new data suggests that addiction levels are far higher than has been previously thought.</p> <p>\u201cPolicymakers, the regulator and gambling support services must take note of these important findings and ensure that the correct provision and regulation is in place to support gamblers in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>The report also found that nearly half of all addicts were not receiving treatment, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/05/gambling-industry-feasts-on-poor-vulnerable-helen-pidd\">poorer people</a>, women and those from a BAME background the worst affected.</p> <p>A lack of awareness of services and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/28/this-is-a-mental-health-issue-the-devastating-impact-of-problem-gambling\">stigma associated</a> with gambling problems were both cited as significant barriers to accessing treatment and support.</p> <p>While women are less prone to developing a gambling disorder, those who do are three times more likely than men to refer to practical barriers such as cost, time or location as a reason for not accessing treatment or support.</p> <p>Matt Gaskell, clinical lead for NHS gambling clinics in the north of England, said the report should lead to significant changes in how treatment and support is offered and delivered.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a significant gap between very high levels of gambling harm and the provision of help, and this gives a useful guide as to how and where to plug some of these gaps,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe sense of shame and stigma that provides a barrier to coming forward for support is compounded by the narrative, perpetuated by the gambling industry and others, that emphasises individualised responsibility for harms.</p> <p>\u201cMy patients feel that they are entirely to blame. The public know that smoking cigarettes is dangerous, and this helps us to be compassionate about tobacco addiction and seeking support for this.</p> <p>\u201cIt will help if the public are similarly aware of the addictive nature of gambling products.\u201d</p> <p>The Gambling Commission said the report had provided \u201cinvaluable additional information\u201d about the gaps in current treatment provision across Great Britain. It pointed to \u00a39m it had diverted towards treatment services, funded by penalties levied on gambling firms that breach the terms of their licence.</p>",

  "<p>Police attempted to use a Taser on Ahmaud Arbery, the slain Georgia jogger, after questioning why he was sitting alone in his car in a park one morning in November 2017, according to<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NB84hbTOdL2Hbxlv6BM1luvJXwB6MrIk/view?usp=sharing\"> records </a>and a police video obtained by the Guardian.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/17/ahmaud-arbery-district-attorney-george-barnhill\">Ahmaud Arbery: new focus on district attorney\u2019s flawed prosecutions of black women</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The video, obtained through a public records request, comes to light as law enforcement in the area faces scrutiny after Arbery was shot dead by two white men while jogging in February. Police did not arrest Gregory and Travis McMichael, who chased down and killed the unarmed Arbery, and a prosecutor assigned to the case wrote a <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6916-george-barnhill-letter-to-glyn/b52fa09cdc974b970b79/optimized/full.pdf\">lengthy memo</a> explaining why the killing was legally justified.</p> \n<p>That prosecutor, George Barnhill, eventually recused himself, noting his son had worked with Gregory McMichael in the district attorney\u2019s office and they had worked on a previous case Arbery <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/brunswick-attorney-released-the-video-arbery-shooting/JkpbvTuJt9wfl3tkcLTTvO/\">was involved in</a>.</p> \n<p>In the video an officer patrolling the area suspected Arbery of using marijuana, saying he was in a park known for drug activity.</p> \n<p>Arbery, dressed in a green hat, winter coat and athletic pants, said he didn\u2019t have drugs and refused to let the officer search his car. He told the officer he was relaxing by rapping in his car over instrumental beats and had the day off from work at Blue Beacon Truck Wash.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"682f408e-a616-4265-a111-a49abff0e7eb\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VvlFw7AcKUU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The incident, previously described <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/records-show-neighborhood-edge-before-arbery-final-jog/P9shmCoRGj90XFWbKfApmJ/\">by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>, escalated when Arbery began to question why the officer, Michael Kanago, was hassling him. Kanago claimed he began to feel threatened by Arbery, later writing in his report that \u201cveins were popping from [Arbery\u2019s] chest, which made me feel that he was becoming enraged and may turn physically violent towards me\u201d. Kanago requested help from a second officer.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re bothering me for nothing,\u201d Arbery said to Kanago, according to body camera footage. After Kanago told him he was looking for criminal activity, Arbery said \u201ccriminal activity? I\u2019m in a fucking park. I work.\u201d</p> \n<p>The second officer, David Haney, arrived minutes later and screamed at Arbery to get his hands out of his pockets, which Arbery did.</p> \n<p>Haney then attempted to tase Arbery, but his Taser malfunctioned, according to Kanago\u2019s report. Arbery continued to comply with instructions from the two officers to get on the ground. Kanago had already searched Arbery for weapons before Haney arrived, and deduced he was unarmed.</p> \n<p>\u201cI get one day off a week\u2026I\u2019m up early in the morning trying to chill,\u201d Arbery told the officers as he sat on the ground. \u201cI\u2019m just so aggravated because I work hard, six days a week.\u201d</p> \n<p>The incident eventually ends with police allowing Arbery to leave, but forbidding him from driving his car because his driver\u2019s license is suspended.</p> \n<p> In a joint statement to the Guardian, lawyers working for the Arbery family described the video as a clear depiction of \u201ca situation where Ahmaud was harassed by Glynn county police officers\u201d.</p> \n<p>The lawyers said there was \u201cno justifiable reason\u201d for Arbery to be threatened with a Taser. \u201cThis appears to be just a glimpse into the kind of scrutiny Ahmaud Arbery faced not only by this police department, but ultimately regular citizens like the McMichaels and their posse, pretending to be police officers.\u201d</p> \n<p>Arbery was placed on probation in 2013 for carrying a gun at a high school basketball game and then charged with shoplifting and violating his probation in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/brunswick-attorney-released-the-video-arbery-shooting/JkpbvTuJt9wfl3tkcLTTvO/\">according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution</a>. Arbery\u2019s attorneys have said those charges have nothing to do with his killing.</p> \n<p>The Glynn county police department <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-spurs-calls-to-disband-police-force-11589630401\">was already facing local political pressure</a> to disband before the Arbery shooting due to a string of recent corruption scandals.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.statesboroherald.com/local/glynn-county-police-chief-3-ex-officers-charged-scandal-grows/\">In March</a> the department\u2019s police chief and three high ranking officers were indicted on perjury charges related to allegations they ignored evidence that an officer from the department was consorting with a local drug dealer.</p> \n<p>The department was forced to disband a specialist narcotics department in 2019 after an investigator was found to have had sex with two confidential informants. The department found evidence of the misconduct in 2017 but failed to investigate. In 2018 the department lost certifications with two law enforcement bodies, the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police and the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement.</p> \n<p>On Monday an outside judge was appointed to preside over the trial of the two men charged with Arbery\u2019s murder, one of whom is a retired law enforcement officer.</p>",

It analyzed the cases of 368 male coronavirus patients nationwide, 97 receiving hydroxychloroquine, 113 receiving hydroxychloroquine in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin, and 158 not receiving any hydroxychloroquine. This was not a randomized clinical trial, the gold standard of drug testing, which would randomly assign hydroxychloroquine treatment to some patients and not to others. Instead, researchers looked back on cases \u2013 and weren\u2019t able to account for why doctors chose to treat some patients with the antimalarial drug and not others. It could be that those treated with hydroxychloroquine had a higher chance of death because doctors chose to give the most severely ill patients the unproven drug.</p> \n<p><em>Maanvi Singh contributed reporting</em></p>",

  "<p>You can\u2019t fault Matt Hancock\u2019s Stakhanovite work ethic. Barely a day has gone by without him being sent out on to the government frontline. But the effort is clearly beginning to take its toll. In the past few weeks his normal Tiggerish enthusiasm and goodwill to all has given way to something rather more vulnerable. A man who feels himself not just under attack from a country that wonders why the health secretary hasn\u2019t done rather more to protect the nation\u2019s health, but also from the prime minister and cabinet colleagues who have been lining him up as the scapegoat in the inevitable public inquiry.</p> <p>The initial sign that Matt was not coping so well was in his snappiness. His tetchiness with MPs and members of the media whenever his version of events was challenged. Now though it\u2019s looking as if Hancock is moving through the denial and anger stages of grief toward the bargaining and depression stages.</p> <p>There\u2019s still a way to go before he comes to any form of acceptance but now there is a discernible sadness to his public performances. An emotional fragility that can barely be kept at bay. Other people\u2019s anger he can just about deal with. It\u2019s their compassion that will get him in the end. The Dear Matt text in which he is dumped with the words, \u201cIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p> <p>For his Commons coronavirus statement, it was all Matt could do to hold it together for an hour. Hardly surprising as he knows better than anyone that much of what he\u2019s saying is pure fantasy. Though the truth might set him free, he\u2019s just not quite ready for the admission of failure. So he began as if the coronavirus was a mild inconvenience, rather than the worst public health crisis for 100 years.</p> <p>We\u2019d passed the peak \u2013 please, no one tell him about the probability of a second wave \u2013 and by and large everything was totally in control. The government had done brilliantly, hospitals had coped and NHS mental health services were there for anyone who needed them. Provided they were able to wait six months without falling apart completely for a referral to a professional.</p> <p>Care homes had had a protective ring thrown round them from the very start of the pandemic. As a description of the government\u2019s handling of the crisis it could hardly have been more inaccurate. But this wasn\u2019t about the public. It was about throwing a protective ring around Matt\u2019s psyche. This was as close to reality as he could bring himself to get.</p> <p>There were a few new announcements. From now on anosmia \u2013 a lack of smell or taste \u2013 would be added to a persistent dry cough and high temperature as coronavirus symptoms. And anyone with any of these symptoms could now get a test if they could log on to the NHS website and find a testing station with capacity to see them. Best of all, Matt was able to report that he had beaten his target of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/17/uk-contact-tracing-applicants-wrongly-told-hiring-paused-in-latest-misstep\">recruiting 18,000 tracers</a> \u2013 he didn\u2019t know if they were yet trained \u2013 and now had 21,000 people on the books. Though given Hancock\u2019s dodgy record on false accounting, it was quite possible that some of the new recruits may have been counted twice.</p> <p>Some politicians believe you need to be cruel to be kind. Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary, John Ashworth, takes the opposite view and is kind to be cruel. He\u2019s long since stopped being angry with Hancock over the government\u2019s mishandling of the crisis and now just talks to him like an awkward teenager in whom he\u2019s disappointed. It had been a bit late to include anosmia, hadn\u2019t it? There hadn\u2019t always been a protective ring around care homes, had there? And what was the point in easing lockdown restrictions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/phone-app-delay-raises-concerns-about-easing-lockdown-on-1-june\">before there was a comprehensive test and trace system up and running</a> to replace them?</p> <p>Matt was now on the verge of breaking down. His eyes bloodshot as he tried to hold it together. Pleading for one last chance to make the relationship work. There was definitely a protective ring around care homes. Things would change. Get better, he promised. Having already forgotten that his new test and trace operation was supposed to have kicked in two days ago. Just one last chance, he pleaded.</p> <p>\u201cWe are ready and preparing,\u201d he said, apparently unaware that the two were mutually exclusive. You\u2019re either ready or you\u2019re preparing. A few Tory backbenchers tried to put a socially-distanced arm around him and reassure him he was doing OK, but most just melted away. Matt left the chamber alone. Hopefully to have a long sob in private. He might just find it cathartic.</p> <p>Fifteen minutes later, Priti Patel made a rare public appearance as she reintroduced her immigration bill. Most of us have long since concluded that the home secretary has been kept hidden because she is fundamentally useless. But now some MPs were wondering if she might not also have had the coronavirus. Because there was a total lack of taste in announcing plans to keep low-paid overseas workers out of the country, when they are doing more than most to keep the NHS, care homes and food deliveries running.</p> <p>Still, Patel did want to pay a small tribute to those doing jobs she considers unskilled. Not least because she has also proved that being home secretary is low-skilled work. So, as a compromise, she proposed that everyone should continue clapping key workers at 8pm on a Thursday. Just to help them on their way to the deportation centre. She\u2019s all heart, Priti.</p>",
  "<p>And we\u2019re off. Project Refund: Phase One is now operational. Although in the interests of accuracy the plan to complete the Premier League season would perhaps be better restyled as Project <em>No</em> Refund, given the only reason anyone wants to play professional football right now \u2013 never mind the cant about national morale and (spare me) \u201csporting integrity\u201d \u2013 is to avoid repaying the broadcasters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/18/premier-league-clubs-vote-to-start-training-but-worries-remain-over-restart\">Premier League admits fans may not be allowed to return for a year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is no shame in this, or need to pretend otherwise. Clubs are cultural assets. Their good health is important. Football supports a large associated workforce outside the better-off elite players. But it is also in everyone\u2019s interest to be clear on the sense of commercial urgency that lies behind every decision taken along the way, including those successfully voted through at Monday\u2019s Premier League meeting.</p> <p>It is a gentle first step. As of Tuesday afternoon clubs can return to carefully managed individual training, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/11/england-players-expected-to-complete-cricket-based-work-in-pairs\" title=\"\">same process England\u2019s cricketers</a> will shortly begin, and the same kind of thing that is happening in parks all around the country.</p> <p>The next phase will involve training in groups of up to six, possibly from next week. Finally clubs will look to agree 11-versus-11 training, presumably with the kind of token restrictions seen in the Bundesliga over the weekend, with masks for substitutes and prim attempts to enforce physical distancing.</p> <p>After which the Premier League will look to restart close to, on, or slightly after its current flag in the sand, 15 June.</p> <p>There will of course be extreme reactions to this process. Understandably so: we are in an extreme situation. The first of these is the obvious response that it is unsafe to consider playing professional football right now, and that all attempts to do so will put lives at risk.</p> <p>The other main objection is that the football produced will be a shabby, synthetic imitation, a shotgun wedding before an empty congregation; and that it will therefore be unfair on those who stand to lose (ie experience relegation) given the skewed sporting environment.</p> <p>Both of these objections are unarguably valid. At the same time both are, in some sense, immaterial to what is about to happen.</p> <p>Firstly, on risk. There is no doubt that football\u2019s return will be hurried through ahead of what can be deemed absolutely safe, and that thanks to its clout and profile the Premier League will be allowed to ride shotgun into this unknown frontier.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/may/16/germany-borussia-dortmund-schalke\" title=\"\">Bundesliga may have returned successfully</a> last weekend, but there are good reasons for this. Germany has a quarter of the UK death toll to date. Germany has six times fewer new cases of Covid-19 diagnosed every day. Germany has a mature, competent leadership with a clear and transparent plan.</p> <p>The Bundesliga itself still has its 51% ownership rule, still retains a community aspect at the top level, and still seems able to act in a climate of general good faith. Germany has earned its place at the front of this queue, although even then there are plenty with misgivings about the resumption.</p> <p>These include some medical professionals. There are concerns Covid-19 remains essentially a mystery disease, one whose long-term effects on the body are unknown. Footballers often have brittle immune systems due to the high intensity of their training. What is certain is that English football is a ruthless business that will push its component parts as far as they can go. Would you trust its opinion on your pre-scandal asbestos roof, or the smoking \u201chealth-scare\u201d? Would you trust it with a trunk full of plutonium?</p> <p>It is also worth being clear about who exactly is most at risk from the Premier League resuming. According to official figures the highest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/manual-workers-likelier-to-die-from-covid-19-than-professionals\" title=\"\">death rate from Covid-19 up to 20 April</a> was among men working in low-skilled leisure and service occupations; or in other words those on the periphery, those who make the industry work as opposed to those making the decisions.</p> <p>Cleaners, carpenters, electricians, manual workers, security guards, transport drivers: these are the people who have died in large numbers with this disease, not CEOs or athletes. These are the people football will vote to put further at risk as the return to action approaches.</p> <p>And yet, at the same time it is self-evident that this is going to happen. And that in pressing forward the Premier League is simply following the tide of British society\u2019s governing and corporate classes. Every decision taken right now involves an appalling balancing act, between virus control and total economic collapse. Every decision is by definition pragmatic and flawed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/18/saudi-regime-newcastle-united-jamal-khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman\">The Saudi regime murdered my fiance. It can't be allowed to buy Newcastle United | Hatice Cengiz</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Against this background it would be absurd to expect English football and the Premier League to make sense of it all, to set some noble and self-sacrificing example. This is a league whose members, we hear via noises off, are concerned their fraternal brothers in arms will lie about infection rates to get matches cancelled (the Maya Angelou quote about believing someone when they tell you who they are springs to mind).</p> <p>This is an organisation lashed together by shared self-interest, whose members have spent the last two months scrabbling for handholds like the doomed ship\u2019s crew on the Raft of the Medusa as it slips beneath the waves. Don\u2019t expect caution or selflessness when these are scarcely present elsewhere in society. And perhaps, who knows, there is something to be said for simply ploughing ahead when all is uncertain.</p> <p>Against this background it seems absurd to object that the rejigged season\u2019s end will be either artificial or unfair. This may well be the case, but on the other hand the basic stitching of society is also coming apart, so there\u2019s that too.</p> <p>And let\u2019s face it, elite level football is already unfair. Football isn\u2019t unfair because of an absence of home fans for a few rescheduled matches. It\u2019s skewed because of its ludicrous finances, because the rich can dominate and get richer. This is not a function of an unexpected bat virus.</p> <p>At which point, with best wishes and fingers crossed for all involved, it is now all systems go for Phase One. A few things seem certain at this point. It\u2019s going to be divisive, messy and worrying in so many ways. Or in other words, it\u2019s going to be quite a lot like football.</p>",
  "<p>Michael O\u2019Leary has always been willing to conduct more than one fight at a time, but the Ryanair chief executive, who seems in danger of exploding with fury every time he speaks at the moment, may be well-advised to calm down and deploy smarter tactics.</p> <p>For starters, his outrage over \u201cstate-aid dopers\u201d, as he calls Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and others, is unlikely to achieve much. Alitalia was being bailed out quietly by the Italian government even before Covid-19 arrived, so the chances of persuading the EU to jump on multiple instances of \u201cillegal\u201d state-aid are roughly zero.</p> <p>Ryanair\u2019s own \u00a3600m loan via the Bank of England\u2019s coronavirus lending facility falls into a different bracket, O\u2019Leary argued, because the scheme is not sector-specific and is generally available to credit-worthy borrowers. That\u2019s true, but don\u2019t expect the distinction to cut much ice with EU regulators. However unfair it is, flag-carrying airlines have always been treated differently.</p> <p>O\u2019Leary\u2019s other rant about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/18/ryanair-chief-michael-oleary-uk-mismanaging-coronavirus-crisis\">\u201cidiotic\u201d nature of the UK government\u2019s 14-day quarantine plan</a> will enjoy some popular support among would-be holidaymakers, but the audience Ryanair would surely prefer to influence is government itself. Ministers, after all, will make the rules, not Ryanair.</p> <p>O\u2019Leary may help himself by sounding more constructive. Here\u2019s an idea: since \u201cnot sure\u201d and \u201chope for the best\u201d Covid cases could be most dangerous in spreading the virus in airports and on planes, Ryanair could offer a refund to any passenger, and member of their family, who feels even mildly ill in the days before a flight.</p> <p>No-quibble refunds are not Ryanair\u2019s normal style, but an effort in that direction would show more seriousness than the current exercise in throwing insults.</p> <h2>Debt nightmare? Boot it Intu the long grass</h2> <p>The beleaguered board of Intu, the over-borrowed owner of shopping centres, has thought long and hard (again) about how to resolve a \u00a34.5bn debt nightmare and here\u2019s its latest idea: boot the problem Intu the long grass.</p> <p>The \u201cupdate on lender discussions\u201d was really a proposal not to hold meaningful discussions for a while. The owner of the Trafford Centre near Manchester, the Metrocentre in Gateshead, Lakeside in Essex, and others is seeking a standstill arrangement that would allow it to operate on a \u201cpay if you can\u201d basis with lenders until the end of 2021.</p> <p>In other words, covenant tests on borrowings, which the company is at severe risk of failing in June, would be waived and everybody would pledge to revisit the mess another day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is no guarantee all lenders will play ball, of course. Intu is a complex financial construction and has many flavours of lenders \u2013 everything from high street banks to hedge funds. But the board will probably get most of what it wants since it is impossible to round up buyers for large malls, as Hammerson proved when a sale of seven centres collapsed this month. Most lenders don\u2019t want to take control of acres of retail space.</p> <p>Prepare, then, for another round of \u201cextend and pretend\u201d. It may make short-term sense at Intu, but a delayed restructuring adds another layer of uncertainty to valuations across the retail property sector. Nobody knows what anything is worth \u2013 and the answers are likely to take ages to arrive.</p> <h2>HIV vaccine points to improvements at GSK</h2> <p>An encouraging Covid vaccine trial by the US group Moderna pushed stock markets everywhere higher on Monday, but there was a medical breakthrough on a different front closer to home. GlaxoSmithKline said its trial to develop a two-monthly injection to prevent HIV infection has shown excellent results.</p> <p>This could be very big news for GSK, which is strong in HIV treatment but has been eclipsed in prevention by the US group Gilead, whose Truvada daily pill generates sales of about $2.5bn a year. GSK said a trial of its cabotegravir medicine had been stopped three years early because the data were so good \u2013 69% more effectiveness than Truvada.</p> <p>The result seems to have been way beyond GSK\u2019s expectations and could mean approval for cabotegravir in the US and Europe later this year. It is just one treatment and nothing can ever be taken for granted in drug development \u2013 but it\u2019s another piece of evidence that the long-promised improvement in productivity in GSK\u2019s labs may finally be happening.</p>",
  "<p>The famous Canova cafe, in Rome\u2019s Piazza del Popolo, was once Federico Fellini\u2019s preferred spot for a morning coffee. On Monday the Canova was in the spotlight again as it reopened its doors, in glorious sunshine, after two and a half months of lockdown. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful, exciting day,\u201d said Valentino Casanova, one of the cafe\u2019s barmen, whose words <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/global-report-italy-reopens-cafes-as-spain-prepares-for-return-of-tourists\" title=\"\">were reported</a> around the world.</p> <p>The reopening this week of Italy\u2019s restaurants and bars \u2013 albeit with tight restrictions in place \u2013 is undoubtedly an uplifting moment. Italy alerted the rest of Europe to the gravity of the Covid-19 pandemic; the return of its <em>osterie</em> and <em>trattorie</em> feels like a triumph of civilised pleasures over the annihilating bleakness of the virus. But no one in Italy is hailing a restoration of <em>la </em><em>dolce </em><em>vita</em>, as shutters are raised and tables are laid out in piazzas once more. In places such as Canova, seating capacity will have to be reduced by at least 40% for the foreseeable future. Running at around half capacity, with extra safety measures to pay for, many are likely to go the wall.</p> <p>The bigger economic picture is equally challenging. At the weekend, Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-18/the-man-few-thought-would-last-steers-italy-in-worst-of-times?sref=ihi5JR1z\" title=\"\">told fellow citizens</a> that the country was taking a \u201ccalculated risk\u201d by loosening the lockdown, but that it could not afford to wait around for a vaccine. After 20 years of stagnation, racked by huge public debt and heading for inevitable recession, Italy\u2019s economy now faces the fight of its life.</p> <p>The European commission forecasts a downturn of more than 9% this year. That would send the country\u2019s public debt soaring to over 155% of GDP \u2013 easily the highest ratio, after Greece, in the eurozone. Yet with business on its knees, the government has been obliged to up the ante on spending. Mr Conte\u2019s government <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-italy-stimulus/italy-finally-approves-economic-stimulus-package-in-virus-fight-idUSKBN22P2YE\" title=\"\">signed off</a> last week on a stimulus package worth $59.6bn. This injection of cash, combined with a steep fall in tax revenue, is likely to drive the annual budget deficit up to more than 10% of GDP.</p> <p>Governments across Europe are, of course, facing similar problems, after sending economies into hibernation. But Italy\u2019s debt levels make it uniquely vulnerable. There are ominous signs that the markets are beginning to turn the screw. One ratings agency recently reduced Italy\u2019s credit status to one notch above junk, and government bond yields are steadily <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-18/italy-s-huge-debt-load-is-at-risk-of-becoming-unmanageable?sref=ihi5JR1z\" title=\"\">creeping upwards</a>.</p> <p>It is in this menacing context that the European Union may soon have a crucial judgment to make. Along with the leaders of eight other countries, including France, Spain and Portugal, Mr Conte <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/italys-conte-threatens-to-block-next-eu-summit-over-eurobonds/\" title=\"\">has called for</a> a new common EU debt instrument to raise funds to assist recovery. Germany and the Netherlands have resisted this idea, pointing to existing options such as the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19870747\" title=\"\">European stability mechanism</a>, which allows for countries in difficulty to receive guaranteed loans.</p> <p>At root, this is a debate about how much Europe\u2019s stronger economies should share risk with weaker members of the eurozone, in the context of an unforeseen public health emergency. How it plays out could have significant political consequences. Recent polls have indicated that Italian Euroscepticism is on the rise: the country felt let down by a <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-aims-better-control-coronavirus-responses/\" title=\"\">lack of solidarity</a> in the early weeks of the crisis, as EU capitals failed to respond to urgent requests to send personal protective equipment, such as face masks. Waiting in the wings, Matteo Salvini, the leader of the rightwing League party, would hope to profit from any economic meltdown. As Italy unlocks, it is in the EU\u2019s interests to ensure that does not happen.</p>",

Asked when the government would be able to say if this would be the date, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You can see from the discussions that have taken place ... that we are working to seek to resolve this as soon as we can.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When it was put to him that in practice this meant a decision this week, because next week is half term, the spokesman did not challenge this assumption. He said that the safety of pupils came first, but that the government was also aware of the damage being done to children from their not being in education.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the government would publish its scientific advice about the safety of children being in school \u201cas soon as possible\u201d.</strong> On Friday the government published<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/885631/Overview_of_scientific_advice_and_information_on_coronavirus_COVID19.pdf\"> an overview on this topic (pdf)</a>, he said. But the teaching unions want to see the full scientific advice. Asked when they would get it, the spokesman said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Sage [Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] papers are being published in batches, and the DfE papers will be published as soon as possible.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The government does not necessarily need to have its new contact tracing system operational nationwide for it to move to the \u201cstep two\u201d stage of the lockdown relaxation measures set out in its plan, the spokesman suggested.</strong> He said various factors would be taken into account before the government moved to step two, such as the reproduction number. But he said the government had not made having the contact tracing system up and running an essential condition.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The quarantine rules being imposed on new arrivals to the UK will be reviewed every three weeks, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said. </strong>He confirmed that the government is planning to issue more details of how the scheme will work \u201cin due course\u201d. But when the quarantine rules are introduced, they will be \u201csubject to rolling review every three weeks\u201d, the spokesman said, to ensure that they are in line with the latest scientific advice. That suggests that they will be reviewed in parallel with the existing lockdown regulations, which also have to be reviewed every three weeks. Those rules are next being reviewed on 28 May. The spokesman would not say whether this meant the quarantine rules could come into force on that date.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman insisted that there had never been an exemption for France.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb84a3c8f08c0a2409bb2ea#block-5eb84a3c8f08c0a2409bb2ea\">A joint statement from the British and French governments</a> on the night of the PM\u2019s TV broadcast clearly implied that an exemption for France was being planned. But the spokesman rejected this. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There was never an exemption for France.

Asked to justify the charge, the spokesman said that the government committed to increasing it in its election manifesto and that it had raised \u00a3900m directly for the NHS by the end of the 2018-19 financial year.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that latest data showed that 38% of care homes in England have had a coronavirus outbreak. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that the decision to add loss of smell to the official list of coronavirus symptoms (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/18/uk-coronavirus-live-lockdown-trains-rail-work-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec261f98f08a1782fa7cbae#block-5ec261f98f08a1782fa7cbae\">11.29am)</a> was expected to increase the number of cases by 2%.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that the NHS Nightingale hospital at the Birmingham NEC was now on standby. </strong>Like the one at the ExCel centre in London, it has effectively been mothballed. The spokesman said that the Manchester one has patients. But another three of the seven in England, in Harrogate, Bristol and Sunderland, are open but without patients, he said. He said an eighth was being built in Exeter and would be operational at the end of the month.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman rejected suggestions that Boris Johnson was responsible for people not realising that Wales now has tighter lockdown rules than England. </strong>At the weekend <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/wales/2020-05-17/police-turn-away-people-travelling-to-pembrokeshire-from-england-over-weekend/\">English people travelling to Wales to walk in the countryside were turned away</a>, even though this is allowed in England. When Johnson announced the rules were being relaxed in his TV address, he was criticised for not being more explicit about how this only applied to England. But, when asked if he was responsible for English people being fined by Welsh police, the spokesman did not accept that. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We were very clear from the outset that people would need to respect the rules in Wales.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the prime minister was feeling \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d.</strong> Asked why the PM was not taking more press conferences himself (like Nicola Sturgeon, who almost always leads the Scottish government\u2019s one), the spokesman said: \u201cNot for a specific reason. The PM did the press conference last week and I\u2019m sure you will see him again shortly.\u201d </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, will take this afternoon\u2019s press conference, the spokesman said.</strong> Raab will appear with Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman indicated that the PM was happy about Sir Mark Sedwill being cabinet secretary and national security adviser.</strong> Some MPs reportedly want him to separate the two roles. In the Spectator last week <strong>James Forsyth</strong> wrote:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One hawk in government says that this issue has been compounded by cabinet secretary Sir Mark Sedwill staying on as national security adviser.

  "<p>Police in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a> are investigating the suspected involvement of dissident republicans in the murder of a man in west Belfast on Sunday night.</p> <p>Kieran Wylie, 57, died after being a shot at a house in the Lenadoon Avenue area of the city shortly before 10pm.</p> <p>DCI Darren McCartney told a media briefing on Monday that two of Wylie\u2019s youngest children were in the house at the time of the attack, which involved two gunmen. \u201cIt was a brutal killing and I believe Kieran was shot a number of times at very close range,\u201d McCartney said.</p> <p>McCartney said he was keeping an open mind about the motive but that dissident republican involvement was a major line of inquiry. \u201cThose involved in this appalling murder have absolutely nothing to offer Northern Ireland. Nothing justifies killing another person and the recovery of the gun that was used in last night\u2019s murder is a key line of inquiry.\u201d</p> <p>McCartney appealed for witnesses and and anyone with CCTV, mobile phone and dashcam footage from the Lenadoon area on Sunday night.</p> <p>Arlene Foster, the first minister, expressed revulsion. \u201cAt a time when we are trying to protect ourselves from the invisible threat of Covid-19 and our emergency services are working hard to deal with people\u2019s concerns, it is particularly reprehensible that some people can callously take a person\u2019s life.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Maskey, the Sinn F\u00e9in MP for Belfast West, condemned the murder and urged anyone with information to help police.</p> <p>Brian Heading, an SDLP councillor for the constituency, said the community was shocked. \u201cThose responsible are thugs who need to get their foot off the neck of the community in west Belfast.

  "<p>Face visors and shields could protect workers who have close contact with others against infection from Covid-19, but may not prevent the wearer spreading the virus, experts have said.</p> \n<p>Linda Bauld, a professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, said research was needed into the alternative forms of face protection before they could be recommended for general use.</p> \n<p>Visors or shields are worn by medics in addition to masks for risky procedures in hospitals, and UK stores including Co-op, Marks and Spencer and Waitrose have offered them to their staff. <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2765525\">A viewpoint</a> published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) last month suggested they \u201cmay provide a better option\u201d than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/public-advised-wear-face-masks-coronavirus-lockdown-easing-plan-for-england\">homemade cloth coverings as advocated in the UK</a> and several US states.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"77142d5a-0bf3-4a80-b538-c47a11b57f6a\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.</p>\n    <p>The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.</p>\n    <p>The WHO says masks should be made of three layers \u2013 with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.</p>\n    <p>The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>However, Bauld said she was sceptical. \u201cThe reason for having a visor which would cover the upper half of your face would be if you\u2019re regularly coming into contact with the public at closer range, and you might be exposed to somebody who is emitting those small droplets that we\u2019re all aware are very efficient at carrying the virus,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo I could see how in some retail settings and other environments they wish to do that, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any strong evidence that they\u2019re something the public should be wearing on a routine basis. The key thing is to cover the mouth and the nose.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe face coverings that people are being encouraged to use, for example, on public transport is not to protect the wearer, but to protect other people. Whereas the visor and harder material is clearly to protect the wearer from coming into contact with others at those droplets.\u201d</p> \n<p>While there have been several studies in relation to face masks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/should-everyone-be-wearing-face-masks\">albeit often with contrary conclusions</a>, there has not been the same research into face shields or visors. The JAMA commentary referenced <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24467190\">a study which found</a> that shields worn by a test subject within 1.8 metres of a cough reduced inhaled influenza virus by 92%, although this protective effect reduced after the cough had dispersed for 30 minutes.</p> \n<p>Bill Keevil, a professor of environmental healthcare at the University of Southampton, said the advantages of shields include that they protect the eyes, are easier to put on and wash, prevent people touching their face, and are also better for people with breathing difficulties, such as asthma, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/what-is-the-uk-advice-on-coronavirus-and-face-masks\">who have been told not to wear face coverings in the UK.</a></p> \n<p>\u201cYou can see how, in a way, it would give better protection for the wearer and it may \u2013 I just say may \u2013 help reduce transmission to others, because whatever you produce is not projecting a long way from your face,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Additionally, face shields and visors appear to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/25/the-schoolboy-brothers-making-coronavirus-visors-for-care-workers\">easier to make</a> than high-specification medical and surgical masks, as evidenced by a number of UK universities manufacturing them, including through the use of 3D printing.</p> \n<p>In the US, companies such as Amazon, Apple, Nike and General Motors have been making them, with Amazon saying that after the needs of healthcare workers are fulfilled, they will be available for purchase by all customers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/facemask-zip/giv-3902CN5iba3GbXmu/\" data-alt=\"how to make a face mask\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/facemask-zip/giv-3902CN5iba3GbXmu/\">how to make a face mask</a> \n</figure> \n<p>But Bauld stressed that members of the public could easily make improvised masks at home. \u201cThe basic face coverings we\u2019re encouraging people to use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/11/make-non-medical-coronavirus-face-mask-no-sewing-required\">can be made by anybody with any fabric</a> \u2026 which is why the public are being encouraged to use their own or make their own rather than order them off some website where they\u2019re needed for other settings,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>While acknowledging some positive elements of visors and shields, she said it was noticeable that, in countries ahead of the UK in infection control such as Hong Kong and Singapore, plastic visors are not seen. \u201cIt\u2019s not happening, right?\u201d she said. \u201cSo this is additional protective equipment for specific environments.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think we\u2019re somewhere away from recommending people [generally] wear plastic visors.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, Keevil thought it was possible visors could catch on. \u201cIt\u2019s a sort of societal change thing, isn\u2019t it? As people start to see these then some people might start thinking: \u2018Why am I messing around with a homemade cloth cover?\u2019,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure>",

Even before stay-at-home orders, women were wearing more trackpants, says Ganapathy. Muston explains: \u201cWe\u2019ve just come out the back over 10 years of athleisure, so already we have pretty high expectations around comfort.\u201d</p> <p>Raised on streetwear, sneakers and activewear, younger people were already resistant to uncomfortable clothing, but now Muston suggests that because shutdowns affected fashion on a \u201cmass level \u2026 the expectation is going to be raised further still\u201d, and it won\u2019t just be demand from younger consumers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ee8b09007f037d7e2b2ce8eae9e00da2f5d78be0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee8b09007f037d7e2b2ce8eae9e00da2f5d78be0/0_1133_4480_4965/902.jpg\" alt=\"A track suit with a cropped, matching top.

Sportsgirl have noticed a decline in the day-to-night dressing category, with Ganapathy explaining it\u2019s not presently relevant to their customers\u2019 lives.</p> <p>Muston says it\u2019s also important to understand the \u201ceconomic impact of coronavirus and what that does to consumer spending\u201d.</p> <p>In Australia, a survey conducted by the Australian Fashion Council found 75-80% of textile, clothing and footwear brands have had their businesses negatively impacted by coronavirus. Muston says with this \u201cabsolute deluge of overstock that has to clear, how do you create new stock that\u2019s going to stand out? How do you justify that to the consumer? How do you justify that to the planet?\u201d</p> <p>Her answer is \u201cversatility\u201d. \u201cProducts that \u2026 can be worn for multiple things are going to be an easier sell. Maybe it\u2019s a top you can work out in but you can also wear it out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cItems with longevity are most relevant,\u201d Kingham says of her customers. \u201cI think unprecedented times mean that people re-evaluate what is important.\u201d</p> <p>Muston notes that direct-to-consumer brands (such as the ones that have been flooding my Instagram feed) are excelling when it comes to differentiating themselves. \u201cThey often come with a problem-solving direction to them,\u201d she says. Because these brands do not have hundreds or thousands of products, they spend more time in research and development, investing in highly technical fabrics that breathe well, or never wrinkle; or shoes that \u201creally look at the arch of the foot and the position of the foot in the shoe\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb3b9e36137fbab621b9d9ed833f2ee67837266e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb3b9e36137fbab621b9d9ed833f2ee67837266e/0_0_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brands advertising how comfortable their clothing is on Instagram.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brands advertising how comfortable their clothing is on Instagram.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ganapathy and Kingham both believe that as the lockdown eases, their customers will want to get very dressed up again \u2013 with Kingham suggesting a hunger for \u201cspecial pieces for evenings out\u201d; and Ganapathy saying \u201cI think party dressing and Christmas is going to be really big this year.\u201d <br><br>Muston is a little more cautious. \u201cYou always get trends that are seemingly opposing that run in parallel,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get revenge spending, where people want to go out and treat themselves.

No efforts were made to ease in his new back-to-work message. Without consulting teachers, care home managers, mayors or leaders of the other nations, of course he <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/05/15/what-do-voters-make-new-lockdown-measures\">faced a backlash</a>. Stay alert? It hasn\u2019t exactly tripped off ministerial tongues since then.</p> <p>Boris Johnson swept to power on brilliant messaging, his spinners turning straw to electoral gold with \u201cTake back control\u201d and \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d, but all that\u2019s gone. He likes to be liked, yet approval ratings are tumbling: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/as-lockdown-consensus-unravels-boris-johnson-divides-nation-and-party\">Opinium polls</a> showed a +42 net approval rating for his handling of the virus in March; that has fallen to -3.

The government was sent into a flat spin by Starmer\u2019s trouncing of Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/13/pmqs-keir-starmer-presses-boris-johnson-over-care-home-deaths\">at prime minister\u2019s questions</a> over the appalling care home death rates.</p> <p>Fresh from a mega-victory and an age from the next election, why should the government panic? Because serial bungles, missteps, policy reversals and a vanishing connection with honesty risk damaging it beyond repair. No one knows all the right numbers yet, but trust shrinks when the government misuses them anyway. After Prof Tim Spector <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/weird-hell-professor-advent-calendar-covid-19-symptoms-paul-garner\">warned</a> that Britain\u2019s failure to list all 14 primary symptoms of the virus meant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/uk-coronavirus-tests-advised-for-people-who-lose-taste-or-smell\">between 50,000 and 70,000</a> people with Covid-19 were wrongly not being told to self-isolate, the government dashed to add \u201closs of sense of smell\u201d to its official list of symptoms. But expressing uncertainty is alien to ministers who were selected for an absolutist Brexit cast of mind.</p> <p>One report last week said that Johnson had warned the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers that they faced an agile opposition and a \u201c<a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/opinion/columnists/boris-johnson-analysis-1922-committee-tory-mps-coronavirus-crisis-2855468\">slippery opponent</a>\u201d. How revealing: there\u2019s nothing slippery about Starmer. But Johnson, captain of the chancers with his hand-picked crew of fly-by-nights, fibbers and fabricators, fears being shown up in unflattering contrast to Labour\u2019s frontbench of serious, earnest policy heavyweights. Politics is not a game for them, as it always has been for Johnson, but he\u2019s bereft when his old bluster can\u2019t beguile away deaths.</p> <p>Trust is ebbing away just when it\u2019s most needed to persuade anxious parents to send their children to school; it\u2019s frittered away on slippery pledges made to fill front pages for a day, but that are bound to be exposed soon after. We could walk down the well-trodden path: the government tacking wildly between herd immunity, tracking and tracing, then neither tracking nor testing, then locking down, then relaxing it but only to visit estate agents and garden centres, but not family. \u201cOnly following the science,\u201d ministers claim, or as one wit put it, the political science. But they get that political science badly askew.</p> <p>Take Matt Hancock\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/1261329991708684294\">dumbfounding claim</a> on Friday: \u201cRight from the start we\u2019ve tried to throw a protective ring around our care homes \u2026 we\u2019ve made sure care homes have the resources they need.\u201d What sentient voter doesn\u2019t know that to be a flat-out lie? No testing and no PPE, as care homes \u2013 some close to bankruptcy \u2013 were pressured to take untested, possibly infected, hospital patients, without enough doctors, staff, training or isolation space. Taking the public for fools destroys trust.</p> <p>No government could have been fully ready as the tsunami of horror swept in. No reasonable voter would have expected everything to have been waiting, just in case. True, a decade of cuts had left us exceptionally unprepared and the government preferred failed private companies to handle PPE, testing and tracing over better equipped local authorities. Yet it might have kept the public\u2019s trust with honesty and transparency, consulting everyone, publishing everything, admitting failures.</p> <p>But on it goes, the absurd targets missed and lied about, graphs of global comparisons hastily dropped. Hancock promises all staff and residents of care homes <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52684700\">will be tested</a> by early June \u2013 but will that be every week, with prompt results?</p> <p>\u201cFollowing the science\u201d often means ducking behind the scientists to let them take the flak: Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, and Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, are, after all, civil servants, not independent. The most hapless figure giving cover to ministers has been the deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries. Before lockdown she <a href=\"https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/uk-news/2020/03/11/uk-is-following-the-science-in-not-banning-mass-gatherings-health-chief/\">backed </a><a href=\"https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/uk-news/2020/03/11/uk-is-following-the-science-in-not-banning-mass-gatherings-health-chief/\">Johnson\u2019s plan</a> not to ban large gatherings, noting: \u201cWe\u2019ve looked at what sorts of interventions might help manage this as we go forward, push the peak of the epidemic forward, and in general, those sorts of events and big gatherings are not seen to be something which is going to have a big effect. So we don\u2019t want to disrupt people\u2019s lives.\u201d She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/uk-governments-coronavirus-response-beset-by-mixed-messages-and-u-turns\">defended</a> a fatal halt to tracking and tracing: \u201cThere comes a point in a pandemic where that is not an appropriate intervention.\u201d She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/19/uk-coronavirus-live-lifting-lockdown-restrictions-boris-johnson-death-tollcovid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9c70008f080ee110447c85\">called</a> the UK \u201can international exemplar in preparedness\u201d and told doctors to have a \u201cmore adult\u201d conversation about the lack of PPE.

As trust evaporates, why keep setting new targets the government will miss?</p> <p>Politicians in a panic grab for two life rafts: internal fall guys and public enemies. Internally cabinet secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/14/no-10-under-pressure-as-it-is-revealed-whitehall-chief-mark-sedwill-had-coronavirus\">Mark Sedwill</a> is taking a beating, while Hancock protests it\u2019s not fair he\u2019s being blamed. But finding public enemies is their favourite of the two. Despite a surge of public appreciation, the BBC is battered in the rightwing press. Teachers were set up for the enemy role, and are being bounced into opening schools at an arbitrary date. Gove extols the Danes for a smooth reopening: they did it with extensive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/17/denmark-can-teach-england-safe-reopening-of-schools-covid-19\">union consultation</a>. When the British Medical Association <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/bma-backs-teaching-unions-in-opposing-reopening-of-schools\">backed the teachers</a>, doctors came under attack: that certainly won\u2019t end well.</p> <p>Local authorities and the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations are as ever cast as enemies, too, with none of them consulted. But if \u201clevelling up\u201d is still Johnson\u2019s aim, councils ask why extra funds are flowing to richer places rather than poorer ones \u2013 for example, to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndyBurnhamGM/status/1261922521177260034/photo/1\">Wiltshire more than to Knowsley</a> on Merseyside. Sadiq Khan, meanwhile, is the Tories\u2019 favoured regular enemy, as they force him to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/14/london-faces-bus-and-train-cuts-without-urgent-funding\">raise</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/14/london-faces-bus-and-train-cuts-without-urgent-funding\"> public transport fares</a> in London.</p> <p>But political aggression towards public servants is as tin-eared a response to public sentiment as Priti Patel\u2019s refusal to lift the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/16/home-office-priti-patel-failure-to-scrap-nhs-migrant-surcharge-sparks-anger\">\u00a36</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/16/home-office-priti-patel-failure-to-scrap-nhs-migrant-surcharge-sparks-anger\">25-a-year NHS surcharge</a> on foreign health and care staff for the privilege of caring for us: doesn\u2019t she hear the clapping? Brexit negotiations heading for no deal are, ministers hope, a winner \u2013 but they may not succeed in hiding chaos at the ports and a fall in GDP amid the coronavirus economic crisis.</p> <p>Everything about this low-grade, callow crew makes them the most unfit government in living memory to cope with this great crisis. Rishi Sunak has done well to spray the meltdown with money, but his real test is still to come. For the rest, they learn nothing from their errors, eroding any trust in the notion that their prime motive might be serving the public\u2019s best interest, not saving their own skins. Boris Johnson looks an ever more inadequate figurehead for their floundering ship.</p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>The dilemma our schools face when going back is not only the safety of children and staff, but also the educational needs of children \u2013 and particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/15/prolonged-school-closures-risk-damaging-childrens-education-no-10-warns\" title=\"\">Prolonged school closures risk damaging children\u2019s education, No 10 warns</a>, 15 May; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/18/keeping-schools-closed-in-england-will-widen-educational-inequalities-study-ifs\" title=\"\">Keeping schools closed in England will widen inequalities \u2013 study</a>, 18 May).</p> <p>We don\u2019t have the evidence to show whether most schools are not good enough to close the gap between life chances of those children as they go through school. To allow this gap to develop unnecessarily, with the closure of schools, will be bordering on the politically criminal.</p> <p>The government not only needs to delegate the opening times to regions and multi-academy trusts, but must also think about how we make good the loss of all pupils during the lockdown. Should the government be thinking of special summer schools or additional top-ups throughout the coming year, with teachers paid to help children catch up? And can we now open a debate on the best way of protecting the current year 10, who will be taking GCSEs next year?</p> <p>So many pupils have lost so much ground during the lockdown. I hope we might debate the various ways of bringing justice to this group, either through allowing them to retake year 10, continuing with teacher assessment and no exams, or allowing them to start their final year in September but extend the exam season into July 2021.</p> <p>Pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds are likely to have been disproportionately further disadvantaged by the effects of lockdown, and the government needs to take immediate action if social justice is to prevail.<br><strong>Frank Field</strong><strong> </strong><em>Chair, </em><strong>Tom Quinn</strong><em> CEO</em><br><em>Frank Field Education Trust</em></p> <p>\u2022 I find one aspect of the IFS study baffling. It is without doubt that in general students from affluent homes receive more support with their studies and tend to have wider access to educational resources.</p> <p>Despite the hours put in by many students and parents at home, most people will agree that educational progress is greater at school. This is where I began to get confused: <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/BN288-Learning-during-the-lockdown-1.pdf\" title=\"\">the study</a> stated that 29% of less affluent families would send their children back to school when they reopen, whereas 55% of the most affluent parents would. It seems to me that the return to school will actually widen the attainment gap even further.</p> <p>The IFS premise that the reopening of schools will mitigate widening educational inequality only stands up if parents are forced to send their children to school \u2013 and that will not, and should not, happen, especially because dangerous underlying health conditions are sadly more prevalent in low-income groups.</p> <p>The issue of the gaps in educational progress and attainment is huge. It is also one for which schools cannot be held wholly responsible. It is true that the impact of home life on educational progress is even greater during the closure of schools, but it is an oversimplification to believe that opening schools is going to solve this problem.<br><strong>Rachael Quinn</strong><br><em>Buxton, Derbyshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I am a retired primary headteacher whose leadership ability was described by Ofsted as exceptional. I understand the needs of young children and how to create a rich and supportive learning experience for them. We can not expect four- to six-year-olds to practise physical distancing in the classroom. It is not only untenable, it is also damaging.</p> <p>Positive brain development in young children occurs when they can experience physical closeness and touch from their informing adults. Those are the neural connections that lead to further learning and indeed ability to learn. Being forcibly deprived of such proximity is likely to inhibit learning.

  "<p>The hierarchy of who cares most about lovely little children is confusing. Parents, I would have thought, are up there. Except the bad ones who are not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/homeschooling\">home schooling</a>, have not bought several laptops and are frantically trying to manage working at home, too.</p> <p>Then there are the awful ones who have to go out to work. Do they not care? Some, like me, have sacrificed their children for their political principles and sent their kids to state schools. I always love this phrase: it is wonderful that my children are still alive despite my attempt to serve them up as offerings to the fake household gods of fairness.</p> <p>Then there are the teachers who could be \u201cheroes\u201d, but are reverting to type as some kind of communists as they do not want schools to open just yet. Strangely, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/bma-backs-teaching-unions-in-opposing-reopening-of-schools\">they are supported by many doctor heroes</a>, who we presume do care.</p> <p>I heard an interview with a teacher who is also a parent and does not feel safe going back to work. I nearly malfunctioned, because, in the current discourse, this is a category error. Good teacher/bad parent or bad teacher/good parent?</p> <p>Even though I have tried to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/the-week-of-staying-alert-that-left-the-government-in-a-daze-coronavirus-boris-johnson\">stay alert</a>, I need some guidelines about who is the enemy of the people now. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, doing \u201ccaring\u201d is alarming enough. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52692017\">\u201cWe owe it to the children\u201d</a> to open schools, apparently. Then along comes Michael Gove, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/michael-gove-tells-councils-to-look-to-their-responsibilities-and-open-schools\">told local authorities</a> unsure about all this: \u201cIf you really care about children, you\u2019ll want them to be in schools. You will want them to be learning. You will want them to have new opportunities. So look to your responsibilities.\u201d</p> <p>I can only conclude that I don\u2019t really care about children, then, because, no, I don\u2019t want kids to be in primary school by 1 June. Nor do people in many other parts of the UK, especially where the virus is still to peak. This date is only a target in England, with Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish schools all expected to reopen after the summer holidays. Many teachers are worried not only for themselves, but also for what they might pass on to their families; many parents do not want their children used in an experiment on contagion.</p> <p>As far as we know, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/can-kids-catch-coronavirus-what-we-know-about-covid-19-and-children\">children </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/can-kids-catch-coronavirus-what-we-know-about-covid-19-and-children\">tend not to suffer badly with the virus</a>, while a study in Australia has suggested that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/children-unlikely-to-transmit-coronavirus-says-study-cited-in-pms-push-to-reopen-schools\">they are not significant vectors of infection</a>. But that is one study and \u201cthe science\u201d is an ever-expanding, moving body. We do not know enough.</p> <p>We do know, however, that the physical distancing required seems almost impossible with the youngest schoolchildren. Do we pick them up when they fall over? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/16/uk-coronavirus-live-stop-squabbling-over-school-closures-says-childrens-commissioner?page=with:block-5ec00dd38f0886ce4f5d4d5c#block-5ec00dd38f0886ce4f5d4d5c\">Why can they bring in lunch boxes but not pencil cases</a>? All these details have to be ironed out in very little time.</p> <p>Of course I see that year 6s and primary 7s need to say goodbye to their friends before they move on to secondary school. Of course I see that teachers can identify the most vulnerable kids in reception, year 1 and primary 1. But none of this is to do with education as such. Schools have to be reopened as giant creches to get adults back to work so the economy can go back to \u201cnormal\u201d.</p> <p>This is an illusion of control and normality from a government that has failed to care. Education has always been one way in which the elite has bypassed the state. The NHS cannot be bypassed, because private medicine provides few ICUs. Teachers are a far easier group to demonise. Gove was always at war with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2013/oct/02/michael-gove-referring-to-the-blob\">\u201cthe Blob\u201d</a>, egged on by his overextended Spads, such as Henry de Zoete. He got burnt out working for Gove and once <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/i-want-to-give-power-back-to-the-people-henry-de-zoete-on-life-after-michael-gove-and-his-big-deal-9253575.html\">tried a week teaching in a </a><a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/i-want-to-give-power-back-to-the-people-henry-de-zoete-on-life-after-michael-gove-and-his-big-deal-9253575.html\">primary school</a>: \u201cI realised that I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d Really? I thought any fool could teach.</p> <p>Reopening schools requires trust between local authorities, teachers and parents, but the government is packed full of those who have systematically undermined that trust and denigrated teaching. Telling people they are safe is not the same as making them feel safe.</p> <p>Now is the time to re-evaluate the ideology that has driven the system. The sudden ditching of exams may have repercussions, but the ease with which it was done could point us in a new direction. We want to get children back to school for their social wellbeing as well as for their consumption of information. Kids miss their friends.</p> <p>We need to ask what education is for. Lockdown has exacerbated every inequality. Richer families spend much more time on schoolwork than poorer ones and are more likely to send their kids back to school. We hold on to the idea that education is the route out of poverty, but school is only one factor in this.</p> <p>The emotional and social development of our children is paramount, not a rushed, unsafe return to constant invigilation. Teachers are not childminders, nor are they risk-averse. You try standing up in front of 30 15-year-olds.</p> <p>As a strategy, alienating \u201cthe Blob\u201d is as dumb as comparing the virus to a mugger to be rugby tackled. But what do I know? I have not had the benefit of the most physically distanced form of education \u2013 a top boarding school.

These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.</p>\n    <p>The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>M&amp;S said the sanitisers were initially priced at \u00a315 by mistake but the new \u00a311.50 cost is still significantly more than similar products sold elsewhere.

The Competition and Markets Authority received 21,000 complaints between 10 March and 19 April related to the pandemic, including grievances about price rises. The average price hike in reports was 130% but in the case of hand sanitisers it reached 367%.</p> \n<p>In recent weeks, shoppers have shared pictures on social media of the Turkish-made \u201cBelux instant hand sanitizer\u201d advertised on M&amp;S shelves, expressing disappointment at its high cost.</p> \n<p>Elaine Hanan, 55, a former CEO who now works as a consultant in the travel industry, only discovered the cost of the hand sanitiser she bought at an M&amp;S in Reigate, Surrey, after looking at her receipt when she arrived home.</p> \n<p>She questioned the supermarket\u2019s integrity over the pricing, sending a message to the firm\u2019s Twitter account last month saying: \u201cI have to say I am in shock.

With hand sanitiser, you can\u2019t really improve on quality so they\u2019re not adding any value to the product and the process.

Labour is understood to be looking at ways to strengthen consumer protection in any upcoming legislation. Powell said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that some businesses are taking advantage of the coronavirus pandemic to line their pockets. This is unacceptable and companies should behave responsibly.

  "<p>In AD 79, a society that thought it was modern, sophisticated and fully in control of its destiny was taught otherwise by nature. Sounds familiar? The eruption of Vesuvius that overwhelmed Pompeii, Herculaneum and many villas dotted around the Bay of Naples caught the Roman empire by surprise.

The people there were proud of their fertile and even divine mountain \u2013 until it erupted. Their bodies have been cast from cavities in the hardened ash, huddled against the volcano\u2019s torrent of choking heat. Why did they not see this coming? Well, why didn\u2019t we?</p> <p>The exhibition, which you can revisit in this special screening of a filmed private view, brought together astonishing evidence of the wealth and comforts of Pompeii the moment before disaster. Frescoes and sculptures from bedrooms, dining rooms and even gardens revealed the style and splendour of wealthy homes in Pompeii. Cookware, heaters, couches and lamps from pubs, shops and baths enhance the image of a world engagingly similar to our own.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"071109b51366dc48b7c8aee72db537354afdf7b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/071109b51366dc48b7c8aee72db537354afdf7b3/0_0_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A view of the ruins of Pompeii today.

The vast archaeological area is closed to visitors due to the pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cesare Abbate/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anyone lucky enough to have walked the streets of Pompeii and nearby Herculaneum today will have felt this. When you see the wonders of most ancient civilisations, from Egypt to the Aztecs, they are sublimely mysterious. Yet Pompeii by contrast is an everyday, knockabout town that seems familiar and recognisable. In so many ways, the Romans resembled us. They had mod cons like hot water and sewers. The difference is that instead of dishwashers they used slaves.</p> <p>Love their Latin literature or loathe their slave mode of production, the Romans were our doubles. And like us, they ignored a blindingly obvious natural menace. The Bay of Naples was one of the poshest resorts in the empire. Caligula is said to have had a house near Herculaneum and one of the finest villas preserved along the coast belonged to Nero\u2019s wife Poppaea. But the evidence of sinister geological activity is and was impossible to ignore. North of Naples is a vast underground supervolcano that vents itself in mysterious earth movements and noxious gases. The Romans noticed. They concluded that Lake Avernus, in a round crater in this fuming landscape, was the entrance to Hades.</p> <p>Vesuvius, to the south, struck the inhabitants of Pompeii as more heavenly than hellish. It had not erupted in human memory. Instead of seeming dangerous, it was beneficial. Its ashy soil was good for growing vines. A painting found in Pompeii depicts the mountain covered with grape-bearing trees while the wine god Bacchus stands beside it bringing his boozy blessings. The mountain still produces a famous wine, Lacryma Christi.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cc88a948287d59eec8404ac403b1fff05415dbb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cc88a948287d59eec8404ac403b1fff05415dbb/0_81_5941_3565/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Visitors view human skeletons at the archaeological site of Herculaneum, October 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Visitors view human skeletons at the archaeological site of Herculaneum, October 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andreas Solaro/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And here is where the parallels between then and now, Pompeii and us, become all the more peculiar. People still live and work all around Vesuvius. A visit to Herculaneum, the town by the sea that was smothered in hot mud by Vesuvius, is genuinely disturbing. Down in the excavated area, you come face to face with the dead. Crowds fled to the harbour to try to escape as the volcano\u2019s mushroom cloud hung over them. They are still here \u2013 tragic groups of skeletons and ghostly casts, cowering in death from a disaster they never had time to comprehend.</p> <p>Yet only a small part of ancient Herculaneum has ever been excavated. Most of it is beneath the modern town of Ercolano, whose blocks of flats house nearly 54,000 people. How are they safer than the ancients were from the looming volcano? Sure, up on the summit of Vesuvius there are modern instruments analysing what\u2019s below. But living on a volcano is as potentially dangerous today as it was 2,000 years ago.</p> <p>Is that what we have all been doing? Have we been caught napping just like the people of Pompeii? So take a virtual trip to this ancient tragedy courtesy of the British Museum. Pity the dead. Admire their lost lifestyle. But don\u2019t patronise these people from history, or think they were naive. Don\u2019t think this is just a story of another time or a strange place. It turns out to be our own story.

  "<p>Coronavirus testing is being extended in the UK to anyone over the age of five with symptoms, Matt Hancock has announced, as it emerged that the national rollout for the government\u2019s new test and track response appears set to be delayed to June.</p> \n<p>\u201cToday, I can announce to the house that everyone aged five and over with symptoms is now eligible for a test,\u201d the health secretary said in a statement to the Commons. \u201cAnyone with a new continuous cough, a high temperature or the loss or change of sense of taste or smell can book a test.\u201d</p> \n<p>Until now, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested\">eligibility had been limited</a> to a series of groups including key workers, those aged over 65, people who could not work from home, or people who lived with someone from one of these groups.</p> \n<p>Those with symptoms can use the gov.uk website to book home test kits or appointments at drive-through centres across the country.</p> \n<p>The expansion follows a period in which the UK\u2019s capacity for testing had exceeded the number of people seeking it. The most recent daily update showed that while there was capacity for almost 118,822 tests, 91,206 had been carried out.</p> \n<p>It comes amid confusion over the rollout for the NHS-designed track and test app, which along with a planned contingent of 18,000 contact-tracers is seen as key to plans to ease restrictions by alerting authorities to any localised outbreaks of Covid-19 and allowing them to be tackled.</p> \n<p>The app is being tested on the Isle of Wight. Last week, Hancock said the trial was going well and that the national rollout would happen \u201cin mid-May\u201d.</p> \n<p>Earlier on Monday, No 10 said only that it would happen \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d.

  "<p>With support for Angela Merkel\u2019s governing coalition surging during the coronavirus pandemic, Germany\u2019s Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland, the largest opposition party in the Bundestag, has opted for a vicious bout of public infighting that could split the party in two.</p> <p>The national board of the anti-immigration AfD narrowly voted last Friday to strip party membership from Andreas Kalbitz, a key networker on the rabidly nationalist fringes of the party\u2019s eastern German branches.</p> <p>Kalbitz, a 47-year-old former professional soldier who heads the AfD in Brandenburg, was ousted over allegedly declining to inform the party of his former membership of a banned neo-Nazi group, German Youths Loyal to the Fatherland, when applying to join the party in 2013. He was last year also revealed to have been named by the German embassy in Athens as one of 14 neo-Nazis who travelled to the Greek capital in 2007 for a far-right rally.</p> <p>The AfD has struggled to formulate a coherent stance on the coronavirus and failed to leverage a grassroots anti-lockdown movement, and the expulsion of Kalbitz has caused a split through the party\u2019s leadership and set eastern against western delegates.</p> <p>The move was driven by J\u00f6rg Meuthen, an AfD co-leader from the party\u2019s middle-class libertarian wing. The former economics professor represents the kind of conservatives who founded the party in protest against Greek bailout payments in 2013, and who previously defended the more extremist positions held by its politicians in the formerly socialist east by claiming their radicalism was exaggerated by the media.</p> <p>But since the German domestic intelligence agency\u2019s designation in March of an AfD faction known as the Wing (Fl\u00fcgel) as a far-right extremist group warranting state surveillance, their alliance has been under strain.</p> <p>\u201cWe are a traditional conservative party,\u201d Meuthen told ARD public television. \u201cWe need to demonstrate cohesion but we also need to clearly distance ourselves from extreme-right positions.\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday night, the Thuringian party leader, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, posted a video on Facebook in which he described the push to expel his ally Kalbitz as a \u201cpolitical act\u201d on behalf of Meuthen and a \u201cbetrayal\u201d. H\u00f6cke, who is seen as the figurehead of the AfD\u2019s nationalist <em><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/fascism/Intellectual-origins\">v\u00f6lkisch</a> </em>tendency, added: \u201cI won\u2019t allow the division and destruction of our party.\u201d</p> <p>Which side of the party will succeed in pushing out the other remains unclear. The AfD\u2019s other co-leader, Tino Chrupalla, and its two parliamentary leaders, Alice Weidel and Alexander Gauland, were reportedly against ousting Kalbitz, who has vowed to take legal action against his expulsion and on Monday announced he would stay on as a member of the AfD\u2019s delegation in the Brandenburg state parliament.</p> <p>To complicate proceedings further, the original 2013 membership application in which Kalbitz had allegedly failed to acknowledge his neo-Nazi past appears to have gone missing.</p> <p>The AfD has been the largest opposition force in Germany\u2019s parliament since the 2017 elections. But the party\u2019s fortunes have plummeted during the Covid-19 pandemic, with several recent polls putting its share of the vote below 10%.</p> <p>For Merkel the pandemic has prompted a political comeback. Her personal approval ratings have shot up on the back of a crisis management perceived as calm and competent, and her Christian Democratic Union party leads the polls on about 38% of the vote.</p> <p>The AfD, a populist outfit that in the past excelled at pinning the blame for complex geopolitical developments to single actors or ethnic groups, has wavered between accusing the Merkel government of shutting down the country\u2019s borders too late and accusing it of not lifting the lockdown earlier.</p> <p>On social media, Chrupalla has demanded a \u201creopening of the economy\u201d while simultaneously opposing proposed measures to control the spread of the coronavirus after lockdown restrictions are eased, such as contact tracing apps, immunity passports and mandatory vaccinations.</p> <p>The AfD has so far failed to exploit a burgeoning anti-lockdown protest movement that has brought together conspiracy theorists from the far right and the far left.</p> <p>In April, protest organisers claimed they had registered a new political party called Widerstand2020<em> </em>(\u201cResistance2020\u201d) with which they would seek to enter the Bundestag in 2021.</p>",
  "<p>It is a masterpiece that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jan/16/the-scream-edvard-munch-ultimate-image-political-age-british-museum\">seems to speak</a> to the later horrors of war in the 20th century and even the anguishes of the 21st. Now Edvard Munch\u2019s The Scream has another claim on modernity, after it emerged that an oversight by the artist means the 1910 version of the work needs to practise some physical distancing.</p> <p>An international consortium of scientists seeking to identify the main cause of deterioration of the paint has discovered Munch accidentally used an impure tube of cadmium yellow which can fade and flake even in relatively low humidity, including when breathed upon by crowds of art lovers.</p> <p>The result is that Munch\u2019s initially bright yellow brushstrokes have turned to an off-white colour in the painting\u2019s sunset and in the neck area of the central angst-ridden figure.</p> <p>The thickly applied opaque yellow paint in the lake above the figure is also flaking away from the canvas, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/aug/31/arttheft.arts\">stolen in 2004 and recovered two years later</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt turned out that rather than use pure cadmium sulphide as he should have done, apparently he also used a dirty version, a not very clean version that contained chlorides,\u201d said Prof Koen Janssens from the University of Antwerp. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was an intentional use \u2013 I think he just bought a not very high level of paint. This is 1910 and at that point the chemical industry producing the chemical pigments is there but it doesn\u2019t mean they have the quality control of today.\u201d</p> <p>Scientists from Belgium, Italy, the US and Brazil took part in the investigation. They initially tested whether reducing the painting\u2019s exposure to light may be key to protecting it from further deterioration.</p> <p>\u201cBut it turned out that the light is not really very harmful so it doesn\u2019t make sense to reduce light levels below the normal one,\u201d Janssens said. \u201cYou have to start working with the relative humidity in the museum, or isolate the public from the painting, or painting from the public, let\u2019s say, in a way that the public can appreciate it but they are not breathing on the surface of the painting.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cWhen people breathe they produce moisture and they exude chlorides so in general with paintings it is not too good to be close too much to the breath of all the passersby.\u201d</p> <p>The Munch Museum in Oslo is due to move to a new location by the city\u2019s opera house this year and the researchers\u2019 findings are to be incorporated in how the painting is displayed in future.</p> <p>Janssens said: \u201cThey can make all kinds of decisions about how they are going to display and protect against whatever environmental conditions. And that is what they said. They will make arrangements to lower the relative humidity. The standard is 50% humidity and they are going to go a bit lower than that.\u201d</p> <p>The discovery of the painting\u2019s fragility was made through luminescence imaging of the canvas to see where the paint was behaving differently, analysis of tiny fragments of paint in Munch\u2019s brushstrokes and in an original tube of cadmium yellow he used.</p> <p>Janssens said: \u201cWhen you illuminate the painting with UV light, what comes back is some kind of orange light in some locations, and there the paint is in not so good a condition. We tried to figure out why. This orange luminescence seemed to be associated to degradation.\u201d</p> <p>In early 20th-century paint production, cadmium sulphide was produced at times through a reaction between cadmium chloride and sodium sulphide.</p> <p>One theory is that chloride-containing compounds, such as cadmium chloride and cadmium hydroxychloride, may have been left behind in the paint as a result of an incomplete or badly executed reaction.</p> <p>It is hoped that changing the circumstances in which the 1910 version of The Scream is displayed will slow down the degradation, but there is nothing that can be done for water damage clearly visible in its bottom-left corner.</p> <p>Munch painted four versions of The Scream between 1893 and 1910. The 1910 painting was left with a dirty brown water mark when it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/aug/23/arts.education1\">was stolen</a> along with his Madonna masterpiece by two masked gunmen in a daytime raid on 22 August 2004.</p> <p>The raiders had tackled four unarmed guards, ordered visitors to lie down and ripped the works off the wall before making their escape in a black Audi. The paintings were recovered in 2006. Three men received prison sentences, two of whom were ordered to pay \u00a366m in damages.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 22 May 2020 to remove an incorrect reference to The Scream\u2019s \u201ccanvas\u201d; the artwork was painted on cardboard.</p>",
  "<p>In his 70-year career, working for directors like Godard, Bunuel, Varda, Clouzot, Hitchcock, Moretti, Chabrol and Sautet, Michel Piccoli had become something like a sacred or profane monster in French cinema: a character actor or complicated leading player who put strength into a picture like a flexed muscle. His robust, rugged looks were not quite like Gabin\u2019s, and certainly a world away from the smouldering sexiness of Belmondo or the ethereal beauty of Delon. He could play a lost soul, a man with secrets, a predator, a sensualist, a politician, an artist, a leader of men. In both his youth and age he was intensely masculine in an unadorned and ungroomed way, the male version of <em>jolie-laide</em>, perhaps. Piccoli was <em>beau-laid </em>or <em>beau-moche, </em>and destructively sexy with it.</p> <p>Perhaps nowadays only Vincent Cassel comes close to Piccoli\u2019s ability to project and dramatise a fierce detachment and self-reliance \u2013 and Piccoli\u2019s was the ideal face for conveying contempt, the concept at the heart of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/31/le-mepris-contempt-review-jean-luc-godard\">Le M\u00e9pris, the 1963 film by Jean-Luc Godard</a>. Without that role, he might have been condemned to play forever the kind of supporting roles \u2014 interesting, but not the sort to make one\u2019s name \u2014 of the sort that Jean-Pierre Melville had given him in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/11/le-doulos-review-jean-pierre-melville-jean-paul-belmondo\">Le Doulos, or The Stoolpigeon</a>, in 1962, the creepy club-owner that Belmondo\u2019s tough-guy tries to frame for a cop killing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98c54d009ef90df30925a34130c1061281a6b984\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98c54d009ef90df30925a34130c1061281a6b984/214_33_2166_1300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A very male fantasy\u2019 ...

Piccoli with Emmanuelle B\u00e9art in La Belle Noiseuse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RONALD GRANT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Le M\u00e9pris, he is Paul, a talented young dramatist who gets the chance for big money with a commission to write the screenplay for a new movie version of Homer\u2019s Odyssey (a drama crucially about adventure and infidelity), to be directed by Fritz Lang (playing himself) and produced by a brash American mogul played by Jack Palance. Paul is contemptuous of the whole crassly commercial business and his wife Camille (famously played by Brigitte Bardot) is contemptuous of him for appearing to use her charms to ingratiate himself with the producer. Piccoli\u2019s long, complex, opaque dialogue scenes with Bardot epitomise Godard\u2019s own fraught and angry relationship both with women and with cinema\u2019s seductive sexiness, as well as the hidden transactions and abasements that come with film-making. Piccoli\u2019s own face portrayed this with great sophistication: it was the face of disillusion, of not-so-secret misogyny, and yet a far-from-satisfied appetite for success. </p> <p>For Hitchcock in Topaz (1969) he played a Soviet spymaster \u2014 a role which was a gift for Piccoli\u2019s mastery of unattractive people in charge, though it wasn\u2019t the most interesting work from either Piccoli or Hitchcock. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/06/belle-de-jour-review-luis-bunuel-catherine-deneuve-erotic-shame\">Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s Belle de Jour (1967)</a>, Piccoli is the disagreeable cynic and married flirt Husson, a friend of the man married to Catherine Deneuve, and it is from this slippery and insinuating Husson and his indiscreetly chattering wife that Deneuve learns of the existence of <em>maisons</em> which men visit for risk-free sex, and in a way it is Husson who indirectly inspires her need to become a secret high-class daytime escort. Piccoli\u2019s coolly unconcerned figure is the embodiment of every pimp, every customer, every blandly corrupt police chief that presides over the whole business. Piccoli was to return as questionable and preposterous authority figures in Bu\u00f1uel movies like The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972) and The Phantom of Liberty (1974).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bc243266fe5dbf5cd0f7d04611121c6af3c1983\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bc243266fe5dbf5cd0f7d04611121c6af3c1983/0_534_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Piccoli with Brigitte Bardot in Le Mepris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Piccoli with Brigitte Bardot in Le Mepris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nana Productions/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another surreal extravaganza was the notorious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/02/la-grande-bouffe-review-a-fabulous-feast-of-desire-and-disgust\">La Grande Bouffe</a> (1973) in which Piccoli features as a jaded television producer who, with three other equally disillusioned and self-important men, gather in a restaurant with the express purpose of eating themselves to death. Piccoli\u2019s air of ennui and suppressed distaste, made him obvious casting for this scabrous satire, but in my view it doesn\u2019t have the interest and poetry of Bu\u00f1uel.</p> <p>For Claude Sautet, he made five very well-regarded movies, of which arguably the best was Vincent, Fran\u00e7ois, Paul et les Autres (1974), a somewhat American-style indie picture with something of Mazursky or Cassavetes: a four-way male-midlife drama which holds up better than La Grande Bouffe, with Piccoli playing opposite those equally lionised European movie-alphas Yves Montand, Gerard Depardieu and Serge Reggiani. They are four friends who are undergoing menopausal crises in parallel, with Piccoli as the disenchanted doctor alienated from both his marriage and his vocation. The sadness and loneliness of these kinds of role were beginning to be the keynote for Piccoli now.</p> <p>Perhaps Piccoli was an actor who was destined to grow into his looks, and he had a very characteristically cast as the ageing artist Frenhofer in Jacques Rivette\u2019s La Belle Noiseuse (1991), adapted from Balzac, with Piccoli as the artist whose creative fires are rekindled by the beautiful (and often naked) model and muse, played by Emmanuel B\u00e9art: a very male fantasy.</p> <p>For Agnes Varda, in her One Hundred And One Nights (1995) he is cinema itself \u2013Simon Cinema \u2013 who hires a young woman (Julie Gayet) to regale him with stories to rekindle his knowledge and memory of film. It is a very flamboyant, exuberant, theatricalised performance and this marked the moment when Piccoli became someone to be liked and even loved. Perhaps more than any other actor of his generation, he continued to work with extraordinary dedication in any number of European movies and co-productions and became an icon in the process, sometimes almost islanded in his own mythic reputation. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84185a6eef28e14e2e7b2da5f7a54f57c94d2f9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84185a6eef28e14e2e7b2da5f7a54f57c94d2f9b/737_334_3107_1864/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Piccoli in I\u2019m Going Home.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Piccoli in I\u2019m Going Home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Canal +/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps the weirdest and most piquant example of this was his enigmatic appearance in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/may/17/culture.reviews\">Manoel de Oliveira\u2019s I\u2019m Going Home</a> in 2001, as an ageing actor devastated when his wife, daughter and son-in-law are killed and he is personally and professionally adrift, bizarrely miscast as Buck Mulligan in a new version of Joyce\u2019s Ulysses. Piccoli carries off the strange wrongness of these scenes with placid, almost saintly dignity, and for all its pure eccentricity I think this is my favourite Piccoli performance. He is starting to show the heartwrenching and even tragic figure of someone who is poised on the edge of departing the screen, and this is certainly the case with his very lovable and charming performance as the reluctant pontiff in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/01/we-have-a-pope-review\">Moretti\u2019s flawed satire We Have a Pope (2011)</a>.</p> <p>Michel Piccoli was the fiercest, strongest flavour in European movies and he was the actor whose career showed a gradual lightening: he played villains, then complicated and defeated men of the world, on the edge of despair and misanthropy, but with a kind of stubborn idealism \u2013 and then in old age he was the object of cinephile fan-worship: a legend of cinema.</p>",
  "<p>China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has said his country would support a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d of the Covid-19 pandemic after the outbreak has been brought under control.</p> <p>Xi, speaking by video conference at the opening of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/world-health-assembly-what-is-it-and-what-is-the-coronavirus-inquiry-china-taiwan-origins\">World Health Assembly</a>, stressed that such an investigation must be conducted in an \u201cobjective and impartial manner\u201d and said Beijing would donate $2bn to the United Nations to help the global response to the outbreak. \u201cAll along we have acted with openness, transparency and responsibility,\u201d Xi said.</p> <p>Diplomatic tensions were expected to dominate the WHA, the governing body of the World Health Organization, which began a two-day meeting on Monday. More than 120 countries have backed a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/australia-wins-international-support-for-independent-coronavirus-inquiry\"> draft resolution</a> co-sponsored by the European Union and Australia calling for an inquiry into the origins of Covid-19. The resolution does not specifically name China, but countries such as the US have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/donald-trump-coronavirus-chinese-lab-claim\">accused Beijing</a> of suppressing information about the virus.</p> <p>Beijing has criticised such calls as an attempt to shift blame or politicise a global health issue. Xi\u2019s comments echo Beijing\u2019s previous statements that the international community\u2019s focus should be on cooperation and stopping the virus. In a media briefing on Monday, China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian described an investigation into the origins of the virus as \u201cpremature\u201d.</p> <p>China <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/03/china-and-australia-how-a-war-of-words-over-coronavirus-turned-to-threats-of-a-trade-war\">reacted furiously</a> to Australia\u2019s earlier call for an independent investigation, retaliating by reinvigorating months-old trade disputes. The Australian government has claimed the resolution as a victory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/australia-wins-international-support-for-independent-coronavirus-inquiry\">despite suggestions from within its ranks </a>that it had been \u201cwatered down\u201d.</p> <p>In a statement to the WHA, the Australian health minister, Greg Hunt, said he was pleased there was support for an \u201cimpartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation of the global response\u201d.</p> <p>The Covid-19 pandemic, which first emerged in Wuhan last December, has placed China under more scrutiny as critics call for an investigation into how the virus was able to spread across the world. It has now infected more than 4.7 million people and killed 315,000.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/world-health-assembly-what-is-it-and-what-is-the-coronavirus-inquiry-china-taiwan-origins\">World Health Assembly: what is it, and what is the coronavirus inquiry proposal?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The resolution on Covid-19 will be put forward on Tuesday if it gains backing from two-thirds of the 194 members of the assembly.</p> <p>\u201cChina\u2019s reluctance to allow the international community to investigate and its enthusiasm in creating all sorts of conspiracy theories pointing to non-China origins of the virus only make the world more eager to know the answer,\u201d said Ho-Fung Hung, a professor in political economy at Johns Hopkins University in the US, with a focus on China.</p> <p>Allies of China such as Indonesia and Russia are among the countries demanding independent investigation, Hung noted. \u201cBeijing will find it difficult to resist without risking further damage of its international image,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In the run-up to the conference, calls for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/china-facing-pressure-over-covid-19-and-taiwan-at-world-health-assembly\">Taiwan to be allowed to join</a> the meeting, led by the US, also threatened to anger Beijing, which has blocked Taiwan from attending since 2016. Joseph Wu, Taiwan\u2019s foreign minister, said his country had not been invited to this week\u2019s meeting, adding that it had agreed to put the issue off until later this year.</p> <p>Wu said on Monday, just before the meeting began, that, after suggestions from allies and \u201clike-minded nations\u201d, Taiwan would not pursue its WHO bid for now.

Previous bids by Taiwan, which had non-voting observer status at the WHO for seven years until 2016, have not gained as much traction as this year\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cBeijing has failed to shape the narrative on Covid-19, pressed too hard diplomatically against countries critical of its response, and come off as prioritising its image and its own interests, including on Taiwan, over global health,\u201d said Jessica Drun, a non-resident fellow at Project 2049, a thinktank focusing on security in the Asia Pacific region.</p> <p>\u201cIn the past, Taiwan\u2019s bids have not gained as much traction as it is currently, and I think that\u2019s largely due to the example Taiwan is setting to the world on not only how to effectively combat the disease on the home front, but also in sharing best practices through informal channels with the international community,\u201d Drun said.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Lillian Yang</em></p>",

But Dan Goor and Michael Schur\u2019s series was different, not least because it was a sitcom that was only loosely about policing. Despite sporadic car chases, court cases and surveillance operations, fighting crime has never been the point of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, which, in its knockabout portrait of workplace camaraderie, could just as easily have been set in a hospital or an office.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2020/mar/25/the-guide-staying-in-sign-up-for-our-home-entertainment-tips\">The Guide: Staying In  \u2013 sign up for our home entertainment tips</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The early focus was on Andy Samberg\u2019s Jake Peralta, a wisecracking detective with an aversion to wearing ties, although it soon became a smart ensemble piece featuring the brilliantly deadpan Captain Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher); ambitious, uptight Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero); goofy gourmand Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio); hardnut Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz); and desk sergeant Terry (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/terry-crews\">Terry Crews</a>), who loves the job so much he called his children <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/jun/11/cagney-and-lacey-box-set\">Cagney and Lacey</a>. The queen of this close-knit yet dysfunctional precinct was the civilian administrator Gina (Chelsea Peretti), known for her smartphone addiction and withering vocal fry.</p> <p>Right from the start, the talk was fast, the script fresh and the sight gags played to perfection.

In their relationship\u2019s early stages, the writers took care not to allow it to mess with the business of funny, but all that changed when the couple got hitched in a gag-free instalment involving an obsessive ex-boyfriend, a trampled bridal veil and a bomb threat. Next we were forced to join them on honeymoon to a luxury Mexican resort where \u2013 what are the odds? \u2013 they ran into Captain Holt nursing a midlife crisis. Later, an entire episode was given over to the couple as they debated the wisdom of having kids. Since then, in what has fast become the Jake\u2019n\u2019Amy show, fertility issues have been followed by pregnancy. Worse still, Gina, the jewel in Brooklyn Nine-Nine\u2019s comic crown, has left the show.</p> <p>Two years ago, Fox dropped the series, to a chorus of devastated wailing from fans and celebs including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/mark-hamill\">Mark Hamill</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/lin-manuel-miranda\">Lin-Manuel Miranda</a> (who played Amy\u2019s brother David in the show) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/guillermodeltoro\">Guillermo del Toro</a>, prompting NBC to swoop in.

Cleaning products have been harder to get hold of, but being a smaller operation means it\u2019s easier to maintain safe distancing.<br><br>Founded in 2002, K\u00fcrten\u2019s butcher is a curious anomaly in an industry characterised by ever greater economies of scale. Around the world slaughterhouses are getting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/meat-plant-workers-us-coronavirus-war\">fewer and bigger</a>. \u201cWe are doing the exact opposite,\u201d K\u00fcrten reflects, a saw wedged in a swaying carcass at his side. \u201cAnd it\u2019s working really well.\u201d</p> <p>Over the course of a year he visits roughly 350 farms, usually slaughtering one to four cows, two or three pigs and as many as 38 sheep on each, and butchering them to the farmers\u2019 specifications \u2013 often, as is the case today, with their help.</p> <p>At the heart of his business lies the conviction that animals should be slaughtered on the farm. \u201cThis means they are calm,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can eat up until the last moment. Mostly they don\u2019t understand what is happening at all.\u201d</p> <p>This is why farmers such as Andrea Schmitz, who has been a client for a decade, chooses K\u00fcrten over the cheaper alternative of an industrial slaughterhouse. \u201cThe animals are born here in the barn with us and run around our fields \u2026 They aren\u2019t driving off in a truck,\u201d she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/13/eus-live-export-trade-puts-welfare-of-millions-of-animals-at-risk-report\">EU's live export trade puts welfare of millions of animals at risk \u2013 report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Francesca Porta of the advocacy organisation Eurogroup for Animals adds: \u201cIt solves the problem of the stress of loading into a truck, the long journey to a slaughterhouse, and the unloading where the animal doesn\u2019t know where it is and then has to wait [for slaughter].\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year the Guardian reported that as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/24/something-is-wrong-meps-say-eu-is-failing-to-regulate-live-animal-exports\">the live animal export trade</a> booms across Europe, animals are travelling ever-longer distances, while the European Commission is failing to fully implement its own transport welfare regulations. Longer journeys are linked to a trend across Europe for fewer and larger slaughterhouses, run by an increasingly small number of large commercial players.</p> <p>\u201cIn Germany we have a very strong concentration in the slaughtering industry,\u201d says Katrin Wenz, from Friends of the Earth Germany. A few smaller slaughterhouses can still be found in states such as Lower Saxony, she adds, but in places like Brandenburg companies have to transport animals over long distances. More than half the pigs in Germany, for example, are slaughtered by just <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/animals-and-animal-products/animal-products/pork_en\">three companies</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"25905d8e84f370efe544ccc7dd9f6e7fe5631365\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25905d8e84f370efe544ccc7dd9f6e7fe5631365/0_77_3000_1897/1000.jpg\" alt=\"K\u00fcrten's van with two dogs relaxing in front\" width=\"1000\" height=\"632\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smaller slaughter companies struggle to compete against the handful of big players in Germany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Harwart/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt became increasingly hard for smaller companies to compete,\u201d says Wenz, citing low profit margins and high EU requirements. \u201cMore and more gave up because the big industrial slaughterhouses could slaughter increasingly cheaply and efficiently.\u201d</p> <p>K\u00fcrten is not slaughtering any animals today, but when he does the farmer is usually present. His methods differ depending on the animal: a bolt gun for cattle, electric stunning for pigs and sheep. He remembers the butcher visiting his family farm when he was younger, and the village shops that slaughtered animals themselves rather than have meat delivered. Since starting his training at 16, he has witnessed the industry reconfigure: \u201cI worked [back then] in a small shop \u2013 but these aren\u2019t around any more.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a feeling in our bones and hearts that there is something wrong with the system</p> <footer> <cite>Matthias Wolfschmidt, Foodwatch</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He believes, like many others, that the key turning point was the <a href=\"https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/meat-inspection\">EU </a><a href=\"https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/meat-inspection\"> hygiene </a><a href=\"https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/meat-inspection\"> regulations</a> that came into force in 2006.

He\u2019s booked up months ahead.</p> <p>K\u00fcrten points to the <em>Natur Fleisch</em> (natural meat) stickers on the packages.

The narrative sets off jauntily, recollecting a slightly embarrassing encounter between the speaker and a fellow student. Ambala bursts into the room where the speaker, \u201chalf-naked\u201d, is busy with face mask and leg-waxing. The protocol demands a theatrical display of apology. Ambala seems to bow, \u201cher statuesque body folding in on itself in a greeting\u201d. Like her accompanying song, this is a bit of burlesque, performed with grace and humour. The narrator, too, is suitably magnanimous: she explains her reaction as one of surprise, because she thought she\u2019d locked the door.</p> <p>We\u2019re particularly aware in these opening stanzas of the dazzled admiration the speaker feels towards the vivacious African. Her breathless tone (we know it\u2019s \u201cher\u201d because of the reference to \u201clife in a student female dorm\u201d) could even denote a crush. The metaphor in the relative clause, \u201ccleaving me with her beauty\u2019s pulse\u201d, is difficult to unravel. It works best if the \u201cpulse\u201d of Ambala\u2019s beauty is imagined as a sound \u2013 the heavily amplified drumbeat from a live band, filling the listener\u2019s whole body with thrilling but disconcerting vibrations. It\u2019s only retrospectively that the reader will connect these initial minor intrusions, suggested by the unlocked door, the sensation of \u201ccleaving\u201d, the mask-wearing) with the horror of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/06/study-reveals-fgm-india-female-genital-mutilation\">female </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/06/study-reveals-fgm-india-female-genital-mutilation\">genital </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/06/study-reveals-fgm-india-female-genital-mutilation\">mutilation (FGM)</a>.</p> <p>In stanza seven, the two characters exchange roles, as if in a folktale or fable. The narrator has learned from the first encounter that social taboos may be trivial, and their breaking pleasurable rather than traumatic. Boldly, she enters Ambala\u2019s room after a brief knock at the door \u2013 and her confidence is extinguished.</p> <p>Ambala sits on the floor in front of a mirror, naked, legs splayed, \u201cpeering deep inside herself\u201d. At first, the narrator tries denial through humour \u2013 or perhaps it\u2019s not denial, but a genuine effort at an interpretation: \u201cis this a new tantric // yoga posture I was ignorant of?\u201d When she notices the stain on the rug and Ambala\u2019s agonised expression, she\u2019s led to a new misunderstanding: she thinks Ambala has period pains.</p> <p>\u201cNo, this is different. A most brutal and unkind cut, / nothing like a male circumcision.\u201d The way Ambala talks about it demonstrates how unassimilable the experience has been for her, and is perceived to be for others. Ambala mixes fact with literary language and euphemism. The speaker herself descends into a tangled of harsh echoes: \u201cexcision\u201d, \u201claceration\u201d, \u201chumiliation\u201d. The nouns, like the verb-list in the penultimate stanza, chafe against each other. While the speaker is helplessly \u201caghast\u201d, Ambala, now that her secret is known, abandons her previous sophistication: childlike, she pleads, \u201cHold my hand, be my best friend forever.\u201d</p> <p>The young Indian woman in Shanta Acharya\u2019s novel <a href=\"https://www.shantaacharya.com/assets/html/shantaAcharya_novel_books_aWorldElsewhere.html\">A World Elsewhere</a> searches for self-fulfilment, hindered by cultural restrictions that begin early and fail to prepare women for autonomy. The character in the novel and the speaker in the poem are different, of course, but the poet creates a persona for the poem who has special insight into Ambala\u2019s ordeal \u2013 \u201cthere but for the grace of God,\u201d she thinks. Constraint is suggested in another way, too, by the diction: the two characters struggle to find words adequate to the experience.</p> <p>Both undergo change after the second encounter. The speaker re-orientates herself, away from her idealised Ambala to find the wounded and fragile woman under the extrovert social masks. Ambala, exposed, resists defensiveness and, in an act of profound trust, pleads for a vow of friendship. Despite the melting dreaminess of their concluding embrace, there\u2019s a flicker of revolutionary hope in the phrase \u201ca world unmutilated\u201d.</p> <p>A lesbian-feminist poem would develop this further. But it\u2019s also satisfying to read Ambala as a poem of warm female solidarity. Its impact registers through dialogue (notably, Ambala\u2019s change of voice) and through certain images \u2013 especially the stain, cruelly visible on the patterned rug, and the women\u2019s motherly-daughterly embrace, a bodily integration silently defying both the patriarchal and matriarchal power structures around FGM. It\u2019s only at the end of the collection that a note tells us that the meaning of the name Ambala is \u201cscar\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Forces allied with Libya\u2019s UN-supported government have wrested control of a key military base on the outskirts of the country\u2019s capital from Khalifa Haftar, dealing a significant blow to the renegade general\u2019s military and its morale.</p> <p>Pro- and anti-Haftar media reported that his eastern-based forces had withdrawn from al-Watiya airbase 90 miles south of Tripoli. Footage posted on social media appeared to show Government of National Accord (GNA) forces driving down runways at the base unhindered.</p> <p>Haftar planned to take Tripoli in a lightning operation in April 2019, but his forces have been mired in fighting ever since. Many of their attacks have been launched from al-Watiya.</p> <p>His retreat, following other recent military reverses, will force those foreign capitals that back him to review the viability of his plan to overthrow the UN-recognised GNA, which is based in Tripoli.</p> <p>GNA forces have been mounting strikes against the airbase for weeks, including its supply lines, but over the weekend stepped up the assault by destroying its Russian-made Pantsir air defence system. The airbase had been in Haftar\u2019s hands since 2014.</p> <p>Turkey, in defiance of a UN arms embargo, signed a treaty with the GNA in November last year, and, in return for Libyan permission to access Mediterranean gas fields, has been supplying military support to the GNA. The bilateral treaty has been sharply criticised by Greece as being in breach of international law and in violation of Greek sovereignty.</p> <p>The growing Turkish support for the GNA, driven by Ankara\u2019s desire to secure its energy supplies and extend its access to Mediterranean gas fields, has included the supply of both drones and Syrian mercenary forces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-39029aX2isIR5vKl/\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-39029aX2isIR5vKl/\">map</a> </figure>  <p>Ankara argues the GNA remains by law the UN-recognised government and says its actions only redress the imbalance caused by the supply of arms and mercenaries to Haftar by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia. France also unofficially backs Haftar, regarding him as a bulwark against terrorism in the Sahel.</p> <p>The second air base in the west, Mitiga, is also run by the GNA and Haftar now has no air base in west Libya.</p> <p> Increasingly many of these assaults are killing civilians and destroying hospital facilities at a time when the country is trying to control a coronavirus outbreak. More than 1,000 have been killed in the year-long battle for Tripoli.</p> <p>The concern for France and the UAE is that it is possible al-Watiya airfield will become a strategic asset for Turkey, especially if it takes an interest in the country\u2019s southern oilfields. The capture will also free up GNA troops to put pressure on Haftar\u2019s forces south of Tripoli.</p> <p>Haftar remains in controls of the oil terminals in the east, and has blocked the export of Libyan oil, the lifeblood of the economy. He also appears to have seen off an attempt last month to weaken him politically by dividing him from the leaders of the house of representatives, the parliament based in the east.</p> <p>The European Union, concerned by migration from Libya to the EU\u2019s southern flank, has just launched a naval blockade of the Mediterranean, codenamed Operation Irini, in an effort to enforce a UN arms embargo. The operation\u2019s structure and composition has been criticised by the GNA and Turkey.</p> <p>The GNA accused the EU mission of bias since it contains ships from Greece and France, the two EU countries most opposed to Turkey\u2019s involvement in Libya.</p> <p>The GNA foreign ministry also claims that because the focus is on enforcing the arms embargo by sea, Haftar\u2019s supplies by air and land are excluded from EU attention.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/war-in-libya-how-did-it-start-what-happens-next\">War in Libya: how did it start, who is involved and what happens next?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Friday the Turkish minister of defence, Hulusi Akar, questioned the legality of Operation Irini, arguing it had been launched without consultation with Nato, the UN or the GNA itself.</p> <p>Akar said: \u201cThey only prevent maritime entry and exit. This is not an arms embargo, but rather an embargo on the activities of the legitimate government, which has not asked for that [launching Operation Irini].\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is no legal basis for this operation without an official request from the [Libyan] government. Therefore, this only supports Haftar.\u201d</p> <p>The EU had been in the diplomatic lead trying to negotiate a ceasefire and political agreement between Haftar\u2019s forces based in the east and the GNA forces in the west, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/14/libyan-warlord-haftar-leaves-moscow-without-signing-ceasefire-deal\">talks staged in Berlin in January</a> foundered, leading to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/02/libya-peace-efforts-chaos-un-envoy-ghassan-salam-quits\">the resignation of the UN special envoy for Libya</a> in March.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 May 2020.

  "<p>For the past 1,000 days, I\u2019ve been writing at least one poem a day. I started on 17 August 2017 as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2017/aug/17/barcelona-attack-van-driven-into-crowd-in-las-ramblas-district\">terrorist attack</a> was unfolding in Barcelona. I was alone in a pub (standard for poets) and found myself writing a few lines on my phone. I posted it on Instagram, where I explained that I was experimenting with writing fast poems. That experiment is now wildly out of control.</p> <p>It may not be the healthiest pursuit. It requires daily engagement with the details of terrorist attacks, natural disasters, school shootings, celebrity deaths, sporting events and the slow plotlines of Brexit, Trump and climate change \u2013 and now there\u2019s a pandemic to write about. Even so, there are days when it feels as if either the news or my mind has slowed to a standstill. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc5gsIXhAzw/?igshid=be35pzngwzqq\">It has helped that \u201cTuesday\u201d rhymes with \u201cquiet news day\u201d.</a></p> <p>I\u2019ve written limericks about armed coups, haiku about football transfers, anagram poems about hurricanes, and streams of consciousness where the likes of Dan Hannan and Matt Hancock sit alongside crow, squirrel and other visitors to my garden.</p> <p>I do have a life, a family and a job. But I\u2019ve discovered you can write a poem while on hold (\u201cOn hold to EE / I am a valued caller / awaiting a callee\u201d) as well as from a soft-play centre, a windswept tent at 6.30am, and even the lobby of Trump Tower. All you need is a phone. It\u2019s the tool most of us use to consume news, but it\u2019s also a creative blank canvas.</p> <p>Posting on Instagram and Twitter means you get instant feedback. It turns out poetry readers love death poems. When a treasured figure such as Rodney Bewes from <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0747126/\">The Likely Lads</a> dies, there\u2019s something different about reading about it minutes later, even if it\u2019s just a couple of lines \u2013 \u201cTrying to avoid the news / about Rodney Bewes\u201d.</p> <p>People seem to like angry poems, too. Wordsworth said poetry is emotion recollected in tranquility, but there\u2019s something to be said for emotion recollected while feeling emotional. I\u2019ve written rage-fuelled diatribes against Trump, Johnson and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BkDP6OYD-Ix/?igshid=1tur6gi880h7x\">Christopher Chope</a>, and a quietly outraged <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_AtP_gByAM/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\">meditation</a> on the 30th anniversary of Hillsborough.</p> <p>But the most popular poems have been more universal. On Christmas Eve 2017, I sat in another pub and wrote: \u201cWhether you\u2019re Remain or Leave / it still goes dark on Christmas Eve / and everyone thinks and drinks to the same: / to those who have left us / and those who remain\u201d. That seems like a long time ago.</p> <p>More recently, a poem in response to this <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/two-members-public-dead-london-bridge-terror-attack-a4300901.html\">Evening Standard</a> story about the London Bridge terrorist attacks was published in the same paper later that week.</p> <p>Two \u201cmembers of the public\u201d dead<br>and you privately wonder<br>if it\u2019s a member to whom<br>you might be connected,<br>and you are privately relieved<br>at another reprieve,<br>and you privately imagine<br>yourself as the hero<br>running towards the danger,<br>or yourself in a panic<br>elbowing past a stranger.<br>Either way, I say<br>here and now to you:<br>if ever it\u2019s me,<br>or if ever it\u2019s you,<br>or if somehow we<br>are the chosen two,<br>I\u2019m proud to have been<br>a member with you.</p> <p>Why have I written a poem daily for 1,000 days? Because in these deranging times, it\u2019s a way of making the world make sense. US attorney general Bill Barr recently smirked in an interview that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/attorney-general-william-barr-on-michael-flynn-obamacare-and-coronavirus-restrictions-transcript/\">history is written by the winner</a>\u201d. I thought back to one of my rage poems, written in response to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1014286054805987330\">a Trump tweet</a> in which he claimed authorship of his <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all/amp\">ghostwritten</a> book, The Art of the Deal. The last lines of that poem are a motto for the whole project: \u201cFor this, Mr President, we will destroy you / de-story you / haunt you like the ghosts we are / sentence you to death / and there is literally nothing / you can do to fight us / you think history is written by the victors? / it\u2019s written by the writers\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><p>Two volumes of Nick Asbury\u2019s Realtime Notes <a href=\"https://asburyandasbury.com/shop/realtime-notes-volumes-1-amp-2\">are available here</a>.</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>I first read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/may/25/fiction.features\">Morvern Callar</a> when I was about the same age as the eponymous heroine, living in Glasgow, depressed and increasingly isolated. A rare friend came to visit and gave me the copy of the 1995 novel I still own \u2013 a <a href=\"https://taleaway.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/books-set-in-scotland-morvern-callar.jpg\">red-toenailed foot</a> on a deep blue background, and a coy blurb on the back that gave me little warning of what I was letting myself in for (\u201cWhat she does next is even more appalling \u2026\u201d OK!)</p> <p>I read it feverishly on my breaks at the chain coffee shop where I worked. At the time I felt strongly that I was failing at most things, including the very basic acts of living. In my spare time I flailed towards something by sporadically writing. My stories were populated with neat, functional characters, characters you could root for. Their goodness was signposted from the get-go; they \u201cdeserved\u201d the happy endings that, increasingly, I didn\u2019t feel I did.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a surreality to elements like the sinister resort bar where you can pay for your beer in blood</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So I was struck then by the inscrutable Morvern, who blindsides us from the start. She narrates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/alan-warner\">Alan Warner</a>\u2019s novel, and yet we rest glacially on the surface, often literally \u2013 she\u2019s more likely to describe in detail the painting of her nails than her feelings. Her focus on her physical self has been criticised as that of a male writer trying to imagine the bodily preoccupations of a young woman, or taken as a comment on the blank-eyed capitalistic ennui of young people in the 90s \u2013 so dead inside! \u2013 but I now read it more as emphasising the boundaries between Morvern\u2019s mysterious internal world and her external. Her self-containment cannot be breached for long. Events from the mundane to the horrific are narrated with equal calm, brand names scattered here and there. The levelling effect is disconcerting.</p> <p>I grappled with just who Morvern <em>is </em>as a character then, and I grapple now. My interpretations depend on where I am with my life, which is part of the enjoyment. I am not the same person or reader I was at 22. She could be read as opportunistic grifter, tragic orphan, hedonistic sociopath. She\u2019s alternately reticent, or dignified, or vacuous. The world slides off her.</p> <p>The inaccessibility can be maddening but I respect it. Maybe there\u2019s a void of emptiness inside her; maybe not. Maybe she feels nothing, or simply doesn\u2019t have the capacity to articulate her trauma. It\u2019s not for us to know, and realising that, accepting that, changed everything for me. We, the readers, are just going along for the ride. What a concept \u2013 to abdicate control. Ambiguity holds power. Nothing is certain and everything is in flux.</p> <p>To read a book where you are always kept at such remove, a rubber-necker rather than a participant, can be frustrating. We\u2019re not always comfortable, as readers, with not being given the whole picture. We want satisfying conclusions and reasons. We\u2019re consumers! But sometimes things happen as they happen. Sometimes people make appalling decisions and stick to them. Sometimes people do not show remorse, or even feel it.</p> <p>The characters in my own writing are not easy to like. I\u2019ve seen them described as hysterical, exasperating, cold (I agree), and their motives questioned because they don\u2019t always act logically (I agree too). We are actually all of us so often so deeply illogical, driven and compelled by desires that can be absurd at best and dangerous at worst.</p> <p>In Morvern Callar, the protagonist makes an understandable choice, in a way: Morvern\u2019s writer boyfriend kills himself \u2013 so she later successfully publishes his book under her own name. It\u2019s just not a morally accepted choice. And yet it hurts nobody. It propels her into her own self-realisation. So is it so wrong? Actually, it\u2019s good. Maybe? The moral gymnastics here are queasy. They\u2019re also, darkly, quite good fun.</p> <p>Badly behaved heroines are more celebrated now, but they still generally have to be made palatable with charm, or an explanation. They still operate within recognised moral codes. They might get their comeuppance. Morvern, though, reminds me that doesn\u2019t need to be the case. She remains gloriously strange. She\u2019s laconic, strangely innocent, drifts along under her own logic with no discernible masterplan. At no point is she punished, or even at risk of being punished, for her actions. And the only place where she does let us in, in the end, is not through eventual regret, but through small moments of joy. In the feel of sun on skin. In landscapes both Scottish and Spanish, the anonymity of a rave. In the music she listens to constantly through her Walkman, soundtracking her every move, highlighting her dissociation even as it provides us with a way to get in closer. She doesn\u2019t question this joy. She doesn\u2019t have to do anything to earn it. It\u2019s just there for her, if she looks closely.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/14/the-best-books-childrens-poetry-audiobooks-2020\">The best books and audiobooks of 2020 so far</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a novel that taught me about control, about the space of what\u2019s underneath a story and what can be left unsaid. About our capacity to root for a character who is, seemingly, totally amoral. And it also taught me there was artistic, even aesthetic, value in my grey little life; things I could use and transform.</p> <p>In the novel, cheap Mediterranean hotels and supermarkets are given a gravity and poetry. The world itself starts to feel like a dream \u2013 there are no consequences, ugliness metamorphoseses into something more transcendent. There is a surreality to elements like the sinister resort bar where you can pay for your beer in blood, the glitter left in Morvern\u2019s knee from an accident, a nightmarish swimsuit-swapping competition. It\u2019s our world, but it\u2019s not, because when the moral code is upended, questioned, anything can happen.

For the editors\u2019 code to have any effect on journalists\u2019 conduct, it should be upheld by those at the very top of an organisation.\u201d</p> \n<p>In December, Sir David strengthened his family\u2019s grip on the businesses, appointing Aidan and Howard as \u201cpersons with significant control\u201d of Ellerman Holdings, the holding company for the Barclays\u2019 UK assets. Each was given \u201cmore than 25% but not more than 50% of the share ownership and voting rights\u201d.</p> \n<p>Sir Frederick and Sir David are no longer beneficiaries of the family trust, and Amanda has been left with a 25% share and no power to block David\u2019s side of the family in any big decisions.</p>",

I\u2019ve become more efficient. I can finish tasks that once took me an hour during the 15 minutes my toddlers eat their breakfast. I\u2019ve become more decisive, simply because I no longer have much uninterrupted time for hemming and hawing.</p> <p>My ability to focus in the face of distraction has grown exponentially. I can follow a 16-step recipe with a baby on my hip and another twirling under my feet, singing the theme song to Frozen on a constant, off-key loop. I won\u2019t pretend that I\u2019m always graceful under the never-ending pressure of parenting, but there\u2019s no doubt I am mentally, physically and emotionally tougher as a result of it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>While many of the tasks of parenthood bear little resemblance to an office job, the mental labor involved is not so different</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Everyone seems to agree that parenting is as difficult as it is important. Still, the fact that we don\u2019t mention parenting when someone asks about our work experience seems to indicate that we think of childrearing as unlike other forms of work, as if the Venn diagram of the skills they require is just two circles with no overlap. But this dichotomy dissolves under any serious scrutiny. Paid childcare positions, such as a nanny or nursery worker, count as work experience. Unpaid internships and volunteer positions count as work experience. I can see no reason that the unpaid childcare role of a parent shouldn\u2019t count for something, too.</p> <p>This has never been more obvious than right now, as the coronavirus has forced parents to shoulder caregiving duties previously outsourced to daycares and schools in addition to their other jobs.</p> <p>While many of the tasks of parenthood bear little resemblance to an office job, the mental labor involved is not so different. I don\u2019t just steam broccoli for my children, I manage their diets. I don\u2019t just take their temperatures when they\u2019re sick, I monitor their health and development. Surely the research, observation, coordination, and thoughtful decision-making this involves have applications in other forms of work.</p> <p>Yet the skills honed in parenthood go unrecognized by the working world. Every moment that mothers are absent from the labor force, our perceived value to potential employers deteriorates, as if our brains go to mush along with the carrots we\u2019re feeding our kids.</p> <p>It\u2019s no secret that childbearing deals a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/05/upshot/even-in-family-friendly-scandinavia-mothers-are-paid-less.html\">serious blow</a> to women\u2019s earnings, resulting in a so-called motherhood wage penalty. A recent <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X20300144\">analysis</a> of research on this phenomenon found that working mothers earn an average of 3.6% less per child than comparable childless women, much of which is explained by loss of work experience during career breaks. It\u2019s hard not to wonder why parenting does not \u2013 at least to some degree \u2013 count as work experience.</p> <p>I\u2019m not the first to point out this double standard. In her book, The Price of Motherhood, former New York Times reporter Ann Crittenden laments that \u201ceconomic theory has nothing to say about the acquisition of skills by those who work with children; presumably there are none\u201d. This, she argues, puts mothers at an undeserved disadvantage when they return to the labor force.</p> <p>\u201cChanging the status of mothers, by gaining real recognition for their work,\u201d Crittenden wrote, \u201cis the great unfinished business of the women\u2019s movement\u201d. Nearly two decades later, it remains unfinished.</p> <p>Obviously, I didn\u2019t become a mother for the paycheck or to advance my career. Parenting is, as they say, a labor of love \u2013 but it\u2019s still labor, and in many ways not so different than other forms of work. It only hurts unpaid caregivers like me to pretend otherwise. So while parenting may not qualify me to develop software for Google or sell bonds on Wall Street, it ought to count for something.</p>",
  "<p>Just three months ago, centrist Democrats were panicking. After strong performances in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders appeared poised to sail away with the nomination for president. Some in the party feared the self-identified democratic socialist would wreak havoc down the ballot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/23/susan-collins-maine-democrats-kavanaugh-controversy\">Could Susan Collins' vote for Kavanaugh help the Democrats flip the Senate in 2020?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf Bernie Sanders was at the top of the ticket, we would be in jeopardy of losing the House,\u201d the Louisiana congressman Cedric Richmond, a co-chair of Joe Biden\u2019s campaign, said on a February conference call. \u201cWe would not get the Senate back.\u201d</p> <p>The world looks different now \u2013 and so does the Senate map. With Biden the presumptive nominee and Donald Trump facing widespread criticism for his handling of the coronavirus crisis, election experts say the upper chamber is up for grabs.</p> <p>Republicans hold a 53-47 advantage, meaning Democrats will have to flip at least three seats to take the majority, assuming they win the White House. If they can\u2019t win the presidency, they will need four seats to control the Senate. Doug Jones, a Democrat, is considered an underdog for re-election in Alabama. If he loses, Democrats will need another Republican seat.</p> <p>But Jones\u2019s race is one of only a few chances for Republicans to flip a seat themselves. Other Democrats up for re-election, such as Gary Peters in Michigan, have started to pull ahead. The map is unfavorable for Republicans, with incumbents facing difficult re-election races in presidential battleground states like Arizona, Colorado and North Carolina.</p> <p>\u201cOver the course of the last several months the playing field has gotten a little bit bigger, and I\u2019d say Democratic prospects in some of these individual races have also seemed to get a little bit better,\u201d said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of <a href=\"http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/\">Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball</a> at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.</p> <p>\u201cThe overall race for the Senate is more of a coin flip than maybe you would have described it at the start of the cycle.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats have managed to expand the map, in part thanks to Biden clearing the presidential primary field, which seems to have improved the party\u2019s prospects in states Trump carried in 2016, such as North Carolina and Georgia.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of Democrats were rightly worried that if you had a more progressive nominee, an avowed Democratic socialist on the ticket like Bernie Sanders, flipping a state like North Carolina \u2026 would have been much harder,\u201d said Jessica Taylor, Senate and governors editor for the <a href=\"https://cookpolitical.com/\">Cook Political Report</a>.</p> <p>Republicans are on defense in states they previously thought safe, most notably Montana. The state\u2019s Democratic governor, Steve Bullock, launched his Senate campaign in March. A <a href=\"http://helpslab.montana.edu/documents/western_states_2020_coronavirus_survey/PoliticsPolicy_Montana_Frequencies_01May2020_RELEASE.pdf\">recent poll</a> showed him leading the Republican incumbent, Steve Daines, by seven points, even though Trump carried Montana by 20 in 2016.</p> <p>\u201cI think the Democrats have done a better job of putting more races in play than the Republicans have,\u201d Kondik said, \u201calthough Republicans are just defending many more seats.\u201d</p> <p>Democratic candidates have seen better fundraising numbers, which party strategists say is a reflection of grassroots energy.

So they go to the hospital.\u201d</p> <p>His friend fought for a week. \u201cWhen you talk about two people from Minnesota that died from it, they\u2019re just statistics,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said. \u201cBut when they\u2019re close to you, then you realize how real this thing is.\u201d</p> <p>Like a lot of older Democrats in a town that was once home to the legendary \u2013 and heavily unionized \u2013 Bethlehem Steel, D\u2019Ambrosio voted for both parties over the years before coming out as an early and enthusiastic Trump supporter. That support has not changed.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, I think we\u2019re so lucky that at this time in our life, we were able to get a president like him, at the right time,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbc0176703e2dcc0cf69f443202b1fa504f988e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbc0176703e2dcc0cf69f443202b1fa504f988e0/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protestor wears a Trump face mask while rallying against the coronavirus restrictions in Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester wears a Trump face mask while rallying against the coronavirus restrictions in Pennsylvania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He dismissed criticism that Trump had made the country complacent by advising that the virus would \u201cdisappear\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat he did was damage control,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said. \u201cPeople were starting to panic, buying everything, emptying the stores. He got it to calm down.\u201d</p> <p>Pennsylvania has recorded more than 4,000 Covid-19 deaths, mostly in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Last week Wolf announced an additional $16m in funding for food banks, where people have <a href=\"https://www.wtae.com/article/pennsylvanias-food-banks-getting-dollar16-million-in-funding/32196590\">queued up before dawn</a>, after the state shed about 2m jobs from mid-March onwards.</p> <p>Bruce Haines, a former steel executive who runs the Historic Hotel Bethlehem, a crown jewel of the local tourism industry, said business had plunged.</p> <p>\u201cIt was like you turned off a lightbulb,\u201d Haines said on the phone from Florida. \u201cThe cancellation calls the week of 9 March were incredible. And it hit us blindly, because we were coming off our best year ever in 2019.\u201d</p> <p>Haines praised Trump\u2019s move to reopen the economy. \u201cI think it\u2019s right on target, and it\u2019s necessary,\u201d Haines said. \u201cAnd anybody who\u2019s a businessman knows that Trump\u2019s the right guy there, to bring us out of this downturn. Because he\u2019s a businessman.\u201d</p> <h2>A downward trend</h2> <p>Peg Ferraro, a Republican official popular with Democrats who for years was the only woman on the county council, retired last year and also spoke on the phone from Florida.</p> <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s doing as well as could be expected under the circumstances, where you\u2019ve never been through it really before,\u201d she said of Trump. \u201cI think he was absolutely correct in leaving it up to the governors \u2013 they know their states better than making blanket statements for everybody.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s visit to Pennsylvania last Thursday represented a headache for Wolf, who is in an escalating war with Republican officials over reopening the state county by county. True to a national pattern, Republicans from more rural districts in the state are less likely to see the pandemic as dangerous than Democrats, Borick said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5202c018055aa247c65dfd6fb6d09086bd0d854a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5202c018055aa247c65dfd6fb6d09086bd0d854a/0_0_4931_3287/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump supporters hold signs highlighting their displeasure with Pennsylvania\u2019s governor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump supporters hold signs highlighting their displeasure with Pennsylvania\u2019s governor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Rourke/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump could still lose in the Lehigh Valley. Public approval of his handling of the coronavirus crisis has plunged nationally from about 50% in late March to just over 40% now, with about 55% disapproving, <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/public_approval_of_president_trumps_handling_of_the_coronavirus-7088.html\">according to polling averages</a>. While there is plenty of time before the election to reverse that slide, polling in Pennsylvania <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/pennsylvania/\"> shows a similar trend</a>.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s margin of victory in 2016 in Northampton county was narrow, spurred by record turnout. And his opponent in that race, Hillary Clinton, was disliked by voters in a way that Joe Biden, the presumed Democratic nominee, who grew up in Pennsylvania, does not appear to be.</p> <p>The unique logistics of the fall election could also go a long way in deciding the victor here, Borick said. Just last year, Pennsylvania for the first time approved absentee voting for everyone, potentially throwing the advantage in November to the party that shows better organization at standing up vote-by-mail and at getting people to the polls amid a potential second pandemic wave.</p> <p>And for all the president\u2019s support in the region, there is a resistance to Trump that is as galvanized as his base.</p> <p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t run a one-car funeral,\u201d said Frank Behum, a former unionized steelworker and vocal Trump critic.</p> <p>\u201cEven my Republican friends, they\u2019re telling me they\u2019re not voting for that clown again. But you don\u2019t know \u2013 remember in the 1980s, people said they\u2019re not voting for Reagan either.</p> <p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Some writers are like old friends \u2013 you can lose touch with their work and pick up right where you left off. I stopped reading Graham Swift after 2007\u2019s disappointing <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/08/fiction.grahamswift\">Tomorrow</a></em>, but returned to him in 2016, when <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/21/graham-swift-latest-novel-mothering-sunday-review\">Mothering Sunday</a></em>, a slight, sad, poised novel, was published to a host of glowing reviews. I was surprised to find Swift was no longer anything like the writer I remembered. Here was a late-period voice, elegiac and wistful, with prose far from the sophisticated experimentation of <em>Shuttlecock</em><em> </em>and <em>Waterland</em>, or the sure-footed mastery of the Booker-winning <em>Last Orders</em> and its underrated successor <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/mar/02/fiction.grahamswift\">The Light of Day</a></em>. <em>Here We Are </em>comes (for Swift) hot on the heels of its predecessor, and summons the same atmosphere: this is a novella suffused with quietness, regret and, eventually, consolation.</p> <p>Short books can be big in the mind, particularly when they contain whole lives within them. <em>Here We Are</em> is the story of a love triangle, although the Jules et Jim in this case are Ronnie \u201cthe Great Pablo\u201d Deane, a magician, and his friend, the actor Jack Robbins. Ronnie is initially engaged to his sidekick, former chorus-girl Evie White, but then, almost without the reader noticing it, she is drawn to Jack, and Ronnie fades into the background as Jack\u2019s career takes off.</p> <p>The novella pivots on a moment halfway through what has until this point been a fairly conventional narrative concerning the early years of Ronnie, Evie and Jack as they make their way in the postwar music hall scene, playing to crowds on Brighton pier. Swift inserts a paragraph break and then we read: \u201cNow Evie White is seventy-five.\u201d It\u2019s a brilliant opening up of perspective, redolent of similar revelatory key changes in Philip Roth\u2019s <em>Nemesis</em><em> </em>or Alice Munro\u2019s <em>Dear Life</em>. As Evie looks back on the more than half a century that has passed since her Brighton days, we are forced to re-evaluate the picture we have of her, Jack and, particularly, Ronnie.</p> <p>This is a beautiful, gentle, intricate novella, the kind of book that stays with you despite not appearing to do anything particularly new or special. In fact, perhaps that\u2019s what makes it so very good: <em>Here We Are</em> smuggles within the pages of a seemingly commonplace tale depths of emotion and narrative complexity that take the breath away.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Here We Are</em> by Graham Swift is published by Scribner (\u00a314.99).

  "<p>Last year, Ari Aster was praised for setting the horrors of Midsommar in bright, sunlit scenes: by refusing the easy scares of nighttime, the director succeeded in making something especially disquieting, a paranoid waking nightmare. Although All Is Well, the debut feature film by German director Eva Trobisch, is not a horror film, it similarly thumbs its nose at the register of darkness you might expect from a drama about somebody recovering from a sexual assault. Janne, the young woman in question, never names her attacker; never seeks revenge; doesn\u2019t have a moment of reckoning \u2013 and, as she attempts to continue her life as usual, Trobisch frames her in solidly neutral whites. The pale workshirts she wears; sunlight through white blinds; white bricks at Janne\u2019s trendy office; computer light on her face; the walls of a hospital clinic: it\u2019s as if the world surrounding Janne is undisturbed. That unsullied universe only heightens the weight of the torment we know she is going through.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/15/the-distinguished-citizen-argentina-film\">My streaming gem: why you should watch The Distinguished Citizen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Janne is suffering. At the start of the movie, she and her boyfriend have just folded their small publishing outfit when she attends a school reunion at which, in short succession, she receives a job offer and is raped by Martin, another partygoer. Trobisch, with a remarkable knack for storytelling, gets through all of this in 20 minutes; 20 minutes filled, too, with so much observation and humanity. As Janne and Martin get pissed at the party and wend their way back together, the two are filmed giggling, drunkenly proffering beer to a passing cat. The movie\u2019s gift for the plausible, the banal, is evident in all of this \u2013 as it is when Janne\u2019s laughing, disbelieving derision towards Martin, when he makes overtures, seems to be what pushes him to assault her. The film is a bold, rich portrait of a woman, but it also trains a gimlet eye on the cringing weakness of men.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"alliswell\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2IXonLKTgvA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>This continues after Janne returns to the apartment she shares with her boyfriend \u2013 a mostly amiable, loving oaf of a man, with anger problems and an inability to listen \u2013 and takes the job she was offered. In a horrifying twist, Martin also works at Janne\u2019s new office, and the two will have to work together. Trobisch is astute in the way she threads the workspace into the narrative; this is now just one more area where Janne has to keep it together, one further instance of oppression. Aenne Schwarz, playing Janne, offers a masterclass here \u2013 not only anchoring the film\u2019s story, but cluing us in to all of Janne\u2019s warring anguish and resolve; her gnawing exhaustion, too. Schwarz gives us the merest split second of pain before switching on her capable public face; it is extraordinarily disquieting to see Janne lean in to greet Martin with a kiss on either cheek. As the movie continues, Schwarz shows Janne\u2019s control slipping, all the while maintaining an appearance of remaining steadfast.</p> <p>All Is Well, as should be clear by now, doesn\u2019t do things quite like other movies. The film is slow-paced and forensic, in the vein of recent German films; it is perhaps reminiscent of Toni Erdmann in the way it incorporates work into its study of character. There is weirdness and absurdity here too; things that can\u2019t be explained away \u2013 as when Janne, in helpless torment after an argument with her boyfriend, takes off her clothes on the landing outside the flat, and posts them through the letterbox. Trobisch, maintaining a riveting control over character and incident throughout, is brazenly uninterested in shortcuts or easy answers. To wit, a late confrontation between Janne and Martin, sharply written, in which Martin now finds himself the one saying no \u2013 this scene never spills into the dramatic, and doesn\u2019t offer catharsis. The movie\u2019s blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it opening scene gives the tone of the film, as Janne impassively watches an advert for a cleaning product, in which a woman admonishes two men for dirtying her floor. That whiteness again!</p> <p>The film\u2019s sublime rug-pull of an ending \u2013 one of the greatest ends in recent times \u2013 sees Janne\u2019s situation spilling over into the public sphere, as she rides the subway. It\u2019s intelligent, because here Janne is a public body, a civilian and a dissident. We have transitioned seamlessly from an interiorised depiction of one woman\u2019s ordeal to a more exterior perception of Janne, all the while knowing the turmoil that inhabits her.

  "<p>Aymen Tahar\u2019s football journey across the globe has been impressive but it might never have happened but for a chance meeting with his former Sheffield United teammate, Kyle Walker.</p> <p>The midfielder bumped into Walker after a year out of the professional game, having played alongside him in his one appearance for the Blades after graduating from the academy. Tahar was talked up by the then Tottenham defender to an agent friend, resulting in a trial and an epic adventure.</p> <p>Tahar had been on numerous trials in search of a club after his release by United in 2010. There were so many foreign trips he cannot remember each of them but among them were Qarabag, Al-Nasr and Rizespor. After numerous rejections, Tahar played for a local non-league side, Staveley Miners Welfare, to stay fit and enjoy football while studying law and criminology at Sheffield Hallam University.</p> <p>\u201cI bumped into Kyle, whose friend Dom was starting to get into working as an agent and he told him: \u2018This kid is good, can you help him find a club?\u2019 He invited me to London for a trial game. I used to think they were a bit of a waste of time but my best friend, Kyle Naughton, was at Spurs at the time and he told me to go and that I could go stay with him. I went down and it was freezing; in the end the game got called off at half-time.\u201d</p> <p>Scouts had taken notice, though, and a couple of weeks later the phone rang with the offer of a trial at Gaz Metan Medias. The Romanian club, who had reached the Europa League qualifiers at the start of the season, offered Tahar a four-year deal after two days of training.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a culture shock as I had never left home. The snow was so bad when I arrived, and I was just thinking: \u2018What have I got myself into? Where have I come?\u2019 I spent three years at Gaz Metan but the first three months were really difficult. I came home and didn\u2019t know if I wanted to go back. After 10 days at home, I realised it wasn\u2019t so bad, as they had given me my chance to play as a professional.</p> <p>\u201cI had a good six months after that, then a bad six months and thought I would never go back. I told them I wanted to leave and that I wanted to get a club back in England. The club said I had to return or they\u2019d fine me \u20ac1,000 a day. I asked to go on free but the president convinced me to stay, he was really good with me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eca9cae30373a73c25688d50283f30fd781fd8fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eca9cae30373a73c25688d50283f30fd781fd8fb/0_49_3165_1901/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aymen Tahar playing for Gaz Metan in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aymen Tahar playing for Gaz Metan in 2015. \u2018The first three months were really difficult,\u2019 he says.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cronos/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Staying proved more than worth it as Tahar earned a move to Romania\u2019s biggest club, Steaua Bucharest, where he would play under their infamous owner Gigi Becali, well known for outlandish statements.</p> <p>\u201cIt is unbelievable how big Steaua is an organisation,\u201d Tahar says. \u201cIn comparative terms, they are bigger than Manchester United as probably 60% of the country support Steaua. All the away games would be sold out as everyone wanted to watch Steaua play. The big-name players, the Romania internationals, can\u2019t go anywhere without it being mentioned. There is so much scrutiny in all the papers; if you go to the mall or a restaurant it will be there. I felt sorry for some of the bigger players as all the eyes were on them.\u201d</p> <p>The opportunity to play in the Champions League was too good to turn down, with Tahar rejecting more lucrative offers. In one of his first games for the club, he played against Partizan Belgrade in front of 30,000 animated Serbs. Steaua were dumped out of both European competitions before the group stages, as Tahar started to learn about Becali\u2019s way of doing things.</p> <p>\u201cWe lost to Rosenberg in the Europa League. I came on for the last 20 minutes with us 2-0 down, the supporters were on our back, nothing was going for us and we were just waiting for the whistle. Personally, I did not play well. After the match, Becali was speaking to the press, saying I had no place in the team, saying he was going to cut my wages by 50%, I was free to go and I\u2019d never play for them again. It was a month into my dream move. I thought I\u2019d been doing all right. He speaks for the sake of it, he couldn\u2019t cut my wages. I spoke to the president and he said: \u2018Don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s just Gigi.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Tahar says Becali visited the squad on another occasion when results were poor. \u201cHe was talking about how players were having too much sex and all this. I was thinking: \u2018This guy can\u2019t be the same as on TV.\u2019 He is a passionate guy, but he does not realise how his statements affect his club.\u201d</p> <p>Tahar\u2019s spell at Steaua was cut short. First he played for Boavista on loan, then signed for Sagan Tosu in the J-League, a spell during which he he had the chance to join the Serie A side Crotone, before returning to Gaz Metan. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d86f4389a62ba832092332dbd464b3ce8db451d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d86f4389a62ba832092332dbd464b3ce8db451d/0_77_2717_1629/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aymen Tahar on the Sheffield United bench with Sun Jihai in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aymen Tahar on the Sheffield United bench with Sun Jihai in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Stuart/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have regrets,\u201d he says, though he did not play as often as he hoped and admits he underestimated the J-League\u2019s strength. \u201cJapan was great, it\u2019s a completely different culture. The Japanese are the nicest people I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p> <p>Tahar has since had a second spell with Boavista and is playing in the Greek Super League for Panaitolikos. The plan was never to spend his career abroad but Tahar, who spent pre-season with Barnsley in 2016, will be 31 in October and accepts he will almost certainly never play for an English professional club again.</p> <p>Ederson and Iker Casillas are among the players he has faced on his travels and football has allowed Tahar to create a property portfolio to set him up for retirement. \u201cPlaying abroad has been great to me. You can do well financially and doing it against top players. I speak to friends in the lower leagues who are panicking about paying mortgages as their contracts are running out. People need to see that there\u2019s more out there.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><br></p> <p>It\u2019s hard to write about rejection; perhaps it\u2019s the hardest thing of all. Who wants to revisit such pain? Who really cares to crack open the smooth shell of their carefully deployed pride, to reveal the gaping wounds beneath? <a href=\"http://www.micheleroberts.co.uk/\">Mich\u00e8le Roberts</a>\u2019s new book, subtitled <em>A Diary of Surviving</em>, was written during the months that followed the rejection of her latest novel by her publisher and, in one way, it is in itself a means of keeping up appearances: in its pages, we find her determined to construct something elegant and worthwhile out of her humiliation. But it is also valiantly candid. Like onions, she peels her feelings; not even the silliest or most shameful among them will escape the blade of her sharpest knife.</p> <p><br>Roberts, as readers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/25/ignorance-michele-roberts-review\">her novels</a> will know, is a wonderful writer: one in possession of immense feeling not only for people (in this book, even strangers, half-glimpsed among the aisles at Morrisons, are described so vividly you can almost smell the too-ripe fruit in their metal baskets), but also for inanimate objects: it\u2019s in her power to make almost anything seem beguiling, whether an ordinary salad, pulled together from bits and pieces left in the fridge, or a slightly chipped statue of the Madonna found at a French <em>brocante</em>. In this book, though, she is the principal character: outwardly strong and capable, but with a newly frangible centre. Her identity \u2013 her entire way of life \u2013 being so bound up with her writing, the rejection of her novel feels calamitous; a personal disaster as well as a professional and financial one. But what to do? \u201cJust get on with your work, Miss Roberts,\u201d her tutor at university liked to tell her \u2013 and so she does. She rewrites (more than once) her novel, and alongside this agonising labour, she also produces this journal, a radiant and absorbing account of her day-to-day life in her basement flat in Walworth, south London, and in her tiny, damp house in the Mayenne, in north-west France (Roberts is half-French).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Roberts\u2019s friendships, whether with other women or with her ex-husband, Jim, are rich and sustaining</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><br>I like the raggedy crowds that populate this unlikely diary: English writers and French farmers gathering in its gardens and sitting rooms, each one of them with their (often forcefully expressed) point of view. Roberts\u2019s friendships, whether with other women or with her ex-husband, Jim, are rich and sustaining, and you know how her pals must feel about her in return, for she makes you feel so close to her: a warm, generous, clever and (to me) agreeably spiky person. However, what I find most powerfully moving about this book is its gentle, sidelong acknowledgment of her status as a single woman; the way she moves about the world, independent, alone, and yet only rarely lonely.</p> <p>Though Roberts is without self-pity, she has tenderness for herself; though her confidence is hard-won, she also knows her worth. Her description of joining the line at a supermarket till soon after her publisher has told her that her novel is \u201ctoo intense\u201d, and of finding a certain consolation there \u2013 \u201cjust being in a queue was a comfort: I had a place, braced by other people\u201d \u2013 brought me, I have to admit, almost to tears. I recognised, too, the way that one spurning \u2013 in this case, of her novel \u2013 causes her to remember others: a lover who returned to his wife; her mother, who never thought her daughter\u2019s books much good. Is rejection ever invited? Is there a sense in which, having learned that we can survive it, we somehow bring it on ourselves? When is calling a life \u201cunconventional\u201d just a way of avoiding putting a more brutal label on one\u2019s failures? These are the questions she bravely asks herself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jul/14/fiction.women\">Interview: Mich\u00e8le Roberts</a> </p> </aside>  <p><br>Her title, <em>Negative Capability</em>, is from Keats: <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/john-keats-and-negative-capability\">in a letter of 1817</a>, the poet wrote of this state as one in which a man is \u201ccapable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact &amp; reason\u201d. Roberts first read this line in her 20s and, longing to be invulnerable, couldn\u2019t appreciate it. Now, though, it is newly resonant for her, not only as a strategy for dwelling more peacefully within contradictions and even tumult, but as a kind of promontory, on which she must likely stand, sometimes waving and sometimes not, for the rest of her life. Concomitant to this is her sense that the writing of her journal has ultimately helped her to take pleasure in the day to day.</p> <p><br>Which brings us \u2013 doesn\u2019t it? \u2013 to the present moment. If someone had told me a month ago that I would find, during this lockdown, such solace and pleasure in a book about the drama of one woman\u2019s quotidian and interior life, I might have shaken my head: ordinary sadnesses are supposed to seem trivial now, bashed into shape by the horror of the times. But of course this is not the case. Roberts\u2019s wisdom worked on me like a spell: her growing awareness that there is no making a pattern of life; the sense that we can control relatively few of the things that are most important to us. Our adventures \u2013 our love affairs, our marriages, our struggles at work and at home \u2013 go on, unabated, irrespective of Covid-19. A sense of perspective, as Roberts repeatedly shows, is no cure at all for heartache.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Negative Capability: A Diary of Surviving</em> by Mich\u00e8le Roberts is published by Sandstone Press (<a href=\"https://sandstonepress.com/\">sandstonepress.com</a>, \u00a314.99).

  "<p>\u2018The fire got a bit out of control,\u201d says Blixa Bargeld, recalling a gig his band played in 1986. As Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten, which means Collapsing New Buildings, wrapped up their set of cacophonous industrial noise, Bargeld took a tray of lighter fluid and threw a match on it before squirting on more and watching the flames erupt. \u201cOh, it was gigantic,\u201d he says with a wry smile. Panic and chaos ensued.</p> <p>Today, thankfully, the only thing being toasted is a tablespoon of peppercorns Bargeld has instructed me to put in a pan as pasta bubbles away furiously. We are preparing spaghetti cacio e pepe. \u201cMy pasta is from Mancini,\u201d he announces over Zoom, while opening a bottle of white wine. \u201cHe\u2019s the only pasta-maker who grows his own wheat and has a doctorate.\u201d Mine is from Co-op.</p> <p>Bargeld has been <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B_z3w_xIJn_/?igshid=jbyvg5z56d51\">regularly hosting these cooking sessions with fans</a> via Patreon and Instagram. He picks a recipe, curates a playlist, drinks wine, dances, and people cook along. Wearing formal dinner attire rather than a chef\u2019s outfit, Bargeld talks me through this simple yet punchy dish. \u201cPeople think you just put cheese over the pasta but that won\u2019t do,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to make a juice out of the peppercorns. Like a tea.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7de69666195b25fac47a2217a466e5dc7e5f41d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7de69666195b25fac47a2217a466e5dc7e5f41d/0_0_1918_1009/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018He was the most beautiful man in the world\u2019 ...

As an early adopter of crowdfunding, the group has been self-sufficient and patronage-funded since 2002. \u201cIt\u2019s not an option for a band like us,\u201d Bargeld says of the traditional record label model. \u201cThe money I currently get for making the album cover would be the amount I\u2019d get for the whole record if I were to sign a record contract now.\u201d</p> <p>For 40 years, Bargeld has fronted Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten, an inimitable and pioneering outfit known for their blueprint influence on industrial music and their proclivity for utilising building tools and scrap metal, as well as inventing contraptions to be used as instruments.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/06/henry-rollins-trump-fans-are-going-to-be-very-dangerous-losers\">Henry Rollins</a> loves them so much he has the band\u2019s logo as a tattoo. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/21/trent-reznor-nine-inch-nails-youre-seeing-the-fall-of-america\">Trent Reznor</a> cites them as a huge influence on Nine Inch Nails and later signed them to his label in the US. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/nick-cave\">Nick Cave</a> stumbled across them, he fell in love and later wrote of Bargeld: \u201cHe stood in a black leotard, black rubber pants, black rubber boots. Around his neck hung a thoroughly fucked guitar. His skin cleared to his bones, his skull was an utter disaster, scabbed and hacked. Blixa Bargeld. He was the most beautiful man in the world.\u201d Cave soon invited Bargeld to be the guitarist in Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, where he remained for 20 years until 2003.</p> <p>However, just as Bargeld\u2019s aptitude for playing genial host belies his reputation as a man known to scream so intensely it can make dogs miles away howl, there\u2019s also more to Neubauten than ear-terrorising industrial noise mania. This is displayed clearly on their latest album, Alles in Allem, their first studio record in 13 years.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nz9t_4XLcc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0Nz9t_4XLcc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nz9t_4XLcc\">Watch the video for new album title track Alles in Allem</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cThe attitude towards the music has relaxed,\u201d says Bargeld. \u201cTwenty years ago, I would have needed to fill spaces, thinking something was too boring or lacking. That\u2019s youth. It\u2019s a different attitude now. I don\u2019t have that urge to fill every space or think there needs to be another scream.\u201d</p> <p>In tone, the result is still quintessentially Neubauten, a band that intuitively understands the equal power of restraint and exertion, albeit with noir pop, ambient soundscapes, sweeping strings and poignant melody overshadowing the cold, brittle rattle of industrial clatter. And why the long wait? \u201cArt doesn\u2019t come from when you can do something,\u201d says Bargeld. \u201cIt comes from when you have to do something.\u201d</p> <p>Having formed in 1980, the band\u2019s early output was a combination of avant-punk, noise, industrial and experimental. They rehearsed in a giant air-conditioning shaft situated underneath \u2013 technically inside \u2013 an autobahn overpass. The intensity of the sound ricocheted around the space whose steel walls doubled as drums, and set the band on a unique path.</p> <p>Having something of an epiphany while listening to traditional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/10/worldmusic\">Ethiopian music</a>, Bargeld asked: \u201cWhat is the authenticity of my life?\u201d The answer lay around him in the debris of post-war Berlin coupled with its fertile and anything-goes outlook. \u201cA lot has been said of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/12/how-berlin-made-me-a-better-artist-chris-petit\">West Berlin in the 1980s</a> and all of it is true. It was like ground zero. The band is connected to this very special environment.\u201d They sold their drum kit to pay rent and soon started to assemble their own instruments and creations, foraging in scrapyards or elsewhere. The message: \u201cBe clever, steal from a construction site\u201d was written across their first self-made drum set.</p> <p>Fuelled by booze and speed, the band found their reputation would precede them. \u201cThe fire thing was moving faster than we were,\u201d Bargeld says. \u201cWe\u2019d turn up to gigs and they\u2019d already be standing there with fire extinguishers. That was something we had to stop, as it became showbusiness. Just showing the audience a petrol canister filled with water became enough to terrify them.\u201d</p> <p>One gig \u2013 Concerto for Voice and Machinery at London\u2019s ICA in 1984 \u2013 became so legendary it was later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/feb/16/popandrock1\">restaged as an artwork in 2007</a>. But its myth has outgrown reality, Bargeld says. The story goes the band planned to drill through the floor into a rumoured secret passage that led to Buckingham Palace. Years later band member Alexander Hacke described the sound they made as \u201ca cross between a building site and war\u201d.</p> <p>His role was to throw milk bottles into a cement mixer. As glass flew out into the crowd, smoke from the petrol chainsaws began to suffocate them, too. The power supply was pulled and a riot followed. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to take part in that show,\u201d recalls Bargeld. The gig also featured members of Throbbing Gristle and Fad Gadget. \u201cThe damage was started by the audience, not the band. It was not planned.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9061c6b40a78fd67db5ccd4b9d5e123939ef18da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9061c6b40a78fd67db5ccd4b9d5e123939ef18da/0_558_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"More relaxed \u2026 Blixa Bargeld and Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">More relaxed \u2026 Blixa Bargeld and Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mote Sinabel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You don\u2019t have to look too far for stories where myth and reality intertwine, however. The band did attempt to drill through a wall at the Berlin venue S036, and ex-member FM Einheit did have a penchant for throwing molotov cocktails into the audience, often causing riots. One night in Copenhagen, says Bargeld, \u201cwe were playing in a squat and we climbed up on the PA and began to chisel off parts of the ceiling. They viewed it as an attack on their house, so they slashed the tyres of our tour van, smashed the windows and stole equipment including our Kango drill.\u201d They lasted just one night as tour support for U2 before being thrown off. The outraged and hostile audience threw bottles of urine. The band responded by throwing iron bars back at them.</p> <p>This led many to think of the band as provocateurs but Bargeld disagrees. \u201cI didn\u2019t start out to destroy the stages of the world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was just a sign of being alive more than a provocation.\u201d While still ferociously intense, shows are less wild these days. Sparks still fly, metal still scrapes and power tools still grind, as Bargeld glides between rich baritone croon and vocal cord-shredding scream, but there\u2019s also melancholic beauty and tenderness. \u201cWe\u2019re very serious about representing the material the best we can,\u201d says Bargeld. \u201cIt\u2019s not really about chaos \u2013 although I did fall off stage and break my leg not that long ago.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's not really about chaos \u2013\u00a0although I did fall off stage and break my leg not that long ago</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One constant is the band\u2019s innovative approach to equipment and recording. \u201cThere\u2019s a strategy,\u201d says Bargeld. \u201cI want to undermine routine and sabotage logic. We\u2019ve been doing that for 40 years with unusual instrumentation. It\u2019s important to undermine functionality and knowledge \u2013 to disturb the obvious.\u201d</p> <p>For Bargeld, the sound of Tupperware filled with nails and coins being shaken recalls the sound of the ocean, while a microphone swiped across a shopping trolley mirrors the lush plucks of a harp. Nick Cave once wrote vividly about watching the band mic up a dog to root around in pig guts. \u201cWhat I want when working with unusual materials is for them to open up and give something of their character away,\u201d Bargeld says. \u201cI don\u2019t really care about sound. I think it\u2019s highly overvalued. I care about context and metaphor.\u201d</p> <p>Watching Bargeld slurp up some pepper-coated spaghetti reminds me they have a percussive instrument called the noodle. However, foraging is getting harder these days apparently. \u201cWe went to a scrapyard,\u201d says Bargeld. \u201cBut due to security reasons, they don\u2019t let you in any more. They only let you look through the trash, and there\u2019s not much treasure to be found in there.\u201d Still, the band is still finding beautiful sounds in unexpected places. \u201cPolystyrene,\u201d says Bargeld, taking another mouthful, \u201cgives you incredible sounds.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Alles in Allem is out now on Potomak.</p>",
  "<p>The Rev Jesse Jackson was born in the racially segregated south when Franklin Roosevelt occupied the White House and war raged in Europe. He was an eyewitness to the assassination of Martin Luther King, campaigned against the Vietnam war and twice ran for US president.</p> <p>But, now an elder statesman of 78, he has never seen anything like the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 1 million Americans and killed more in April alone than died in Vietnam over 15 years. The world\u2019s most powerful and wealthy country also bears by far its biggest death toll: almost 90,000. It is enough to shake faith in American exceptionalism.</p> <p>\u201cOur military cannot defeat this germ,\u201d Jackson says by phone from Chicago, one of the hardest-hit cities. \u201cHaving the biggest banks, having the biggest military has no meaning in this kind of germ warfare. The frontline is not soldiers; the frontline is doctors and nurses. The planes are grounded, the bombs are irrelevant. It turns out that pride precedes a fall. Sometimes people have to learn that we don\u2019t control everything.\u201d</p> <p>Despite lockdown and Parkinson\u2019s disease, Jackson is still working with gusto at the Rainbow Push Coalition, a progressive organisation he founded in 1996. It has convened thousands of black doctors and lawyers and released a manifesto suggesting that high-risk groups, including African Americans, be prioritised for coronavirus testing.</p> <p>Jackson has twice written to Donald Trump urging testing for the 2.2 million people currently in prison. At a time when most Americans are looking inward, he has also called for massive intervention in Africa, a particularly vulnerable continent that is close to his heart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"55dddb9dfcb17798d138912412644c022255a838\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55dddb9dfcb17798d138912412644c022255a838/25_33_1319_1965/671.jpg\" alt=\"Jesse Jackson in 1988 in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination.\" width=\"671\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jesse Jackson in 1988 in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cynthia Johnson/The LIFE Images Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re working virtually, making conference calls, using this time to organise people,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked to about 2,000 ministers around the nation over the past 10 days, trying to convince their congregations to honour the protocols and stay in the house.\u201d</p> <p>For a brief while it became voguish to indulge a comforting myth that the coronavirus was the great equaliser, touching the bus driver and Prince of Wales alike. But while infections do not discriminate, humans do. Despite making up only 13% of the US population, African Americans represent 30% of the deaths from the coronavirus.</p> <p>A Senate Democratic Policy and Communications Committee <a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/dpcc/press-reports/dpcc-report-racial-disparities-on-full-displaycovid-19-is-disproportionately-affecting-communities-of-color\">report </a><a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/dpcc/press-reports/dpcc-report-racial-disparities-on-full-displaycovid-19-is-disproportionately-affecting-communities-of-color\">last month concluded</a> that people of colour have less access to quality healthcare, are more likely to have a pre-existing health condition and suffer greater exposure to air pollution that puts them at higher risk of asthma. They also make up a disproportionate share of frontline workers, are less likely to be able to work from home and more likely to rely on public transport, and are hit hardest by poverty as layoffs continue to rise.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that people should honour the [social distancing] protocols, but some find it more difficult because of congested conditions or their transportation,\u201d says Jackson. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/los-angeles-coronavirus-inequality-undocumented-healthcare\">A lot are untested and uninsured</a>. If you\u2019re uninsured, you can go to the hospitals only to be told you can\u2019t get service, so you end up resorting to your own home remedies, or you end up in the hospital too late.</p> <p>\u201cThat points to disparity in income and education and healthcare. It shows the black condition in America. The legacy of slavery and Jim Crow is very clear.\u201d</p> <p>Like Trump\u2019s regressive presidency, the virus is a shock to the system that forces a confrontation with class, race and structural inequality. What had been ambient noise for the privileged is suddenly vividly clear and difficult to ignore.</p> <p>\u201cAfter 400 years of slavery, segregation and discrimination, why would anybody be shocked that African Americans are dying disproportionately from the coronavirus?\u201d Jackson <a href=\"https://chicagocrusader.com/why-are-african-americans-dying-disproportionately-to-the-coronavirus/\">asked in a statement published on 7 April</a>, arguing that all past US presidents have failed to \u201cend the virus of white superiority and fix the multifaceted issues confronting African Americans\u201d.</p> <p>He adds, by phone: \u201cAmerica has decided the place of blacks in this society, which is beneath that of European immigrants. People say America is 244 years old, but Africans have been here 157 years before the constitution.

We\u2019re still looked upon as the other based upon skin colour, as some kind of irreparable sin in the society. People try to adjust to it but, when a pandemic sets in, the data comes out.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re about 60% of prisoners in this country. People are sick behind those walls. You can have 200 inmates sick with Covid-19 and the workers go home and they spread it. So the prisons become the epicentre of the untreated and untested and undetected.\u201d</p> <p>Itching to revive their economies, several southern states led by mostly white male governors are already reopening bowling alleys, cinemas, hairdressers, restaurants and other outlets against federal guidelines. A <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?next_url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.washingtonpost.com%2fpolitics%2f2020%2f04%2f28%2fblack-activists-officials-see-major-threat-souths-plans-reopen%2f\">group of activists</a>, mostly black women, warned in a petition that reopening now \u201cis irresponsible and a death sentence for many of us\u201d.</p> <p>White privilege will offer no immunity in an interconnected society, says Jackson. \u201cIf blacks are the drivers and unprotected, the driven are hurt. If the cooks and waiters are unprotected, those they cook for are all unprotected. So we\u2019re more integrated than we realise on a daily basis.</p> <p>\u201cSo we really must have healthcare for all as one of the by-products of this pandemic. Anybody who\u2019s left out is a threat to those who are left in. When people as affluent as Prince Charles and Boris Johnson and athletes are affected, it means that the gated community did not protect you from the pandemic. If the poor are not protected, the rich are in jeopardy, because you cannot separate by community the poor from the rich, the white from the black.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0dbd14c23583b71911f99a88a27e694605d5ec8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0dbd14c23583b71911f99a88a27e694605d5ec8/608_479_2392_1668/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Martin Luther King in 1968 a day before King\u2019s assassination at the same spot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Martin Luther King in 1968 a day before King\u2019s assassination at the same spot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Kelly/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Roosevelt was tested by the Great Depression and second world war and rose to the challenge.

Biden\u2019s campaign fell apart after he quoted without attribution the then British Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, and was accused of plagiarism. Jackson, bidding to become the US\u2019s first black president, gathered 7m votes and finished first or second in 46 out of 54 primary contests. But he lost the nomination to Michael Dukakis, who went down to George HW Bush.</p> <p>Does it hurt that he will never be president? \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he says firmly, \u201cbecause I was a trailblazer, I was a pathfinder. I had to deal with doubt and cynicism and fears about a black person running. There were black scholars writing papers about why I was wasting my time. Even blacks said a black couldn\u2019t win.\u201d</p> <p>Some of his foreign policy positions at the time, he points out, became widely adopted: a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians, the release of Nelson Mandela from prison in South Africa (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/08/thatcher-advisers-suspicious-jesse-jackson-visit\">he met Margaret Thatcher to plead for Britain</a> to drop its support for the apartheid regime). In 2000 he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the US\u2019s highest civilian honour.</p> <p>When Obama won in 2008, he praised Jackson for making his run possible. As Obama delivered his election night victory speech at Grant Park in Chicago before a crowd of 240,000, Jackson\u2019s tear-stained face was among the most indelible images. \u201cIt was a big moment in history,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI cried because I thought about those who made it possible who were not there \u2026 People who paid a real price: Ralph Abernathy, Dr King, Medgar Evers, Fannie Lou Hamer, those who fought like hell [at the Democratic national convention] in Atlantic City in 64, those in the movement in the south.\u201d </p> <p>Some felt that Obama should have pushed faster and further on racial justice in his two terms. But Jackson ranks him among the US\u2019s top presidents. \u201cFirst, given America\u2019s history in terms of race, he inspired indescribable pride. No 2, his family and their decency and dignity were a big deal.\u201d</p> <p>He points to the Paris climate accords, Iran nuclear deal, rapprochement with Cuba and rescue of the economy as signal achievements. \u201cHe stabilised the ship when the ship was sinking and got it back above the water. And no scandal. Trump creates a desire for Barack all over again. When he travelled around the world, he was the best face America\u2019s ever had.\u201d</p> <p>In March, Jackson endorsed Bernie Sanders, returning a compliment from 1988 when Sanders backed his campaign. \u201cHis ideas made the most sense to me,\u201d he explains. But after a promising start Sanders fell away, partly because of his failure to connect with older African American voters, where Biden dominated.</p> <p>\u201cHis campaign was [about] class without appreciating the caste dimension of poverty,\u201d Jackson explains by way of post-mortem. \u201cThere are 55 black members of Congress and he didn\u2019t have one. Maybe one or two black mayors, but he didn\u2019t cultivate an African American constituency.\u201d</p> <p>Biden, meanwhile, benefited from his \u201ckinship\u201d with Obama as well as Trump\u2019s repeated attacks that kept his profile up and his name on the front pages. \u201cThe opposition had no infrastructure for the black vote. In many ways, he inherited votes he didn\u2019t campaign for.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1c0ab365ca2b0e711ca6df5ee832b9671430bc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1c0ab365ca2b0e711ca6df5ee832b9671430bc7/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Bernie Sanders in March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Bernie Sanders in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In recent weeks, Biden has been endorsed by Sanders, Obama, Hillary Clinton, House speaker Nancy Pelosi and the civil rights hero John Lewis in a show of party unity. Will Jackson support him enthusiastically? \u201cYeah, as an alternative to the present administration, but we\u2019ve not had a meeting with the black constituency on what our demands are.\u201d</p> <p>The ground is shifting under Trump and Biden\u2019s feet. Sanders argues that the pandemic, which has put more than 30 million Americans out of work, shows the failure of the US healthcare system. As an opportunity to reimagine the social contract, the present moment is being compared with Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal or the post second-world-war consensus in Britain.</p> <p>\u201cBiden won the delegates but Sanders won the issues,\u201d Jackson reflects. \u201cSanders\u2019 agenda will dominate the [Democratic national] convention. One of the by-products of this pandemic is going to be the need for healthcare for all. We can\u2019t afford not to have healthcare for all because if you see the gap between the 1% and 99%, the 1% can\u2019t hide from who it is that\u2019s caring for the masses. The real soldiers are not the investment bankers. It\u2019s the doctors and nurses. There is a new appreciation of the common people, doctors and janitors and truck drivers, what they call essential workers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn many ways,\u201d he says, \u201cas African Americans, we\u2019re at the the bottom of the foundation. The foundation is where it starts from. So when the foundation\u2019s in trouble, the whole building\u2019s in trouble.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Global infections pass 4.7 million</strong></h2> <p>There are 4,716,513 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide. At least 315,187<strong> </strong>people have died over the course of the pandemic The number of deaths in the US is approaching 90,000, with 89,562 confirmed fatalities and 1,486,757 infections, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker.</p> <h2><strong>US Federal Reserve Chair says unemployment could reach 25%</strong></h2> <p>US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Sunday that US unemployment could peak at 25%, but expressed optimism Sunday that the economy could begin to recover from a devastating recession in the second half of the year, assuming the coronavirus doesn\u2019t erupt in a second wave.</p> <h2><strong>Japan\u2019s </strong><strong>falls into recession </strong></h2> <p>Japan dived into its first recession since 2015, according to official data Monday, with the world\u2019s third-largest economy contracting by 0.9% in the first quarter as it wrestled with the fallout from the coronavirus. The cabinet office reported a drop of 3.4% annual pace in seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, or GDP, the total value of a nation\u2019s goods and services, for the January-March period, compared to the previous quarter.</p> <h2><strong>South Africa reports highest daily increase in cases</strong></h2> <p>South Africa on Sunday reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March \u201cAs of today, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 15,515, with 1,160 new cases identified in the last 24 hour cycle of testing,\u201d the health ministry said in a statement. The Western Cape province, popular with tourists, accounted for nearly 60% of the national numbers.</p> <h2><strong>S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil mayor says hospitals \u2018near collapse\u2019</strong></h2> <p>In Brazil, the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-52701524\">BBC</a> has reported that the mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, the country\u2019s largest city, has warned that hospitals have reached 90% capacity and are \u201cnear collapse\u201d; they could run out of space in just two weeks\u2019 time, he said. Brazil has the fourth-highest number of infections worldwide, with 241,080, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. It has recorded 16,118 deaths. Meanwhile, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro greeted hundreds of supporters and joined some in a series of push-ups who gathered before the presidential offices Sunday.</p> <h2><strong>Death tolls fall in UK, Spain and Italy</strong></h2> <p>In a possible glimmer of hope, Sunday saw lower death tolls reported in the UK, Spain and Italy. The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. However, the Sunday and Monday figures tend to be lower than other days because of weekend testing rates. Meanwhile Spain<strong> </strong> recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months. Italy on Sunday recorded its lowest daily toll, 145, since lockdown was declared. There were 153 deaths registered during the previous 24 hour period.</p> <h2><strong>Move Rohingya on Bangladesh island to refugee camps, says UN chief</strong></h2> <p>Hundreds of Rohingya rescued by Bangladesh and sent to a flood-prone island after being stranded at sea for weeks should be moved to existing refugee camps, the UN secretary general has said. The appeal by Antonio Guterres to Bangladesh\u2019s foreign minister in a letter obtained Sunday by AFP comes as concern grows over a coronavirus outbreak in the sprawling camps near the border with Myanmar. A fourth virus case has been detected in the crowded camps, officials said Sunday.</p> <h2><strong>WHO committee to discuss Taiwan exclusion</strong></h2> <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) is to raise the question of Taiwan\u2019s participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/world-health-assembly-what-is-it-and-what-is-the-coronavirus-inquiry-china-taiwan-origins\">which opens virtually on Monday</a>, before one of its committees. Diplomatic allies of Taiwan, including Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Paraguay, have formally requested to invite Taiwan to the meeting as an observer. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has also said publicly he wants Taiwan in the room.</p> <h2><strong>India extends lockdown by another two weeks</strong></h2> <p>India has extended its lockdown to 31 May, but with some easing of restrictions. States are being given greater power to reopen markets and standalone stores, bus and other public transport travel being allowed between and within states. However, shopping malls, air travel, cinemas, schools and places of worship will remain closed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/17/coronavirus-live-news-barack-obama-attacks-trump-virus-response?page=with:block-5ec146888f0886ce4f5d52ff#block-5ec146888f0886ce4f5d52ff\">Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai and other key regions</a> are still fighting to control the rising curve of coronavirus infections.

  "<p>I know these two well. There they stand, side by side, rain or shine \u2013 stoic through the seasons, resolutely inseparable. We share a garden and, as I would any elderly couple, I check on them, watch them for change \u2013 and trouble myself by imagining what life would be like if we lost them.</p> <p>Trees do that when you have them close. They become a part of your family. Beneath the horse chestnut, mine have camped, collected conkers, made leaf piles tall enough to disappear into. We\u2019ve hugged it, climbed it, studied it, sometimes worriedly. I breathe a sigh of relief when the horse chestnut bursts into leaf every March, afflicted as it is with a leaf-mining moth \u2013 nothing more serious, not yet \u2013 that turns its leaves brown earlier every year.</p> <p>As I stand now on this windy evening, the grass for 20 metres around it is scattered with its blossom, intricately ornate up close, stood like perky pink arrows up in its canopy. Those, too, have come early.</p> <p>The sycamore next to the chestnut is slighter. I pull a leaf down and examine it. Each one is a little world of its own. Red pimples on this one suggest gall mites. I turn it over and there are aphids, the shape of tiny translucent pumpkin seeds, a stilt-walking greenfly and a fine white fur, which is the tree\u2019s reaction to the mites. The flowers are clusters of spread hands, sticky and \u2013 with a close look \u2013 there\u2019s the embryonic \u201chelicopter\u201d seed, pea-green, the size of a rice grain and the shape of a wing nut. I look up and imagine all this, thousands of times over.</p> <p>I\u2019m out here, in the shadow of the new leaves, to feel the energy of the wind working the tree. Around me, the branches drape like a cloak. Above, the trees are so heavy over me, yet weightless. It\u2019s inexplicably heart-quickening.</p> <p>But it\u2019s the union of these trees I love most. During the winter they are a scrabble of hard branches, dark shapes with no identity. But when they are in leaf, their individuality emerges. Their character. I see it most in the line, that unique junction they share, where every spring, their canopies meet and interlock. In times of enforced distance, it\u2019s a beautiful thing.</p>",
  "<p>The mayor of Athens has said he will \u201cliberate\u201d public space from cars.

It is planning a public consultation over where and how to introduce more bike lanes in the future.</p> <p>Around 20 miles of temporary bike lanes have been set up across Paris, much to the disgruntlement of car lobbyists who have protested to city hall that their rights are being squeezed. Main roads such as the Rue de Rivoli and Rue Saint Antoine, a major east-west route, are gradually being sealed off to private vehicles and there are proposals for a further 30 miles of bike lanes in the city.</p> <p>Many Parisians <a href=\"https://coupdepoucevelo.fr/auth/home\">are being offered \u20ac50</a> toward getting old bikes repaired as part of the French capital\u2019s \u20ac20m (\u00a318m) <em>planv\u00e9lo</em> to encourage the use of bicycles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d1b6c53ef2e2b20043c33763f952c1cddfdb2be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d1b6c53ef2e2b20043c33763f952c1cddfdb2be/0_123_4480_2688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclists near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cyclists near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bertrand Guay/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those supporting the new push for bike travel point to recent studies, one of which showed the average journey by vehicle in Paris to is 2.5 miles \u2013 a comfortable distance by bike for most \u2013 and another indicating that the lack of exhaust fumes during lockdown has dramatically improved air quality in the city.</p> <p>The city\u2019s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, had made persuading people to abandon private cars in favour of bikes one of the pillars of her political programme even before she was elected mayor in 2014.

Authorities singled out College Green, which abuts Trinity College, and other parts of the city centre for what promises to be a bold transformation. </p> <p>The idea is to give pedestrians and cyclists more space to navigate the city when shops and other businesses reopen in a 12 to 18-month respite from traffic-choked streets. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f49ab5587b7a2ee4080e34f09bde71c2a9ce354\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f49ab5587b7a2ee4080e34f09bde71c2a9ce354/0_7_3217_1930/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of Dublin\u2019s temporary bike lanes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Dublin\u2019s temporary bike lanes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Authorities in Milan, among the most polluted cities in Europe, have said 22 miles of streets will be transformed over the summer as part of a scheme to reallocate space from cars to cycling and walking.

As part of the government\u2019s economic decree, people in towns and cities with populations of 50,000 or more will also be able to claim up to \u20ac500 toward the cost of a new bike. The payment also applies to scooters, electric bikes and Segways.</p> <p>Last year\u2019s Tour de France victory by the Colombian Egan Bernal precipitated a cycling boom in Bogot\u00e1. Hundreds of miles of public highways are closed to cars on Sundays, allowing cyclists to take to the roads free of exhaust fumes and the blare of car horns.</p> <p>This enthusiasm has made it easier for the mayor, Claudia L\u00f3pez, herself a keen cyclist, to introduce more bike lanes as part of plans to reduce public transport use to 35% of capacity in the country\u2019s effort to tackle the pandemic.

One of the outcomes of purchasing weapons is that you\u2019re buying relationships,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/andrewfeinstein\">Andrew Feinstein</a>, an expert on corruption and the global arms trade.</p> <p>In the US, Donald Trump has in the past pointed to Saudi\u2019s proposed weapons purchases \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/20/donald-trump-saudi-arabia-arms-sales-jamal-khashoggi\">inflated estimates about its impact on US jobs</a> \u2013 to justify his administration\u2019s soft response to the murder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jamal-khashoggi\">Jamal Khashoggi</a>, the Washington Post journalist.</p> <p>Britain sells more arms to Saudi Arabia than to any other country \u2013 more than \u00a34.7bn since the kingdom began a bombing campaign against Yemen in March 2015 \u2013 and Boris Johnson has faced criticism for allowing sales to continue despite concerns that the UK has risked being in breach of international humanitarian law by aiding the Saudi campaign.</p> <p>But Riedel and others believe the Saudi government will have little choice but to delay military spending, in some cases permanently.</p> <p>Andrew Smith, at the Campaign Against Arms Trade, said: \u201cI expect that they may in the short term put off committing to some larger purchases, like a new set of fighter jets, for example, which Britain has been negotiating for quite some time.\u201d </p> <p>Another expert, Gerald Feierstein, a former US ambassador to Yemen, said it would be easy for the Saudis to delay or cancel new weapons contracts, but that the Saudi government would likely have to continue maintenance contracts to keep its current force operable. Feierstein said Saudi Arabia has in the past sought to renegotiate payment schedules for weapons, stretching out payments over long periods of time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"152845234d1d00a0e6c999e45e05b0c68347d831\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/152845234d1d00a0e6c999e45e05b0c68347d831/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yemenis searching for survivors under the rubble of houses in the capital Sanaa after a pre-dawn Saudi-led air strike.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yemenis searching for survivors under the rubble of houses in the capital Sanaa after a pre-dawn Saudi-led air strike.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mohammed Huwais/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cRemember when Mohammed bin Salman came to the White House and Trump held up that cardboard graphic with $100bn in sales, that was all aspirational anyway,\u201d Feierstein said. \u201cMost of that stuff has never happened and it\u2019s never been signed, it was just kind of pulled out of the air.\u201d</p> <p>Prince Mohammed does not only have the financial crisis to worry about. In the US, he is facing the prospect of Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, winning in November. Biden has already said he would curb US arm sales to Saudi Arabia and called the current leadership a \u201cpariah\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI do think that the [financial crisis] is going to affect all their spending,\u201d said Kirsten Fontenrose, who served as senior director for Gulf affairs at the National Security Council in the Trump administration.</p> <p>Instead of announcing cuts in spending, Fontenrose suggested, the Saudis could wait for the results of November\u2019s election and \u2013 if Biden wins \u2013 for the Democrats to force the spending reductions, which they would \u201cpretend to grudgingly accept\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThat would be a way for them to escape the political repercussions and maintain some of their leverage with the private sector,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Riedel said that among the companies likely to be hardest hit is Britain\u2019s BAE Systems,, given the company\u2019s exposure to Saudi Arabia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/28/khashoggi-fiancee-stop-saudi-takeover-of-newcastle-or-be-complicit\">Khashoggi fiancee: stop Saudi takeover of Newcastle United or be complicit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBAE will be hit enormously.

Instead, the kingdom has been siphoning off its reserves, which have dwindled from $750bn to $500bn over the past five years.</p> <p>Publicly, Saudi Arabia appears to be on a spending spree, even as it recently introduced an unprecedented hike in taxes and budget cuts.</p> <p>The Saudi sovereign wealth fund, which is controlled by Prince Mohammed, is set to acquire a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/28/khashoggi-fiancee-stop-saudi-takeover-of-newcastle-or-be-complicit\">majority stake in the Newcastle football club</a>, and has bought hundreds of millions of dollars in shares of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/carnival\">Carnival</a> Cruise ships and in <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/27/saudi-arabia-buys-500-million-stake-in-coronavirus-hit-live-nation.html\">Live Nation</a>, the world\u2019s largest concert and events promoter.</p> <p>Not every analyst agrees that the Saudis will rein in spending.

We were only cheerfully ignoring that fact, while walking hand in hand with the administrators down the red carpet of another awards night. The model was flawed, pressures great and margins thin. Switching to a Covid model of takeaway has been tricky, running on little-to-no profit with endless outgoings.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard not to feel helpless as a small business operator right now. Jobkeeper is a Band-Aid on a gunshot wound, and the government-backed bank loans are a joke. Even if you actually get a loan from the bank (which you won\u2019t if you carry any ATO debt, and I guarantee almost all of our industry does), you\u2019re then required to pay it off in the midst of a potential depression. On the subject of foreign workers, our government failed. Our industry relies on that talent and the tourism and hospitality sector have thrived because of it, however the government distanced themselves from them faster than MasterChef distanced themselves from George Calombaris.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6b1e47a7a7ebadba16f9ad37267419a7740c0cc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b1e47a7a7ebadba16f9ad37267419a7740c0cc9/0_628_1333_1372/972.jpg\" alt=\"Chef Duncan Welgemoed\" width=\"972\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chef Duncan Welgemoed: \u2018It\u2019s hard not to feel helpless as a small business operator right now.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andre Castellucci</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Every move we make now must be to position ourselves as essential food businesses.

Paying for the true worth of the product and passing on that cost to the consumer, without fear of reprisals or criticism.</p> <p>The perceived value of food is distorted \u2013 people are willing to purchase a 250g sirloin steak at the butchers for $14 to cook at home, but have issues spending $30 for that same steak to be cooked with all the trimmings, presented, served and cleared by someone else.</p> <p>We are partly responsible for that due to the \u201clook at your neighbour\u201d pricing model, where oversupply of restaurants and big-format food businesses have reduced the number of regular, repeat business and in turn, decreased overall turnover. It creates the illusion that undercutting your competition was<strong> </strong>the only way to attract diners.</p> <p>Some in the industry sought to increase their margins by underpaying staff \u2013 notable operators and TV chefs have been guilty of this. It is wrong and illegal to financially exploit your employees, and those who do should not be forgiven very quickly.
