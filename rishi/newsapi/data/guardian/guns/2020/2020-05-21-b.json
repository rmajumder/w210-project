We are very concerned about rising cases in low- and middle-income countries,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile Europe\u2019s director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the agency responsible for advising governments, including the UK, on disease control, has said that Europe should brace for a second wave of infections \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/top-eu-doctor-europe-should-brace-itself-for-second-wave-of-coronavirus\">The question is when and how big.

That it\u2019s not the time now to completely relax,\u201d she said. </p> \n  <p>Here are the top developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/global-report-coronavirus-pandemic-not-over-warns-the-who\">World sees largest daily rise in cases</a>. </strong>The World Health Organization gave a stark warning on Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic is far from over, after 106,000 new cases were recorded worldwide over the past 24 hours \u2013 the most in a single day so far. Speaking in Geneva, the WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the virus was spreading in poorer countries, just as wealthier nations were emerging from lockdown.</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/top-eu-doctor-europe-should-brace-itself-for-second-wave-of-coronavirus\">Europe should brace itself for a second wave of coronavirus infections</a></strong>, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big. That is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump considers an in-person G7 meeting despite coronavirus pandemic. </strong>Donald Trump has said he may seek to revive a face-to-face meeting of Group of Seven leaders near Washington, after earlier canceling the gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, DC, at the legendary Camp David,\u201d the US president tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cThe other members are also beginning their COMEBACK. It would be a great sign to all \u2013 normalization!\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>International imports and exports have fallen to their lowest level for at least four years</strong>, according to World Trade Organization figures. Warning that there was little prospect of the downturn ending soon, the global authority on trade said it believed import and export activity would fall precipitously in the first half of 2020.</li> \n   <li><strong>Tourists will be welcomed back to Greece from 15 June</strong>, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has announced. \u201cThe tourism period begins June 15, when seasonal hotels can reopen, and direct international flights to our tourist destinations will gradually begin 1 July,\u201d Mitsotakis said in a televised address.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Africa records its first neonatal coronavirus death. </strong>South Africa has recorded its first neonatal coronavirus death, the country\u2019s health ministry has said.The two-day old baby was born prematurely and had lung difficulties that required ventilation support immediately after birth, the health minister Zweli Mkhize said.</li> \n   <li><strong>France is to launch a complete shake-up of its health system</strong>, widely considered to be one of the best in the world, yet exposed by the pandemic. President Macron had already promised to overhaul the \u201csalaries, careers, speciality training and professional situation\u201d of staff, and to invest and reform financing of the health system.</li> \n   <li><strong>The arrival in Bangladesh of possibly the most powerful cyclone in more than a decade complicated coronavirus containment measures</strong>. Authorities were attempting to move 2.2 million people to safety as Cyclone Amphan made landfall on Wednesday morning, after days brewing in the Bay of Bengal.</li> \n   <li><strong>Amnesty International has urged governments to conduct urgent search operations to find as many as 1,000 Rohingya refugees</strong> who are stranded at sea and at risk of being hit by the cyclone. Rights groups said governments were using the pandemic as an excuse to turn away boats carrying stranded refugees, who may have been at sea for months.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Trump administration called on the UN to remove references to sexual health from its Covid-19 humanitarian response plan</strong>. In a letter to the UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the acting administrator for the US agency for international development, John Barsa, urged the UN to \u201cstay focused on life-saving interventions\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The US president, Donald Trump, lashed out at Beijing, blaming it for \u201cmass worldwide killing\u201d</strong>. Trump referred to an unidentified \u201cwacko in China\u201d, in the latest in a series of attacks aimed at the country that he appears to be trying to frame as the centrepiece of his reelection bid.</li> \n   <li><strong>Oxfam International is to lay off almost 1,500 staff and close operations in 18 countries</strong> \u2013 including Afghanistan where it has worked for 50 years \u2013 after it emerged that the global aid organisation had been bleeding cash during the coronavirus crisis. The NGO has seen its funding model hit by an accumulation of crises.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div>",
  "<p>The US has declared its intention to leave the Open Skies Treaty, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/05/trump-administration-treaty-war-russia-withdraw\">intended to reduce the risk of war</a> by allowing Russia and western nations to conduct observation flights over each other\u2019s territory.</p> <p>Washington informed the other 33 parties to the treaty of its intention to deliver a formal six-month notice of withdrawal on Friday, accusing Russia of violations.</p> <p>\u201cI think we have a very good relationship with Russia, but Russia didn\u2019t adhere to the treaty, and so until they adhere to the treaty, we will pull out,\u201d Donald Trump told reporters. He added: \u201cThere\u2019s a very good chance we\u2019ll make a new agreement or do something to put that agreement back together.\u201d</p> <p>In a written statement, the secretary of state Mike Pompeo said the US could reconsider its withdrawal during the six month notice period \u201cshould Russia return to full compliance with the Treaty\u201d. Moscow denies being in violation of the agreement.</p> <p>By starting the six-month notice period now, the administration ensures that - even if Donald Trump loses the election in November \u2013 the US will have left the treaty before a Biden administration takes office.</p> <p>\u201cThe timing of the Trump administration\u2019s decision to withdraw is clearly tied to the political calendar,\u201d said Bob Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cBy rushing this abrupt withdrawal, it is clear the Trump Administration is attempting to bind a future administration from participation in this longstanding and valuable treaty for our nation.\u201d</p> <p>America\u2019s European allies are keen to keep the treaty going. They have benefited from the more than 1,500 overflights carried out under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/05/trump-administration-treaty-war-russia-withdraw\">the OST</a>, allowing them to observe Russian military movements, and see it as a remaining element of international cohesion and transparency.</p> <p>\u201cThe writing has been on the wall for a long time,\u201d a European diplomat said, adding it was \u201cstill disappointing\u201d.</p> <p>The OST is the third arms control agreement Trump has left. He took the US out of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/08/iran-deal-trump-withdraw-us-latest-news-nuclear-agreement\">Iran nuclear deal in 2018</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/01/inf-donald-trump-confirms-us-withdrawal-nuclear-treaty\">Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces</a> treaty in 2019. There are fears for the future of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/01/us-senate-pushes-trump-to-safeguard-last-russian-nuclear-arms-control-treaty\">the last treaty limiting US and Russian strategic nuclear weapons</a>, New Start, which is due to expire in February next year, and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which the US has signed (observing a voluntary moratorium on nuclear tests) but not ratified.</p> <p>It is unclear how Russia will respond to US withdrawal. They will now be able to fly over US bases in Europe but the US will no longer be allowed to overfly Russia.</p> <p>Under the 2020 defence spending act, the administration is supposed to explain to Congress how leaving OST serves US security interests and give assurances that Washington has consulted its partners, 120 days before serving formal notice of withdrawal.</p> <p>\u201cReckless deal wrecking and the collapse of US leadership continues,\u201d Kingston Reif, director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association said.</p> <p>\u201cThe treaty benefits US and European security. Our allies value it and don\u2019t want us to leave. It has been an important tool for responding to Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine. This is a propaganda coup for Moscow.\u201d</p> <p>The US has complained about curbs that Moscow has imposed on overflights that have violated the accord. Russia limited the flight time of observation flights over the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad and set up an exclusion corridor along the border of the Russian-occupied regions of Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/europe-must-prepare-for-us-exit-from-vital-russia-treaty-former-nato-generals-warn\">Europe must prepare for US exit from vital Russia treaty, former Nato generals warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cRealize the Russians were cheating,\u201d Tim Morrison, who was briefly the top arms control official in the Trump White House, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tim_Morrison/status/1263512735385600004\">said on Twitter</a>. \u201cThey were misusing the treaty against the US \u2013 as senior military and civilian leaders warned.

The territory has long had a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework, but legal observers and human rights activists fear legislative change within China will undermine Hong Kong\u2019s legal framework. \u201cThe obvious worry is that in China, we have seen \u2018national security\u2019 \u2026 being used as an excuse for all sorts of human rights abuses, including the arbitrary arrest and imprisonment of dissidents,\u201d said Hong Kong barrister Wilson Leung.

  "<p>Nicola Sturgeon has announced people in Scotland will be allowed to meet friends outdoors, sunbathe and start shopping at garden centres from 28 May as she unveiled the slow easing of the lockdown.</p> \n<p>The first minister told MSPs she wanted to see a suitably cautious lifting of some lockdown restrictions from next Thursday mirroring the relaxations already announced in other parts of the UK.</p> \n<p>Sturgeon confirmed outdoor sports such as tennis and golf could restart next week and people could visit nearby parks and beauty spots. Outdoor cafes, recycling centres and drive-through restaurants will also be permitted to reopen as part of the four-step plan she outlined for easing the lockdown.</p> \n<p>She said all Scotland\u2019s schools would reopen from 11 August with a \u201cblended model\u201d of part-time teaching in school and at home, with teachers going back to school from June to start preparing their classrooms.</p> \n<p>From June, children moving from primary school to secondary school this summer would also be given help with the transition to secondary school. </p> \n<p>She added, however, that tight restrictions on allowing relatives and friends to gather at funerals, and the ban on bars and hairdressers from reopening, would not be relaxed for at least three weeks.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe steps we will take are by necessity gradual and incremental \u2013 and they must also be matched with rigorous, ongoing monitoring of the virus,\u201d Sturgeon told the Scottish parliament.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is no completely risk-free way of lifting lockdown. But we must mitigate the risks as much as possible. And we must not at any stage act rashly or recklessly. [If] we move too quickly or without proper care, it could run out of control again very quickly.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"77142d5a-0bf3-4a80-b538-c47a11b57f6a\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.</p>\n    <p>The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.</p>\n    <p>The WHO says masks should be made of three layers \u2013 with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.</p>\n    <p>The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>She warned that the lockdown could be reimposed if the virus returned, and urged people in Scotland to continue observing all existing restrictions until the first relaxation began next Thursday.</p> \n<p>Scotland is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/10/sturgeon-reveals-irritation-over-uk-lockdown-messaging\">last of the four parts of the UK</a> to publish specific plans on easing the lockdown; the prime minister, Boris Johnson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/10/boris-johnson-coronavirus-lockdown-shops-schools-june-reopening\">did so on 10 May,</a> with Wales and Northern Ireland already allowing outdoor sports, recycling centres and garden centres to restart.</p> \n<p>The latest Scottish data on deaths in hospitals, intensive care cases and hospital admissions confirmed the gradual decline in the severity of the outbreak. While the number of deaths with confirmed Covid-19 climbed by 37 to 2,221, the number in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 fell by 125 to 1,318.</p> \n<p>Sturgeon added that:</p> \n<p>\u2022 Non-essential indoor shops, pubs and restaurants must remain closed for at least three weeks, with no date yet set for their reopening.</p> \n<p>\u2022 The building trade would be allowed to slowly resume construction.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Childminders could slowly resume work from next week, and all nurseries would resume slowly this summer.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Universities in Scotland would reopen in September by combining remote learning with limited on-campus tuition.</p> \n<p>Opposition parties broadly welcomed the phased approach but Jackson Carlaw, the Scottish Tory leader, said Sturgeon\u2019s statement raised a series of questions about how it would work in practice. \u201cScotland is already on the move,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He urged Sturgeon to publish sector by sector plans and the clearest possible instructions on what was allowed. As the changes became more nuanced \u201cso the need for clarity will be more urgent than ever\u201d, he said.</p> \n<p>Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, urged Sturgeon to publish all the evidence and advice she was using to make the decisions, to introduce an emergency plan for care homes, and maximise the test, trace and isolate programme she promised would start in late May.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Alison Johnstone, the co-leader of the Scottish Greens, said the Scottish government should have introduced a mass test, trace and isolate programme at an earlier stage. Many people were already ignoring the lockdown advice. The police were called to disperse crowds of sunbathers at Portobello beach in Edinburgh on Wednesday, she said.</p> \n<p>Downing Street claimed Scotland\u2019s announcement was a vindication of Johnson\u2019s plan for lifting the lockdown \u2013 despite clashes over the prime minister\u2019s abandonment of the \u201cstay at home\u201d slogan.</p> \n<p>The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cWe welcome today\u2019s announcement as it shows the UK-wide approach is working. We set out the roadmap a few weeks ago and now the devolved administrations are following that path at the right speed for them.\u201d </p>",

  "<p>Britain and the US are facing calls to take some form of economic reprisal after China signalled that it was taking major steps to restrict civil liberties in Hong Kong <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/china-proposes-controversial-national-security-law-for-hong-kong\">by pushing through national security laws</a>.</p> \n<p>In an early sign of the British reaction, Lord Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong and a passionate critic of Chinese regime, called the move a \u201ccomprehensive assault on the city\u2019s autonomy, rule of law, and fundamental freedoms\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/china-proposes-controversial-national-security-law-for-hong-kong\">'This is the end of Hong Kong': China pushes controversial security laws</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He has recently written to the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, seeking assurances that the UK will not allow the Sino-British joint declaration to be torn up. The declaration, signed in 1985, made clear that Hong Kong\u2019s high degree of autonomy, rights and freedoms would remain unchanged for 50 years.</p> \n<p>In the US, Senator Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, condemned Beijing\u2019s plans, accusing the Communist party of \u201ctrying to kill Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy\u201d and promising action if Beijing goes ahead.</p> \n<p>\u201cBeijing\u2019s current proposal will effectively destroy the rule of law in Hong Kong and will give Chairman Xi\u2019s thugs legal cover to treat freedom-loving protesters as terrorists,\u201d Sasse said in a statement.</p> \n<p>The chair of the House foreign affairs committee, Michael McCaul, warned: \u201cAny law passed by the CCP that further stifles the freedom of the people of Hong Kong would only further erode the foundations of One Country, Two Systems, and will not be tolerated by the United States.\u201d</p> \n<p>Donald Trump has been piling new trade restrictions on China in recent weeks, partly in response to the Chinese handling of the coronavirus outbreak. But Republican Senators called for Trump in the specific case of Hong Kong to change the former UK colony\u2019s preferential trading status. A US government determination of the special administrative region\u2019s \u201cautonomy\u201d is a precondition for continued US preferential trade and investment terms distinct from those applied to China. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, has already said it will be difficult to declare the region autonomous in view of recent arrests of protesters.</p> \n<p>The US president seems determined to make the threat posed by the Chinese Communist party the defining issue in the campaign for November\u2019s presidential election, so may need little encouragement to impose new economic tariffs. Steve Bannon, his onetime political aide, said Trump\u2019s three election themes will be China, China, and China.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, Trump told reporters at the White House that \u201cnobody knows yet\u201d the details of China\u2019s plan. \u201cIf it happens, we\u2019ll address that issue very strongly,\u201d Trump said, without elaborating.</p> \n<p>Given the long history of bipartisan scepticism towards China in Washington, Democrats are unlikely to oppose any measures. Indeed, pro-democracy legislators in Hong Kong such as Claudia Mo are already expecting Trump to respond to China\u2019s actions. \u201cChina\u2019s move might just be considered savage by outsiders, and there could be a huge political price to pay internationally,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it worth it?\u201d</p> \n<p>The UK government, by contrast, has been involved in a balancing act.</p> \n<p>Tighter UK takeover laws are due to be published soon, but the UK Treasury does not believe decoupling between the west and China is in anyone\u2019s interest. The UK is also the No 1 foreign direct investment site for China in Europe, even if trade between Germany and China dwarfs that of the UK.</p> \n<p>Politically, the UK does not want to jettison China. Lord Hague, a former Conservative foreign secretary, said this month that there was no major challenge facing the world that could be solved without the cooperation of China. That applies especially to UN climate change talks, a process in which the UK has the diplomatic lead.</p> \n<p>The UK intelligence agencies have also made the judgment that Chinese-owned Huawei firm could be at the heart of the UK\u2019s new 5G network, without compromising national security, a decision that has led to heated phone calls between Trump and Boris Johnson.</p> \n<p>But the pressure to change tack is growing. Tom Tugendhat, chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said this week UK relations with China had reached \u201ca turning point\u201d. He argued: \u201cThe UK has a special duty to respond since China is now directly and incrementally challenging the international rules-based system.\u201d</p> \n<p>The UK, he said, was dealing with a very different China from the China of 2010. \u201cUp until a decade ago, we saw that increased wealth led to increased democratisation. Well, that is not so any more.\u201d</p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s Asia spokesman, Stephen Kinnock, has also adopted a more active and assertive position.<br><br>But the perennial question is what in practical terms can the UK do to resist a takeover in Hong Kong, apart from express outrage. Extending the British National Overseas Passport offer to Hong Kong citizens is the normal demand.</p> \n<p>In a muted letter to the foreign affairs select committee, Raab said: \u201cIf there is any attempt to include national security legislation before wider concerns with rights and freedoms in Hong Kong has been addressed satisfactorily, it could further unsettle the situation.\u201d</p> \n<p>The UK Foreign Office said: \u201cWe are following reports and monitoring the situation closely. We expect China to respect Hong Kong\u2019s rights and freedoms and high degree of autonomy. As a party to the joint declaration, the UK is committed to upholding Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and respecting the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 model.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>China plans to push through sweeping national security laws for Hong Kong at its annual meeting of parliament, in a move that critics say will effectively end the territory\u2019s autonomy.</p> \n<p>Beijing has been making it clear it wants new security legislation passed since huge pro-democracy protests last year plunged Hong Kong into its deepest turmoil since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.</p> \n<p>\u201cNational security is the bedrock underpinning the stability of the country,\u201d said Zhang Yesui, spokesman for the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC), the annual meeting of parliament that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/china-prepares-to-stage-annual-congress-and-pretence-of-business-as-usual\">kicks off its full session on Friday</a>.</p> \n<p>Zhang announced that delegates at the NPC \u2013 a largely rubber-stamping exercise \u2013 would \u201cestablish and improve a legal framework and mechanism for safeguarding national security\u201d in Hong Kong.</p> \n<p>Condemnation of the proposal was swift, amid fears it could erase the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework that is supposed to grant the territory a high degree of autonomy.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is the end of Hong Kong,\u201d said pro-democracy Hong Kong legislator Dennis Kwok. \u201cBeijing, the Central People\u2019s Government, has completely breached its promise to the Hong Kong people ...

  "<p>Beijing\u2019s parliament has announced that it will discuss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/china-proposes-controversial-national-security-law-for-hong-kong\">controversial national security laws</a> for Hong Kong in a dramatic escalation of China\u2019s efforts to place the semi-autonomous territory under its control and curtail pro-democracy protests.</p> <h2><strong>What are the national security laws?</strong></h2> <p>Article 23 of Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution, the Basic Law, says the city must enact national security laws to prohibit \u201ctreason, secession, sedition [and] subversion\u201d against the Chinese government.</p> <p>But the clause has never been implemented because of deeply held public fears that it would curtail Hong Kong\u2019s cherished rights, such as freedom of expression. An attempt to enact article 23 in 2003 was shelved after half a million people took to the streets in protest. </p> <h2><strong>Why are the laws back on the agenda?</strong></h2> <p>The possibility that the shelved laws would be revived increased as the city descended into mass protests and crackdowns last year. During the past few months, while much of the world has been distracted by the coronavirus pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/the-stakes-are-higher-hong-kongs-battle-lines-redrawn-for-post-covid-protests\">Beijing appears to have hardened its position</a> towards Hong Kong.</p> <p>In April, Beijing\u2019s top official in the territory, the head of China\u2019s liaison office in Hong Kong, Luo Huining, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/china-official-hong-kong-luo-huining-pushes-national-security-law\">called for Hong Kong </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/china-official-hong-kong-luo-huining-pushes-national-security-law\">urgently to pass the laws</a> to combat radical violence, foreign interference and pro-independence forces.</p> <p>Beijing\u2019s offices in the territory have also declared that Basic Law articles barring Chinese departments from interference in Hong Kong do not apply to them.</p> <p>The protests that racked the city last year dissipated during the pandemic, but now that Hong Kong is coming out of lockdown, they have restarted. The government is adamant that the protest movement must be stopped to save Hong Kong\u2019s reputation, society and economy.</p> <p>Beijing may also be looking ahead to Hong Kong\u2019s elections for the legislative council in September. After months of protests, and a very successful run at district council elections last year, pro-democracy candidates could win a majority. They have vowed to block bills put forward by the government.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/the-stakes-are-higher-hong-kongs-battle-lines-redrawn-for-post-covid-protests\">'The stakes are higher': Hong Kong's battle lines redrawn for post-Covid protests</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Why are they so controversial?</strong></h2> <p>Hong Kong, which operates under the one-country, two-systems framework, has enjoyed liberties not available in mainland China such as an independent, free press and the ability to demonstrate. It has long been a safe haven for critics of the Chinese government. Such critics fear the laws will be used against anyone objecting to the central government or the Beijing-backed Hong Kong government.</p> <p>They are especially worried that the law would apply to those who have been protesting during the past year, in some cases burning the Chinese flag or defacing the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong. Chinese authorities have routinely described the protesters as \u201cterrorists\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cGiven how Beijing conceptualises \u2018national security\u2019 as any act or speech that criticises the party, a law that protects national security is likely to mean an end to Hong Kong as we know it,\u201d said Maya Wang, China researcher for Human Rights Watch. \u201cMost importantly, we will lose a safe harbour for dissent on Chinese soil, at a time when the world needs a place that keeps speaking truth to an increasingly powerful China.\u201d</p> <p>Last month Martin Lee, a pro-democracy veteran, politician and barrister who helped draft the Basic Law, said Hong Kong was required to legislate the national security laws. However, he now objected to it because the governments had failed to fulfil their obligations to introduce universal suffrage in the territory.</p> <h2>What comes next?</h2> <p>The laws could technically be implemented by promulgation \u2013 essentially a decree \u2013 although analysts said this would be an unprecedented act of provocation. Instead they would probably first be sent through Hong Kong\u2019s legislative council, in the same way that an (also controversial) national anthem law is heading towards its second reading. </p> <p>Pro-democracy legislators strongly dispute the legality of Beijing imposing the laws. Protests against Beijing\u2019s intervention were quickly called on Thursday. Whether they take off remains to be seen, but much of Hong Kong is deeply angry.</p>",

  "<p>For what feels like ages, comic-book fans have been clamouring for the \u201cSnyder cut\u201d of Justice League: the version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/15/justice-league-ben-affleck-dc-comics\">the 2017 film</a> intended to be released before director Zack Snyder had to leave the project due to a personal tragedy \u2013 and before Warner Bros realised that not everyone wanted to spend four hours subjecting themselves to the cinematic equivalent of an emo haircut.</p> <p>Now it\u2019s happening. After Joss Whedon\u2019s forgettably piecemeal version of Justice League came and went to utter silence, HBO Max has granted Snyder between $20-$30m to finish his film the way he intended. </p> <p>What an opportunity this is. The release of the Snyder cut, in 2021, effectively gives directors the opportunity to be their true selves \u2013 releasing a commercial version of their film theatrically while serving up a dish of pure id designed solely to appeal to a hardcore of obsessive fans on a streaming site. With that in mind, here\u2019s a list of films that should be given this treatment next.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21bfb3b6403c7b42352cca022ddb4910658ece62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21bfb3b6403c7b42352cca022ddb4910658ece62/0_8_3036_1822/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fiery \u2026 Chris Evans in Fantastic Four.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fiery \u2026 Chris Evans in Fantastic Four.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Fantastic Four</h2> <p>Much like Justice League, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/09/fantastic-four-marvel-superhero-film-review\">Josh Trank\u2019s dark update of Fantastic Four</a> felt like watching the indiscriminate dilution of a creative vision. Trank claimed on Twitter: \u201cA year ago I had a fantastic version of this. And it would\u2019ve received great reviews.\u201d Now is the time to see that vision through to completion. A Cronenberg-style body horror, shot with a deadening lack of wit, where everyone staggers through their own personal hell-cycle of grief and the Human Torch ends up addicted to heroin.</p> <h2>Knight of Cups</h2> <p>Some have said that 2015\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/08/knight-of-cups-review-terrence-malick-christian-bale\">Knight of Cups</a> marked the nadir of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/terrence-malick\">Terrence Malick</a>\u2019s freeform, quasi-meditative film-making style. But some might say it wasn\u2019t freeform or quasi-meditative enough. According to actor Thomas Lennon, his minute-long appearance in the film was the result of 11 hours of continuous shooting on multiple cameras. There might be a version of this out there that\u2019s four or five days long! Surely Netflix would jump at that.</p> <h2>Transformers 4</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/12/every-michael-bay-film-ranked\">Michael Bay</a>\u2019s film-making style is so chaotic and incomprehensible that it borders on arthouse. Let\u2019s allow him to lean into that tendency with a version of his most mindless film. Let\u2019s just make it a nonstop, full-volume collage of shapes and noises and explosions and cleavages that never changes in rhythm or tone, slowly hypnotising its audience into a completely blank fugue state. It could be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/apr/11/morley-lou-reed-metal-machine\">Metal Music Machine</a> of film-making. Or it could be indistinguishable from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/10/transformers-age-of-extinction-review-michael-bay\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/10/transformers-age-of-extinction-review-michael-bay\">film that was released into cinemas</a>.

But ask yourself this: is there a scene where a little boy soils his underwear, then places his soiled underwear on his head and marches around in circles singing I\u2019m a Little Teapot? No there is, and it is an opportunity wasted. Hopefully a rerelease on, say, Quibi, will remedy this.</p> <h2>The Irishman</h2> <p>My one complaint about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/13/the-irishman-review-martin-scorseses-finest-film-for-30-years\">The Irishman</a> is that it wasn\u2019t long enough.

  "<p>The Indian city of Kolkata has been left devastated by the worst cyclone it has seen in 100 years, which swept through India and Bangladesh on Wednesday and killed at least 84 people.</p> <p>Kolkata, home to almost 15 million people, bore the brunt of Cyclone Amphan, which tore roofs off buildings, smashed windows, pulled down trees and pylons and overturned cars.</p> <p>Most of the fatalities were caused by falling trees or electrocution.

Another episode devotes a lengthy segment to Pippen\u2019s infamous decision to not re-enter Game 3 of Chicago\u2019s 1994 Eastern Conference semi-final series against the New York Knicks for the final 1.8 seconds because Toni Kukoc was given the final shot over him.</p> <p>\u201c[Pippen] felt like up until the last few minutes of Game 6 against the Jazz [in the 1998 NBA finals, during the series\u2019 last episode], it was just \u2018bash Scottie, bash Scottie, bash Scottie,\u2019\u201d Kaplan said.</p> <p>Pippen\u2019s reported discontent came one day after Horace Grant, the starting power forward on the Bulls\u2019 first three championship teams, said the documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/19/horace-grant-michael-jordan-the-last-dance-documentary-espn\">was edited to make Jordan look better</a>. </p> <p>\u201cI would say [the documentary was] entertaining, but we know, who was there as teammates, that about 90% of it [was] BS in terms of the realness of it,\u201d Grant said in an interview on ESPN 1000\u2019s Kap and Co radio show on Tuesday. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t real \u2013 because a lot of things [Jordan] said to some of his teammates, that his teammates went back at him. But all of that was kind of edited out of the documentary, if you want to call it a documentary.\u201d</p> <p>Jordan is depicted as a man ruthlessly devoted to winning in The Last Dance, even if it comes at the expense of his personal popularity. Grant, who was with the Bulls for seven years, said Jordan sometimes went too far.</p> <p>\u201cHe felt that he could dominate me, but that was sadly mistaken,\u201d Grant said. \u201cBecause whenever he went at me, I went at him right back. But in terms of Will Perdue, Steve Kerr and the young man, Scott Burrell, that was heartbreaking [to watch]. To see a guy, a leader, to go at those guys like that. I understand in terms of practicing, you have a push and shove here and there, but outright punching [teammates] and things of that nature. And calling them the B\u2019s and the H\u2019s, that wasn\u2019t called for.\u201d</p> <p>In May, ESPN\u2019s Jackie McMullan hinted at Pippen\u2019s disappointment with the production, saying: \u201cThose close to him say he\u2019s wounded and disappointed by his portrayal.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Restaurants and bars around the world are starting to reopen, often at just 50% capacity. But how do you make a half-empty bar look buzzing? And how can owners ensure that diners stay a safe distance from one another? Here are five creative answers to the problem of socialising while social distancing.</p> <h2>Mannequins</h2> <p>Some enterprising owners are using mannequins to get bums on seats. The idea started in the US, where the three-Michelin-starred Inn at Little Washington in Virginia is working with a local design company and a theatre to create <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/14/virgina-restaurant-solves-social-distancing-dilemma-mannequins\">elegantly dressed \u201cdining mannequins\u201d</a> to fill the spaces between real-life guests.

The idea has since spread to Europe. In Austria, several Viennese bars and cafes have installed mannequins, including historic<a href=\"https://www.cafecentral.wien/en/\"> Caf\u00e9 Central</a> and cocktail bar <a href=\"https://www.kleinod-prunkstueck.wien/\">Kleinod Prunkst\u00fcck</a>.

  "<p>A group of retired doctors who set up the UK\u2019s first Covid-19 contact-tracing scheme has warned that the government system faces major challenges after they struggled to persuade health and care workers to self-isolate.</p> \n<p>Dr Bing Jones, a retired Sheffield GP, helped start the group a month ago out of frustration that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/uk-to-start-coronavirus-contact-tracing-again\">contact tracing had been abandoned</a> in England. \u201cWe sat down and thought: this is a major omission \u2013 a schoolboy error. We have got one of the biggest crises you can possibly imagine and one of the major building blocks of the public health management of an epidemic is not being done,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>They were surprised to find that most contacts of people with Covid-19 were workers from the NHS, care homes or care provider agencies \u2013 and that those people were not always happy to stop work and go into isolation for seven to 14 days. \u201cThe majority were in health and care settings. That\u2019s the really big and worrying message here,\u201d said Jones.</p> \n<p>The group set up <a href=\"https://www.communitycontacttracers.com/\">its pilot project in Sheffield</a>, using volunteers who called up people with Covid-19 referred to them by GPs. The volunteers offered support and asked for the names and numbers of anyone the patient had spent more than 15 minutes with in an enclosed space.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Their early report of what happened \u2013 with 13 people who had Covid-19 and 58 of their contacts \u2013 paints a worrying picture. People were unwilling to let them have details or the volunteers were unable to reach 39 of the 58. In 29 cases, those were care workers.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou talk to somebody and they will sometimes give you the names of their fellow cleaners or kitchen staff in a care home, but as soon as they start talking to each other they think, well we\u2019d better talk to our manager, and the manager says oh no \u2013 you\u2019d better not do this,\u201d said Jones.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd the fact is that in all of these care settings but also in the NHS, there is no culture for contact tracing. There\u2019s also no culture of self-isolation.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe emotional side of this is me listening to our volunteers every night saying: \u2018I have got all this information, I\u2019ve tried to get in touch with the helper at the care home and then the shutters come down. I got in touch with the trust \u2013 the teaching hospital trust \u2013 and bang, the shutters come down.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cWe\u2019re talking here about a major problem and a major deficiency particularly around health and care workers. My analogy is that health and care workers are unwittingly acting as the vectors of this \u2026 spread.\u201d</p> \n<p>The group\u2019s volunteers had the authority of GP practices and a well-respected community development organisation yet were unable to convince people to self-isolate. Jones thinks the government scheme \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/20/boris-johnson-pledges-england-wide-coronavirus-tracing-by-1-june\">due to be up and running by 1 June</a> staffed by 25,000 contact tracers, most of them call handlers with a script and minimal training \u2013 will fare no better.</p> \n<p>\u201cI feel sad to have to say this but the whole way that this is unfolding \u2013 I have no confidence in the government. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-app-could-be-ditched-for-different-model-after-trials\">The app has failed</a>, they\u2019ve failed in their testing, on their PPE. I wouldn\u2019t put any money on their sorting out this contact tracing,\u201d Jones said.</p> \n<p>The spreading of infection through health and care workers was predictable, he said, and identified in a study in the town of Vo\u2019 in Italy.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/eradicated-coronavirus-mass-testing-covid-19-italy-vo\">In one Italian town, we showed mass testing could eradicate the coronavirus | Andrea Crisanti and Antonio Cassone</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He said: \u201cWhy does it take a group of retired doctors to come up with this? It is fatuous that people haven\u2019t twigged that in the care home setting it is quite obvious \u2013 there is very little expertise, very little money, no reserve of staffing, so it\u2019s inevitable that people will be moving around within and between care homes. A lot of care homes are run by big firms and what else are they to do?\u201d</p> \n<p>In an ideal world, contact tracing would be done by environmental health workers, as for previous outbreaks of infectious diseases, he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you had meningococcal meningitis, a sexually transmitted disease, TB\u2026 that\u2019s the established system. You would be backed up by the law, by the environmental health officers who have absolute authority, but also you would have the incentive to comply because if your child had meningitis, they would get antibiotics and get better.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhereas here, everything is reversed \u2013 there\u2019s no real incentive to self-isolate, particularly as everybody\u2019s keenness wears off...

  "<p>The Home Office has launched an initiative to deport migrants who cross the Channel from France to the UK in small boats, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>The initiative, known as Operation Sillath, is thought to be in response to rising numbers of people arriving in boats from France.

The previous daily record was 102 in February 2020. There were 297 boat crossings by migrants in 2018, 1,890 last year and at least 1,040 so far this year.</p> <p>Under current legislation known as the Dublin convention one EU country can send an asylum seeker back to another if there is evidence that they were fingerprinted, claimed asylum or spent time in the first EU country before arriving in the second.</p> <p>However, human rights lawyers and campaigners say that they have gathered evidence that under Operation Sillath migrants are already being returned swiftly to France before their asylum claims have been properly considered, and even if there is no evidence of these things happening in France, in breach of the convention.</p> <p> Lily Parrott, a lawyer at Duncan Lewis solicitors, who is working on a legal challenge about Operation Sillath and the return of asylum seekers to France who arrive in small boats, said: \u201cWe are increasingly concerned about a trend that we have seen where the Home Office seeks to remove people from the UK to France after they arrived to the UK by boat. We feel that this is being done illegally and on the basis of a conflation between the Dublin convention and a UK-France treaty about border management.</p> <p>\u201cThis would be an egregious breach of European law that allowed many asylum-seekers to be wrongly removed from the UK.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this month the home secretary, Priti Patel, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/05/06/priti-patel-seeks-french-backing-plan-return-channel-migrants/\">urged her French counterparts</a> to back a new crackdown to enable the UK to return Channel migrants to France even if they have been found in British waters.</p> <p>A Home Office freedom of information response in March 2020 seen by the Guardian stated that last year (2019) 21 people were removed to France under the disputed clause of the Dublin convention.</p> <p>A further freedom of information response from the Home Office refers to Operation Sillath but declines to provide information about the operation on the basis that it would be too costly.</p> <p>An immigration detention centre visitor group has also raised concerns about the practice of returning people to France. The organisation sends visitors to people in the detention centres where some of the migrants have been detained.</p> <p>They expressed concern about \u201can alarming trend\u201d to attempt to remove asylum seekers from the UK to France even though their fingerprints had not been found in the European-wide database known as Eurodac and there was no clear evidence they spent any significant amount of time in France or claimed asylum there. They said that out of nine such cases they worked with recently at least two were possible victims of trafficking and three were possible victims of torture. One was removed to France by the Home Office where he was subjected to torture and abuse by migrant smugglers.</p> <p>Clare Moseley, founder of the charity <a href=\"https://care4calais.org/\">Care4Calais,</a> said that people crossing on boats had fled some of the most dangerous countries in the world.</p> <p>\u201cWhen they turn to us for help we simply must treat them fairly and properly. I know a man who was sent back to France in error and then was finally and correctly given UK asylum thanks to the excellent work of his lawyers. Being aware of his suffering I find it deeply shocking to think a different outcome was possible and may well have happened to others in the same position.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cNo one should be making these dangerous and illegally-facilitated crossings from France to the UK. France is a safe country and no one should be getting on these boats and putting themselves in danger. We are working closely with the French government to tackle this dangerous and illegal activity, including returning over 155 migrants back to European countries.\u201d</p> <p>The French embassy has been approached for comment.</p>",
  "<p>The worst thing about getting cancer, as many of us who\u2019ve had it will confirm, is the unbearable wait to find out whether you\u2019ve got it.</p> <p>Being told your tumour is malignant is a life-changing moment: but it does at least deliver certainty, and once you have certainty you can move on to a plan. Or at least, you could when I had it. In these coronavirus days, as is increasingly clear from cancer charities such as the Institute of Cancer Research and Breast Cancer Now, it leads not to a plan, but to a new series of agonising unknowns.</p> <p>Is it safe to have the operation you need, given the risks of coronavirus? Are the clinics you need to attend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/coronavirus-crisis-is-stopping-vital-cancer-care-doctors-say\">still open</a>? Do the risks of getting coronavirus outweigh the benefits of going ahead with a course of chemotherapy?</p> <p>And this continued uncertainty will have an impact. Prof Clare Turnbull of the Royal Marsden Hospital, where I was treated, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/20/thousands-of-cancer-patients-could-die-early-due-to-coronavirus-delays-study-finds\">said this week</a> that a proportion of people diagnosed with cancer whose treatment is delayed will move from the \u201ccure\u201d to the \u201cnon cure\u201d category. In other words, they won\u2019t be in the situation I\u2019m now in, where they\u2019re cancer-free. They will have to go on at best living with cancer; at worst, they\u2019ll die from it.</p> <p>Just as important as the physical toll, though, is the psychological impact. Because, while only a proportion of cancer patients will have their lives shortened by coronavirus, <em>all</em> cancer patients will have their anxiety heightened because of the uncertainty; and that anxiety will impact their lives in the short term, making it harder to cope with having cancer, and potentially leave them with long lasting psychological scars.</p> <p>Within two days of being told I had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/16/doing-it-right-check-yourself-for-breast-cancer\">breast cancer</a> I was meeting doctors who could start to reassure me that there were many treatments available, that I had a range of options, that there were many lines of attack for the type of tumour I had, and that I had every reason to be hopeful.</p> <p>And while it was a long journey to being confident about my health again, looking back I can see that was a turning point. Waiting for the test results I was essentially on my own; now I was surrounded by people who would not only support me but, all importantly, offer me a roadmap through it. It was the first glimmer of hope that I might, possibly, still have a future.</p> <p>I remember my surgeon saying to me, at one consultation, that if I gave her my life for the next few months, she would give me back my lifetime. But she was only able to make me that offer because she had operating theatres and nurses and hospital beds and pathology labs and chemotherapy and radiotherapy clinics running at full capacity. I wonder if she is able to say it as confidently to her patients today.</p> <p>So my heart goes out to those who right now are where I was six years ago. One of the things I realised, through my own experience, is how much cancer is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/27/mental-health-terminal-illness-nhs-psychological-needs\">psychological</a> as well as a physical journey. It takes the ground away from under your feet: nothing will ever be quite the same in your life from now on, and getting your head round that is a big part of getting through.</p> <p>These days, as we all know, treatments are getting better and better, and more people are moving on to live, as I do now, a life that\u2019s entirely cancer free. But part of the reason I can enjoy that life is that I wasn\u2019t left devastated psychologically by one of the most traumatic episodes I\u2019ve ever experienced. Counselling helped me; but what helped even more were those wonderful medics who came armed with action plans and treatment options. Their certainty that they could help me was the beginning of getting back to a life that is entirely healthy, not only physically but emotionally.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/20/coronavirus-mental-health-trauma\">Coronavirus affects mental health too \u2013 here's what we know | Anthony David</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Every single cancer patient deserves what I had: a confidently delivered strategy to take the necessary steps to restore health. </p> <p>That\u2019s why I believe cancer patients should be as centrestage right now as people with Covid-19.

  "<p>Air travellers will have to wear face masks throughout all stages of their journey, they could be assessed in interview booths if they show signs of Covid-19, and will need to say goodbye to loved ones outside the airport, according to guidelines issued by the EU\u2019s air safety body.</p> <p>Instructions issued to airports and airlines also include: restrictions on hand luggage, reserving an on-board toilet for cabin crew and no onboard duty free or food trolleys.</p> <p>The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) <a href=\"https://www.easa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/dfu/EASA-ECDC_COVID-19_Operational%20guidelines%20for%20management%20of%20passengers_final.pdf\">published 28-pages of guidelines</a> that will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/16/small-planes-and-no-business-class-will-flying-ever-be-the-same-again-covid-19\">radically alter the experience of flying</a>, including physical distancing measures that Heathrow\u2019s chief executive has previously said would be impossible to implement. The UK has had no role in shaping EASA policy since the official Brexit date of 31 January but remains a member until the end of the year.</p> <p>Airlines and airports are likely to adopt many of the guidelines, which cover every stage of the air travel process.</p> <h2><strong>Arrival and check-in</strong></h2> <p>Anyone who develops symptoms after booking, or has been in contact with someone suffering from Covid-19, should not turn up to the flight.</p> <p>Passengers should not expect a lingering goodbye with loved ones at the terminal. With few exceptions, nobody who is not travelling or working there will be allowed inside.</p> <p>Those travelling are expected to take precautions such as washing hands and wearing masks, with exceptions for children under six and people with a medical reason not to. Regular reminders will be broadcast through the public address system, alongside the usual security messages and flight information.</p> <p>EASA also recommends \u201crespiratory etiquette\u201d, such as covering the face when sneezing. Those who do not comply could be ejected from the airport and suffer further penalties from local authorities.</p> <p>Physical distancing is defined as 1.5m, rather than the 2 metre gap Britons have been told to maintain. As in many shops and offices, there will be floor markings to show people where to stand in queues.</p> <p>However, physical distancing is unlikely to be feasible in many airports and the EASA guidelines state that if the 1.5m rule is not possible, the airport should implement additional measures such as hand hygiene. John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow chief executive, said physical distancing at a boarding gate would mean a queue of 1km for a jumbo jet. </p> <p>EASA said airport operators should set up interview booths for people found to have a temperature of more than 38C to assess possible illness.</p> <p>However, it also admits that temperature screening is not considered particularly effective at spotting Covid-19 and is more intended to \u201cdissuade ill persons from travelling by air and enhance public confidence\u201d. Nonetheless, Heathrow airport last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/06/heathrow-to-carry-out-temperature-checks-on-passengers\">rolled out temperature screening</a>, using camera detection systems to monitor multiple people at a time for signs of fever.</p> <p>Airport staff will need to wear face masks and hand them out to passengers not sporting their own. Protective perspex barriers are also likely to become a feature of check-in desks and security areas, under the guidelines. Heathrow has said it is installing 600 hand sanitiser stations, putting up signage featuring government health advice and even looking at using UV light to sanitise surfaces.</p> <h2><strong>Security</strong></h2> <p>As with the terminal, physical distancing will not always be possible in the security area. All staff will be wearing masks but security employees performing body checks may also be wearing face shields. Security screening trays will be much more frequently disinfected. Heathrow is also testing contact free security screening equipment.</p> <h2><strong>Boarding and disembarking</strong></h2> <p>Hand luggage restrictions could be even stricter. EASA recommends cutting down on cabin bags to speed up boarding and reduce contamination risk. It recommends airlines incentivise customers to do this, so there may be discounts on hold luggage charges.</p> <p>Passengers should be spaced apart if possible while boarding and disembarking and where buses are used, more should be provided. There may be an automated disinfectant dispenser at the aircraft door and a mat soaked with disinfectant to walk on.</p> <h2><strong>On board</strong></h2> <p>The aircraft should be thoroughly disinfected between flights, so trays are likely to be less grubby at least. EASA has asked airlines to install better air filters to clean the air in the cabin but everyone, passengers and crew, will be expected to wear masks. EASA recommends discarding them after four hours, meaning several may be needed for long-haul flights.</p> <p>Airlines have toyed with the idea of blocking off the middle seat to keep passengers further apart but whether this is mandatory will depend on where you are flying. Europe and the US do not require it, but Malaysia and Indonesia do.</p> <p>Using the toilet will be more difficult, with airlines advised to reserve one for cabin crew and prevent passengers queuing in the aisles where possible.</p> <p>The short-haul airline easyJet says there will be no food service on board its planes, at least initially. EASA has recommended \u201creduced\u201d food and drink services and no duty free sales onboard.</p> <p>EASA recommends strict protocols if someone falls ill on board with Covid-19 symptoms. Two rows of seats in every direction should be cleared and anyone who was sitting in them could be interviewed by public health authorities when they land. Their travelling companions will also be isolated.</p> <p>The ill passenger should be given their own toilet and be seated at the back right, near the outflow valve through which dirty air is dumped. The air nozzle above their seat should be turned off to reduce droplet spread and only crew members who have already interacted with them should continue to do so. </p> <h2><strong>Arrival and baggage claim</strong></h2> <p>Thermal screening may be applied at the arrival airport and airlines should provide public health authorities with a \u201cpassenger locator card\u201d if requested for contact tracing purposes. This will give a passenger\u2019s name, allocated seat and phone number or email.</p> <p>Governments have been asked to simplify border control processes, such as by using facial recognition. Immigration halls may have to be redesigned to ease passenger flow and border control agents will be trained to spot signs of illness.</p> <p>After collecting baggage, passengers will be told to leave the airport as soon as possible. Meet and greet will not be allowed for the most part. Where it cannot be avoided, a special area will be set up away from other arrivals.</p>",

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/04/gini-index-is-a-poor-inequality-measure\">Gini coefficient</a> is measured between 0 and 100 \u2013 with 0 indicating that income is shared equally among all people and rising to 100 in extreme income inequality.<strong> </strong>The story was that the rich also took a beating in this long period of austerity imposed by successive Tory governments \u2013 and they didn\u2019t get richer.</p> <p>Now we have proof that this tale isn\u2019t true. <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/who-gains/\">Who gains?</a>, a report by the Resolution Foundation released on Thursday, with researchers from the LSE and Warwick University, has found missing billions in earnings of the hyper-rich, all disguised as capital gains \u2013 profits from selling an asset for more than it was worth when it was acquired. The share of earnings of the top 1% were far greater and grew far faster than previously disclosed.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/capital-gains-tax/rates\">Capital gains</a> are taxed at just 20%, unlike the 45% income tax rate for top earners. With a deft sleight of hand, wealthy individuals and business managers<strong> </strong>can take large amounts of their earnings in the form of shares or other assets to avoid it being taxed as income. Andy Summers of the London School of Economics says the line between the two taxes is \u201cvery blurred\u201d.</p> <p>The missing sum of money is enormous \u2013 the scale of the switch into capital gains vast. Taxable capital gains in the UK more than doubled between 2012-13 and 2017-18, jumping to \u00a355bn. The top 1% are far richer than we thought, while the earnings of the top 0.1% have grown 50% more from 1996 to 2018 than previously measured. \u201cA lot of capital gains are, in fact, just repackaged income going to the already-rich,\u201d says Summers.</p> <p>Who is gaining? Just 9,000 people, who made \u00a31m or more in such a manner, accounting for the majority of the UK\u2019s taxable capital gains. Adam Corlett, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation says these figures show \u201cthe top 1% account for \u00a31 of every \u00a36 of taxable income received.\u201d The new figures show the top 1% take a massive 16.8% share of national income. He adds, \u201cThat scale of inequality should be addressed in post-pandemic Britain.\u201d</p> <p>But will it be? When polled, people express indignation at the soaraway earnings and wealth of the hyper-rich, but that doesn\u2019t appear to swing elections in this perennially Conservative-voting nation.</p> <p>Inequality, at its <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality\">lowest in the late 1970s</a>, shot through the roof in Thatcher\u2019s 1980s, aided by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/09/big-bang-1986-city-deregulation-boom-bust\">big bang</a> in the City when deregulation blew the lid off top salaries, and the crushing of union power that strove to keep wages from falling behind in a high-inflation era.</p> <p>Since the mid 1980s, inequality has plateaued, staying at a shocking high despite Labour <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/feb/25/economy.uk\">raising lowest incomes</a>, lifting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jun/12/labours-effort-cut-child-poverty-exceptional\">a million children</a> and a million pensioners out of poverty. But at least, people were told, inequality wasn\u2019t actually getting any worse. Will it make a difference once people know that what they felt instinctively turns out to be true? Society is being stretched further and further apart across a growing social chasm.</p> <p>The grotesque facts of Britain\u2019s exceptionally high income inequality should have been enough without this new revelation. The <a href=\"http://highpaycentre.org/\">High Pay Centre</a> has clever ways to illuminate the way we live now: the average <a href=\"http://highpaycentre.org/blog/high-pay-day-2020-scope-for-fairer-pay-and-lower-inequality-remains-conside\">FTSE 100 CEO earns</a> more in three working days than the average employee in a year. The 1,000 people featured in the <a href=\"http://highpaycentre.org/blog/billionaires-and-poverty-should-not-coexist\">2019 Sunday Times Rich List</a> together earned \u00a3771bn: that\u2019s six times the <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/spending-english-nhs/\">cost of the NHS</a>.

Not even early nights, moderate drinking, good intentions, a clear head, a straight back, an ergonomic working situation, perfect lighting, a clean bill of health, no pre-existing conditions, no underlying causes, can save you from the critic\u2019s gnawing doubt. </p> <p>Further tyrannical routines and rituals lead us towards evening. It is a mystery how one ever finds oneself seated at the desk. Sometimes the words still refuse to surface; or offer themselves so unwillingly and in such hopeless disarray that the task they are meant to perform will never be completed. The situation unfolds in its predicable, time-honoured way. It didn\u2019t work last time so why should things be any different now? But you\u2019ve got to start somewhere, even from here.</p> <p>The broken-backed paragraphs lie around in disordered heaps. All those equivocations. All those ambiguities. The cloth-eared language and mind-numbing cliches leave me aghast. It is like looking at bad art, except art looks back at you and dares you. And how can you tell with art anyway? Dress it up right and any negative can be turned into a positive. Fine-tuned and finessed and cleverly de-skilled, the worst becomes the best, or something suspiciously like it. But bad writing is just bad writing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0720af1f2a4f48b5ace7a856ea4c58f1d4ff388e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0720af1f2a4f48b5ace7a856ea4c58f1d4ff388e/0_115_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018You can\u2019t check out before you check in\u2019 ...

But even the accomplishment of these self-imposed tasks still leaves me with the nagging suspicion that something, or rather someone, is holding me back. A shifty little back-seat homunculus who monitors my every move, an inner critic who stalks me, insinuating its own derisory little commentary in my ear and even shouting at me as I rush ahead, coat flapping, on the wet pavements. Flight impossible, inexorable the pursuit.

Who do you think you are? He\u2019s the monkey on my back, the author of my imposter syndrome and my anxiety.

Let\u2019s say I am now at the office door, key in one hand and the last half-cup of coffee in the other. I put the cup down on the step, so I can turn the key and lift the handle. Think about it too much and even this simple act can leave you with coffee down your shirt. What is needed is not so much mindfulness as mindlessness. To catch a fish you must think like a fish, to paraphrase <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Izaak-Walton\">Izaak Walton</a>.

It can happen at any time. It isn\u2019t even my voice, and certainly not my inner critic\u2019s. I know his wheedling tone. There are several of these voices, these visitors who come to me unbidden, and I submit to becoming their stenographer and amanuensis, no more than a secretary. Sometimes these are dangerous, infectious voices, depending on whom I have been reading. Other writer\u2019s rhythms and syntax and even their vocabulary can get to you. People talk about writers and artists and composers finding their voices, but they don\u2019t just come out of nowhere. They\u2019re in the ether, in everything you\u2019ve read and seen and heard. It is certainly not yours alone, this voice of yours, this trademarked imprimatur of the authentic self. There isn\u2019t one. Often it is the art itself that provides the voice, or at least the start of it \u2013 an inkling, a tone, a timbre, the pitch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/28/confessions-art-critic-adrian-searle-notebooks\">Confessions of an art critic: I can't believe the things I write in my notebooks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You wouldn\u2019t get all flowery <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/audio/2008/may/15/serra\">with Richard Serra</a>, would you, though it might be fun to try.

Builders were flown in from China to erect the barrier and they have worked at the site throughout the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>The work has continued even though Chinese diplomats did not apply for permission for the project through the normal planning procedures.</p> <p>In a letter to Martin McBurney, who lives across the road from the consulate, a Belfast city council official said the Chinese had the right to build the wall under the 1961 Vienna convention on diplomatic relations \u2013 the international act of law that grants immunity to diplomats in foreign countries.</p> <p>\u201cIn relation to your query regarding diplomatic immunity, the consulate has consistently asserted that their premises are inviolable by virtue of the fact that the premises have been designated as consulate premises by the secretary of state,\u201d the council letter states.</p> <p>On the possibility of the council or anyone else seeking to halt construction until a planning application from the Chinese consulate was accepted, the letter continued: \u201cThe consulate would claim diplomatic immunity in any subsequent court action rendering the court action pointless.

Even the trees in the street, he pointed out, were subject to conservation orders.</p> <p>\u201cThe council\u2019s excuse for not putting this project through the normal planning application process struck me as incredulous and I contacted the attorney general\u2019s office to establish if diplomatic immunity applies in this case,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In a letter from the office of the attorney general, John Larkin QC, Northern Ireland\u2019s most senior law officer said the Vienna convention \u201cdoes not exempt such premises from the requirements of domestic planning law\u201d.</p> <p>The office advised the city council that it was its duty \u201cto consider properly the full extent of its own powers and duties in this area\u201d.</p> <p>It noted that if the Chinese consulate refused to comply with any enforcement notice the Foreign and Commonwealth Office may have to intervene. \u201cThere is no bar in international or domestic law to an enforcement notice being issued against the consulate,\u201d it said.</p> <p>McBurney said the attorney general\u2019s response posed questions as to the real motive behind allowing the consulate to go ahead with construction before any planning application was approved.</p> <p>\u201cThe only reason I can think of is purely business. It is a question of being so desperate to bring in Chinese business investment that the council can ignore our concerns and the normal planning laws that apply to everybody else.\u201d</p> <p>The residents have been backed by the South Belfast SDLP councillor, Gary McKeown. He said: \u201cThe people of the area are at a loss as they watch construction work taking place with no planning permission, and nothing apparently being done to stop it.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a neighbourhood with a distinct historical character, which is subject to strict conservation rules \u2013 residents can often need permission to simply paint a gable wall or replace a window frame \u2013 which makes this issue all the more frustrating.\u201d</p> <p>A Belfast city council spokesperson said: \u201cThe works at the Chinese consulate are the subject of a current planning enforcement investigation which is ongoing. At this stage we cannot provide any further information as it could impact on the investigation, which is seeking to resolve the issues that have been raised to the council.\u201d</p> <p>However, McBurneysaid work continued at the site on Wednesday. \u201cThis work has been going on since February and it continues all through this week non-stop,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Chinese consul-general has been approached for comment.</p>",

One theory repeatedly voiced at the demonstrations is that a vaccination programme will be used as an opportunity to plant computer chips into the population, which will be used to control them.</p> <p>Physical distancing rules have also been referred to as \u201csocial Holocaust\u201d, affecting elderly members of society the most. </p> <p>Observers of the movement, which has been gathering momentum over the past month, have said it has in part sprung out of Germany\u2019s relative success in tackling the virus so far, a so-called \u201cprevention paradox\u201d, with a low death rate despite a high infection rate, compared to other countries.</p> <p>Last weekend several thousand people gathered at demonstrations in Berlin, Munich, Stuttgart, Cologne, Frankfurt and other towns and cities, and some have pledged to do so again his weekend.</p> <p>On Thursday Stuttgart authorities cited \u201cprotection against infection\u201d as the legal grounds on which it was banning a demonstration called by the far-right populist Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party due to take place at the weekend at which the party\u2019s co-leader Alice Weidel was expected to speak.

But according to politicians and civil servants in government at that time, the shock of the fuel crisis sparked a realisation at the highest levels of Whitehall that civil emergencies could bring down a country.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor a few days, a few hundred protesting people outside fuel depots brought the country to a halt,\u201d said Sir Peter Ricketts, a diplomat and later David Cameron\u2019s national security adviser. \u201cThe shock of suddenly finding the country stopped because of a few fuel depots being blockaded was a real wake-up call.\u201d</p> \n<p>Within just the following year, the UK suffered more fuel protests, floods, foot-and-mouth disease, and the aftermath of September 11. Tony Blair\u2019s government decided a completely new approach to civil emergencies was required, and established a revised and expanded civil contingencies secretariat in the Cabinet Office, backed by new legislation.</p> \n<p>The ambition was \u201cto create something which was better suited to the way in which the UK is run\u201d, said Bruce Mann, the director of the unit from 2004 to 2010. Civil contingency planning would cascade downwards through tiers of government, he said, all the way from Whitehall to networks of local emergency response groups.</p> \n<p>Mann\u2019s unit dealt with a \u201crelentless\u201d series of civil emergencies during his six years in charge, including periodic outbreaks of infectious disease, endless fuel supply crises including the explosion at the Buncefield fuel refinery, bird flu scares, and the aftermath of terrorist atrocities both domestic and overseas, including the 7 July 2005 bombings.</p> \n<p>But the team also had a second responsibility: predicting entirely new risks and anticipating how the government might respond. Within its first year the unit drew up the national risk register, a comprehensive catalogue of all the civil emergencies that could conceivably strike the UK, which continues to be updated annually. At the top of the list \u2013 then and now \u2013 was an influenza pandemic.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/the-wrong-kind-of-government-to-deal-with-a-pandemic\">The wrong kind of government to deal with a pandemic | Letter</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Early versions of the register now read as eerily prescient. \u201cIn addition to the severe health effects, a pandemic is also likely to cause significant wider social and economic damage and disruption,\u201d <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61934/national_risk_register.pdf\">stated the 2008 register</a>. \u201cNormal life is likely to face wider social and economic disruption, significant threats to the continuity of essential services, lower production levels, shortages and distribution difficulties.\u201d Deaths would range from 50,000 to 750,000.</p> \n<p>\u201cPandemic influenza has been one of the top risks in the risk register for a long time,\u201d said Miles Elsden, a mathematician and former government scientist who specialises in contingency planning. Elsden helped coordinate meetings of the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) during the 2009 swine flu outbreak. \u201cEverybody had been expecting something to come along,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reasonable worst-case scenario that was the basis for most of the planning was Spanish influenza,\u201d he added, referring to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/us-responses-1918-flu-pandemic-offer-stark-lessons-coronavirus-now\">the 1918 flu pandemic</a> that killed between 50 million and 100 million people worldwide.</p> \n<p>Prof Lindsey Davies, a public health doctor, was brought in as the UK\u2019s first national director of pandemic influenza preparedness in 2006. Having been handed the \u201cfairly skeletal\u201d existing plan, Davies began battling for additional resources. To get them, she would need to force ministers to realise the potential scale of a pandemic crisis. Together with Mann she coordinated the first major nationwide simulation of a flu pandemic in 2007, codenamed <a href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/132988/winter_willow_lessons.pdf\">Winter Willow</a>.</p> \n<p>One question surrounding the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus is whether it implemented recommendations from a second, 2016 flu pandemic simulation, codenamed Exercise Cygnus. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/revealed-the-secret-report-that-gave-ministers-warning-of-care-home-coronavirus-crisis\">The report, which was leaked to the Guardian</a>, made several recommendations that appear to have been overlooked.</p> \n<p>But Winter Willow was the far larger exercise. Where Cygnus involved 950 people, Winter Willow marshalled more than 5,000 people, including government ministers, civil servants, emergency planners, NHS staff, and emergency services personnel to coordinate the first real attempt to test how the UK would hold up under the strain of a pandemic.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The result was transformative. \u201cThat was absolutely a turning point for us, because people at that stage realised what [a flu pandemic] could do,\u201d Davies said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t exaggerate it at all; if anything we underplayed it. We had a sort of moderate pandemic scenario, rather than the worst-case one. But even then,\u201d she added, \u201cwe ran out of face masks.\u201d</p> \n<p>As well as pinpointing holes in the planning, Winter Willow galvanised ministers into taking the threat of a pandemic seriously. \u201cMinisters, when they were faced with the reality of it, suddenly realised that this actually could be disastrous,\u201d Davies added.</p> \n<p>Several changes of government later, and after a decade of austerity, pandemic planning appears to have slowly dropped off the radar. The value of the UK\u2019s pandemic influenza stockpile, estimated at \u00a3831m in 2013, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/revealed-value-of-uk-pandemic-stockpile-fell-by-40-in-six-years\">declined by 40% over six years</a>. Ricketts says that while the government had a faultless record anticipating pandemic influenza as a risk, \u201csomewhere along the line that didn\u2019t get translated into decisions on funding, preparedness stocks, the in-case stocks of vital equipment to make it real\u201d.</p> \n<p>But a second consensus has also emerged: that one of the UK\u2019s big mistakes, rather than failing to plan, was planning for the wrong illness.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Get%20in%20touch&amp;description=Do%20you%20have%20information%20about%20this%20story%3F%20Email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Adavid.pegg%40theguardian.com%22%3Edavid.pegg%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20Signal%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447584640566%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20%2B44%207584%20640566.%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Do you have information about this story?

The emergency pandemic stockpile contains millions of doses of Tamiflu and Relenza to help alleviate the worst of the symptoms for anyone catching the new flu disease, and a National Flu Pandemic Service would distribute them. Stockpiles of existing flu vaccines that might be effective against the new strain would be distributed to inoculate health workers, while contingency contracts with pharmaceutical companies would be spun up to manufacture more flu drugs.</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s most recent national security risk assessment, compiled last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/preparing-for-pandemic-national-security-risk-assessment-coronavirus\">predicted a potential catastrophe</a> in the event of a flu pandemic: trillions of pounds in damages, deaths in the five figures, disruption lasting for months. </p> \n<p>However, the risk assessment\u2019s prediction for the potential impact of a new disease like a coronavirus was staggeringly off target. The worst-case scenario for a novel infectious disease in the UK, the government\u2019s risk assessment said, \u201ccould be on the scale of <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/6458609/looking-back-toronto-sars-outbreak/\">the </a><a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/6458609/looking-back-toronto-sars-outbreak/\">Sars outbreak in Toronto, Canada</a>\u201d, which involved 438 probable and suspected cases and 44 deaths. Economic damage would be limited to a few billion pounds, mostly from nervous tourists staying away.</p> \n<p>The British government\u2019s focus on flu, and the failure to look at how Asian countries were responding to the coronavirus, was recently described by the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt as \u201cone of the biggest failures of scientific advice to ministers in our lifetimes\u201d. \u201cIt is now clear that a major blind spot in the approach taken in Europe and America was our focus on pandemic flu rather than pandemic coronaviruses, such as Sars or Mers,\u201d he told parliament.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16737aed75da4f87593c635fba3ad43eab97afc6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16737aed75da4f87593c635fba3ad43eab97afc6/0_171_3150_1889/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A postman delivers swine flu leaflets in Glasgow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Almost every major UK disease outbreak in the last 100 years has been some form of flu.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The extent to which Boris Johnson\u2019s government stuck to a protocol laid out in its flu pandemic plans is made clear by reviewing the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/213717/dh_131040.pdf\">2011 strategy for responding to a flu pandemic</a> (the most recent published version available). It reads like an extraordinarily precise description of the steps the UK government did (and did not) take in its initial response to Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Mass gatherings such as football matches and live music events would continue, in part to \u201chelp maintain public morale\u201d. There would be no quarantining of international arrivals at airports, though passengers would be encouraged to report any symptoms upon arrival. Face masks would not be recommended for use by the public. There is no mention whatsoever of healthy people being confined to their homes in an attempt to prevent transmission.</p> \n<p>Perhaps most striking is that the decision to wind down contact tracing on 12 March, widely viewed as an error that has hamstrung the UK\u2019s ability to fight back against the coronavirus, is also alluded to in the government\u2019s flu pandemic strategy.</p> \n<p>Its first \u201cdetection and assessment\u201d phase ( seemingly an analogue for the \u201ccontain\u201d phase of the coronavirus response) describes how the focus would shift away from \u201cactively finding\u201d and isolating confirmed and suspected cases, and instead turn to treatment of the disease once there was \u201cevidence of sustained community transmission of the virus\u201d. It even anticipates that detection and assessment could itself be a \u201crelatively short\u201d phase, depending on the circumstances.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a8aefc4-c87c-430c-81cd-7b8b5fa27431\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VIZouD5qaLM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The flu strategy bluntly concludes: \u201cIt will not be possible to halt the spread of a new pandemic influenza virus, and it would be a waste of public health resources and capacity to attempt to do so.\u201d</p> \n<p>There is one obvious but important reason why the UK may have focused its attention so much on planning for influenza: following Spanish flu in 1918, subsequent pandemics included Asian flu in 1957, Hong Kong flu in 1967, and swine flu in 2009. Barring HIV/Aids, almost every significant disease outbreak for the past hundred years has been some form of flu.</p> \n<p>A Department of Health spokesperson acknowledged that several steps taken by the government resemble those set out in the strategy, but cautioned against interpreting this as the result of some blinkered focus on the document. While useful, they stressed, the strategy would have been only one of several elements considered by government scientific advisers, alongside emerging data from Wuhan as well as new research into the nature of the virus.</p> \n<p>They added that contact tracing did not stop when Britain moved to the delay phase, but was instead focused on specific settings at risk of infection such as residential care homes. \u201cThis is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it, guided at all times by the best scientific advice,\u201d they said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Prof David Tuckett, an expert in decision-making under uncertainty who runs a research group called <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/clinical-educational-and-health-psychology/research-groups/centre-decision-making-uncertainty/cruisse\">CRUISSE</a> at University College London exploring how organisations can respond to \u201cradical uncertainty\u201d, has some sympathy for ministers.

There are hoodies by the cult streetwear brand Bathing Ape and Virgil Abloh\u2019s Off-White; outfits nodding to well-loved names in the fashion industry such as Sacai and Jacquemus; and even signature wet-look tops inspired by the cult designer of sexy menswear, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/27/oh-my-goodness-from-jockstraps-to-codpieces-how-menswear-got-sexy\">Ludovic de Saint Sernin</a>, and the now infamous <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-3RjUgHTsT/\">\u201cFuck Boris\u201d design</a> the Tottenham-based bootleg label Sports Banger.</p> <p>A number of experienced creators are fuelling the game\u2019s high-fashion credentials. Richmond Young is a web developer who has been giving players the chance to wear cutting-edge looks from Bottega Veneta, Dries Van Noten, Louis Vuitton and Gucci via <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/crossingtherunway/?hl=en\">Crossing the Runway</a>, an Instagram account dedicated to the fashion of Animal Crossing. \u201cPeople plug a serial number into their game, the garment arrives in their closet, and they can wear it immediately,\u201d he explains</p> <p>It isn\u2019t the first time fashion has crossed over into video games \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/08/240397/jeremy-scott-moschino-the-sims\">Moschino\u2019s Jeremy Scott designed clothes for EA\u2019s simulation game The Sims</a>, while <a href=\"https://adage.com/article/digital/want-nikes-latest-jordans-theyre-only-fortnite/2173436\">Nike has collaborated with Fortnite</a> on a digital version of the brand\u2019s iconic Air Jordan trainer. But it plays a unique role in Animal Crossing because, says the Guardian\u2019s video games editor, Keza MacDonald, \u201cit\u2019s a game about self-expression\u201d,</p> <p>\u201cPlenty of games let you pick an outfit, but Animal Crossing lets you pick all the elements<em> </em>of an outfit, from socks and hats and shoes to dresses, turn-ups, shorts, parkas \u2026 that makes an Animal Crossing outfit feel unique,\u201d she says. The looks range \u201cfrom cute to traditional, or madcap to understated, so you can walk about in a frog hat and a pair of orange leggings or put together a blazer-and-chinos smart-casual combo.\u201d</p> <p>Shel Orock, an industrial designer and co-founder of Crossing the Runway, thinks the appeal is similar to Instagram\u2019s #OOTD: \u201cA lot of people can\u2019t go outside and flex their outfit and show it off, and this has been our way of playing into that.\u201d</p> <p>In this world, unlike the real one, designer threads come free. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to live out fashion fantasies without having to pay the steep price,\u201d says Michele Yue, one of the founders of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nookstreetmarket/?hl=en\">Nook Street Market</a> (NSM) on Instagram, a play on the famous Dover Street Market, whose 23k+ followers are treated to looks from Molly Goddard to YSL.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAGNKM-FxNI/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

We like to take it as a form of honour and flattery.\u201d Fellow New York brand <a href=\"https://vaquera.nyc/\">Vaquera</a>, whose designs also show up on avatars from time to time, sees it similarly: \u201cIt\u2019s been really inspiring to see how people are using Animal Crossing to live out fantasies, whether it be with clothes, gardening or a dream home.\u201d While none of them has a Nintendo Switch and so haven\u2019t been able to play, \u201cwe\u2019re dying to create our own Vaquera Island\u201d.</p> <p>Despite no real-life money changing hands, there are non-digital rewards for brands, and many seem to enjoy the exposure. Plus, as Dominic Lopezone, co-founder of the streetwear brand Happy99, told <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/nintendo-animal-crossing-custom-clothes-fashion\">industry website Business of Fashion</a> off the back of a 30% increase after releasing a collection on the game: \u201cI think there\u2019s a pretty good attachment between owning a hoodie in a game and then later deciding to buy the hoodie so that you match your avatar.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_7xdV0DTmh/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

  "<h2>40. North and South of the River (1997)</h2> <p>Bafflingly left off Pop \u2013 it was released on the B-side of Staring at the Sun \u2013 North and South of the River is audibly better than swathes of that album: a low-key excursion into something resembling trip-hop, replete with breakbeat and lo-fi orchestral samples and particularly yearning Bono vocal.</p> <h2>39. Vertigo (2004)</h2> <p>If All That You Can\u2019t Leave Behind returned U2 to something like their pre-Achtung Baby selves, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\u2019s roaring lead single took them back even further: inspired once more by the Sex Pistols and Buzzcocks, it stripped their sound to its elemental punk roots: one guitar, bass, drums.</p> <h2>38. In a Little While (2001)</h2> <p>Once they had shaken off their youthful obsession with Siouxsie and the Banshees and Joy Division, U2 seldom sounded like anyone other than U2. In a Little While, however, has a 70s Rolling Stones feel to it. Subsequently covered by both Hanson and William Shatner, it\u2019s a lovely, loose ode to enduring romance.</p> <h2>37. Out of Control (1980)</h2> <p>U2\u2019s debut single is very much a product of its era, further bedevilled by the difficult recording session at which the band\u2019s own technical limitations were revealed. Re-recorded for 1980\u2019s Boy, however, Out of Control shone, its blazing youthful power fully revealed itself.</p> <h2>36. Sleep Like a Baby Tonight (2014)</h2> <p>The contents of Songs of Innocence were overshadowed by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/sep/10/u2-apple-launch-means-band-and-company-songs-of-innocence\">controversy over its means of distribution</a> \u2013 oddly enough, not everyone wanted a U2 album to automatically appear in their iTunes library \u2013 but they were better than the reviews suggested: produced by Danger Mouse, Sleep Like a Baby Tonight\u2019s lambent tune and electronic pulse deserve reassessment.</p> <h2>35. The Playboy Mansion (1997)</h2> <p>Another song worth salvaging from the wreckage of Pop, the drum machine-driven The Playboy Mansion is raggedly charming, its lyrics casting an ambiguous eye over media bombardment, celebrity and advertising, its guitar snaking around Bono\u2019s low-key vocal.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDl1c0nR5SI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IDl1c0nR5SI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>34. Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me Kill Me (1995)</h2> <p>U2\u2019s contribution to the soundtrack of Batman Forever might well be their own charming homage to Marc Bolan, albeit put through a distinct Zooropa-era filter: the string arrangement is pure Children of the Revolution, the guitars crunch very T Rex-ily, there\u2019s a distinct hint of a <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0s0LRAzjXUyFgxstSrxVke\">\u201cglam descend\u201d</a> chord sequence about the chorus.</p> <h2>33. Cedars of Lebanon (2009)</h2> <p>Cursed with the kind of title guaranteed to get U2 naysayers rolling their eyes, Cedars of Lebanon is nevertheless one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/27/u2-no-line-on-horizon\">No Line on the Horizon</a>\u2019s scattered highlights: sonically muted and misty, the vocals oddly conversational, its tone weary and sombre, it feels focused and potent where the rest of the album feels confused.</p> <h2>32. Invisible (2014)</h2> <p>Kraftwerk apparently lurked among the regular musical diet of the nascent U2, but it took until 2014 for their influence to really make itself heard. Invisible\u2019s blend of classic U2-isms with motorik drums and Autobahn synths is the most successful of their recent attempts to reboot their sound.</p> <h2>31. Mothers of the Disappeared (1987)</h2> <p>There\u2019s a sense that U2\u2019s vast commercial success means their willingness to experiment gets overlooked, but The Joshua Tree\u2019s second side is thick with impressive diversions into the musical left field, as evidenced by its closing track\u2019s ominous, chilling ambient noise.</p> <h2>30. Stay (Faraway, So Close!) (1993)</h2> <p>As befits a song originally intended for Frank Sinatra, Stay pared back the sonic overload of much of Zooropa, leaving U2 more or less au naturel. Its live sound bolsters the song\u2019s beautifully elegant, elegiac, small-hours tone, its lyric inspired by the plot of the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107209/\">Wim Wenders film </a>they wrote it for.</p> <h2>29. October (1981)</h2> <p>At the other extreme to Gloria\u2019s breast-beating lurked October\u2019s title track, an austere, suitably autumnal-sounding piano ballad in which Bono\u2019s vocals arrive only in the final 50 seconds. \u201cJoy Division had gone to our heads,\u201d shrugged the singer years later, but there\u2019s a hushed, stark beauty to the track.</p> <h2>28. Get Out of Your Own Way (2017)</h2> <p>U2\u2019s most recent albums have been marred by the audible sense of a band trying too hard, but Songs of Experience\u2019s highlight felt effortless. Its shifts from soft and sad to rousing are the sound of a band not worrying about their place in the modern pop landscape and being themselves.</p> <h2>27. Until the End of the World (1991)</h2> <p>A fantastic example of Achtung Baby\u2019s ability to adapt current musical trends so they fit into U2\u2019s universe, rather than vice-versa, the shuffling, vaguely \u201cbaggy\u201d dance rhythm here supports a retelling of the story of Judas Iscariot, a song that alternately broods and soars and a particularly sky-scraping Edge solo.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHcP4MWABGY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LHcP4MWABGY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>26. Pride (In the Name of Love) (1984)</h2> <p>The song that in effect sent U2 supernova plays fast and loose with the facts of Martin Luther King\u2019s murder \u2013 he was shot in the afternoon, not the morning \u2013 but it hardly matters. As straightforward a lunge for anthem status as they had yet recorded, Pride worked.</p> <h2>25. City of Blinding Lights (2004)</h2> <p>Either a paean to Bono\u2019s goggle-eyed first trip to London, or a description of Manhattan, City of Blinding Lights isn\u2019t about taking risks so much as U2 doing what U2 were put on Earth to do \u2013 make music that\u2019s atmospheric but anthemic, uplifting but soul-searching \u2013 and doing it absolutely perfectly.</p> <h2>24. Ultraviolet (Light My Way) (1991)</h2> <p>Julian Schnabel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/08/worldcinema.drama\">The Diving Bell and the Butterfly</a> features a scene soundtracked by Ultraviolet: the film\u2019s paralysed protagonist remembering a car journey with his lover, her hair flowing in the wind. It is an extraordinary piece of film-making that perfectly captures Ultraviolet\u2019s power, the most musically uplifting of U2\u2019s examinations of faith.</p> <h2>25. Mofo (1997)</h2> <p>Pop is generally regarded as U2\u2019s latter-day nadir: its recording was rushed, its attempt at grafting samples and loops on to U2\u2019s sound ungainly, and even its title managed to upset US rock fans. But occasionally, it worked, as on Mofo, an improbably titled song about the death of Bono\u2019s mother, complete with thrilling, Giorgio Moroder-ish synth line.</p> <h2>24. The Electric Co (1980)</h2> <p>U2 have been resident in the world\u2019s stadiums for so long, it is easy to forget they were once a post-punk band. (They would doubtless argue they still are.) It is very clear here, a song about alienation and electro-convulsive therapy, vocals hidden amid trebly, reverb-heavy guitars, drums heavy on tom-tom thunder.</p> <h2>23. Stuck in a Moment You Can\u2019t Get Out Of (2000)</h2> <p>At the other emotional extreme to Beautiful Day lies All That You Can\u2019t Leave Behind\u2019s anguished response to the death of Michael Hutchence. More complex and affecting than a standard issue tear-jerker, its lyric keeps shifting from sadness and empathy to anger at its subject: \u201cYou\u2019re such a fool.\u201d</p> <h2>22. Zooropa (1993)</h2> <p>Zooropa was Achtung Baby\u2019s scrappier sibling: if you wanted evidence of the distance U2 had travelled in recent years, the title track\u2019s experimental, episodic collision of ambience, distorted vocals and densely affected guitar was a good place to start. Moreover, they somehow did it without surrendering their, well, U2-ness.</p> <h2>21. Bullet the Blue Sky (1987)</h2> <p>Inspired by a trip to El Salvador, Bullet the Blue Sky\u2019s tribal drums, dub bass and arcs of guitar noise sound like a bold attempt to turn the experiments of post-punk into something stadium-sized. Extra fun can be had imagining Mark E Smith\u2019s reaction when he learned the chorus was based on a Fall track.</p> <h2>20. Gloria (1981)</h2> <p>U2\u2019s second album could have been their last \u2013 a confused exploration of spirituality, it nearly pre-empted a split \u2013 but when it worked, as on towering opener Gloria, it underlined what a different proposition U2 were. Who else among their peers would write an open-hearted, earnest celebration of Christian faith?</p> <h2>19. The Troubles (2017)</h2> <p>Not all of U2\u2019s recent lunges for contemporaneity have worked (who in their right minds wants to hear Bono singing through Auto-Tune?) but Songs of Innocence\u2019s concluding duet with Lykke Li did. A slow drift that never deals directly with the conflict in the title, but focuses on the impact that growing up near conflict has on one\u2019s personality.</p> <h2>18. The Fly (1991)</h2> <p>From its opening blast of chaotic guitar, The Fly boldly announces things are not as they were in the world of U2. Out goes earnestness that could border on painful, in come more murky, ambiguous songs sung in character. \u201cConscience can be a pest,\u201d offers Bono, as if starkly critiquing his former self, \u201cambition bites the nails of success.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8rQ575DWD8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z8rQ575DWD8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>17. Desire (1988)</h2> <p>Rattle and Hum marked the point at which U2 allowed their passion and self-belief \u2013 and indeed their reaction to superstardom \u2013 to slip into bombast, but sometimes its experiments with US roots music work. Fizzing with their enthusiasm for music forbidden under post-punk\u2019s rules, Desire\u2019s irresistible Bo Diddley beat is evidence.</p> <h2>16. Bad (1984)</h2> <p>Inspired by the rise in heroin use in 80s Dublin, Bad looms large in U2 legend. The original is hypnotic and slow-burning, delicately shaded with Brian Eno\u2019s electronics, the perfect launchpad for onstage development. Most famously, they <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvBgRSSlVBA\">played it for 12 minutes at Live Aid</a>, a performance they thought was a disaster, but which turned out to be a highlight.</p> <h2>15. I Will Follow (1980)</h2> <p>U2\u2019s first truly great song was a product of its era \u2013 Public Image-esque guitars, the vocal influence of Siouxsie particularly evident on the chorus, a hint of DIY experimentation in its percussive use of cutlery and a bicycle wheel \u2013 but it hoisted its influences into the service of music expressly built for crowds to sing along and punch the air to.</p> <h2>14. New Year\u2019s Day (1983)</h2> <p>The unexpected result of Adam Clayton attempting, and failing, to play the bass line to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMPR6Ujop4k\">Visage\u2019s Fade to Grey</a>, U2\u2019s breakthrough hit had what Bono admitted was a sketchy lyric about Poland\u2019s political upheavals. It didn\u2019t matter: its anthem status rests on the emotional shift between the jagged iciness of its verses and the warmth and yearning of the chorus.</p> <h2>13. Sometimes You Can\u2019t Make It on Your Own (2004)</h2> <p>How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\u2019s greatest track remains Bono\u2019s rumination on his complex relationship with his dying father. It\u2019s the perfect counter-argument to those who feel U2\u2019s music exists solely on a grand scale, painted in emotional brushstrokes too broad for its own good. Incisive and personal, it is heartbreakingly frank.</p> <h2>12. Lemon (1993)</h2> <p>Achtung Baby\u2019s singles employed a lot of hip dance remixers: the shimmering synths and falsetto vocals of Zooropa\u2019s Lemon seemed to seamlessly integrate the sound of a hip dance remix into U2\u2019s own. It is helped by the fact the song itself is great; you could strip it of its production and it would still work.</p> <h2>11. Even Better Than the Real Thing (1991)</h2> <p>Returning to Achtung Baby\u2019s many remixes, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRQg1R4jiwk\">Paul Oakenfold\u2019s version </a>of Even Better Than the Real Thing was the most famous, but then his source material was fantastic: a rattlingly exciting song about the desire for immediate gratification \u2013 \u201cSlide down the surface of things\u201d \u2013 that now seems remarkably prescient.</p> <h2>10. No Line on the Horizon (2009)</h2> <p>A commercial disappointment \u2013 selling a mere 5m copies \u2013 the album No Line on the Horizon was muddled and, in Larry Mullen\u2019s words, \u201cfucking miserable\u201d. Finding its highlights requires a degree of sifting, but its title track is fantastic: a wracked vocal over a pulsing wall of guitar effects, the intensity of which ebbs and flows throughout the song.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co6WMzDOh1o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/co6WMzDOh1o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>9. Beautiful Day (2000)</h2> <p>Trailed as a return to basics after the failed experiment of Pop, All That You Can\u2019t Leave Behind wasn\u2019t quite as straightforward as that, but U2 songs come no more direct and powerful than its lead single. Everything about Beautiful Day clicks perfectly, the apparent effortlessness of its widescreen euphoria at odds with its tricky gestation.</p> <h2>8. The Unforgettable Fire (1984)</h2> <p>By now, U2 could knock out potent stadium rock to order, as evidenced by Pride, but The Unforgettable Fire\u2019s best moments are more opaque, less direct. The title track is atmospheric, synth-heavy and dense with serpentine melodies, its euphoric power gradually building over the course of five minutes.</p> <h2>7. I Still Haven\u2019t Found What I\u2019m Looking For (1987)</h2> <p>The gospel inflections and earnest tone of I Still Haven\u2019t Found What I\u2019m Looking For are precisely the kind of thing that winds up U2\u2019s detractors. But blessed with a melody that sounds it has somehow always existed, its strength lies in the fact that it doesn\u2019t deal in pious sermonising; its expressions of spiritual doubt are disarmingly heartfelt.</p> <h2>6. All I Want Is You (1988)</h2> <p>Of all Rattle And Hum\u2019s attempts to tap into American music history, employing former Beach Boys collaborator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/09/van-dyke-parks-victimised-brian-wilson-buffoonery\">Van Dyke Parks</a> for All I Want Is You was the most inspired. His complex but beautiful string arrangement turns a straightforward love song into something richer, adding an undercurrent of uncertainty to Bono\u2019s vocal proclamations.</p> <h2>5. Sunday Bloody Sunday (1983)</h2> <p>A lot has been written about Sunday Bloody Sunday\u2019s lyrics \u2013 a non-sectarian, pacifist view of the Troubles \u2013 but its power lies in the way its sound keeps lurching back and forth from a clattering racket strafed with feedback and scraping violin to something more straightforward and palatable: a killer riff coupled with the singalong-inducing refrain: \u201cHow long must we sing this song?\u201d</p> <h2>4. With Or Without You (1987)</h2> <p>Daringly at odds with then-prevalent trends for pumped-up and musclebound stadium rock, With Or Without You\u2019s examination of faith and/or love is simple to the point of sounding stark: subtle, even subdued, never reaching the big climax you expect. None of which stopped it going to No 1 in the US, a very counterintuitive way of becoming the biggest band in the world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/21/u2-review-manchester-arena-experience-innocence-tour\">U2 review \u2013 eye-popping show finds rock icons at their most human</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>3. Mysterious Ways (1991)</h2> <p>\u201cHeavy-bottomed but light-headed\u201d in the words of the producer Brian Eno, Mysterious Ways is one of a number of Achtung Baby tracks to bear the influence of contemporary indie-dance, an inspiration U2 were able to assimilate remarkably well, hence this gleefully lubricious blast of wah-wah guitar, congas and funky bass.</p> <h2>2. One (1991)</h2> <p>Achtung Baby is rightly heralded as one of the great 180-degree artistic turns a major band has ever performed, but at its heart lies a traditionally U2-esque song: a love ballad that reaches for bigger topics \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re one, but we\u2019re not the same, we get to carry each other\u201d \u2013 so emotionally powerful it apparently reduced Axl Rose, of all people, to floods of tears.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzZWSrr5wFI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GzZWSrr5wFI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>1. Where the Streets Have No Name (1987)</h2> <p>Where the Streets Have No Name had inauspicious beginnings: in effect written to order \u2013 The Joshua Tree was \u201cshort [of] a certain kind of song\u201d, the Edge later recalled \u2013 the band struggled to record it, and Eno was so unimpressed he attempted to wipe the tape. He would have erased a song that perfectly sums up U2\u2019s appeal. Powered by a particularly gripping example of Edge\u2019s patent echo-drenched arpeggios, it is breathlessly exciting without ever resorting to rock anthem cliche (the time signature changes twice). The lyrics seem to be as much about the ability of music to inspire joyful transcendence as the divisions in Belfast that inspired them and the chorus soars irresistibly. \u201cThe ultimate U2 live song,\u201d Edge suggested. He was right.</p> <p><em>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 May to state that The Troubles came from Songs of Innocence rather than Songs of Experience</em></p>",

It would, however, be deemed to be in recession if it grew by 5% in each of the first and fourth quarters but contracted by 0.1% in each of the second and third quarters.</p>\n    <p>An alternative \u2013 and tougher definition \u2013 is a full calendar year of negative output.

It was designed by British architects Lutyens and Herbert Baker following the 1911 decision to move the capital of the British Raj from Calcutta to Delhi.</p> <p>The geometric design, with wide avenues and sprawling lawns, was modelled on European capitals such as Paris but was also infused with Indian influences from the architecture of Hindu temples to the red-stoned grandeur of Mughal forts.

It will repurpose the north and south blocks into a national museum, demolish some newer ministry buildings and erect a vast new secretariat along either side of the vista, which will house all the government ministries currently scattered across Delhi. It will be the most significant transformation of the physical structures of government in India since independence; yet according to many opponents, it is not needed at all.</p> <p>The government and HCP Design, the architecture firm overseeing the project, say its necessity is not up for dispute. \u201cFrom the day after independence, parliament was too small, because the existing building was the council house for the British raj,\u201d said Bobby Desai, director of design at HCP. \u201cWe have limped along since then. It was certainly never designed to be a parliament building for a country of 1.4 billion people.\u201d</p> <p>Currently 550 representatives sit in the parliament, but is still based on the 1971 census when India\u2019s population was a just 580 million, meaning a single elected official now looks after an average of 2.5 million people. This will be up for review after 2026 and there are estimates it could raise the number of parliamentarians to over 900, thus requiring more seats.</p> <p>But opponents to the project have questioned why the Indian government cannot follow the example of ageing parliament buildings all over the world, from the French parliament to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/01/a-tale-of-decay-the-houses-of-parliament-are-falling-down\">Houses of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/01/a-tale-of-decay-the-houses-of-parliament-are-falling-down\">Parliament in the UK </a>and the Senate in the US, and renovate the current structure, which is less than 100 years old.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4286a7a438bc0058ce7b3a84a98a09799332158d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4286a7a438bc0058ce7b3a84a98a09799332158d/0_0_3000_2002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Central Secretariat in Delhi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Central Secretariat in Delhi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: jacus/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Desai insisted that it was unsafe to do so, and that an entirely new building was the only option. \u201cThe current building has heritage status and physically can not be expanded any further, without being incredibly invasive,\u201d he said. HCP say their design will also create 75 acres more of public green space, including part of presidential estate being opened up for the first time as an arboretum showcasing India\u2019s biodiversity.</p> <p>With Delhi currently the most polluted city in the world, many have questioned why there are funds for this grandiose development but not to clean the city\u2019s toxic air. The coronavirus pandemic, and the massive financial strain it has put on India and its millions of migrant workers, has led many to argue that the billions could now be better spent on urgently needed healthcare and welfare. However, a petition for the vista development to be delayed due to the pandemic was rejected by the Supreme Court last week.</p> <p>\u201cEverything about this project has been flawed,\u201d said Anuj Srivastava, an architect who has been part of Lokpath, a group opposing the development. \u201cThere has been no transparency, no consultation and they are pushing forward with it so fast just so they can get it done before the next election. It\u2019s clearly nothing but a vanity project for prime minister Modi, to build parliament in his own image, at an unaffordable cost.. </p> <p>\u201cA heritage area like this is under strict architectural control but that seems to have been completely disregarded,\u201d Srivastava added. \u201cThe government is riding roughshod over all the committees and bodies which are supposedly meant to protect this area.\u201d</p> <p>The selection process that awarded the project to HCP, a firm known for their close ties to Modi, was accused of a lack of transparency.</p> <p>Desai acknowledged that there had been \u201cobjections\u201d to the lack of public consultation on a project. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we have absolutely achieved the mark of how public consultation should happen in these projects,\u201d said an HCP project spokesperson. \u201cI think there is some lack from both ends, both from us and also from the end of the government.\u201d</p> <p>Historian Sohail Hashmi said the project was problematic on both a practical and symbolic level.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lana-del-rey\">Lana Del Rey</a> has hit out at the accusations that she \u201cglamorises abuse\u201d that have trailed her throughout her decade-long career. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAcQPuBJdir/\">In a lengthy text post to her Instagram account</a>, the 34-year-old singer criticised \u201cfemale writers and alt singers\u201d who she says have blamed her \u201cminor lyrical exploration detailing my sometimes submissive or passive roles in my relationships\u201d for \u201c[setting] women back hundreds of years\u201d.</p> <p>She wrote: \u201cIn reality I\u2019m just a glamorous person singing about the realities of what we are all now seeing are very prevalent emotionally abusive relationships all over the world.\u201d She said she had been \u201chonest and optimistic\u201d about her \u201cchallenging\u201d relationships: \u201cNews flash! That\u2019s just how it is for many women.\u201d</p> <p>From the release of her major label debut album, Born to Die, in 2012, critics have dwelt on what they perceived to be Del Rey\u2019s regressive sexual politics. The influential online music site Pitchfork said of the album: \u201cYou\u2019d be hard pressed to find any song on which Del Rey reveals an interiority or figures herself as anything more complex than an ice-cream-cone-licking object of male desire.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/20/kim-gordon-lana-del-rey-doesnt-even-know-what-feminism-is\">In a leaked draft of Kim Gordon\u2019s 2015 memoir</a>, Girl in a Band, the Sonic Youth co-founder claimed that Del Rey \u201cdoesn\u2019t even know what feminism is\u201d. Gordon wrote: \u201cToday we have someone like Lana Del Rey \u2026 who believes women can do whatever they want, which, in her world, tilts toward self-destruction, whether it\u2019s sleeping with gross old men or getting gang raped by bikers. Equal pay and equal rights would be nice.\u201d The section on Del Rey was deleted from the final published version of the book.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAcQPuBJdir/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

  "<p>With campuses closed through Covid-19, and teaching and exams shifted online to protect student and staff welfare, digital literacy has never looked more important.</p> <p>But digital literacy is not, as many understand it, simply the ability to use a computer. Loosely defined,<strong> </strong>it\u2019s an umbrella term for a range of competencies, such as coding, internet and computer mastery, that are used to locate, assess, create and communicate information.</p> <p>And it\u2019s critical to the career success and learning outcomes of students in every discipline.<strong> </strong>\u201cThere\u2019s no institution that has not been profoundly impacted by digital technology,\u201d says Todd Taylor, an Adobe pedagogical evangelist and Eliason distinguished professor of English at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. \u201cWhether you\u2019re studying science or social science, you need digital literacy to contribute as a worker in the current digital economy.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor says digital literacy goes way beyond mastering the basic functionality of digital tools;<strong> </strong>it involves understanding the process behind the task and<strong> </strong>adapting that knowledge and skills to other technology platforms.<strong> </strong>Many knowledge workers create and disseminate content via a multitude of modalities <strong>\u2013 </strong>videos, podcasts, mobile apps and more.</p> <p>This requires \u201chard\u201d technical and \u201csoft\u201d cognitive skills.<strong> </strong>The specific mixture differs between jobs,<strong> </strong>but most occupations demand a degree of digital literacy, says Taylor.<strong> </strong>An artist creating an exhibition poster via Adobe InDesign won\u2019t need to code, for example,<strong> </strong>but needs to be proficient in the software,<strong> </strong>and understand their genre, content and design elements such as typography.</p> <p>Technology is not just transforming the way we work;<strong> </strong>it\u2019s changing how we teach and learn. From video lectures to virtual collaboration software, higher education is being digitised, and the Covid-19 outbreak has only hastened this process.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the next iteration of teaching, and digital literacy is central to success in the classroom,\u201d<strong> </strong>says Sid Dobrin, chair of the English department at the University of Florida and director of the Trace Innovation Initiative.</p> <p>Current students grew up with Google. Their comfort with technology is off the charts. But digital literacy is<strong> </strong>\u201cabout moving them away from being passive, disconnected consumers of content to becoming active, connected, content creators\u201d, says Taylor.</p> <p>Higher education must evolve too, so students can function fully in a digital society.<strong> </strong>Some 30 higher education institutions<strong> </strong>in the US<strong> </strong>have joined Adobe\u2019s Creative Campus programme, a powerful peer network for sharing ideas.</p> <p>They aim to foster digital literacy using the<strong> </strong>Creative Cloud platform,<strong> </strong>a suite of digital apps and services that can be embedded into every syllabus.<strong> </strong>\u201cIt\u2019s the gold standard,\u201d says<strong> </strong>Taylor.<strong> </strong>\u201cThere\u2019s an app for every stage of learning,<strong> </strong>from Spark for beginners<strong> </strong>to Premiere Pro, which is used to edit some Hollywood films.\u201d</p> <p>Working with such tools can nurture some of the most sought-after soft skills in graduates, such as critical thinking and creative problem-solving abilities.<strong> </strong>The process of creation is inherently collaborative and, editing a video, for instance, often involves thinking critically about how to creatively present and convey information.</p> <p>During this process, students also learn how to share their work with wider audiences online, creating digital portfolios that may help in landing a job.</p> <p>Employers are crying out for these skills, in part because they cannot easily be replicated by a robot and may separate humans from machines.<strong> </strong>Artificial intelligence, for example, could sound the death knell for scores of jobs, perhaps whole occupations.</p> <p>Mastering novel software in a continuous way can stand students in good stead for the seismic workplace change that\u2019s coming, says Taylor.<strong> </strong>\u201cIntellectual agility will make students robot-proof.\u201d<strong> </strong>Adaptability is also vital because \u201cmany of the jobs students will occupy 10 years from now do not even exist today\u201d, he says.</p> <p>While digital literacy can (happily) be nurtured, evaluating it is much more difficult.<strong> </strong>Taylor says it\u2019s relatively easy to measure functional IT skills \u2013 whether one can create a spreadsheet or edit a word processing document \u2013 but digital literacy involves higher-order cognitive skills,<strong> </strong>which are complex and nuanced.<strong> </strong>It\u2019s also hard to control for other variables.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tomorrows-campus-today/2020/may/21/artificial-intelligence-why-students-need-to-learn-digital-skills-to-compete\">Artificial intelligence: why students need to learn digital skills to compete</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So there are no consistent and comparable metrics for measuring digital literacy,<strong> </strong>which reflects the lack of a commonly agreed definition, says Dobrin. He adds, however, that a broader array of modalities used to create and circulate content can suggest a higher degree of digital literacy at a macro level \u2013 among an entire class, department or university.</p> <p>An individual student, meanwhile, may be digitally literate if they can explain the reason behind their choices in creating and communicating content.<strong> </strong>\u201cIf they understand why they make decisions, they can adapt and improve them,\u201d Dobrin says.</p> <p>For him, the bigger concern is the digital literacy of teachers: the older among them learned at school through chalkboards rather than computers.<strong> </strong>\u201cI have faculty members who refuse to even own a smartphone,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In a 2018 <a href=\"http://cps.adobeeducate.com/GlobalStudy\" rel=\"nofollow\">global survey</a> by Adobe,<strong> </strong>55% and 58% of educators said they don\u2019t have access to the training and tools they need, respectively, to nurture creative problem solving in students.</p> <p>The Adobe Creative Campus programme is a potential solution to these challenges, since Adobe offers skills workshops for teachers to help raise their own digital literacy and that of their students.</p> <p>Given the vast benefits of doing this, Taylor expects uptake of the programme to increase, and the focus on digital literacy to endure long after the Covid-19 crisis abates.<strong> </strong>He adds that the traditional definition of literacy \u2013 the ability to read and write \u2013 is in need of updating: \u201cSoon, we won\u2019t need to prefix digital to literacy: to be literate will mean having mastered technology.\u201d</p>",

The deaths mount.</p> <p>As southern states that have seen some of the starkest racial disparities reopen, \u201cI feel like it\u2019s only going to get worse,\u201d Kendi said.</p> <p>Recent polls of white Americans by a progressive polling firm found that certain white voters were more likely to endorse the idea of \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d for health disparities when the people affected were black.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8e59364f408c6896fd1d6a3bd28fddae1faf247e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e59364f408c6896fd1d6a3bd28fddae1faf247e/0_0_5342_3569/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People protest at the state capitol during a rally in Lansing, Michigan, on Wednesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People protest at the state capitol during a rally in Lansing, Michigan, on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Sancya/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ronald Reagan attacked America\u2019s postwar investment in social programs, Kotsko said, \u201cby pointing out that the generosity is now extending to black people\u201d and suggesting that \u201cit\u2019s better to tear down the system of solidarity than to allow the wrong people to get the benefits\u201d.</p> <p>But the victim-blaming of black Americans may also have shaped how white Americans have estimated their own risk.</p> <p>\u201cIf you really thought the coronavirus was going to be lethal to you and your family, would you rush in a big group of people to the statehouse without a mask?\u201d Metzl said. \u201cI think you would only do that if you thought you were somehow safe or immune.\u201d</p> <p>The problem, of course, is that death and life during a pandemic are not actually determined by moral righteousness. Blaming dead people of color for being sinful, rather than trying to fix underlying problems, only leads to many more people dying.</p> <p>Metzl argued in his book Dying of Whiteness that the way racism has shaped gun policy and healthcare choices in this country has led to outcomes that hurt black and brown Americans, but that also led to measurable increases in the deaths of white Americans. Today, he\u2019s afraid that same dynamic is playing out again.</p> <p>But there has only been a \u201cdamning\u201d silence from the White House, Metzl said, on any plan to fix the disparities that are leading to tens of thousands of deaths.</p> <p>It\u2019s not easy to describe what it\u2019s like to be forced to witness the violent repetitions of American history. Listening to other Americans argue that you are responsible for your own death, that your body is inherently expendable, takes a particular toll, said Gardiner, the disability rights advocate, who is black.</p> <p>The Puritans had a form of torture called \u201cpressing\u201d, used during the Salem witch trials. They made the accused person lie on the ground, and then very slowly, over many days, placed one rock on their chest, and then another.</p> <p>The terror for Americans now is not that coronavirus is an unprecedented challenge: it\u2019s that all this is so devastatingly familiar.</p>",

So how can teachers steel their students for the unprecedented workplace disruption that\u2019s coming?<strong> </strong>Robot-proofing careers<strong> </strong>will require higher education to be revised.<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/22/damian-hinds-education-secretary-focuses-soft-skills-first-big-speech\">Governments and employers agree</a><strong> </strong>that graduates should not only strengthen technical skills \u2013 they also need \u201csoft skills\u201d<strong> </strong>because they are <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2019/09/are-you-developing-skills-that-wont-be-automated\" rel=\"nofollow\">hard to automate</a><strong> </strong>and may help humans steal a march on machines.</p> <p>The four essential abilities are:</p> <ul> <li><p>creativity, to come up with fresh ideas;</p></li> <li><p>creative problem solving to provide solutions and take action;</p></li> <li><p>critical thinking to analyse information and make a judgement;</p></li> <li><p>collaboration to work in teams to achieve aims.</p></li> </ul> <p>\u201cThese are the skills that will carry this next generation into the workforce and beyond over the next 30 or 40 years,\u201d says Melissa Vito, interim vice-provost for academic innovation from the University of Texas at San Antonio.</p> <p>But how can these skills be taught?<strong> </strong>Perhaps ironically,<strong> </strong>becoming digitally literate \u2013 using technology to create content<strong> </strong>\u2013 can cultivate soft skills simultaneously.<strong> </strong>Creating podcasts or videos, for instance,<strong> </strong>tends to involve thinking critically about presenting information and how to imaginatively communicate it. Students often collaborate and solve problems too.</p> <p>\u201cThis has transformed learning for many of our students,\u201d says Vito. Her university has joined the Adobe Creative Campus programme,<strong> </strong>which makes their collaborative software such as Photoshop (image editing) and Audition (audio editing) available to students from every academic discipline, not just overtly creative subjects such as<strong> </strong>design, but business and medicine.</p> <p>\u201cHaving used Adobe Creative Cloud, they are more creative, approach problems from different perspectives, and can communicate more confidently in new and more powerful ways,\u201d<strong> </strong>she says.</p> <p>However, higher education could do more to provide students with these paramount skills.<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://cps.adobeeducate.com/GlobalStudy\" rel=\"nofollow\">In a poll</a> for Adobe,<strong> </strong>69% of educators said the syllabus does not focus enough on creative problem solving, for example.<strong> </strong>Respondents cited scarcity of time, training and software as being among the key barriers to greater adoption. As such, Adobe offers skills workshops for teachers, helping them deliver these vital pieces of learning.</p> <p>A myriad of higher education institutions have joined the programme,<strong> </strong>recognising that many students learn best by doing, reflecting their comfort with technology. As a result, they may be more engaged and learning outcomes can improve, while students acquire skills for the future of work and create digital portfolios to help in getting hired.</p> <p>Despite the jobs shake-up foretold by economists, a <a href=\"https://www.pwc.co.uk/press-room/press-releases/AI-will-create-as-many-jobs-as-it-displaces-by-boosting-economic-growth.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">study from PwC</a> argues that AI will replace any obsolete roles by boosting the economy.</p> <p>Proponents believe machines can rid us of mundane and routine tasks, freeing up time for higher-value work that we actually enjoy. Accountants at EY, for one,<strong> </strong>have developed an AI for <a href=\"http://cdn.ey.com/uk/en/annualresults/\" rel=\"nofollow\">identifying the right tax codes</a> for capital allowances that can do in just three seconds what it took 15 hours for a human to do.</p> <p>With technical tasks like this being automated, soft skills are essential to the work humans do in the 21st century.<strong> </strong>Among a basket of eight competencies deemed critical by the <a href=\"https://www.naceweb.org/career-readiness/competencies/the-four-career-competencies-employers-value-most/\" rel=\"nofollow\">US National Association of Colleges and Employers</a>,<strong> </strong>critical thinking and problem solving came top<strong> </strong>in a 2018<strong> </strong>poll of 172<strong> </strong>employers.</p> <p>\u201cAI will enhance, not replace the workforce,\u201d says Sebastian Distefano, global manager of strategic development, higher education at Adobe. \u201cAI can be creative, but creativity won\u2019t be automated any time soon.</p> <p>\u201cSo hiring managers are really stressing these soft skills and they must be emphasised across higher education and across all disciplines. And when it comes to developing soft skills, digital tools support those learning outcomes.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tomorrows-campus-today/2020/mar/10/happiness-theres-an-app-for-that-business-students-design-solutions-for-wellness-in-education\">Happiness?

But<strong> </strong>in the search giant\u2019s<strong> </strong>early days,<strong> </strong>its founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page hired people in their image: top computer scientists, reflecting the company\u2019s focus on technology.</p> <p>However, Google\u2019s own analysis of its employment and promotion data in 2013 revealed that the seven most crucial qualities of its top-performing employees were all soft skills, including critical thinking and problem-solving talent. Technical abilities came last on the list.</p> <p>No surprise that Google subsequently cast its recruitment net wider, beyond tech wizards to catch business and humanities graduates, even artists as well. Further research revealed that Google\u2019s best new ideas came from teams<strong> </strong>that had a broad array of soft skills, not just groups with top computer scientists.</p> <p>With soft skills so crucial to jobs in the fourth industrial revolution,<strong> </strong>it\u2019s likely that more higher education institutions will adapt their teaching to place a greater emphasis on the abilities that robots cannot yet replicate or replace. Technology can help to nurture such skills, but it\u2019s being human that will set tomorrow\u2019s graduates apart from the robots.</p>",

  "<p>\u2022 <em>Spoiler warning: plot points up to and including episode five of Gangs of London are discussed in detail</em></p> <p>Have you been watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/23/gangs-of-london-review-a-thrilling-dose-of-capital-punishment\">Gangs of London</a>? Sky Atlantic\u2019s lurid underworld drama explores the messy fallout created when the capital\u2019s No1 gangster is assassinated in a neglected tower block. Finn Wallace (Colm Meany) was an Irish hood who had muscled his way to the top of the most exalted racket of them all: London property development. His abrupt death disrupts the delicate boardroom detente that exists between the city\u2019s jostling crime factions.</p> <p>The street-level results of these executive power moves are bone-crunching fistfights, chaotic shootouts and some exceptionally nasty business involving machetes. Imagine Succession with more aggression or Game of Thrones styled by GQ (the casting of Thrones veteran Michelle Fairley as the Wallace family matriarch does not feel like an accident). The result is a heightened, headlong drama that crackles with pulpy energy: Normal People for Jean-Claude Van Damme fans.</p> <p>Created by Gareth Evans and Matt Flannery \u2013 the writer/director and cinematographer of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/10/the-raid-2-gareth-evans-action-martial-arts-review\">The Raid</a> franchise of whiplash-inducing action films \u2013 Gangs of London was released as a bingeable box set last month but the extended opening episode was apparently enough to crystallise opinions. Some reviewers were impressed by a frenzied all-out brawl in an old-fashioned boozer that involved the wince-inducing use of a dart as an improvised shiv. Others simply recoiled from the impressively staged but unashamedly over-the-top violence.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve been rationing your intake to Sky Atlantic\u2019s weekly Thursday night broadcasts however, this week\u2019s fifth episode is a notable outlier, leaving behind all the key London players and their lethal realpolitik and making a break for the Welsh countryside. Such detours have become a common gimmick in dramas released as box sets, particularly in Netflix series. Slotting in an unexpected side story or flashback episode is a way of breaking up the main narrative, a little breather that provides a helpful point of orientation during a binge.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"116363e845989f3e50319b70c6594238cd2cf614\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/116363e845989f3e50319b70c6594238cd2cf614/0_126_5550_3332/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Darren hides out.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darren hides out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky UK</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Episode five of Gangs of London is the opposite of a breather. It is essentially a standalone mini-movie, an expertly choreographed masterclass of cranked-up tension and cathartic release that threatens to overshadow the rest of the series. (There\u2019s even a cute dog.) It picks up a dangling plot thread from earlier in the story: the fate of Darren (Aled ap Steffan), the Welsh traveller kid who was manipulated into shooting Wallace in the first place. Darren\u2019s burly father Kinney (Mark Lewis-Jones) brought that information to the Wallace family and petitioned them to spare his son\u2019s life. Instead, Wallace foot-soldiers promptly razed Kinney\u2019s traveller camp in a machine-gun assault that left no Calor gas cylinder unexploded.</p> <p>The traumatised Darren has been stashed in a remote Welsh safehouse with Kinney\u2019s loyal lieutenant Mal (Richard Harrington, from the acclaimed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/sep/11/hinterland-y-gwylls-richard-harrington-everybody-around-me-sounded-like-pingu\">Hinterland</a>), awaiting a boat that can spirit the boy away. His injured father survived that brutal camp attack but witnesses a mysterious third party sifting through the wreckage and picking up clues to Darren\u2019s location. From that moment, it is a race to see who can get to the safehouse first.</p> <p>So it starts out as a pacy fugitive-on-the-run story, with the gut-shot Kinney performing some improvised field surgery and hijacking a Land Rover from a distraught farmer in such single-minded fashion that you are left in no doubt that this growling heavy will do anything to protect his son. At the halfway point, there is a serene god\u2019s-eye-view of the bleak Welsh countryside, as a special forces team in hiking snoods and fancy tactical gear ominously marches in V formation toward the safehouse, while the desperate Kinney scrambles ahead of them.</p> <p>The next 20 minutes is a relentless action sequence, an escalating siege that can stand alongside any Game of Thrones castle sacking. Seeing the well-drilled tactics of the initially impassive mercenary squad collide with Kinney and Mal\u2019s desperate improvisations \u2013 assault rifles and C4 breaching charges versus fireside pokers and molotov cocktails \u2013 is exhausting but exhilarating. Handheld camerawork gives the assault a bracing immediacy, while one stomach-lurching but ingenious shot mimics the feeling of dropping into a war zone.</p> <p>The unremitting gunfire might seem gratuitous but it does not shy away from showing the damage even a single bullet can wreak, leaving a sobering stack of broken bodies. Amid all the bedlam, there also remains the emotional core of Kinney bundling his resentful son toward the slimmest chance of safety.</p> <p>It is one of only two Gangs of London episodes directed by co-creator Evans, who could presumably have had his pick of the bunch. He has clearly poured everything into it, bringing all the action expertise he gleaned from shooting The Raid movies in Indonesia back to his homeland of Wales. It is, literally, a blast. Through sheer ear-ringing impact alone, there is unlikely to be a more visceral episode of TV broadcast this year \u2013 if ever.</p> <p><em>Gangs of London, Thursdays, 9pm, Sky Atlantic.

I\u2019ve watched all 132 minutes of it twice this week, and to call it a balm is an understatement. I know I must have looked ridiculous, but I cheered, laughed, sang along and, yes, did what could generously be called <em>interpretative dance</em> right there in my living room. (Try to listen to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okukvuUQnj4\">Sugar Magnolia</a> without shaking your hips a little bit \u2013 it\u2019s very hard to do.)</p> <p>Before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/01/the-last-waltz-review\">The Last Waltz</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-features/talking-heads-on-stop-making-sense-we-didnt-want-any-bulls-t-231875/\">Stop Making Sense</a> came The Grateful Dead movie. But it came after <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo_ijYTcu3A\">Woodstock</a>, and it\u2019s to that film this documentary owes a lot. Shot in October 1974 and released in June 1977, most of The Grateful Dead movie\u2019s running time is devoted to the music \u2013 a giddy Going Down the Road Feelin\u2019 Bad, a spaced-out Playing in the Band and a high-volume Casey Jones being some of the highlights. But as any freak\u2019ll tell ya, much of the appeal of the Grateful Dead was the travelling circus. As with Woodstock, the best moments are the snapshots of the fans.</p> <p>There are the Deadheads who line up outside San Francisco\u2019s Winterland Ballroom, smoking marijuana out of a beer can. There\u2019s a guy freestyling poetry about Garcia\u2019s guitar playing. There are the women in flowing dresses swirling around to the beat, the shirtless dudes who sing along to each word and there are the many, many fans captured in ecstatic amber, some of them just <em>being</em>, man.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpKQOvlDr-s\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fpKQOvlDr-s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The Grateful Dead was a band of many eras. There was the early acid-test years in <a href=\"https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/usa/california/articles/the-evolution-of-haight-ashbury-and-the-grateful-dead/\">Haight-Ashbury</a>, the 77-78 \u201cdisco Dead\u201d period (which I adore) and a spell of glassy, synthesiser-enhanced trips in the early 1990s. As luck would have it, The Grateful Dead movie captures the band during a particular zenith. They had just finished recording From the Mars Hotel but had yet to explore the prog/funk of Blues for Allah. They were in the peak of what I like to call their dirtbag psychedelia mode, when songs such as Truckin\u2019 and loose affiliation with biker gangs lent them a nasty edge of outlaw Americana.</p> <p>And even if you hate the music you can\u2019t help but love this documentary footage. The swarms of shimmying, stinking hippies is just good cinema. There are dancers who somehow make their way to the stage (including some children?) plus a guy shooting fireballs from time to time. It\u2019s a bit of a free-for-all, and that\u2019s before we head to the concession stand selling hot dogs for a mere 60 cents. (That\u2019s about $3 in today\u2019s money.)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZwdf4y1b4M\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QZwdf4y1b4M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The Grateful Dead are no more, but many bands chasing their spirit are still out there.

  "<p>The UK\u2019s universities are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/20/uk-universities-facing-760m-hit-one-in-five-students-plan-defer\">now in </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/20/uk-universities-facing-760m-hit-one-in-five-students-plan-defer\">real crisis</a>. They are not crying wolf, and they are not asking for more money to inflate management salaries or buff up shiny new buildings. If they don\u2019t get more help, some of them could well fold in the near future.</p> <p>This emergency has been in the making for a long time. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-uk-universities-face-25bn-tuition-fee-loss-next-year\">Tuition fees</a> have been fixed at the background level of general inflation, way below cost rises inside higher education itself, for nearly a decade; they have been completely frozen for two years. A whole generation of new buildings has been needed to replace worn-out estate from the 1950s and 1960s. Pension costs are rising.</p> <p>Coronavirus is a perfect storm on an already forbidding sea. By obliterating income from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/10/uk-universities-fear-huge-budget-holes-as-chinese-students-stay-home\">international fees</a> and taught postgraduate courses, as well as potentially slashing home undergraduate numbers for at least a year, institutions that were getting into trouble are now lurching towards disaster.</p> <p>What might that mean in the medium- to long-term? With this level of uncertainty, prediction is very difficult indeed, but there probably are three or four lines of march.</p> <p>First and foremost, universities will now be subject to the same, or an even fiercer level of, the austerity that the rest of the public sector has been feeling for a decade. The relatively good years that made things feel merely cramped and gritty, while large sectors of our shared lives fell into decrepitude, are sadly over.</p> <p>The exact level of that pain is still subject to uncertainty. Boris Johnson, who, like David Cameron, always dreamed of being a sunny, expansive prime minister in a time of plenty, might try to spend his way out of any difficulties \u2013 especially on the capital side, where he retains a penchant for costly big-ticket projects.</p> <p>In addition, Johnson won\u2019t necessarily want his \u201clevelling up\u201d agenda threatened. Conservatives will worry if Keele University gets into trouble in a freshly blue seat, and right next to new Tory seats in Stoke-on-Trent; or if the University of Bolton collapses, sitting as it does right next to five more Tory gains from 2019.</p> <p>The Treasury is, however, another matter. By quibbling over help for small businesses and, more ominously, pushing back against a proper rescue package for universities themselves, it has clearly indicated it is going to want back a lot of the money from its limited assistance.</p> <p>Yes, tuition fees have been brought forward. Yes, olive branches may be extended to individual institutions. But the Treasury will say that the money is going to have to come from somewhere. If it doesn\u2019t come from students \u2013 and higher fees seem politically impossible \u2013 it will come from redundancies. It is as simple as that.</p> <p>A second trend will be mergers and \u201crationalisation\u201d. Those universities who do get into really acute financial trouble are unlikely to just shut their doors and put up a \u201cclosed\u201d sign. They are going to put out an urgent request for help \u2013 which is one of the reasons why the government, very unwisely, might let them suffer for now.</p> <p>In that case, regional blocs could be shoved together like Lego, making use of expensive buildings and infrastructure while slimming down the student offer \u2013 and potentially making staff redundant and taking on more part-time teachers.</p> <p>A sprinkling of mergers will look like it is saving the government money, since the cost in chaos and incoherence will only emerge some way down the track, and this course will not only lure Whitehall. Scottish universities, relatively numerous and without recourse to undergraduate fees for Scottish residents, look particularly likely to fall victim to these shotgun marriages.</p> <p>Thirdly, another opportunity the government will seek to wrest from this crisis will be a different sort of merger. Some of what many observers patronisingly and offensively think of as the \u201cweakest\u201d universities may get shoved out of traditional higher education altogether, asked, as they struggle, to get together with groups of regional further education providers (which often offer technical or vocational training).</p> <p>This is where shorter degree-level courses over two rather than three years, teaching over the traditional summer break and research-light teaching might come in, opening the way for future governments to cope with the demographic bulge of 18-year-olds that is about to start. This will be at a much lower cost than allowing them all to claim \u00a39,250 a year for three years.</p> <p>Fourthly, it may be that online and distance learning gets a decisive boost from the cessation of face-to-face teaching, especially if no effective coronavirus treatments or vaccine emerge in pretty short order. Cambridge has already announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/19/cambridge-university-moves-all-lectures-online-until-summer-2021\">all its lectures will go online</a> during 2020/21, though it\u2019s still planning to conduct seminars and tutorials in person \u2013 at a safe distance.</p> <p>It is hard to imagine the full roster of on-campus activities resuming without that sort of progress, and if this physically distanced phase continues for a year or even more some undergraduates may get a taste for it. Living in halls has become enormously expensive: polls show that students are much more worried about their living costs than fees. So-called \u201cblended\u201d learning, in which universities provide more recorded content alongside face-to-face contact, may become more prevalent.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/20/british-schools-science-children-education-testing-tracing\">When should British schools reopen?

But any new coalitions bringing together the less well-established end of higher education with further education might find this an attractive way to further lower costs.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s universities are now entering a white-water phase of change. No more money will be forthcoming \u2013 at least, for the sector as a whole.

After coming to power as the leader of a 1980 coup, Bouterse ruled as military dictator before adopting a behind-the-scenes role in the 1990s and 2000s.</p> <p>He was elected president in 2010, proving uniquely able to win support across the many ethnic groups that make up the former Dutch colony\u2019s population of half a million. He was re-elected at the head of his National Democratic party (NDP) with a smaller margin in 2015.</p> <p>Over his last decade in office, he has tried to delay and disrupt a legal case over his role in the 1982 murder of 15 prominent opposition members at Fort Zeelandia, a pink-brick fortified chateau in Paramaribo, the capital. But in December <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/30/suriname-president-guilty-of-over-1982-executions\">a military court found him guilty of murder</a>.</p> <p>He is appealing the decision and looks unlikely to see the inside of a cell, but the verdict marked a victory for the opposition.</p> <p>\u201cThat the president could be convicted by an independent court is a compliment to the independence of our justice system. It shows that no one is above the law,\u201d said Chan Santokhi, leader of the opposition Progressive Reform party (known by its Dutch initials VHP) \u2013 and a former chief of police who led the investigation into the murders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"57c522fd887c0c74671fe54ce0672f452c293371\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57c522fd887c0c74671fe54ce0672f452c293371/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protestors demonstrate against corruption in the government of President Desi Bouterse in Paramaribo, Suriname on 17 February 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protestors demonstrate against corruption in the government of President Desi Bouterse in Paramaribo, Suriname, on 17 February 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ranu Abhelakh/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The criminal dealings of the Bouterse family are widely known.

In 2011 Bouterse granted a pardon to his foster son, Romano Meriba, who had been convicted in 2005 <a href=\"https://www.stabroeknews.com/2011/12/29/news/guyana/controversy-as-bouterse-grants-pardon-to-foster-son/\">of the murder of a Chinese trader and of throwing a hand grenade at the Dutch ambassador\u2019s residence</a>.</p> <p>Such scandals have not dented Bouterse\u2019s appeal. With the no-nonsense aspect of a heavyweight boxer and a melodious voice he deploys in man-of-the-people speeches and impressive Frank Sinatra renditions, Bouterse cultivates a lovable tough-guy image that has won him widespread popularity among working-class Surinamers.</p> <p>But if his persona reminded some of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hugo-chavez\">Hugo Ch\u00e1vez</a> \u2013 who he considered a friend and ally until the Venezuelan president\u2019s death in 2013 \u2013 then so, too, did his fiscal profligacy and disdain for democratic institutions.

The currency collapsed, the major credit ratings agencies devalued Suriname to junk status and by May, the Oppenheimer bonds were trading at 35% of their original price. According to Winston Ramautarsing, head of the Surinamese Society of Economists, 38% of government income goes to servicing debt. \u201cThe situation is unsustainable, we don\u2019t have enough income to pay local salaries and \u2013 having taken expensive loans from all over \u2013 we are now going to pay the true cost,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In February the situation came to a head when <a href=\"https://www.kaieteurnewsonline.com/2020/02/06/us100-million-vanishes-at-surinames-central-bank/\">a $100m hole in foreign currency reserves was discovered after the Central Bank</a> had ordered commercial banks to place 50% of deposits with them.</p> <p>\u201cWe warned the banks that the Central Bank was broke and not to be trusted \u2013 it hasn\u2019t published a report since 2014 \u2013 but they didn\u2019t listen, and the Central Bank used the savers\u2019 foreign exchange to cover the government\u2019s imports,\u201d said Ramautarsing.</p> <p>Suriname\u2019s long-term economic prospects could be brighter, however.</p> <p>In January international oil firms announced they had discovered offshore oil, leading to speculation that the reserves recently developed in Guyana could extend into Surinamese waters. If Bouterse can cling on to power, his next term could see billions of dollars of foreign investment.</p> <p>Until recently, however, that seemed unlikely. \u201cThe loss of purchasing power as a result of the weak currency has cost Bouterse a lot of middle-class support, particularly in the capital where opposition parties have grown rapidly\u201d said Hans Breeveld, a political analyst at Anton de Kom University in Paramaribo.</p> <p>But the Covid-19 pandemic has stalled the opposition\u2019s momentum. To date the country has had 11 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and one death, but a curfew and social distancing measures have been in place since 8 April, cutting off the sparsely populated forested inland regions from the coast.</p> <p>That has made it impossible for opposition groups to organize rallies<br>or reach inland areas. The pandemic has prompted to the EU to cancel its election observation mission, although the Organization of American States (OAS) will send a 10-person team.</p> <p>\u201cIn the interior you need just 700 votes for some seats, compared to 7,000 in the capital. There\u2019s been no oversight of what\u2019s happening in the interior and Bouterse\u2019s party has a history of using national funds for his campaigns,\u201d said Breeveld. </p> <p>Santokhi warned that a failure to oust Bouterse would have wider ramifications for the region.</p> <p>\u201cSurinamers have a choice between a better future or to become the next Venezuela\u201d he says. \u201cShould Bouterse retain power, the Caribbean region can expect to see economic refugees and cross border crime.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The flavour is that of <em>ochazuke</em>, green tea poured over rice: it\u2019s a classic, simple, unassuming taste that, for the married couple in Yasujiro Ozu\u2019s drama, is to be a happy-sad epiphany. This is the taste of marriage itself, a taste of sublime humility and simplicity, which wise souls will prefer to flashier dishes \u2013 and also to the husband\u2019s more sloppy bachelor-like taste for soup poured over rice, which he has been indulging when his wife isn\u2019t around. Yet she concedes her angry scolding of him for this is wrong, too, and the green tea over rice is their gentle compromise. It\u2019s a savour of mystery and melancholy.</p> <p>If Ozu, like Shakespeare, has a \u201cproblem\u201d genre, then his 1952 film (rereleased as part of <a href=\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/japan\">the BFI\u2019s Japan 2020 season</a>) falls into it. This is a sentimental comedy of married middle age with dashes of sadness and anger, and, as so often in Ozu, heartbreakingly reticent hints that the people involved have not got over the second world war. There are intriguingly odd plot contortions and grave symbolic gestures: some scenes take place in a <em>pachinko</em> parlour called the Bittersweet School of Life. The principals\u2019 apparently placid resolution can\u2019t be understood without digesting the enigmatic final scene, in which the young couple, apparently having found love, nonetheless appear to be bound to the same quarrelsome behaviour.</p> <p>Taeko (Michiyo Kogure) is a woman in early middle age, dissatisfied with her dull salaryman husband, Mokichi (Shin Saburi). They are childless, and now Taeko has a close relationship with her niece, Setsuko (Keiko Tsushima). She even persuades Setsuko to fake illness so that, under the guise of going to visit her, they can all take off on a girls\u2019 spa weekend without her dope of a husband.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWKrFPx8JEA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qWKrFPx8JEA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It\u2019s a silly deceit, easily seen through (Taeko finally has to pretend it\u2019s someone else who\u2019s ill), but Mokichi buys it and Setsuko is secretly upset and shocked at Taeko\u2019s cynical contempt for her husband. Meanwhile, Mokichi is spending time with young family friend Non-chan (K\u014dji Tsuruta) who is soon going to be working at his engineering company.</p> <p>The men drink together and hang out at the <em>pachinko</em> parlour run by Mokichi\u2019s morose old army pal, Sadao, played by the veteran Ozu stalwart, Chish\u016b Ry\u016b. But Setsuko astonishes both Mokichi and Taeko by confiding in them that she is furious about being chivvied into an arranged marriage \u2013 and hurts their feelings by revealing that she doesn\u2019t want to be trapped into a life of unhappiness like theirs. Meanwhile the good-natured if slightly bumptious Non-chan is the obvious \u201cromcom\u201d candidate to be Setsuko\u2019s soulmate.</p> <p>As always with Ozu, there is his stylised mannerism of direct sightlines into camera, often from someone smilingly looking to the side in semi-profile, as if posing for a portrait. It creates a hypnotically formal, faintly unreal effect that flavours the entire drama. And it\u2019s difficult sometimes to judge the playfully comic tone. When Taeko, her friend, Aya (Chikage Awashima), and sister-in-law, Chizu (Kuniko Miyake), attend a baseball match \u2013 a marvellous set-piece scene \u2013 Aya notices her husband at the game as well, with a woman from his office!</p> <p>In another type of movie, that would be the cue for broad comedy, or deeply serious embarrassment and shock. Here, Aya responds only with a kind of bemused exasperation, shrugging off his behaviour. This extraordinary scene is indicative of how deeply denial runs in Japanese marriage. Aya will later tell Taeko that telling or acknowledging the truth is not consistent with married love; she talks of \u201ccouples who\u2019ve given up on each other, and can\u2019t even be bothered to lie\u201d.</p> <p>When Taeko and Mokichi have their argument and Taeko confesses that he likes smoking cheap cigarettes and travelling third-class, his wife is finding out things about her husband for the first time, as if on some fraught first date, and later reveal that they don\u2019t actually know where things are kept in their kitchen without the maid there to help. It\u2019s such a strange, sad, sweet film.</p> <p>\u2022 The Flavour of Green Tea Over Rice is available on digital platforms.</p>",

However, amendments to ensure that imports are of similar or higher standards were rejected by 328 to 277 votes by MPs last week.</p> <p>Sue Davies, head of consumer protection and food policy at Which?, said research has shown that British consumers value the UK\u2019s high food standards and believe imports produced to an inferior standard should not be allowed in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cThe government has made promises to protect food standards, but these commitments must be enshrined in legislation so consumers can have confidence that they won\u2019t be traded away,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The National Trust said they would be working with others across the environmental and farming sector to see how these changes might be made during the Lords stages of the agriculture bill.</p> <p>Patrick Begg, director of natural resources at the National Trust, said: \u201cAs we move towards a more environmentally sustainable system at home, it\u2019s essential that this long-overdue move is not undermined by food imports that don\u2019t meet UK standards.

They look, obviously, like the sort of people who\u2019d sign up for a reality show about getting a woman pregnant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e330dd46e40090de0eabdcad4bdc94be1af1746f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e330dd46e40090de0eabdcad4bdc94be1af1746f/0_0_648_453/500.jpg\" alt=\"The cast of Labor of Love\" width=\"500\" height=\"350\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The format is awful, especially the part where the woman eliminates potential fathers on an iPad app. The house they all live in is awful, not least because one of the rooms is an infantilised man cave called \u201cThe Father Hood\u201d.

In episodes five, six, seven and eight, there\u2019s a fighting chance that everyone involved in this legitimate horror show comes to their senses and starts to rebel against the system a little. The show does already have something of a backdoor; in the first episode we see that Kristy has had her eggs frozen, allowing her the option to back out of the deal and go it alone in the event of her realising that going on a dating show just to get pregnant is arguably the least dignified thing any person could ever do. Hopefully that\u2019s how this ends.</p> <p>But honestly, on the basis of the first four episodes, that isn\u2019t going to happen. She\u2019s going to have a baby with one of these gibbering corned beef statues. Their relationship will falter. The child will grow up and discover how they came into being and embark on an unbreakable cycle of destructive behaviour that leaves a permanent trail of regret behind them. On the basis of the first four episodes, this whole show is nothing but a recipe for suffering. Everyone involved in it should be truly ashamed. To reiterate, I hate it.</p> <p>However, if any Fox executives are interested in paying me for the rights to Sperm Lottery, please get in touch through the usual channels.

  "<p><br>After the end of the second world war, several of Mussolini\u2019s generals said that they believed that <em>Il Duce</em> had been \u201cmad for four years\u201d. Others claimed that he was incompetent, wayward and with no grasp of strategy. A few allowed him moments of brilliance. All agreed that his great mistake had been to think that the army could be led by men appointed for their politics rather than their military skills. And, as John Gooch spells out again and again in his scrupulous account of Mussolini\u2019s wars, Italy at every stage lacked resources, which made her ever more fatally beholden to Germany, her dangerous and untrustworthy ally.<br><br>In 1922, Mussolini inherited a country with a troubled history and reputation when it came to fighting. Having vacillated over which side to join in the first world war, then sided with the Entente, Italy suffered a catastrophic defeat at <a href=\"https://www.historytoday.com/miscellanies/catastrophe-caporetto\">Caporetto</a>, her reputation barely redeemed by later bravery, and came away from the Paris Peace Treaty humiliated. It was, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/mar/12/italian-scientists-dna-fascist-warrior-poet-semen-gabriele-dannunzio\">Gabriele D\u2019Annunzio</a> famously put it, a \u201cmutilated victory\u201d. What Mussolini instinctively understood was that to win a place at the top table of the Great Powers he needed to forge a \u201cnew resurgent state\u201d, while modernising his inadequate military. What he really dreamed of was a new Roman empire, full of <em>italianit\u00e0 </em>and <em>romanit\u00e0</em>, one that would cover the Mediterranean and north Africa, include a generous slice of the Balkans and open gateways to the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean.<br><br>His first test, retaking Libya, conquered and then mostly lost in the first world war, succeeded largely through brutality and the merciless hunting down of rebels. It brought to the fore two men, Rodolfo Graziani and Pietro Badoglio, who emerged as ruthless if conservative soldiers and who would have a hand in most of Italy\u2019s warfare in the years to come. For Mussolini, the experience was nothing but positive. It had shown Italy to be effective and tough, his soldiers possessed of spirit and will, which was exactly what he wanted from his \u201cnew Fascist man\u201d. When, in 1935, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1935/oct/03/italy.mainsection\">advanced on Abyssinia</a>, he was undeterred by the sanctions imposed by the League of Nations, and though victory came with yet more savagery \u2013 and the use of poison gas \u2013 it gave him the empire he craved.<br><br>All this, however, used men and materiel. Support for Franco in the Spanish civil war ate up planes, trucks, ammunition and left Italy with a deficit of over 40 billion lire, but did not stop <a href=\"http://ww2today.com/23rd-december-1943-galeazzo-cianos-last-reflections-before-execution\">Gal</a><a href=\"http://ww2today.com/23rd-december-1943-galeazzo-cianos-last-reflections-before-execution\">eazzo Ciano</a>, Mussolini\u2019s son-in-law and foreign minister, from proclaiming it to be \u201ca new formidable victory for Fascism: perhaps up to now, the greatest\u201d.<br><br>The top table beckoned, but it was clear that to sit at it Mussolini would need friends. On 22 May 1939 he signed the \u201cPact of Steel\u201d with Hitler, committing their two countries to each other\u2019s aid if either was at war, while at the same pointing out that Italy, depleted by Abyssinia and Spain, would not be ready to fight until 1943. When Germany went to war without him, he sat out an uneasy year of neutrality, but once the French Maginot line was breached, he sensed that he could wait no longer without forfeiting his share of the spoils.<br><br>In 1940, Mussolini knew perfectly well that Italy lacked the manpower or resources \u2013 tanks, mortars, rifles, iron, copper, steel, nickel, rubber and oil \u2013 for more than a single short campaign. But he never much liked his senior fascists, the <em>gerarchi</em>, or the generals who surrounded him and never believed in experts unless they agreed with him. As the war in Europe spread, Italy was sucked into campaigns across north and east Africa, Russia and the Balkans, so the only way that Fascist Italy could earn her place was by depending ever more on Germany. Some historians have maintained that Italy really became subordinate to Germany only when Rommel arrived in north Africa in February 1941, but Gooch believes it was inevitable from the start. He is good on the meetings between Mussolini and Hitler, when the F\u00fchrer harangued a partner whose feebleness he increasingly deplored and whose needs he seldom met. Italian soldiers sent to the Arctic Russian plains to crush, so they were told, the barbaric Bolshevists, sometimes marched on paper boots. At every turn, Italy\u2019s equipment was inferior and scarcer than that of its ally. \u201cFascist Italy,\u201d Gooch writes, \u201ccontinued on its chosen path towards defeat.\u201d<br><br>Over much of Gooch\u2019s long and fascinating book hangs Mussolini\u2019s personality. By turn gungho and monosyllabic, truculent and cheerful, he changed his senior soldiers around, issued orders and then cancelled them, committing Italy to battles she could not win. Gooch is skilful at carrying his narrative forward, through painful campaigns and quixotic tactics, through advances and retreats, victories and losses.<br><br>And the losses were indeed overwhelming. By the time Tunis fell to the allies in May 1943, and all north and east Africa was lost, some 400,000 Italians had been taken prisoner, and almost 30,000 were dead. The 17-month Russian campaign saw a third of the army of quarter of a million soldiers die, and 70,000 taken prisoner, many soon also to die on forced marches and in camps.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/feb/22/casapound-italy-mussolini-fascism-mainstream\">The fascist movement that has brought Mussolini back to the mainstream</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By the spring of 1943, Mussolini was running out of time. Rome was awash with plots to topple him and there was talk of a separate peace deal with the allies. The value of the lira had collapsed, food prices kept rising and there were strikes across the industrial north. Italians were exhausted, hungry, angry and longing for peace. The Duce\u2019s sudden end, ousted by his <em>gerarchi</em>, arrested by the king, then rescued by a squadron of German gliders from the top of a mountain in the Abruzzi, is only briefly touched on by Gooch. It is enough to know, perhaps, that the final peace treaty, signed in Paris in 1946, did not bring glory to Italy, but rather further humiliation. Forced to pay heavy reparations and give up its empire \u2013 along with Istria and Dalmatia which it had won in 1918 \u2013 Italy could not quite escape the contempt of the allies for having so willingly tolerated 20 years of fascist corruption, incompetence and greed. But by now, Mussolini himself was dead, shot and hanged upside down by partisans from the roof of a petrol station in Milan.<br><br>Mussolini never lost faith in what he regarded as an Italian army composed of \u201cwell trained troops nourished by a strong combative spirit\u201d. A few were indeed just that, fanatic fascists, loyal to the end. But for the most part, Mussolini\u2019s armies, as Gooch meticulously chronicles, were badly trained, confusingly and ineptly led, imbued by a culture of cruelty, insufficiently fed and lacking in almost everything they needed to confront the allies and stand up to the Germans. It is hard to imagine a finer account, both of the sweep of Italy\u2019s wars, and of the characters caught up in them. That Mussolini\u2019s soldiers fought for so long, against such odds, often with such tenacity and courage, is what really stands out.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Mussolini\u2019s War: Fascist Italy from Triumph to Collapse, 1935-1943 is published by Allen Lane (RRP \u00a330).

  "<p>Shortly after the imposition of lockdown, I came across a team of workers painting red lines all the way down Ridley Road. They started at dusk and had to work through the night to complete the task. I was intrigued by the addition to the street iconography and developed the idea of making portraits to include both masks and these new lines of separation.</p> <p>Most of the people I approached were keen to be photographed, feeling that they wanted to advocate mask wearing. They had widely different reasons for choosing to wear a mask. Some felt they were protecting others \u2013 some were fearful of contracting the virus themselves.</p> <p>Masks can signify many things today: anxiety, isolation, social responsibility, fear or safety.

  "<p>Rwanda is to release 50 women who were jailed for having abortions after a personal pardon was issued by the country\u2019s president, Paul Kagame.</p> <p>Human rights activists welcomed the pending release of the women, six of whom had been given life sentences \u2013 the highest penalty available to the courts \u2013 two serving 25 years and the others terms ranging from 12 months to 20 years.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a positive step,\u201d said Tom Mulisa, executive director for the Great Lakes Initiative for Human Rights and Development (GLIHD).</p> <p>Dr Agnes Odhiambo of Human Rights Watch in Kenya, said they should never have been jailed. \u201cWhile this is a good move, women and girls should never, in the first place, be imprisoned for exercising their reproductive rights. The government of Rwanda should remove punitive measures for women who undergo abortions.\u201d</p> <p>Rwanda revised its penal code in 2018, allowing abortion strictly only for cases of minors, rape, forced marriage, incest and instances where the pregnancy poses a health risk.</p> <p>Odhiambo said that sends the wrong message: that women have to undergo certain abuses for them to exercise their reproductive rights.</p> <p>Even where a termination is allowed, it must be carried out by a doctor, an issue in a country where medical professionals are in short supply. \u201cThe condition that allows only a \u2018recognised medical doctor\u2019 to perform abortions threatens to make safe abortions almost impossible for many women and girls to access, particularly those who are poor, illiterate and from rural areas,\u201d she said. \u201cStudies have shown that trained nurses and midwives are as capable as doctors in providing safe abortion care.\u201d</p> <p>Figures from 2016 by Rwanda Medical and Dental Council show the country has one doctor per 10,055 people, and one midwife for every 4,064 women aged 15 to 49.</p> <p>Dr Afrodis Kagaba, the executive director of Health Integrated Development, said the more difficult abortion was to access, the more people are pushed towards unsafe solutions. \u201cNurses and midwives can safely conduct abortion operations as they normally help more than 80% of women to give birth. Nothing can stop a woman who has decided to abort. The law is good, but as we know, around 40% of hospitals are owned by religious bodies, and they cannot offer the service due to their beliefs. Also, healthcare providers are yet to understand the law, they require evidences that are no longer necessary,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The use of law enforcement in arresting women means they are less likely to seek medical help after an unsafe abortion.</p> <p>\u201cIn some cases, girls or women can be handcuffed or arrested and this brings fear in others. Therefore, doctors lack enough evidence, it is not easy for a girl or a woman to prove that she has been raped,\u201d said Dr Frank Habineza, a member of parliament for the Democratic Green party of Rwanda.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2019/mar/15/no-tomorrow-for-me-rwanda-teen-mothers-in-pictures\">'There is no tomorrow for me': Rwanda's teen mothers \u2013\u00a0in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mulisa said that more than the narrow specified circumstances permitting abortion should legally be supported. \u201cThis point, when the pregnancy puts at risk the health of the pregnant person or of the foetus. As defined by the World Health Organization, health is a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Many people do not understand what it means. There are many reasons that can affect the social wellbeing,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A 2015 study, by reproductive rights group Ipas and GLIHD, found that legal barriers, and cultural and religious stigma make it nearly impossible for women to get a safe, legal abortion in Rwanda, leaving the vast majority forced to resort to unsafe procedures that break the law.

  "<p>The number of frontline charities and community groups seeking help to feed the hungry from the UK\u2019s largest food redistribution organisation has tripled since the start of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\"> the coronavirus pandemic</a>.</p> <p>FareShare has added a further 500 charities to its waiting list, more than 80% of which are delivering emergency food parcels to vulnerable families and individuals at risk of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/hunger\">hunger</a>, its annual report said, as benefit claims and unemployment soar because of the virus.</p> <p>The FareShare network is made up of 17 independent food redistribution organisations. The report said they redistributed more than 24,000 tonnes of in-date surplus food from the food industry in the last financial year, a 26% increase on the previous 12 months and the equivalent of 1m meals a week. This was used by almost 11,000 charities \u2013 including domestic violence refuges, breakfast clubs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/food-banks\">food banks</a> and day centres.</p> <p>But in the month after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/lockdown-living\">lockdown</a> was implement, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/10/uk-food-waste-charity-fareshare-donations-lockdown\">the charity distributed 3,208 tonnes of food</a> \u2013 double the usual amount \u2013 and enough to create almost 2m meals a week. In just one week in April, more people signed up to volunteer to sort, pack and deliver food for FareShare than in the whole of last year.</p> <p>To help store and manage the additional food, the charity has recently secured another nine warehouses\u2019 worth extra capacity. It is now urging the government to cover the costs to producers and growers of saving surplus food from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/food-waste\">waste</a> and sending it to charities, in order to tackle an expected rise in food poverty during and after the crisis.</p> <p>Lindsay Boswell, the chief executive of FareShare, said: \u201cWhen the crisis ends, the need for our food will still be there. In April alone 856,500 more people claimed benefits and job opportunities fell by a quarter. Many more people will fall through the gaps in society and need the support of frontline charities.\u201d</p> <p>Even before the outbreak of the coronavirus, demand for surplus food had soared against a background of growing dependence on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/food-banks\">food banks</a> and rising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/homelessness\">homelessness </a>in the UK. The number of households with children going hungry has doubled since lockdown began, as millions of people struggle to afford food, according to data from the <a href=\"https://foodfoundation.org.uk/about/\">Food Foundation</a>.</p> <p>The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cWe continue to support redistribution organisations getting food to those in need through our work with the Wrap Resource Action Fund. Most recently we provided a series of grants to help redistribution organisations both large and small respond to the impact of coronavirus. We will look to evaluate an earlier <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cutting-food-waste-game-changing-fund-opens\">pilot programme</a> and any further funding decisions will be made in due course.\u201d</p>",

While the experience has been life-changing for her, the Covid-19 crisis has thrown up new challenges for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/domestic-abuse-surge-coronavirus-lockdown-lasting-impact-mps\">those living in protected accommodation</a>, as well as the staff who are risking the virus to keep the services running.</p> <p>Through interviews and diary extracts, Annie and two women in the Reigate and Banstead Women\u2019s Aid refuge in Surrey have provided the Guardian with unique insight into life there in the time of Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cI was concerned about coming to the refuge \u2013 anyone would be \u2013 but if you know that you\u2019re going to be able to get far, far away then it\u2019s worth it,\u201d Annie said. \u201cSo you just have to go through all your fears and break them down a little bit.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/13/my-working-week-mother-arrives-refuge-covid-19-symptoms\">My working week: 'A mother arrives at our refuge with Covid-19 symptoms'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rebecca, who is pregnant and has children, found the first few weeks of lockdown hard.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to come to terms with the news of a lockdown, the virus, being pregnant, and in a refuge with other families that I have no control over how they should keep up with hygiene,\u201d she wrote in her diary.</p> <p>\u201cSo many fears and questions linger in my mind. How will we share the toilets? We are told that [if] one of us gets sick they will use the toilet and the shower downstairs and that is where my room is.\u201d</p> <p>Rebecca explains she and the other tenants agree to a cleaning rota to allow some social distancing. \u201cSharing the communal areas is becoming a sort of nightmare because you don\u2019t know if the people here have the virus or not,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>\u201cI keep to my room as I consider myself a high risk. I am very anxious and worried when my kids go out to the back garden and interact with other children.\u201d</p> <p>Rebecca is a migrant and has to apply for a destitution domestic violence concession, allowing her to claim public funds while applying to settle in the UK.

So it doesn\u2019t make us feel disadvantaged. I try as much as I can to assure them.\u201d</p> <p>Other children knock on the door in the refuge, which makes her anxious. She wants her children to feel at home but she is concerned about the virus. \u201cI live in fear of the unknown,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>The women may feel anxious about the virus in the refuge but the staff are working hard to ensure they are in a safe environment.</p> <p>Charlotte Kneer, the chief executive of the Reigate and Banstead Women\u2019s Aid refuge and a survivor of abuse, said: \u201cThe big worry is it\u2019s a communal living environment in the same way as nurseries; if one gets a bug it goes through the whole place. It\u2019s the same for us.</p> <p>\u201cWe have 11 women, 24 children, in a small space where they\u2019re sharing facilities. We\u2019re trying to make sure that every day there\u2019s enough cleaning stuff.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m worried that if someone gets it, they\u2019re all going to get it.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a plan that if someone has it or suspects they have it, there\u2019s a bathroom only they and their children use. Only come out and use the kitchen when no one else is around.\u201d</p> <p>Kneer\u2019s refuge can house up to 11 vulnerable women and 24 children at a time. It offers clean, furnished rooms with televisions and tea-making facilities, a communal living area and kitchen, and a large garden with playground equipment.</p> <p>One member of staff is on site every day to hand out rations of food and toiletries.</p> <p>Multiple support services have seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/28/lockdowns-world-rise-domestic-violence\">a surge in calls to helplines</a> during the lockdown period but there are fears that the already creaking refuge system in England and Wales will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/28/refuges-from-domestic-violence-running-out-of-space-mps-hear\">not be able to cope with the number of women looking to flee abuse</a>.</p> <p>Sally, also a mother, said the lockdown had brought with it additional anxiety and frustration.</p> <p>\u201cBut I would like to add, that no matter the delay and any problems we get, this is the best place to be under the circumstances of domestic abuse. First of all me and my child, we are safe. We receive a lot of emotional and practical support here.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very helpful to understand how serious the abuse was that I went through, and how important it is to always keep my address secret and leave no chance for my perpetrator to contact me.</p> <p>\u201cThe assurance that we did the right thing removing ourselves from abuse and understanding that it wasn\u2019t all just my sensitive feelings or overreaction went a long way in feeling more confident. Being manipulated for 10 years makes you doubt yourself in every thought you have and every step you make.\u201d</p> <p>She had to take a Covid-19 test while staying in the refuge after a visit to hospital for a stomach sickness and high temperature.</p> <p>While at the hospital, one of her children spent the night with one of the refuge workers \u2013 but social services recommended this was limited to the one night.</p> <p>\u201cIt was difficult, he didn\u2019t want me to go without him and he was crying on my way out,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>\u201cI was very worried about the Covid-19 test \u2013 if it would be positive, maybe my child had it too, then the possibility to pass it on to the woman who was looking after him, also my housemate who has asthma and her kids.\u201d</p> <p>She was ultimately discharged and the test returned negative \u2013 but because she had visited a hospital she had to self-isolate for two weeks from the rest of the refuge, although her housemate offered to help.</p> <p>\u201cI was having difficult time accepting help. My ex-partner, that I spent 10 years with, he used to call me worthless and useless and ungrateful all the time,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cSlowly he destroyed my self-esteem and my personality, I was just there to cook food and clean and take care of his needs.</p> <p>\u201cThis left a very big impact for me to ask and accept help from anyone. Now not being able to do my usual daily things was making me feel anxious and stressed a lot.\u201d</p> <p>She says that self-isolation compounds how isolated she feels having left her previous home.</p> <p>\u201cRefuge helped me a lot,\u201d she wrote, \u201cit was a life-saving decision to move here, but there always comes the feeling of isolation.</p> <p>\u201cHaving to go through lockdown and now self-isolation made it even worse, especially when you are sharing your home with another family, you don\u2019t really feel free at your own home, you don\u2019t even feel that you are at home.\u201d</p> <p>The shortage in spaces in refuges during lockdown has sparked initiatives to offer safe accommodation with specialist support, such as the Covid-19 Crisis Project run by Solace and Southall Black Sisters in London.</p> <p>There were 72 refuge vacancies in England on 3 April, compared with 170 on the same day last year. The Women\u2019s Aid Annual Survey 2017, carried out on a single day, found there were 3,557 women with 3,919 children and young people staying in refuges across all services in England.</p> <p><em>Annie, Rebecca and Sally agreed to their names being changed for this piece to protect their identities</em></p>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Global cases near 5 million</strong></h2> <p>After the biggest single-day increase in cases worldwide so far in the pandemic, the number of confirmed infections is close to 5 million, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The true number is likely to be significantly higher, due to differing testing rates, delays and underreporting. This is true for deaths, too. At least 328,120 people have lost their lives in the pandemic so far.</p> <h2>\u2018Don\u2019t count on\u2019 vaccine\u2019</h2> <p>A top US scientist has said governments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/global-report-coronavirus-vaccine-us-scientist-cases-5-million\">should not count on a Covid-19 vaccine</a> being developed any time soon, urging people to wear masks, wash hands, clean surfaces and keep a distance. William Haseltine, the groundbreaking cancer, HIV/AIDS and human genome projects researcher, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a slam-dunk case by any means ... because every time people have tried to make a vaccine \u2013 for Sars or Mers \u2013 it hasn\u2019t actually protected.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Migrant boat crossings to UK surge during virus lockdown</strong></h2> <p>The number of unaccompanied young migrants crossing the Channel from France to Britain has spiked during the coronavirus outbreak, as travel restrictions force them onto boats rather than trucks. Kent County Council in southeast England, which includes the major port of Dover, was dealing with \u201c230 to 250\u201d young migrants a year ago, its chief executive, Roger Gough, said.</p> <h2><strong>Mexico suffers record one-day death toll</strong></h2> <p>Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Wednesday registered 2,248 new coronavirus infections and an additional 424 fatalities, a record one-day death toll since the start of the pandemic. The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 56,594 and 6,090 deaths in total, according to the official tally. Mexico registered its biggest daily increase yet in infections on Tuesday, when it reported 2,713 new cases. Mexico\u2019s highest daily death toll was on 12 May, when health authorities reported 353 fatalities.</p> <h2><strong>World sees largest daily rise in cases</strong></h2> <p>The World Health Organization gave a stark warning on Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic is far from over, after 106,000 new cases were recorded worldwide over the past 24 hours \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/global-report-coronavirus-pandemic-not-over-warns-the-who\">the most in a single day so far</a>. Speaking in Geneva, the WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the virus was spreading in poorer countries, just as wealthier nations were emerging from lockdown.</p> <h2><strong>Europe should brace for second wave, says</strong> EU coronavirus chief</h2> <p>The prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments \u2013 including the UK \u2013 on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big. That is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</p> <h2><strong>Japan to lift state of emergency in Osaka and two other prefectures</strong></h2> <p>Japan\u2019s economy minister says experts have approved a government plan to remove a coronavirus state of emergency in Osaka and two neighbouring prefectures in the west where the infection is deemed slowing, while keeping the measure in place in the Tokyo region and Hokkaido. Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters that experts at the meeting approved the plan to lift the measure in Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo. The measure will be kept in place in Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures, as well as Hokkaido, where the infections have slowed but need further improvement.</p> <h2><strong>Trump considers an in-person G7 meeting despite coronavirus pandemic</strong></h2> <p>Donald Trump has said he may seek to revive a face-to-face meeting of Group of Seven leaders near Washington, after earlier canceling the gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, DC, at the legendary Camp David,\u201d the US president tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cThe other members are also beginning their COMEBACK. It would be a great sign to all \u2013 normalization!\u201d</p> <h2><strong>More than 100 virus infections in French slaughterhouse</strong></h2> <p>More than 100 people have tested positive for the novel coronavirus at a slaughterhouse in western France, the regional health authorities said Wednesday. The cases follow coronavirus outbreaks at meat plants not only in France but also in Germany, Spain, Australia, the United States and Brazil - where people tend to work in close proximity. A total of 109 personnel have tested positive at the slaughterhouse in Cotes d\u2019Armor following a second wave of testing, the ARS regional health authority said in a statement. Some 818 people have been tested at the plant, it added.</p>",
  "<p>Hollywood loves a happy ending and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/26/ryan-murphy-american-horror-story-pose-politician-glee-nip-tuck\">Ryan Murphy</a>\u2019s new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/01/hollywood-review-ryan-murphy-netflix\">Netflix series of the same name</a> is no exception. This seductively glossy drama is a speculative story about postwar Hollywood, a revisionist fantasy in which a group of gay men and people of colour sweep prejudice aside on the road to box-office victory and Oscar glory. Thanks to the show\u2019s attention to set design, costuming and name-dropping, it certainly looks a lot like 1947, but the events that take place bear a complex, ironic relationship to history.</p> <p>Murphy, the creator of hits including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/glee\">Glee</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/21/pose-review-ryan-murphy-show-voguing-underground-ballroom-new-york\">Pose</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/19/feud-bette-and-joan-tv-drama-hollywood-sexism-in-spotlight\">Feud</a>, about the rivalry between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, has taken inspiration from the cheerfully lewd, largely unverifiable memoirs of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/15/scotty-bowers-male-madame-to-stars-dies\">Scotty Bowers</a>. In his book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/04/full-service-my-adventures-bowers-review\">Full Service</a>, best read with a shaker or two of salt to hand, Bowers recalls decades spent hooking up with stars or supplying them with sex partners, starting with the days when he picked up clients while working at a petrol station in Hollywood.</p> <p>Murphy\u2019s show professionalises that operation, with Dylan McDermott playing Ernie: a likable, brisk chap who marshals an army of young men and women into the beds of the Hollywood elite from his forecourt. Those giving and receiving the password \u201cDreamland\u201d at the pumps include such made-up characters as aspiring actor Jack Castello (David Corenswet), gay black screenwriter Archie Coleman (Jeremy Pope), and Avis Amberg (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/oct/11/print-that-broadway-legend-patti-lupone-sounds-off\">Patti LuPone</a>), the neglected wife of a studio mogul. Historical figures using the service include Cole Porter and Rock Hudson (played by Jake Picking), who in this version of reality falls in love with Coleman.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9231590a9eb7d95bbfdeba9e38dba02094519e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9231590a9eb7d95bbfdeba9e38dba02094519e7/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Service with a smile \u2026 hopefuls at the pumps.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Service with a smile \u2026 hopefuls at the pumps.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saeed Adyani/NETFLIX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many other Hollywood names appear in the series, often in roughly sketched caricatures, from George Cukor, Hattie McDaniel, Anna May Wong and Vivien Leigh, to lesser-known names such as Henry Willson (Jim Parsons) a gay man who was Hudson\u2019s agent, and promoted many hunky \u201cbeefcake\u201d stars of the 1950s. In the show, he uses mob connections to keep a story about Hudson\u2019s sexuality out of the press \u2013 in real life Willson did this in 1955 by selling scandal on two other stars to the magazine in question.</p> <p>While Hollywood revels in often-retold stories about orgies, arrests and eccentricities, it lands on two facts that are unequivocally true: that many people working in golden age Hollywood were gay (although not out to the public), and that the careers of talented people of colour suffered because of ingrained racism. This was true for Wong and McDaniel, but also figures such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/10/lena-horne-obituary\">Lena Horne</a> and Dorothy Dandridge, who have inspired another key fictional character in the show, actor Camille Washington, played by Laura Harrier.</p> <p>In the show, Archie has written a screenplay called Peg that alludes to the outsider status shared by Washington, himself and many others. It dramatises the tragedy of Peg Entwistle, a young British actor who killed herself by jumping from the H of the Hollywoodland sign in 1932, after struggling to get into the movies. At first Coleman sees a symbol for his own exclusion in Peg\u2019s history, but after he finds a director and studio to make the film, he starts rewriting history, eventually dismissing Entwistle as a \u201cdumb-ass white girl\u201d. Camille suggests that the film should be Meg, not Peg \u2013 the story of a black woman who comes to Hollywood to be a star, but ends up rejected and depressed as Entwistle did. It\u2019s a far bolder choice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01d0310ed3555dd6c5f5fb971d8f97f78df3ceb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01d0310ed3555dd6c5f5fb971d8f97f78df3ceb3/0_0_5757_3838/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bold move \u2026 Patti LuPone as stand-in studio boss Avis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bold move \u2026 Patti LuPone as stand-in studio boss Avis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saeed Adyani/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Avis, temporarily in charge of her husband\u2019s studio (something the show presents as a first, although there had been female studio bosses in the silent era), gives Meg the green light, encouraged by a gay male executive and a visit from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/03/eleanor-roosevelt-autobiography-1962\">Eleanor Roosevelt</a>. Camille is the best person to play the lead, although she has only had one film role before, a demeaning maid role far beneath her talents. Jack plays her love interest, beating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/oct/03/archive-rock-hudson-victim-of-aids-1985\">Rock Hudson</a>, who flunks his screen test by mixing up his lines. Hudson did indeed need repeated takes early in his career, though he wasn\u2019t quite the clot this show makes him out to be.</p> <p>Avis sets the budget for Meg very low (although it is still referred to as a \u201cmajor motion picture\u201d) and retains some understandable concerns: that there will be protests against the studio, and that the film won\u2019t recoup its costs because it can\u2019t be shown in the South. Despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/05/ku-klux-klan-kkk-media-debate\">the KKK</a> burning crosses on studio lawns, the production continues and the team eventually give Meg a happy ending, in which she climbs down from the sign and into the arms of her boyfriend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8f5f0c8083cc26842213a0b183a083144e55bfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8f5f0c8083cc26842213a0b183a083144e55bfc/0_0_3329_2370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Groundbreaking \u2026 Pinky, starring Jeanne Crain and Ethel Waters, 1949.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Groundbreaking \u2026 Pinky, starring Jeanne Crain and Ethel Waters, 1949.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What Avis doesn\u2019t take into account is that censorship would have nixed Meg from the start. In real life, the villains of this piece weren\u2019t protesters from outside but Hollywood\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1270/joseph-breen\">Joseph Breen </a>and the Production Code he enforced. So-called miscegenation, the romance between Meg and her white boyfriend, was not allowed on screen, a rule that was relaxed only slightly for the real <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041746/\">Pinky</a>, made two years later. Pinky features a young black woman who passes for white, who was in fact played by a white actor, Jeanne Crain. Both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/aug/30/1\">Dandridge</a> and Horne wanted that role, but women of colour were not cast as romantic leads in Hollywood at that time.</p> <p>Breen\u2019s influence is revealed in the casting of Fannie Hurst\u2019s novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/20/passing-film-rebecca-hall-black-white-us-rac\">Imitation of Life</a>, which was filmed twice. In 1934, just as Breen began enforcing the Code, Fredi Washington, a woman of colour, played the white-passing lead, but in the 1959 remake the part was taken by a white actor, Susan Kohner. In 1951, black actor-singer Horne lobbied for a lead role in the musical <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqKJM23YB0g\">Show Boat</a>, but was rejected in favour of the white <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/apr/30/biography.features\">Ava Gardner</a>, whose singing voice had to be dubbed. Hollywood refers to this kind of whitewashing by re-enacting Wong\u2019s failure to win the lead role of The Good Earth despite being the only Asian star \u2013 and the best actor \u2013 to audition, but implies it is all in the past.</p> <p>One historical angle oddly absent from Murphy\u2019s reconstruction is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/feb/16/features.weekend1\">the Hollywood blacklist</a>, first drawn up in 1947 after growing unrest in the industry about the corrupting influence of creatives with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/communism\">communist</a> sympathies.

The big winner that year was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/15/best-picture-oscar-winners-gentlemans-agreement-1947\">Gentleman\u2019s Agreement</a>, directed by former Communist party member Elia Kazan (he also directed Pinky, and would testify against his friends), in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jun/14/guardianobituaries.film\">Gregory Peck</a> plays an investigative journalist going undercover to expose antisemitism.</p> <p>The other was <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039286/\">Crossfire</a>, a B-movie directed by Edward Dmytryk, one of the original blacklisted <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hollywood-Ten\">Hollywood Ten</a>. It was actually based on a novel about about homophobia, but homosexuality was another subject that the Production Code prohibited. Arguably, it was because of the success of these \u201cmessage pictures\u201d, that Hollywood turned its attention to race prejudice with Pinky and another popular 1949 film, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041481/\">Home of the Brave</a>. The latter was based on a play about antisemitism in the armed forces but was given a black lead because, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/aug/01/arthur-laurents-musicals-interview\">as its gay author Arthur Laurents was told</a>: \u201cJews have been done.\u201d Hollywood picks its causes and progressiveness is not always linear. As with many more movie treatments of racism from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2012/jul/08/10-best-east-london-films\">Broken Blossoms</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/03/green-book-review-peter-farrelly-viggo-mortensen-mahershala-ali\">Green Book</a>, these films are deeply compromised if well-intentioned.</p> <p>Regardless, in Murphy\u2019s revisionist world Meg does indeed get made, with a little financial boost from Ernie and his gas-station hustlers. It is a hit with the public, after opening in the kind of \u201cwide\u201d release across the US that wouldn\u2019t be seen until the 70s. In real life, the biggest box-office hit of 1947 was musical comedy Welcome Stranger, starring Bing Crosby as a singing doctor.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3EASLgzOcM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q3EASLgzOcM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Hollywood on YouTube</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Meg also sweeps up at the Academy Awards, where Archie and Hudson share a very public kiss. This romantic moment sadly defies credibility. Although there were rumours, the culture of secrecy around homosexuality meant that Hudson\u2019s sexuality was not public knowledge until it was confirmed by friends <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/03/nancy-reagan-refused-help-dying-rock-hudson-get-aids-treatment\">shortly before his Aids-related death in 1985</a>. Hudson may have been a huge star, but studio \u201cmorality clauses\u201d kept him in the closet. The show refers to the story of William Haines, whose career ended in the 1930s after he rejected MGM\u2019s demand that he enter a lavender marriage. In the mid-50s, Hudson was married to Willson\u2019s secretary Phyllis Gates.</p> <p>Later in the ceremony, when Camille clutches her best actress Oscar for playing Meg, we witness a moment of triumph for women of colour in film that would not actually take place until the following century, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/jun/03/artsfeatures\">Halle Berry won for Monster\u2019s Ball in 2001 and began her speech by saying</a>: \u201cThis moment is so much bigger than me\u2026\u201d McDaniel was not even allowed in the room until the moment she was ushered in to accept her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/19/the-nine-greatest-oscar-moments-ceremony\">best supporting actress award</a> for playing Mammy in 1939\u2019s Gone With the Wind.</p> <p>Camille is banned from the room, too, as it happens, but she gathers her nerve and successfully demands a seat on the front row. Murphy seems to be implying that a woman of colour only needs to ask for a seat at the table, which is an offensive lie when you consider that even now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/feb/07/why-oscars-still-so-white-podcast\">the Oscars remain #SoWhite</a>, and the industry wildly unbalanced in terms of gender, race, sexuality and class diversity.</p> <p>In its own well-meaning way, Murphy\u2019s Hollywood is a rescue fantasy as outlandish as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/21/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review-tarantino-dazzling-dicaprio-pitt\">Quentin Tarantino\u2019s re-enactment of the Manson </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/21/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review-tarantino-dazzling-dicaprio-pitt\">murders</a>, in which Sharon and her unborn child are saved by the intervention of a stuntman. Murphy has imagined away decades of institutional prejudice in favour of an ahistorical narrative about optimists pluckily seizing control of the power structures. In the same way that Meg twists the tragic story of Peg Entwistle, Hollywood betrays the legacy of those who had to fight for their rightful place in the film industry. Hollywood suggests a happy ending is just within our grasp \u2013 but that only happens at the movies.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81088617\">Hollywood is on Netflix</a>.</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Just before lockdown, 29-year-old Ala Uddin became ill with coronavirus-related symptoms and had to self-isolate in his London flat. \u201cFor 23 days I was relying on video calls,\u201d he says. \u201cI hardly used them before, but now it was the only way I could see anyone and communicate with my housemate, even though we were living in rooms next to each other.\u201d Uddin was also regularly video-calling his parents and siblings in York, as well as family members in Bangladesh, all of whom were checking in to make sure he was coping. \u201cWithout video calls I don\u2019t know how I could have got through that time,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Since the pandemic hit, Zoom, FaceTime, Houseparty, Microsoft Teams and all manner of other video-calling apps have become so engrained in our lives. As one of the only safe ways to communicate, it\u2019s hard to imagine living without them. None of these have taken off quite like Zoom. At the end of December, the app reported a maximum of 10 million daily users. By March, <a href=\"https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/04/01/a-message-to-our-users/\" title=\"\">200 million</a> people were on it each day to work, socialise, view lessons and lectures, sing in choirs, attend church, birthday parties and weddings, meet new babies, say final words to dying family members and observe Ramadan and Easter. So embedded are these apps in all parts of life now that when Zoom went down last weekend, it made headlines around the world and even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/17/widespread-technical-issues-with-zoom-hits-uk-covid-19-briefing\" title=\"\">halted the Downing Street press conference</a>.</p> <p>For many of us, Zoom, and apps like it, are a necessary frustration \u2013 the technical glitches, the pixellated faces, the exhaustingly long meetings with colleagues with their bookcases in the background \u2013 are the price we pay for preventing the spread of a pandemic. But for others, many of them elderly or disabled, the Zoom boom has helped them become more sociable than before.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"614ec917866f769539c30dfe1528fc23eb2640f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/614ec917866f769539c30dfe1528fc23eb2640f6/0_0_1276_909/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dog on Zoom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Julie Taylor, 61, who is retired and lives in Wiltshire, had never used video-calling before the lockdown began, but now talks to her friends every day via Zoom. \u201cMy neighbour Ben, who is 15, told me about it and helped me set it all up by calling instructions over the fence. It\u2019s made me realise what I was missing out on before,\u201d she says. \u201cI live on my own and so calling my friends each day or calling into the weekly public council meetings has been doing a lot of good for me when I feel down in the dumps.\u201d Similarly, Uddin\u2019s grandmother in York has been lent a tablet with video-calling software. \u201cIt was so emotional seeing her once she got it working,\u201d he says. \u201cSince she hasn\u2019t been able to go out at all, I could see how comforted she was just by having my face there and knowing that we\u2019re all safe.\u201d</p> <p>When Emma Critchley-Lloyd, 31, a marketer living in London, started a Saturday night Zoom quiz with her family, she didn\u2019t realise it would bring them into contact more regularly than before. \u201cA lot of my relatives aren\u2019t very good with technology and I\u2019ve never even needed to have their email addresses before,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re now seeing each other more than we would before lockdown and I hope we can keep it going afterwards \u2026 It\u2019s been something to look forward to each week, even though it can be an effort to get on a video call after a day of work Zooms.\u201d</p> <p>The psychologist Dr Doreen Dodgen-Magee sees video-calling as being an essential but contentious part of our lives. \u201cAs social animals, we fail to thrive when we can\u2019t have meaningful connections with others, so video-calling is really important at the moment for helping us feel part of a community,\u201d she says. But it is not without its flaws. \u201cSpeaking over video is such a static way of connecting with people. We\u2019re used to a full sensory experience, which is lost when we\u2019re limited to a small square of someone\u2019s face with audio delays. Plus, we\u2019re always seeing our own faces, so there\u2019s a constant sense of internal judgment on how we look and the distraction of where we should even be looking.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b96605595b12d06efd696bd7fa735d611930665d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b96605595b12d06efd696bd7fa735d611930665d/0_0_1276_909/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Party on Zoom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Aside from the oddness of seeing our own faces in conversation \u2013 the painful reality of quite how badly the at-home haircut went or the frown lines that we never noticed before video-calling became the norm \u2013 many of us will also be juggling children or others in the room while we are trying to concentrate. It is a lot for our brains to contend with, so it\u2019s no wonder so many of us are experiencing Zoom fatigue.</p> <p>Tom, who is based in New York and works for a media company, has found himself on marathon seven- or eight-hour Zoom calls since lockdown began in the city. \u201cMy boss just has the video feed on all day and will fire instructions at us while he works so he doesn\u2019t have to call or email,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s so inefficient because we end up not being able to do all of the other work we need to and these calls are so much more tiring than normal conversation. By the end of the day my brain feels like it\u2019s been pulverised and the smallest task becomes a huge effort.\u201d</p> <p>In the absence of benign office chat about our weekends and what we had for dinner last night, which helps to de-stress us in work environments, all our work interactions are now \u201chyper-focused\u201d, says Pam Custers, a psychotherapist at the Counselling Directory. \u201cFor that reason, breaks are more important than ever, since we\u2019re doing all our work and socialising in one place.\u201d One of the reasons that work Zoom calls can feel so draining is the pressure to fill any gaps in conversation. \u201cSilence feels very unnatural on a video call,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we need to allow that thinking time, as well as having the host be mindful of when to draw things to a close, rather than letting them peter out \u2026 At the moment there is a notion that you\u2019re available all the time because people aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d The 40-minute limit on free Zoom accounts could be the ideal amount of time to use, she suggests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"504c9558a3b711772c84ce6f87986b029ce3f673\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/504c9558a3b711772c84ce6f87986b029ce3f673/0_0_1276_909/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Friends on Zoom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For the cyberpsychology researcher Dr Linda Kaye, the video-calling boom may be the closest we have got to seeing the early utopian ideals of the internet come to fruition. \u201cThe idea of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/web20\" title=\"\">Web 2.0</a> was for people to be active agents on the internet and this is somewhat being fulfilled now by using it for such connectivity, regardless of location. It seems like this technology is fostering a sense of unity, rather than exacerbating divisions as it may have been doing in recent years.\u201d This is particularly true in the case of those who were already housebound before the lockdown began; as music and theatre performances have moved online and video-calling has become the norm, it has in turn normalised their day-to-day interactions.</p> <p>Arif Miah, who has been launching a creative advertising agency during lockdown with Uddin, sees video-calling as a saving grace. \u201cRamadan has been so weird this year,\u201d he says. \u201cUsually the streets are full and there\u2019s celebrations, but right now it\u2019s like Christmas without the tree and presents \u2013 there\u2019s no joy. Technology has been such a blessing \u2013 I don\u2019t know how we would have kept each other motivated otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>Since Uddin is observing Ramadan alone in his flat, the pair break their fast each evening over a video call and have been sharing their meals with family over social media, too. \u201cIt\u2019s been so hectic starting the business and fasting in lockdown,\u201d Uddin says. \u201cWe\u2019re having to sleep late in the mornings and then work into the night, so even though the video calls have been tiring, they are essential, especially with older members of the family who haven\u2019t been able to see anyone since the lockdown started.\u201d</p> <p>But what if you can\u2019t afford a computer or the right phone or tablet to stay in touch? \u201cThere is a digital divide where some people will not have access to adequate internet speeds or the relevant technology and so they will be missing out,\u201d says Kaye.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca4e93ee5b41136f572a961d03bd5cad4ffa9857\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca4e93ee5b41136f572a961d03bd5cad4ffa9857/0_0_1276_909/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sad on Zoom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>James is a teacher in a London secondary school. \u201cMany of our students come from deprived backgrounds, so asking them to have all of this technology available [to attend online lessons] is just not feasible,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has put us in a real bind because we don\u2019t have the funds to help them get access to video-calling and so we\u2019re relying on them for independent study when they also now have extra caring duties with looking after younger siblings at home.\u201d</p> <p>Social inequalities are stark on screen when faced with a direct link into people\u2019s homes. Background graphics on Zoom might create a temporary solution and online parody accounts such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ratemyskyperoom?lang=en\" title=\"\">Room Rater</a> have sprung up to poke fun at TV guests\u2019 home settings. The diversity and inclusion consultant Sara Chandran has heard of one company going so far as to instigate a \u201cvirtual house tour\u201d as a supposedly fun way to keep their employees engaged. \u201cThose in decision-making positions are often coming from a place of privilege,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are deeply concerned about their futures and so doing a tour to show off your house probably isn\u2019t going to help when many employees will be self-conscious about the state of their living spaces, especially if they are renting in house shares and fighting to find an area to quietly work in. That\u2019s likely something they won\u2019t want to share with their bosses.\u201d</p> <p>There is also the issue of how Zoom and other apps prioritise speakers. \u201cThe person who speaks loudest can often command the most space on video calls because they can just ignore the others, so it makes it much harder for people who are anxious to participate,\u201d says Chandran. This could particularly affect employees who are lower down in the pay scale and already wary of putting a foot wrong, as well as ethnic minorities who may have concerns about speaking up in a largely white space.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba89717a717992219358fc8e8a1e3a133ef4d291\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba89717a717992219358fc8e8a1e3a133ef4d291/0_0_1276_909/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tired on Zoom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As the psychologist Prof Robin Dunbar, of the University of Oxford, <a href=\"http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2016-01-20-how-face-face-still-beats-facebook-0\" title=\"\">found in his 2016 study of online relationships</a>, there is no substitute for face-to-face contact when it comes to maintaining friendships. It is important to remember this when we are scheduling Zoom social events, says Dodgen-Magee. \u201cUltimately, too much video-calling can be disassociating and make us feel alone even when we are together on screen,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to remember the value of interpersonal relationships and to really work for them again when we\u2019re allowed out.\u201d In the meantime, she recommends limiting your number of video calls to the number of face-to-face meetings you would have each day, as well as developing visual cues to signal when people might want to speak on group calls.</p> <p>Chandran finds there are some positives we can take away, though. \u201cThis lockdown has broken down a lot of barriers for many people who are disabled or who might have caring responsibilities in fast-tracking working from home and making workplaces accessible \u2013 which were all things companies used to say would be way off in the future,\u201d she says. \u201cSo, we need to continue with these developments when lockdown ends and everyone should try and keep up the empathy and understanding they have hopefully learned by going through such a traumatic experience together.\u201d She hopes that, in the future, working from home will become the norm for those who require it, while companies will take the time to find out what their employees require in order to perform at their best, whether that means flexible working or more face-to-face meetings.</p> <p>\u201cWe do have to remember we are all in this together,\u201d Uddin says. \u201cVideo-calling is a great way to stay safe, but I\u2019m just looking forward to seeing people again. There really is no substitute for just sitting in each other\u2019s presence, even if you\u2019re not saying anything.\u201d</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed</em></p>",
  "<p>One day in the summer of 2017, I was sitting at a cafe table in the atrium of Portcullis House, across the road from the Palace of Westminster. With indoor trees and a good coffee bar, it\u2019s a pleasant place for politicians and their staff to meet, outside their cramped offices. I was there to interview an MP for a research project, hoping to learn more about how MPs understood climate change, and how that shaped their work in parliament.</p> <p>The MP arrived. She was young and, at least on the surface, full of confidence. I explained that my interviews would be anonymised, so that she and others could talk freely about how they came to their public positions on climate. She told me she regularly speaks for her party on climate change, telling people about the need for action to tackle emissions. And yet, she said, there was a catch: lots of people in the constituency she represents have jobs in an industry responsible for huge amounts of carbon pollution.</p> <p>She had two, conflicting, demands: she wanted urgent action on climate; and she also wanted government support to allow her local industry to continue polluting. She was simultaneously backing and opposing climate action. She was worried that someone \u2013 maybe a constituent or the local paper \u2013 would point out this glaring contradiction. But so far, no one had. \u201cI thought I might get a bit of pushback,\u201d she told me. \u201cI\u2019ve had absolutely zero.\u201d</p> <p>This contradiction sums up the state of climate politics in the UK today. There is strong cross-party support for far-reaching carbon targets. In June last year, the government passed a law to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/11/theresa-may-commits-to-net-zero-uk-carbon-emissions-by-2050\" title=\"\">strengthen these targets</a>, committing the UK to end virtually all emissions of carbon and other greenhouse gases within the next 30 years. There was next to no opposition \u2013 in fact, Labour and the Liberal Democrats argued for an earlier phase-out date. And yet politicians are oddly reluctant to talk about how we might actually meet these targets. There is very little honest debate about the major changes to our economy and society that will be needed if we are to meet this challenge. Like my interviewee, we\u2019re all in favour of climate action, but we haven\u2019t yet had an honest conversation about the power and the vested interests involved, or the choices that will have to be made if we are to achieve significant reductions in emissions.</p> <p>I have come to think of this as the dual reality of climate politics. We know that things need to change, and yet we\u2019re embedded in our current lives and our current politics. We exist in both realities at once. Politicians make grand statements about the threat of climate change, then flip straight back into politics-as-usual. They find it hard to imagine, and to get others to imagine, how we might talk about and bring into being a politics with climate at its heart. It\u2019s easier to look away.</p> <p>In recent months, though, politics has changed almost beyond recognition. The coronavirus pandemic is a global crisis that alters fundamentally the way we see risks, politics, and the relationship between people and society. Like everyone else, I am not sure what the world will look like on the other side. The only certainty is that everything <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/how-will-the-world-emerge-from-the-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">will be different</a>. If, as I\u2019ve described, politicians have until now been finding it hard to contemplate radical changes to the status quo, has this barrier now fallen away?</p> <p>Covid-19 is, understandably, taking up all the political and media attention there is, for now. But the need for fast, radical carbon cuts \u2013 and a political strategy that will allow this to happen \u2013 has not gone away. Will green investment be prioritised in the economic stimulus packages that are undoubtedly needed? Will people think differently about travel or food security? Will we emerge with a politics that focuses more on a collective approach to global challenges such as climate? Or will we fall back into desperate attempts to rekindle the old economy and the old ways? For now, there are only questions. But my research offers some clues about how the recovery could be climate-proofed.</p> <h2>* * *<br></h2> <p>I\u2019ve worked with politicians for many years. In the early days of Tony Blair\u2019s administration, I got a job with the thinktank Green Alliance. I started to look into the backgrounds of new Labour MPs, trying to find ways of connecting with them on environmental issues. We worked with the Conservatives in opposition, too, so that they could hold the government to account. Gradually, climate issues grabbed a political foothold. In 2006, the Tories went into a local election campaign with the slogan \u201cvote blue, go green\u201d, and the parties began to compete for environmentally minded voters. Then in 2009, came the Climate Change Act, a comprehensive piece of legislation setting legally binding carbon targets into UK law.</p> <p>Even then, the dual reality was evident. Despite the obvious implications for economy and society, there was precious little media coverage or political debate about these new laws. I asked a senior Labour figure what discussions there had been about the act as it went through parliament. \u201cI don\u2019t remember it being one of the big issues,\u201d she told me. All the talk had been of counter-terrorism and banning smoking in public places. For climate, in contrast, \u201cI remember it going on in the background, but it wasn\u2019t something that had high temperature\u201d. Politicians quietly passed a radical act of parliament committing the UK to serious change \u2013 and then carried on as normal.</p> <p>That same year the act was passed, I had an idea that came to dominate my working life for a decade. Frustrated by the mismatch between the scale of the climate challenge and the response from politicians, I wanted to make sure that the next generation of MPs were equipped with all the evidence and skills they needed to make informed decisions on climate. New MPs are lobbied from all sides, but they are offered very little training or support for their new and often daunting roles. Climate science, and climate policy, is complex. How could we expect them to lead us if they didn\u2019t understand what it was all about?</p> <p>With the backing of Green Alliance and some philanthropic funders, I set up a training programme. We offered parliamentary candidates and new MPs the chance to learn about the science, policy and politics of climate in a series of tailor-made workshops. We worked with small groups of around 10 politicians, all from the same party, to allow them to question and debate freely. We asked leading climate scientists to join us to answer the MPs\u2019 questions. Businesspeople came to talk through how they were thinking about the likely impact of climate change on their companies, and climate activists explained why they campaigned on the issue. At the end of each workshop, the new MPs got together with more senior politicians \u2013 ministers or frontbenchers \u2013 to debate what climate change meant for the outlook, values and strategy of their party.</p> <p>Running these workshops was a fascinating experience. In each, there was a definite point which I came to think of as a \u201cpenny-drop moment\u201d, when the participants came to realise the significance of the climate crisis and the way it would shape our collective future. In one workshop, for example, a very eminent scientist explained to MPs how crop yields are likely to be severely affected by extreme weather, a likely scenario if global average temperatures rise by 2C or more \u2013 and that this could lead to food shortages. The response was striking. There was a silence, a collective intake of breath, a recognition of the significance of the changes that could be upon us if we don\u2019t act.</p> <p>And then, at the end of our workshop, they walked out of the door and back to their normal lives.</p> <p>We kept talking to them. We organised more briefings, and we worked with them in their constituencies to bring climate issues home. In Sheffield, we talked about how communities could set up and own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/12/community-generated-green-electricity-to-be-offered-to-all-in-uk\" title=\"\">renewable energy projects</a>. In Nottingham, we talked about resilience to floods. They were polite conversations, but all the time, that sense of dual reality was with me. If they understood the seriousness of climate change, I thought constantly, why aren\u2019t they doing more?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"afcb85fa426712679510187631f7a82fbdd47560\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afcb85fa426712679510187631f7a82fbdd47560/0_0_4597_3065/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MPs from various parties meeting climate activist Greta Thunberg at the Houses of Parliament in April last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MPs from various parties meeting climate activist Greta Thunberg at the Houses of Parliament in April last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I became a little bit obsessed with this question. I wanted to see whether they worried about climate, or whether they had somehow convinced themselves that it would all be OK. I decided I would ask them directly. And so, in 2015, with Lancaster University, I set up my research project in order to learn more about how MPs understood climate change, and its implications for political life. I chose to work with a small number of MPs \u2013 23 in all \u2013 to get a detailed, qualitative understanding of their views. I spoke to politicians from all parties and all levels of seniority. The only group I left alone were the small, but nonetheless influential, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/11/tory-mps-five-times-more-likely-to-vote-against-climate-action\" title=\"\">number of known \u201cclimate sceptic\u201d MPs</a>, who publicly state that they do not accept the scientific consensus on climate change.</p> <p>I offered my interviewees anonymity. Many displayed a disarming frankness about their professional and personal struggles, often at odds with their appearance of breezy confidence.</p> <p>All the politicians I spoke to accepted the science of climate change. And yet they downplayed the consequences. They showed a reluctance to discuss how climate change would reshape human society. A newly elected MP, talking to me in the House of Commons, told me that climate \u201cterrified\u201d him. \u201cWhere we\u2019re sat right now might well be underwater, right next to the Thames. I wouldn\u2019t fancy our chances.\u201d</p> <p>I asked why, if it\u2019s so significant, it wasn\u2019t discussed much in parliament. But he didn\u2019t answer. He couldn\u2019t, or didn\u2019t want to, linger on this point: he steered the discussion on to electoral cycles, the health service, the economy. He was back in the manageable normality he knew, rejecting the reality of a climate-changed future that had, just a few moments before, terrified him.</p> <p>Over the course of the interviews, carried out between 2016 and 2018, I saw a pattern emerge. The way politicians responded to climate didn\u2019t just depend on what they thought about the science. Instead, it became clear to me that there were two main reasons why MPs struggled with the issue: first, because it didn\u2019t fit easily into the culture of political life and their own identity as a parliamentarian; and second, because they worried that public support for climate action was limited, and that, as representatives, they needed to be led by their electorate.</p> <h2>* * *<br></h2> <p>It\u2019s obvious that the House of Commons is an institution with a strong internal culture. Yet I was surprised by the extent to which the MPs I spoke to felt constrained by the social norms of their workplace. In one conversation, my interviewee was deliciously unguarded in her opinions of her colleagues. She said that just a few of her 600 or so fellow parliamentarians took climate seriously as an issue: \u201cYou might not get into double figures.\u201d She told me she saw everything through a climate lens, and was, in private, very critical of measures such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/25/british-taxpayers-bill-tax-relief-oil-gas-companies\" title=\"\">tax breaks for oil and gas exploration</a>. And yet she felt that she had to tread carefully: she has to fit in. I asked her what would happen if she tried to intervene in a budget debate, to make the case that fossil fuels should stay in the ground. She replied: \u201cI think they\u2019d just think you were a bit \u2018niche\u2019, is the way I\u2019d put it \u2013 I say \u2018niche\u2019 in quotes, like a bit of a lunatic fringe.\u201d</p> <p>One former MP, who had been an active climate campaigner in parliament, said: \u201cI was known as being a freak.\u201d Another told me about how he tried to avoid being seen as a \u201czealot\u201d. These remarks were common in my conversations with politicians. Some said they avoided any mention of climate for fear that it would put an unhelpful label on them. One confident, outspoken MP who worked on energy policy told me that he did what he could to promote policies that would reduce carbon, but justified his proposals on other grounds, such as reducing fuel bills. \u201cI don\u2019t use climate change as the word because I think it\u2019s just toxic,\u201d he told me. \u201cAs is the way in these issues which are contentious, you won\u2019t take people with you politically.\u201d</p> <p>This shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. We know the way people think and act is conditioned by their social world. This plays far more of a role in our responses to climate change than we might imagine \u2013 and politicians are no exception.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a4fd2319fcf5ac28d3ff3dd9d56b9b7dc53173b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4fd2319fcf5ac28d3ff3dd9d56b9b7dc53173b9/0_75_3754_4688/801.jpg\" alt=\"Sir David Attenborough addresses the Climate Assembly UK in January this year.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir David Attenborough addresses the Climate Assembly UK in January this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Stonehouse/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back in 2001, the anthropologist Kari Norgaard spent a year living in a rural Norwegian village. That winter, the weather was unusually warm. The lake didn\u2019t freeze over, and the local ski resort had not received any snow by mid-December, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/19/snow-machines-fleece-blankets-inside-ski-industry-battle-with-climate-change-alpine-resorts\" title=\"\">having to resort to artificial snow</a> \u2013 something that had not happened before. Income from the ski industry was reduced, and the tradition of ice fishing was interrupted. When talking about this and other weather patterns, villagers mentioned climate change, and seemed to have a good level of understanding. And yet climate was not something that people factored into their daily lives.</p> <p>Norgaard uncovered a paradox: people were aware of, and concerned by, climate change, but chose to ignore it. It was an unspoken collective turning away. She asked: \u201cHow could the possibility of climate change be deeply disturbing and almost completely invisible \u2013 simultaneously unimaginable and common knowledge?\u201d She labelled this phenomenon \u201csocially organised denial\u201d. Norgaard pointed to a range of strategies people used that allowed them to continue as if climate change wasn\u2019t happening. Some said that Norway was a relatively small country, with insignificant emissions compared to the US. There was also a widespread sense that, as a rural community, they lived simply and \u201cwith nature\u201d. By telling each other these and other stories, they created the fiction that all could continue unchanged.</p> <p>Socially organised denial is alive and well in the Commons. It is exacerbated by very deliberate strategies from those who have a stake in high-carbon activities: countries, and companies, that depend on fossil fuels.</p> <p>As a result, it is surprisingly difficult for politicians to talk openly about the need to transition away from fossil fuels. Witness Nicola Sturgeon, leader of a progressive Scottish government that champions strong climate commitments, while also supporting continued oil and gas extraction in the North Sea. When challenged, her reply is always the same: the industry \u201ccannot be shut down overnight\u201d. She\u2019s right. But her dismissive response shies away from the science, which tells us very clearly that fossil fuels need to stay in the ground, and that we need a plan to move away from them, and create opportunities and jobs elsewhere \u2013 not overnight, but urgently.</p> <p>The toxic combination of socially organised denial and deliberate lobbying has created a problem that I\u2019ve come to think of as the \u201cfeelgood fallacy\u201d. So far, climate action has focused overwhelmingly on low-carbon solutions such as developing renewable energy or offering grants for electric vehicles. These are very valuable schemes, but all this positive activity masks a deeper problem. Little has been done to curb carbon-intensive activity. New coal mines are opened and new airports built with little discussion of climate impacts. If we are constantly finding new ways to dig up and burn carbon, it won\u2019t be enough just to ramp up renewable energy. Study after study shows that meeting climate goals means phasing out the extraction and use of oil, coal and gas \u2013 yet no mainstream political party has a coherent plan to do this.</p> <p>If pressed, politicians like Sturgeon could hide behind a quirk in the rules of carbon accounting. According to conventions set by the United Nations, we count the carbon where it\u2019s burned, not where it\u2019s taken out of the ground. This creates a strange incentive to dig more up, ship it out and let other countries take the hit on their carbon target. But what might make accounting sense for one country works directly against the global goal of reducing emissions.</p> <h2>* * *<br></h2> <p>Politicians, then, are constrained by the culture of political life. They also feel constrained by the electorate. There was a striking consistency in my interviews: no MP felt that their voters were putting them under particular pressure to act. As one said to me, \u201cI\u2019ve knocked hundreds, literally thousands of doors, and had tens of thousands of conversations with voters \u2026 and I just don\u2019t have conversations about climate change.\u201d</p> <p>Many of these conversations took place before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/school-climate-strikes\" title=\"\">school climate strikes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion\" title=\"\">Extinction Rebellion</a> protests began in 2018 \u2013 these were remarkable events, after which the polls showed heightened levels of concern. Yet speaking to politicians during and after the 2019 election, I heard a lot of uncertainty about how this generalised concern might translate into support for particular climate strategies. And this matters, particularly in the UK\u2019s constituency-based system, where MPs feel a particularly strong attachment to the local patch, described by one as \u201calmost like being a parent. It\u2019s got the sort of joys and terror associated with that type of emotional connection.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2110a813d81f6d8e75d87510732c26beff873300\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2110a813d81f6d8e75d87510732c26beff873300/210_0_1790_1127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Extinction Rebellion climate protest in the House of Commons public gallery in April 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"630\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Extinction Rebellion climate protest in the House of Commons public gallery in April 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Extinction Rebellion/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Exactly how a politician \u201crepresents\u201d the people is not at all straightforward. When an MP campaigns against a hospital closure, they are, in effect, saying\u201d: \u201cI am campaigning for local health services and this makes me a worthy representative of this area.\u201d This is a relatively straightforward claim. With climate \u2013 a complex, global issue with no clear beginning or end \u2013 it\u2019s more complicated. Politicians have to work quite hard to make a claim for why acting on climate is in the best interests of their electorate.</p> <p>They might do this through pointing out that a global problem such as climate change requires everyone to do their bit. But this claim is often ignored, because people are understandably caught up with their daily lives and struggles, or feel powerless, cynical or overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge. Some politicians point out the economic or social benefits of climate action, such as jobs in renewable energy. As one told me: \u201cI\u2019m happy to use an economic argument if that means more people will come on side.\u201d Another told me about proposals for a new road in his constituency, which he opposed. If he had used a climate argument, he said, \u201cthere would have been a rolling of eyes and saying: \u2018Oh, here he goes again.\u2019\u201d Instead, he made the case on economic grounds, saying that investment in public transport was a better option.</p> <p>There\u2019s a danger in dampening down the message in this way. If politicians don\u2019t speak out, people don\u2019t feel a sense of urgency. They are less likely to support climate action if they don\u2019t see their politicians leading the way, or offering up a strategy that is as serious as the problem it is designed to address. Climate politics becomes a silent standoff, with neither citizens nor representatives willing to make the first move.</p> <p>But this standoff contains the seeds of a solution. If politicians have the confidence to lead, to see climate action as a social contract between citizens and politicians, this is likely to lead to greater support. What could a confident climate politics look like?</p> <h2>* * *<br></h2> <p>In this new world of the coronavirus pandemic, this question is all the more urgent. Some have cheered the unintentional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/30/clean-air-in-europe-during-lockdown-leads-to-11000-fewer-deaths\" title=\"\">environmental benefits of lockdown</a>. It\u2019s certainly true that the air is cleaner, the streets quieter. We can hear the birdsong. Carbon emissions have taken a dive, too. But this is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/steep-fall-emissions-during-coronavirus-no-cause-for-celebration\" title=\"\">in no way a model</a> for climate strategy. Experience from China has shown that emissions bounce back pretty quickly once lockdown restrictions are eased. But most importantly, lockdown has imposed untold misery and sacrifice. This is emphatically not what is needed for climate action. Instead, politicians need to talk about a purposeful transition: not the juddering halt of lockdown, but the managed transformation of our economy, so wellbeing increases as carbon falls.</p> <p>What the pandemic does provide, though, is the possibility of change. The government has done things in the last few weeks that no one thought possible: paying the wages of millions of private-sector workers; shoring up company finances; involving itself in the lives of individuals in ways that would previously have caused the hackles of even the most radical of politicians to rise. Fundamentally, we are rethinking the relationship between state and citizen. As citizens, we have realised that we need the state to keep us safe from crises, be they immediate, like Covid-19, or longer term, like climate change. Politicians, for their part, have realised that people can rise to the challenge, if they understand what they need to do and why.</p> <p>Once the trauma of lockdown eases, the rebuilding begins. This is perhaps the point at which the risks and opportunities for climate are at their most stark. The government could choose to align its recovery strategy with its climate strategy, or, in the rush to prop up an ailing economy, it could do the opposite \u2013 handing money out in such a way as to safeguard the high-carbon economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dedac528d1bc759b9c5130ba1ec29d18758dbfac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dedac528d1bc759b9c5130ba1ec29d18758dbfac/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaigning for a Green New Deal in Washington DC in November 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaigning for a Green New Deal in Washington DC in November 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Reynolds/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If we are to make the right choice here, as a society, the essential first step is a simple one: speaking out. Politicians, and others, need to speak openly and with unflinching honesty about the significance of climate change. As my conversations with MPs have shown, this is a surprisingly difficult thing to do. The left has made a start, with its idea of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/12/the-guardian-view-on-a-green-new-deal-we-need-it-now\" title=\"\">Green New Deal</a>. In the US, politicians led by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey put forward <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/11/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ed-markey\" title=\"\">a plan</a> aiming for net-zero emissions and 100% renewable energy, including job creation in manufacturing, economic justice and even universal healthcare.</p> <p>Following Covid-19, what the Green New Deal now offers is, essentially, a green route to recovery. The plan has many critics, but compared to the low-key approach favoured by UK politicians, it has the advantage of being idealistic, bold and honest. It tells a story about climate action that aims to connect with voters. Elements of this approach could be seen in Labour\u2019s 2019 election offer. On the political right, though, despite support for ambitious targets, there is a distinct lack of a clear story on climate.</p> <p>A second step is to open up a more meaningful dialogue between citizens and politicians. One practical way is through processes like citizens\u2019 assemblies. Early this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/16/climate-assembly-uk-concludes-in-world-transformed-by-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Climate Assembly UK</a> got underway. This gathering of 110 representative UK citizens, commissioned by six select committees, has heard evidence from experts on climate science and responses, has discussed and deliberated on possible solutions, and will shortly report its findings back to parliament.</p> <p>Third, improving conversations on climate change almost certainly requires more of an appeal to the heart as well as the head. The language of cost-benefit analysis and gross domestic product has its uses, but its appeal is limited, and it accentuates the divide between experts and public, rather than breaking it down. Yet this is the language that politicians have used until now. There are parallels here with the Brexit debate. Remain politicians thought they could win by putting forward a clear-headed case for economic stability, but they left the emotion out of it. In truth, we need both. People care about family, fairness and decency, and an enabling state, looking out for the interests of its citizens. This is exactly how climate action could be framed. Following the coronavirus shutdown, there\u2019s an opportunity to involve people in shaping the way we rebuild our societies and economies, to increase resilience against future threats \u2013 not least, those arising from climate change.</p> <p>Every politician is reassured if they know there is support for their proposals. They can\u2019t govern in a vacuum. We can\u2019t afford to be silent now, when politicians are debating our future. Street protests are out of the question at the moment, but there are many ways to make your voice heard. Talk to MPs and local councillors about your views on climate. Get in touch by phone or email. Ask them what they think; make it a dialogue. From a politician\u2019s point of view, showing your strength of feeling as a citizen, as someone who doesn\u2019t normally kick up a fuss, is immensely powerful.</p> <p>Given a meaningful opportunity to have their say, most people would support action in the face of the climate breakdown that is unfolding in front of us. But our democracies, in their current form, are just not offering people that choice. Politicians and citizens, if they take each other seriously, can turn this around. <br><br>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">weekly email here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>You could spend a lifetime preparing to interview John Malkovich. For starters, there are his films, about 90 of them \u2013 mainstream, indie, European arthouse, schlocky, literary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/29/being-john-malkovich-charlie-kaufman-review\">self-referential</a>, lots of stinkers and a few classics. But he says he doesn\u2019t even like movies. So then there are his more esoteric projects: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/08/malkovich-malkovich-malkovich-catherine-edelman-chicago\">a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/08/malkovich-malkovich-malkovich-catherine-edelman-chicago\">photography exhibition by Sandro Miller in which Malkovich recreated</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/08/malkovich-malkovich-malkovich-catherine-edelman-chicago\"> iconic portraits</a>, including Dorothea Lange\u2019s Migrant Mother; collaborations with classical musicians in which he reads out venomous critiques of the great composers. Finally, there is his real love \u2013 theatre. Fortunately, Malkovich doesn\u2019t expect you to have seen all his work. In fact, he gives the impression that he would be happy if you had seen none.</p> <p>I first interviewed him 27 years ago when he had just made <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107206/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\">In </a><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107206/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\">the Line of Fire</a> \u2013 a thriller in which he plays an assassin determined to kill the president (and which is one of his classics). He didn\u2019t mention the film once in our hour-long meeting. Today, he is supposed to be promoting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/ng-interactive/2018/mar/06/whats-on-netflix-and-amazon-this-month\">Space Force</a>, a Netflix comedy. Again, he doesn\u2019t mention it, until I ask at the end of our call. Instead, he talks about loss. All sorts of loss, from weight (shedding 32kg \u2013 5st \u2013 as a teenager) to hair to money \u2013 and even three siblings in their 50s. But, oddly, the more he talks about loss, in that hushed, melancholy voice, the more I begin to suspect he is one of life\u2019s unlikely optimists.</p> <p>Malkovich is 66, into his fifth decade in the film industry, and insists he has been winging it the whole time. \u201cI certainly never had a plan.\u201d Would it bother him if he never got another job offer? \u201cNo!\u201d He sounds positively enthused. \u201cIt would require a change in the way we live. But we already did that 12 years ago. So that would be fine.\u201d</p> <p>In December 2008, Malkovich lost his life savings. \u201cOur then business manager had invested pretty much everything we\u2019d ever made with somebody called Bernie Madoff.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/12/bernie-madoff-prison-life-ponzi-supernova-podcast-experience\">Madoff defrauded thousands of investors out of an estimated $64.8bn</a> and was given a 150-year jail sentence in 2009. \u201cEverything I\u2019d ever made was gone.\u201d</p> <p>Malkovich had been directing a play in Mexico City and had just returned to New York. \u201cI saw a picture of Bernie Madoff in handcuffs and said to my wife: \u2018I\u2019m going to go to the corner to get a packet of cigarettes. I think we have a little problem with Madoff.\u2019\u201d How did he feel? \u201cYou know, that was a couple of days of shock, I suppose.\u201d He tells the story with such languid insouciance that I initially assume it must be for effect \u2013 but I don\u2019t think it is. This is the real Malkovich.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b12278fb27bbbf8a3ef367278bb02c0c0df5a6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b12278fb27bbbf8a3ef367278bb02c0c0df5a6f/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Malkovich as Dr Adrian Mallory in Space Force\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The final frontier ...

A lot. But I don\u2019t think it mattered that much. We just made changes to the way we lived and the money we spent.\u201d What changed? \u201cI had to do more work that paid for a number of years, and work all the time. And I stopped paying for everything. I just stopped paying for friends and family for a time. And we used to spend a lot of money producing movies that lost quite a lot of money. That stopped.\u201d</p> <p>Was he angry? \u201cNo. Not really. The first couple of days.\u201d Malkovich talks more slowly than anybody I know. Pretty much every word is accompanied by a pause. His language is flat and restrained \u2013 almost self-consciously untheatrical \u2013 even when telling the most dramatic stories. \u201cAfter a couple or three days, you go: \u2018You\u2019re lucky to be alive, you\u2019re lucky to have a job.\u2019 Almost no one has money in the banks. I read somewhere that a huge percentage of Americans wouldn\u2019t have $400 to put between their hands in an emergency.\u201d</p> <p>Malkovich grew up in a fairly privileged, but combustible, family in small-town middle America. His mother owned and edited the local paper in Benton, Illinois, and his father became an environmental journalist and activist. He grew up with three younger sisters and an older brother and has talked about the violence of his childhood \u2013 beatings from his father and his brother, Danny.</p> <p>Today, he says there was nothing remarkable about it. \u201cYou crossed the line and you got a beating. That was very common at that time. Sure, I had a lot of violence growing up, but so what?\u201d Is it true he would chase his brother with a butcher\u2019s knife? There is a long pause, even by Malkovich standards. \u201cMy brother didn\u2019t get anything he didn\u2019t deserve. That\u2019s not saying I didn\u2019t love him \u2013 he\u2019s gone now. He could be hilarious, very smart and extremely witty, but he was quite the torturer.\u201d Another pause. \u201cPeople get sick of being tortured.\u201d</p> <p>At the age of 16, he weighed 102kg (225lb) and was nicknamed Piggy. \u201cKids aren\u2019t very nice,\u201d he says. He went on a jelly-only diet and lost almost a third of his body weight. Yet even when he was mocked by his peers, he had style and self-belief. \u201cI used to play baseball and, when I was young, my father was my coach. He always said to me: if I cared about playing half as much as I cared about how I looked while playing, I could have been a very good baseball player.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14024c9e8b1d8984dbb9a71c578c26117e2968d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14024c9e8b1d8984dbb9a71c578c26117e2968d3/45_0_1165_1165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Malkovich with Michelle Pfeiffer in 1988\u2019s Dangerous Liaisons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Life imitates art ... starring in 1988\u2019s Dangerous Liaisons opposite Michelle Pfeiffer, with whom he had an affair.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In fact, Malkovich had wanted to become a professional pitcher. He only started acting because he fancied a girl in the drama group. Even then, his route into acting took detours. He drove a bus, dabbled in biology and sociology at college, then studied theatre at two universities in Illinois \u2013 dropping out of both. He moved to Chicago and became a founding member of the Steppenwolf theatre group, alongside Terry Kinney, Jeff Perry, and Gary Sinise (who directed and starred with Malkovich in Of Mice and Men).</p> <p>In its early years, the theatre\u2019s ensemble also included Glenne Headly, whom he later married, and Joan Allen. The latter said the young Malkovich, who dressed in an array of purples and long scarves, was a cross between Oscar Wilde and Franz Liszt. He was compared to Brando after he burned up the stage in Sam Shepard\u2019s True West in 1980.</p> <p>Four years later, he received an Oscar nomination for his first (non-extra) film part, playing a blind man in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087921/\">Places In </a><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087921/\">the Heart</a>. <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094947/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\">Dangerous Liaisons</a> made him a household name in 1988. His on-screen affair with Michelle Pfeiffer was replicated off screen and led to the collapse of his marriage to Headly. He ended up with neither woman and suffered a year-long depression. In 1989, he made <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100594/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\">The Sheltering Sky</a> and fell in love with the second assistant director, Nicoletta Peyran, with whom he has been since.</p> <p>Slightly boss-eyed, balding by his early 20s, with legs like sequoias and an incipient belly, Malkovich made an unlikely leading man. But there was something about him \u2013 part brute, part beauty. He had grace, swagger, energy, sexuality. His contradictions made for a thrilling presence. The first time I met him, he gave a little bow when he introduced himself. He may have been 1.9 metres (6ft 2in) tall and heavily set, but he reminded me of a geisha.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think anybody enjoys their family dying. I liked all mine. But what can you do? It\u2019s the final act in life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In films, he has excelled at preening seducers. There are the obvious ones (the foppish predator Valmont in Dangerous Liaisons) and the less obvious (crazed Mitch Leary in In the Line of Fire is utterly bewitching). He can still be every bit as seductive today \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/02/the-new-pope-review-john-malkovich-paolo-sorrentino-jude-law\">his fabulously vain John Paul III</a> in Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s classy TV series The New Pope is irresistible.</p> <p>Does he recognise himself in these characters? Not really, he says \u2013 apart from the vanity. \u201cMany of these characters are cold or cruel or intellectual.\u201d Is he cold in real life? He sounds hurt. \u201cMaybe shy sometimes. I don\u2019t think anybody who knew me would consider me cold. I may be wrong. And seducer the same \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t associate it with myself. Intellectual I wouldn\u2019t associate with myself. More class clown than any of that.\u201d</p> <p>He says he loves playing for laughs. One of my favourite Malkovich films is a little-known comedy called The Great Buck Howard, in which he plays a famous magician fallen on hard times. It is a gloriously hammy performance. He sounds delighted when I tell him. \u201cYeah, I enjoyed doing that immensely and am glad you noticed. I prefer to have fun.\u201d</p> <p>Really? There are so many stories of him being tough and intimidating, I say. \u201cI was athletic and I guess fairly strong in some ways, but don\u2019t consider myself tough; I don\u2019t consider myself someone looking for trouble.\u201d So these stories are apocryphal? Try me, he says. Well, what about the time you were mugged and ran home to get a knife, threw the mugger against a tree and said if he ever did it again he would be dead? \u201cIt\u2019s pretty apocryphal,\u201d he says. OK, the time you broke a bus window with your fist in temper? \u201cTrue. They wouldn\u2019t let me get on the bus.\u201d Were you in a lot of pain afterwards? \u201cI was, yes.\u201d</p> <p>Malkovich does bullying rage with aplomb on screen. He recently played a character based on Harvey Weinstein in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/19/bitter-wheat-review-malkovich-and-mamets-monstrous-misfire\">the David Mamet farce Bitter Wheat</a>. So many actors tell you they need to be able to sympathise with their characters, but Malkovich\u2019s isn\u2019t having any of that. \u201cI don\u2019t feel the need to be sympathetic. I didn\u2019t see much in that character to feel sympathetic with.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2d61284fc88ad82ad964b90793e5864842a4df55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d61284fc88ad82ad964b90793e5864842a4df55/0_0_1873_2050/914.jpg\" alt=\"John Malkovich playing a version of himself in Being John Malkovich.\" width=\"914\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t consider it to be so much about me as about the nature of celebrity\u2019 ... playing a version of himself in Being John Malkovich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext Collection/Sportsphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Was he shocked that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/harvey-weinstein-sentencing-rape-conviction\">Weinstein got a 23-year prison sentence</a>? \u201cI was shocked he even got a sentence. I don\u2019t know anybody who believed he would go to jail.\u201d He says it is too early to know whether the #MeToo movement has changed the culture of the film industry, but he hopes so. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible thing if somebody\u2019s job depends on what sexual favour they will give in return for work.\u201d Was that the culture? \u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>Did he experience it first-hand? \u201cWhen I was young, I had a professor in the theatre department who made some advances that were unwanted. I was 19, he was in his 50s.\u201d Malkovich says he was lucky. \u201cI just said it wasn\u2019t my thing, sorry. It was someone I was fond of and I liked. So life went on. I did transfer schools, but not really because of that. The Weinstein situation is very different. It was transactional. It\u2019s terrible for women, but it\u2019s horrific also just for the idea of work.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps Malkovich\u2019s best-known film is Being John Malkovich \u2013 the brilliant absurdist comedy in which a puppeteer discovers a portal into the actor\u2019s head and then flogs tickets for it to the public. Malkovich plays Malkovich, or the Malkovich we think we know from his parts \u2013 serious-minded, arty, sleazy, with a volcanic temper. \u201cI don\u2019t consider it to be so much about me as about the future and about the nature of celebrity.\u201d He says that when he read the script, he loved it, but he asked the screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, if he could direct it and Kaufman could make it about Tom Cruise. Kaufman gave him a firm no.</p> <p>For a number of years, Malkovich lived in France with his family (his children are 30 and 28). Now he is back in the US, living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, just outside Boston. Throughout lockdown, he has been at home with Peyran, now an academic, and their daughter, Amandine, who works in a grocery shop; his son, Loewy, is in Oregon, computer coding. No actors, then? \u201cOh, no!\u201d He sounds pleased.</p> <p>The actor has a reputation as a warmongering neo-con \u2013 he was in favour of invading Iraq and once said of the death penalty: \u201cI would have no problem pushing the switch while having dinner.\u201d But today he tells me he can\u2019t stand politics and hasn\u2019t voted since 1972\u2019s US presidential election, when he cast his ballot for the Democrat, George McGovern. \u201cI guess I think the system is pretty corrupt.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdpYpulGCKc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bdpYpulGCKc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The spoof is out there ... watch the trailer for Space Force.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Yet his latest project is a political satire. Created by the celebrated TV comedy writer Greg Daniels and Steve Carell, Space Force stars Malkovich as a slow-talking scientist alongside Carell\u2019s manic General Mark R Naird. It is uneven, but entertaining \u2013 part Dr Strangelove, part Veep, part soppy soap. Donald Trump has said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/may/16/spacewatch-nasa-wants-one-point-six-billion-dollars-next-year-to-get-astronauts-to-moon-by-2024\">he </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/may/16/spacewatch-nasa-wants-one-point-six-billion-dollars-next-year-to-get-astronauts-to-moon-by-2024\">wants to get astronauts back on the moon by 2024</a>, but Malkovich says the concept predates the president\u2019s ambition. Does he think it is a good idea to revisit the moon? \u201cI don\u2019t know. It might be a better idea than creating more lethal versions of viruses in labs,\u201d he says, gnomically. \u201cBut it may not be the best idea we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d </p> <p>I ask why he is working so hard these days \u2013 for the love or the money? Both, he says. \u201cI always love working.\u201d Again, he says, he has been lucky.</p> <p>But you have not always been lucky, I say \u2013 I was staggered to read that three of his four siblings (all of whom became journalists) died in their 50s. It must have been devastating, I say. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what can you do about it? Amanda, then Mother, then Danny, then Rebecca \u2013 and that was all over a five-year period from 2009.\u201d Did it prompt an existential crisis? \u201cNo. I try not to worry about things I can\u2019t control. Unless, say, you had a terrible mother, I don\u2019t think anybody enjoys their family or siblings dying. I liked all mine. But what can you do? It\u2019s the final act in life.\u201d</p> <p>It is unusual to find someone so accepting. Does he have a religion, a guiding philosophy? \u201cNot really,\u201d he says. He tells me a story \u2013 about shooting a film in a small town in Canada and being asked to talk to a little boy with leukaemia, whose hair had fallen out. \u201cThey wanted me to talk to him because people somehow think people in the movies have some power to do good. He was self-conscious about his hair, and I said: \u2018We\u2019ve got the same haircut,\u2019 and he said: \u2018Yes, but not for the same reason.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAnd that is how I look at life; I was very lucky. I\u2019ve been luckier than anybody I know. Luckier than all of the children in my family, all of whom were more interesting or more talented or smarter than me. So when things have happened that have been sad and difficult, I don\u2019t feel the need to complain about them.\u201d</p> <p>So, in a way, that is a philosophy, I say \u2013 and a surprisingly positive one for someone who sounds so relentlessly downbeat. \u201cYeah!\u201d he says, with an audible surge of enthusiasm. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a negative influence. I think I\u2019m quite a positive person, all in all.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81021929\">Space Force</a> is available to stream on Netflix from 29 May</em></p>",

Told from the point of view of the wife, Charlie (played by Rake\u2019s Adrienne Pickering), it presents a smattering of TikTok-length moments with heart, earnestness and Australian humour (a vagina is at one point called a \u201cclacker\u201d). Bates and the producer, Dan Prichard, originally bonded over their shared experiences of fertility treatments and alternative routes to parenthood, lending a bracing freshness to the show. As Charlie navigates doctors, clinics and hormone injections, her body is presented with a frankness rarely seen.</p> <p>After all, \u201ctrying\u201d tends to looks the same on TV: an attractive couple embark on a schedule of kookily regulated sex in which everyone treats it like a boring chore but still wears nice undies. Ovulation cycles are tracked, temperatures are taken, men are woken up in the middle of the night and instructed to \u201cget on top\u201d. Afterwards, women lie with their legs in the air and their fingers crossed.</p> <p>All Our Eggs hits a lot of these beats too; viewed on its own, the show is a sweet, earnest, sometimes uneven account of one couple\u2019s experiences. But its cross-platform release format lends an added dimension \u2013 especially when you start reading the comments.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@alloureggs/video/6803952014125583621\">first TikTok snippet</a><em> </em>attracted more than 2m views. On Instagram it has a modest following but engagement is enthusiastic and effusive. Over and over viewers find themselves in the episodes. \u201cI felt every single bit of that,\u201d writes one. \u201cI feel like you are telling my story word for word,\u201d comments another.</p> <p>Most commenters have been through similar treatments and are quick to share their frustrations. One thread saw viewers swapping advice they\u2019d received. \u201cA well meaning friend (as they always are ) recommended I try essential oils after three years of IVF \u2026 hmmm probs a little past essential oils at this point but thanks,\u201d remembers one woman. Several admit to sobbing through viewings, and the creators are thanked for portraying a part of life often kept hidden. \u201cInfertility can steal so many things from you,\u201d as one woman puts it. In this context of community, the show takes on a different energy, with higher, more urgent stakes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"244d5703c873b7630b0ec68436b4d57039c4ba5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/244d5703c873b7630b0ec68436b4d57039c4ba5a/0_0_1600_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adrienne Pickering as Charlie in All Our Eggs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There are plans to spin some comments into character dialogue, promoting viewers from consumers to collaborators.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: On The Deck Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All Our Eggs didn\u2019t start out as a cross-platform experiment. It was first envisioned as a short film or a feature, at one point a web show, but across almost a decade it became ensnared in a familiar tangle of grants, development deals and financial cuts \u2013 landing on a final form that enriches the story with a realism and intimacy it may not have achieved otherwise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/13/melissa-leong-masterchef-judge-2020-diversity-tabloids\">Melissa Leong on MasterChef, diversity and tabloids: \u2018I will never, ever let this stuff shake me\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was always intended to be participative,\u201d Prichard says\u2013 but they had envisaged inviting the public to contribute personal fertility experiences to a website, which the creators would then draw on. Forced to change formats, the social media platforms came with a built-in opportunity for fans to immediately engage with the episodes \u2013 and an opportunity for creators to respond. Each clip invites reactions and feedback, \u201cso each episode becomes a point of discussion amongst the community\u201d, Prichard says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a finished product any more.\u201d</p> <p>That feeling of being unfinished, of still taking shape, is ultimately one of All Our Eggs<em>\u2019 </em>strongest features. Prichard predicts that the show\u2019s fans will become even more embedded in the production, as the writers begin to fold feedback and personal accounts into the show. There are plans to spin some comments into character dialogue too, promoting the viewer from consumer to direct collaborator.

  "<p>The Morrison government is facing pushback from leading academics and from a major Muslim advocacy group about new powers allowing the domestic spy agency to question people as young as 14.</p> <p>The dean of law at the University of New South Wales, George Williams, said the government\u2019s proposed new law was a case of \u201coverreach\u201d and agency powers kept being increased \u201cin what typically is a one-way street without any sense of what the endgame is\u201d.</p> <p>He said aspects of the bill were \u201ctroubling\u201d and were the latest chapter in the continual ratcheting-up of national security laws.</p> <p>A group advocating for Australian Muslims has also voiced alarm over the bill \u2013 which would allow the attorney general to issue certain warrants orally in emergency situations \u2013 while calling on the government to explain why it has yet to list any white nationalist groups on the list of terror organisations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/14/australians-personal-freedoms-could-be-under-serious-threat-with-the-new-asio-bill\">Australians\u2019 personal freedoms could be under serious threat with the new Asio bill | Pauline Wright</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/13/asio-could-question-children-and-more-easily-use-more-tracking-devices-under-new-powers\">introduced a bill to parliament last week that would overhaul</a> the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation\u2019s existing rules for compulsory questioning \u2013 measures that were originally brought in after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States.</p> <p>The bill would broaden the types of Asio cases that could trigger questioning to include espionage, politically motivated violence and acts of foreign interference \u2013 rather than just those regarding terrorism.</p> <p>The agency would also be allowed to seek to question minors aged 14 to 18 \u2013 down from the current age minimum of 16 \u2013 but the government argues this would be subject to safeguards, including that a lawyer is present as well as a parent, guardian or other appropriate person.</p> <p>Williams welcomed part of the bill \u2013 the abolition of a certain type of warrant that allowed people to be detained for long periods for Asio questioning \u2013 but said that \u201cextreme\u201d power had never been used.</p> <p>\u201cI think it would have been better to remove that without then embarking on what I think is a further overreach by extending other powers in this area,\u201d he told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re really now at the sharp end of the most concerning powers, you know, when you get to intelligence agencies operating in secret, being able to exercise coercive powers with respect to Australian citizens who aren\u2019t even suspected of terrorism.\u201d</p> <p>Williams said the rest of the bill removed safeguards, made it easier to exercise powers, and extended the reach of the agency.</p> <p>\u201cThis has been the pattern since 2001: a steady increase and ratcheting up of these powers in what typically is a one-way street without any sense of what the endgame is,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is the line we don\u2019t cross? It\u2019s just this gradual encroachment, sometimes faster, sometimes slower.</p> <p>\u201cIt begs a larger conversation about what sort of security powers do we think are appropriate, what are the limits, what is the community happy to put up with? But instead, we\u2019ve just got this ad-hoc legislation which on its own merits is troubling.\u201d</p> <p>The Australian Muslim Advocacy Network \u2013 which was set up after the massacre against Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand \u2013 argued the ongoing increase in national security powers was \u201cgetting more and more alarming\u201d.</p> <p>Rita Jabri-Markwell, a lawyer and adviser to the network, said Australian Muslims had already disproportionately suffered as a result of a raft of laws that had been introduced over the past two decades.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s had huge impacts on our community and our trust in the justice system and police. Now they\u2019re talking about reducing oversight \u2026 it\u2019s very scary for us but it should alarm all Australians.\u201d</p> <p>While Asio powers were already very extensive, Jabri-Markwell argued, the government had not yet given any indication \u201cthat it\u2019s at all interested in protecting Australian Muslims from the threat of white nationalist terrorism\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe have white nationalist terrorist groups listed in the UK, Germany and Canada, and the US has just listed its first one under the Trump administration, and Australia hasn\u2019t got a single one on its proscribed terror list,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cHow is this blind spot happening in Australia?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/13/asio-could-question-children-and-more-easily-use-more-tracking-devices-under-new-powers\">Asio could question children and more easily use more tracking devices under new powers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The head of Asio has previously revealed that \u201cthe extreme rightwing threat is real and it is growing\u201d in Australia and is on the agency\u2019s radar.</p> <p>Mike Burgess, the director general of security, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/24/rightwing-extremism-a-real-and-growing-threat-asio-chief-says-in-annual-assessment\">said in a speech in February</a> that \u201cviolent Islamic extremism\u201d remained the agency\u2019s principal concern \u2013 but it was also focused on small extreme rightwing cells who met regularly in suburbs around Australia to salute Nazi flags, inspect weapons, train in combat and share their hateful ideology.</p> <p>The following day, the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/25/dutton-says-leftwing-lunatics-must-be-dealt-with-as-asio-warns-of-far-right-threat\">ensure agencies were dealing with threats from both</a> \u201crightwing lunatics or leftwing lunatics\u201d \u2013 the latter of which was not specifically mentioned in the speech.</p> <p>In March, at a parliamentary committee hearing, Burgess was asked why Australia had not followed other western countries in listing extreme rightwing groups as terrorist organisations.</p> <p>He said Australia constantly reviewed the situation, but listings depended on \u201cthe intelligence that we have, the legal threshold for which we can do so, and the purpose that that would allow us to achieve by listing such organisations\u201d.</p> <p>The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security said this week it had launched a review into the effectiveness of the proposed new Asio bill. Dutton has asked the bipartisan committee to hold public hearings and produce a report by July, which will pave the way for parliamentary debate.</p> <p>Comment was sought from Dutton\u2019s office on Wednesday regarding the criticism of the bill.</p> <p>But in a speech to parliament last week, the minister said the government was moving to ensure Australia\u2019s national security agencies had the powers they need to work in an increasingly complex national security environment. He said Asio was \u201cfacing a wider range of security challenges than at any time in its 70-year history\u201d.</p>"
